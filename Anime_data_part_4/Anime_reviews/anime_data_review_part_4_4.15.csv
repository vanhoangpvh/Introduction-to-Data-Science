Cobra The Animation: The Psycho-Gun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4646/Cobra_The_Animation__The_Psycho-Gun,"[""For Cobra Fans - It's Cobra, you'll love it.For non-fans, Cobra is pure retro-pulp-space opera, or more simply, Lupin III in space. If that sounds appealing, you'll likely love it. If you don't know what that means, you probably won't understand why the women don't wear pants...The story is quite epic, gorgeous animation, and while the music is as classic as it was in the movie or even the tv series, its still good.As far as character development, its there, there is a bit of growth, but franchises like this are about appreciating and reinforcing the status quo, which is where the majority of...the entertainment lies.No matter what anyone says, this is Cobra, and that mean awesome. the entertainment lies.No matter what anyone says, this is Cobra, and that mean awesome."", ""The Psycho Gun OVA is the start of the more recent Space Cobra material beginning from 2008-2010 being followed by the OVA titled as Time Drive and the 13 episode anime series, Cobra The Animation. It has been over 2 decades since the last appearance of a Space Cobra anime and Psycho Gun delivers a great start to the return of Cobra.To sum up the story, Cobra aids a woman named Utopia More who works as a professor. During her research, Utopia discovers the whereabouts of a weapon capable of creating galaxies. The Pirate Guild gets wind of her discovery and decide to use this...weapon for their own use of interstellar conquest.I should mention that I'm uncertain whether this OVA follows any particular story line of the Cobra manga but it shouldn't be a bother to a fan of the series. The first scene opens with Cobra utilizing his signature Psycho Gun against 3 guild members and you can immediately tell of its cinematic style of storytelling. The first episode makes sure to deliver great emphasis on Cobra's character; a man who seeks adventure and is chivalrous towards women but isn't afraid to get his hands dirty when placed in self-defense. I feel the OVA also served as a debut for new viewers of the series as the first episode reestablishes most of Cobra's highlights such as his amazing cigar, that his beams can bend in any direction, his smooth personality and displaying the universe of space cobra which included aliens, cyborgs and the sex appeal of seeing semi-nude women. (There are a LOT of booty shots in this particular story).Psycho Gun offers a touch to appeal to older fans but also welcomes a new audience to the franchise. One such example as catering to the old fan base are the actors as Cobra and Lady are still voiced by the original actors from the 1982 anime series being Nozawa Nachi and Sakakibara Yoshiko. While Crystal Boy/Crystal Bowie is also included in this OVA he is sadly not voiced by his original actor Kobayashi Kiyoshi who is most notably known for playing Jigen from Lupin the 3rd. Speaking of actors, is also interesting to know that the first actor for Cobra from the 1982 Movie actually performs the ending songs for each of the new Cobra material.Much of the story works well to display multiple side to Cobra's character such as behavior as a ladies man or other times goofy when feeling comedic but still remains entertaining as he was in the 80's. The appeal of Cobra for new fans is his more James Bond approach in this OVA. Such examples are his charisma and the resourcefulness of using various tools which include his trademark cigar. Like the previous story arcs we seen before, this one focuses solely on Utopia and how she begins to fall for Cobra while attempting to free herself from anguish.Much of the animation looks good especially in scenes featuring plant life and scenery during the night time such as episodes 2 and 3. Much of it is due to shading which makes certain scenes have subtle but stunning visuals. While it doesn't have the iconic angles from the anime director Osamu Dezaki, The Psycho Gun still looks remarkable. However, a con for this series is the usage of CGI which doesn't blend too well, especially with Crystal Boy. (The following series Time Drive & The Animation also feature heavy CGI usage). As for the soundtrack, there isn't much to say other than it feels very subtle in comparison to the jazzy upbeat tone of the 1982 anime. However, if you listen carefully you may hear certain tracks that sound similar to Star Wars music.After giving this OVA a second viewing, I found myself appreciative of its story as gives this feeling of an epic return to an older series that could still be adapted in today's standards. Complaints are few which include the lack of a more villains but still offers plenty of creativity and new alien/technology lore that keeps the series fresh. My main disappointment is the final battle with Cobra & Crystal Boy as it came off anti-climatic while both the anime & movie made their battles much more exciting. There is also a lack of Lady in this feature and Cobra doesn't carry his Colt Python.Lastly, I'm uncertain whether this OVA is original material as it seems to reference events of both the anime and the movie version of Space Adventure Cobra most notably on the three sisters who were killed by Crystal Boy.

This can be especially troublesome if you have the genital fortitude to cross Cobra.Cobra is the captain of a spaceship. He works as a thief-for-hire and is on the “Most Wanted” list. The character of Cobra is difficult to describe. It’s like if you mix Han Solo’s ability to charm women, James Bond’s gadgets and ingenuity, and a dash of Lupin III’s thieving skills. Stir it all together and replace one of his arms with a laser gun and you’ll...have a pretty good replica.The plot isn’t anything new, but that’s to be expected when the source material is well over 20 year’s old. Cobra is on a mission to steal a jewel from a museum on Earth. As one would expect, the alarms go off when he grabs the jewel. Surprisingly enough, it has nothing to do with the heist. It’s actually because the museum is being invaded by the Pirate Guild.Professor Utopia, a damsel working on an important study for the government, suddenly gets attacked by Gipsy Doc of the Pirate Guild. Being the chivalrous gentleman that he is, Cobra comes to the rescue. They end up escaping in a helicopter with the help of the Psycho-Gun,  which is the name of the gun attached to Cobra’s arm. This is when you learn about the true power behind Cobra and his weird weapon. Since it has the ability to split its energy beam, it allows him to kill multiple enemies in one shot.After escaping the museum, they realize that the Pirate Guild has learned the secret about Professor Utopia’s research. Let’s just say that fossils are a lot cooler than you originally thought.There are a few negative things to say about this show. The animation quality is a bit below what you would expect from an OAV made with today’s technology. Also, there has been no news of an American release. This is unfortunate because Cobra is truly an experience to be had, but companies are too busy release crap like Strike Witches to give it the recognition it deserves. have a pretty good replica.The plot isn’t anything new, but that’s to be expected when the source material is well over 20 year’s old.

Dragon Half,https://myanimelist.net/anime/870/Dragon_Half,"[""The early and mid 90's were probably the golden age of mindless comedy in anime as far as my viewing goes. A lot of it was just as hit and miss as any other period of time, but the field was vast, filled with various styles of comedic offerings, like Compiler and Junk Boy. Dragon Half is one of these, an OVA parody of RPGs and fantasy adventures, and is the best of the sub-genre I've seen to this day, without a close second.The plot is incredibly simple, but it's all the motivation a comedy needs. Something as easy as a half dragon...who wants to win the affections of a super pop star who slays her kind in his off time by becoming human is just absurd enough to rank very high on a comedy scale. Getting into a comedic show for a plot is asking for trouble, and you might rob yourself of fun. So, it's about as easy as The Little Mermaid-er, Dragon, as Mink and her friends make a complete mockery of the adventure genre. It deserves it after giving me Those Who Hunt Elves.Character designs are really cute and vibrant, with virtually every cast member shifting between vaguely serious mode to wacky chibi in a matter of frames. The show spends most of the time in super-deformed mode. It's hammered down your throat, but this was back when chibi characters using physical comedy was still pretty damn funny and fresh to me before becoming a fairly predictable and stale novelty that it is today. The animation is mildly dated, but still looks pretty great with Production I.G, as the visual gags and dialouge are perfectly timed, making the best out of SD characters and a silly script. I loved them all, from Mink's completely perverted father, to Vina and her father, including his assistant. As well as Damaramu, who was Kamina from Gurren Lagaan for his time, only 5000 times funnier and more enjoyable to me.The English dub is one of my favorites, including some of ADVs best best talents from the mid 90's like Marcy Rae as Mink's mother, the fantastic Brett Weaver doing what he does best; voicing a loud-mouth buffoon as Damaramu, and Jessica Calvello (A woman who needs more work) as Mink. Probably the only English dubbed animes I've found this funny were GTO and Azumanga Daioh. The ending theme is very, very catchy as well, I believe it's singing about breakfast. God, I dig it so much.IN CLOSING: This is a rare treasure. It's from a different era of satire, so it may not be everyone's cup of tea for younger veiwers. Probably the biggest drawback against it being a satisfying experience is that the manga continues the story, so you might feel a little gipped when the OVA just abruptly ends. Even above and beyond that, it's almost comedy perfection that does little wrong and is probably only hurt by the passage of time and the fan's palette for what defines a farce. It's earned a permanent, golden plaque on my shelf as one of the funniest things I've ever seen come out of Japan.P.S.  Sorry for sounding like an old man again in my reviews.STORY: 6ART: 9SOUND: 8CHARACTERS: 10ENJOYMENT: 10OVERALL SCORE: 9 out of 10PROS: Fantastic retro satire, Dungeon & Dragons-inspired parody, a pioneer of the chibi-SD humor, great ADV English dub,CONS: Lack of continuation might dampen experience, out of date style of comedy might not sit well with younger audiences who wants to win the affections of a super pop star who slays her kind in his off time by becoming human is just absurd enough to rank very high on a comedy scale.

That includes the English dub and Extras. Enjoy ;)""Dragon Half"" is a little OVA, that does a lot more then I ever thought it could. It\'s not the deepest most profound anime, and it\'s not the most exciting thing to watch either. But it\'s got some wild and crazy characters, and it\'s laugh out loud funny. Sure it\'s a little stupid, and a bit shallow. But it\'s a cute show, and hey I LOVE the dub.Plot/Story - 7This little OVA series takes place in your standard ""sword and sorcery"" fantasy realm,...and although it\'s not original, it gives the series a bit of an edge. It\'s a great setting for a comedy in my opinion. Also it does have a bit of a twist, like for example some non-coventional stuff will apear from time to time. Anyway this anime is about Mink and her friends trying to get tickets to this concert. Yes they have concerts ther ein this fantaysy world, and the guy Mink wants to see is some famouse idol, who sings all around the land, and fihghts bad guys, and does everything else. He\'s quite the hot shot, and ""big thing"" going at this time. Mink\'s a huge fan. The King of this land has it out for her, however, and wants nothing more then for Mink to be dead! He wants to marry her mother, and will do whatever it takes. For some reason he thinks if he does away with Mink, it will make this much easier on him. Her mother is a dragon by the way, and she\'s still married to her father, a knight who slays dragons. Yeah a match made in heaven...or hell :P. Anyway the King and his men try to capture/kill Mink, Mink doesn\'t seem to notice much and wants to go to the convert, her friends join her, hijinks ensue. It\'s a very simple story, but one that works. Later Mink ends up in this huge tournament/fight against some of her enemies, and that\'s where you will really start laughing your but off! The story is interesting, and never boring, thats for sure.  Crazy things keep happening, at yet the story still moves along. And the ending is also quite fun. The show is very light hearted, goofy, and stupid at times, yet never too dumb. It may not be a smart show, but the way it does everything makes you feel dumber then the show is. This is a plus in my book. Also when everything is over, you get to see Mink with her top off. Not sure if this is good or bad, but you do. As Matt Greenfield so blunty puts it (in his commentary track) ""And there\'s the fanservice. The reword for watching it to the end ;) "". Boobies and humor. Yes this show has it all folks.Usually when/if I review a comedy I\'ll try and describe the type of humor (slapstick, dialogue based, character based, parody, satire, puns, nonsensical, etc), but trying to pin down the type of humor in ""Dragon Half"", is like trying to pin  down a tiger. It won\'t be easy, it\'s crazy, and you will probally fail trying. So I\'ll just say that ""Dragon Half""  is incredbly fast paced, and very very funny. To try and get you to understand what type of humor this is  perhaps this will help. Greg Ayres once called it ""Excel Saga...before we had Excel Saga"". So yeah...think about that one. I think that works quite nicely.  This show outright paradies many different fantasy tropes in anime. It makes fun of a lot of things, and it also makes fun of its self. It doesn\'t ""reference"" any shows in perticular (that I noticed), but it makes fun of common fantasy themes. It\'s also completly random, and makes no sense. Yeah there\'s a story, and it ends. But nothing you will watch will make any sense at all. This show is incredbly surreal. Laugh as things that make no sense happen in weird ways! I know I did! Much of the humor is slapstick, but not in an anoying way. There is some great wordplay once in awhile (and I must compliment ADV Films for the great script), and off the wall stuff happening constantly, and the dub really makes everything 10 times funnyer. You can tell ADV had fun dubbing this one. Anyway yeah the type of humor in this changes with the mood, although it tends to stay clearly on the ""stupid"" side of the humor equation. So yeah no real witty remarks, or intelligent satire. Just plain, dumb, (but FUNNY) jokes. And it\'s not even high brow stuff. It\'s not offensive, but this isn\'t ""Jokes with Einstein"" either. Oh and although all the characters are stupid, even they laugh at Damaramu for being an idiot. He\'s one of the ""bad guys"" out to get Mink for the King. And you should too, because he\'s pretty stupid, yet funny. He keeps saying his own name when he talks, not because it makes him sound tough. But because if he didn\'t he\'d forget his own name. Yeah dumb as a herde of snails, running right into a pile of salt.Art/Animation - 6This is an OVA, and so I judged it as one. Despite being an OVA, it seemed to have gotten a rather poor budget. It has aged quite a bit by today\'s standards. Comedy seems to never get the big budgets, but boy did they save on this one. It\'s not bad or anything, but the animation is rather average. It does it\'s job, with all the crazy and random things happening, but it is nothing to write home about either. The art is nice looking, although rather plane and undetailed, even for 93. It has some cute character designs that I really liked. And the color palette is very nice, incredbly bright, full of like, and cheery. A little TOO colorful at times, but I liked it. The backgrounds are rather average and plane looking.Also I must bring up the fact that the characters are constantly changing from super deformed (aka Chibi form) to regular anime form throughout the show. They do a good job at this, although they didn\'t blow me away either. It was a great choice however, and I admire the effert. It works with the crazy pace of the show, and the just so bizarre and outlandish nature of it all.Sound (Music & Dub) -  9MusicThe background themes, when played are quite good. Light hearted, poppy, and very cute. But where this series shines is in it\'s AMAZING ending theme. ""Watashi no Tamagoyaki"" is a crazy pop song verson/remix of a famouse Beethoven song. Yeah they don\'t mess around here. On top of that you have the meaningless, nonsenical lyrics such as "" Pappara funi-Funi Papparu hoe-hoe"" song with such effert, feeling, and enthusiasm that you can\'t help but love it. It\'s so in your face, it\'s so cute, it\'s so fluffy, yet it all sounds very nice. This si the type of song you will get stuck in your head, and never be able to sleep. Yet you won\'t care because the song is so catchy.DubDragon Half was dubbed in  2002 by ADV Films, in their Houston studio (Amusement Park Media, although its been known as a lot of things over the years. They keep changing the damn name I have no idea what they called this studio back in 2002. Anyway I rank it as one of, if not THE top ADR studio in North America). This is an anime ADV released sub-only YEARS before hand, and was known in some circles as ""un-dubble"" just because of how fast paced it was, and how much is going on. According to the commentary track, this was dubbed around Christmas, so they could have the largest talent pool possible (many actors who moved away come back for the Holidays). Also they seemed to have wanted Jessica Calvello to play the lead, and by this time she had already moved to New York City. Greenfeild (the ADR Director) said they could have dubbed this whenever, but he waited until it could have a great dub, as best as they could do. And I must say I am truly glad they waited to dub this. As this is one of the funniest dubs out there. First the casting of Jessica Calvello as Mink...dead on! I love her in this role. She\'s perfect in every way. Not that Mink is a very difficult charcter to ""get"", but I really can\'t picture anyone else playing her. Also Amanda Winn Lee as Vina, the main bad girl and the King\'s Daughter, was another brilliant casting. She is truly funny in this. Like I fell off my stea with some of the stuff she says. Hilary Haag as Pia, one of Mink\'s friend, was another great choice. She fits these ""little, tiny and silly"" characters quite well.As far as the performances go, Not sure what I can say really. This isn\'t a Shakespeare play, it\'s a lowbrow comedy, off the wall anime, with lots and lots of crazy dialogue. But as far as comedies go, I dare you to find a better acted one out there. This show\'s dub is just great, truly top grade! I just love how insane everyone is. The main cast, the small roles, the one line guys, everyone does a great, no wonderful job. And as I already said, Jessica Calvello is amazing in this. You can tell she had a lot of fun with it. No one out there could do what she did with this one here. Also shout out to Tiffany Grant, who plays a small, but important character from the second episode. She gives Dug Fin, this small magical critter, such a cute, yet mean spirited voice, that you just gata love it. Everything she says will have you rollying on the floor laughing. Aaron Krohn as the idol Mink wants to see, Dick Saucer, is so OVER THE TOP, you will smile. You will just totally get this guy, every bit of him. He did a great job as Kaji in Eva, and you can tell this was no fluke. He\'s a real fit for these types of characters in my opinion. In fact you can tell a lot of thought went into the casting of this show. And Greenfield\'s mark is all over this one. I expect the best from him, and I got nothing less then that. One of the best ADR directors in the biz.Enjoyment - 9This is very subjective, as if this humor style doesn\'t work with you, you probally won\'t like this show very much. But I can\'t help but to love it. I laughed, I laughed,I kept laughing, I laughed some more. It\'s really a fun, enjoyable, and cute little OVA. I\'m glad it didn\'t overstay it\'s welcome, as two episodes is more then enough. Anymore and the jokes would get stale, it wouldn\'t be able to keep up with it\'s fast paced nature, and the characters could get anoying. But as this is it\'s perfect. In fact all of the characters are likeable and cool, even the truly stupid ones. That takes some good writing, because sadly many times the truly DUMB characters get anoying fast. Not so here. Now the show is kind of hallow, shallow, and devoid of anything more then joke after joke really. But I feel the crazy characters get me though that. They\'re not really deep, or very well developed, but their likeable, and you enjoy watching them.Extras:Commentaries can sometimes be the most boring thing ever, or the best extra feature on the DVD. Luckily for us, the latter is true for this one. Matt Greenfeild the ADR director, and one of the head honchos at then-ADV Films (now Section 23) is main voice you will be hearing. And he actually talks in debth about the this very shallow show, and explaisn the dubbing process. His wife, and voice actor Tiffany Grant  (who has an important role in this) joins him. And he tried to talk matter-of-factly about the show, but he really can\'t because it\'s so funny. Ok maybe because I\'m a nerd, and fan of Greenfeild, or perhaps because this commentary track is truly funny, either way I found I really enjoyed this.One of the better commentaries out there by far. Not only is it interesting and informative, but it\'s also very funny. It\'s like if your up for more laughs after watching the show, put this on to kill another hour. Now it\'s not as good as his commentary on ""Puni Puni Poemy"" but it\'s still very good. (In the commentary for ""Puni Puni Poemy"" he tries to talk about the show, but CAN\'T because the entire cast is there with him, and everyone is constantly saying something laugh out loud funny. This constant struggle between Greenfeild trying to talk in debth about another very shallow show, and everyone just goofing on the show is really an undrescrible listen. It\'s one of my favorites! Very enjoyable. In fact funny/more interesting then the show its self, at least for that OVA). So in short, give the commentary a listen if your a dub fan. It\'s one of the better ones out there.Final Vertic:This is a very shallow, and stupid show. But it\'s also very very funny. It\'s humor is hard to pin down, and you never know what it\'s ganna do next. The fantasy setting is a plus, and the characters while, 2 dimensional, are very likeable (even the bad guys and stupid dudes). The dub is one of the best for a comedy, and you will be on the floor with this one. The show may be a little too crazy and fast paced for some, but it\'s weird nature is something I couldn\'t help but love. Also Beethoven ending theme for the win! And boobies. First they try and hide them, but then they show all. I\'m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but it\'s boobies.Yeah...watch this crazy show. It\'s well worth the price of the DVD. and although it\'s not original, it gives the series a bit of an edge. It\'s a great setting for a comedy in my opinion. Also it does have a bit of a twist, like for example some non-coventional stuff will apear from time to time. Anyway this anime is about Mink and her friends trying to get tickets to this concert.

This is a plus in my book. Also when everything is over, you get to see Mink with her top off. Not sure if this is good or bad, but you do. As Matt Greenfield so blunty puts it (in his commentary track) ""And there\'s the fanservice. The reword for watching it to the end ;) "". Boobies and humor. Yes this show has it all folks.Usually when/if I review a comedy I\'ll try and describe the type of humor (slapstick, dialogue based, character based, parody, satire, puns, nonsensical, etc), but trying to pin down the type of humor in ""Dragon Half"", is like trying to pin  down a tiger. It won\'t be easy, it\'s crazy, and you will probally fail trying. So I\'ll just say that ""Dragon Half""  is incredbly fast paced, and very very funny. To try and get you to understand what type of humor this is  perhaps this will help. Greg Ayres once called it ""Excel Saga...before we had Excel Saga"". So yeah...think about that one. I think that works quite nicely.  This show outright paradies many different fantasy tropes in anime. It makes fun of a lot of things, and it also makes fun of its self. It doesn\'t ""reference"" any shows in perticular (that I noticed), but it makes fun of common fantasy themes. It\'s also completly random, and makes no sense. Yeah there\'s a story, and it ends. But nothing you will watch will make any sense at all. This show is incredbly surreal. Laugh as things that make no sense happen in weird ways! I know I did! Much of the humor is slapstick, but not in an anoying way. There is some great wordplay once in awhile (and I must compliment ADV Films for the great script), and off the wall stuff happening constantly, and the dub really makes everything 10 times funnyer. You can tell ADV had fun dubbing this one. Anyway yeah the type of humor in this changes with the mood, although it tends to stay clearly on the ""stupid"" side of the humor equation. So yeah no real witty remarks, or intelligent satire. Just plain, dumb, (but FUNNY) jokes. And it\'s not even high brow stuff. It\'s not offensive, but this isn\'t ""Jokes with Einstein"" either. Oh and although all the characters are stupid, even they laugh at Damaramu for being an idiot. He\'s one of the ""bad guys"" out to get Mink for the King. And you should too, because he\'s pretty stupid, yet funny. He keeps saying his own name when he talks, not because it makes him sound tough. But because if he didn\'t he\'d forget his own name. Yeah dumb as a herde of snails, running right into a pile of salt.Art/Animation - 6This is an OVA, and so I judged it as one. Despite being an OVA, it seemed to have gotten a rather poor budget. It has aged quite a bit by today\'s standards. Comedy seems to never get the big budgets, but boy did they save on this one. It\'s not bad or anything, but the animation is rather average. It does it\'s job, with all the crazy and random things happening, but it is nothing to write home about either. The art is nice looking, although rather plane and undetailed, even for 93. It has some cute character designs that I really liked. And the color palette is very nice, incredbly bright, full of like, and cheery. A little TOO colorful at times, but I liked it. The backgrounds are rather average and plane looking.Also I must bring up the fact that the characters are constantly changing from super deformed (aka Chibi form) to regular anime form throughout the show. They do a good job at this, although they didn\'t blow me away either. It was a great choice however, and I admire the effert. It works with the crazy pace of the show, and the just so bizarre and outlandish nature of it all.Sound (Music & Dub) -  9MusicThe background themes, when played are quite good. Light hearted, poppy, and very cute. But where this series shines is in it\'s AMAZING ending theme. ""Watashi no Tamagoyaki"" is a crazy pop song verson/remix of a famouse Beethoven song. Yeah they don\'t mess around here. On top of that you have the meaningless, nonsenical lyrics such as "" Pappara funi-Funi Papparu hoe-hoe"" song with such effert, feeling, and enthusiasm that you can\'t help but love it. It\'s so in your face, it\'s so cute, it\'s so fluffy, yet it all sounds very nice. This si the type of song you will get stuck in your head, and never be able to sleep. Yet you won\'t care because the song is so catchy.DubDragon Half was dubbed in  2002 by ADV Films, in their Houston studio (Amusement Park Media, although its been known as a lot of things over the years. They keep changing the damn name I have no idea what they called this studio back in 2002. Anyway I rank it as one of, if not THE top ADR studio in North America). This is an anime ADV released sub-only YEARS before hand, and was known in some circles as ""un-dubble"" just because of how fast paced it was, and how much is going on. According to the commentary track, this was dubbed around Christmas, so they could have the largest talent pool possible (many actors who moved away come back for the Holidays). Also they seemed to have wanted Jessica Calvello to play the lead, and by this time she had already moved to New York City. Greenfeild (the ADR Director) said they could have dubbed this whenever, but he waited until it could have a great dub, as best as they could do. And I must say I am truly glad they waited to dub this. As this is one of the funniest dubs out there. First the casting of Jessica Calvello as Mink...dead on! I love her in this role. She\'s perfect in every way. Not that Mink is a very difficult charcter to ""get"", but I really can\'t picture anyone else playing her. Also Amanda Winn Lee as Vina, the main bad girl and the King\'s Daughter, was another brilliant casting. She is truly funny in this. Like I fell off my stea with some of the stuff she says. Hilary Haag as Pia, one of Mink\'s friend, was another great choice. She fits these ""little, tiny and silly"" characters quite well.As far as the performances go, Not sure what I can say really. This isn\'t a Shakespeare play, it\'s a lowbrow comedy, off the wall anime, with lots and lots of crazy dialogue. But as far as comedies go, I dare you to find a better acted one out there. This show\'s dub is just great, truly top grade! I just love how insane everyone is. The main cast, the small roles, the one line guys, everyone does a great, no wonderful job. And as I already said, Jessica Calvello is amazing in this. You can tell she had a lot of fun with it. No one out there could do what she did with this one here. Also shout out to Tiffany Grant, who plays a small, but important character from the second episode. She gives Dug Fin, this small magical critter, such a cute, yet mean spirited voice, that you just gata love it. Everything she says will have you rollying on the floor laughing. Aaron Krohn as the idol Mink wants to see, Dick Saucer, is so OVER THE TOP, you will smile. You will just totally get this guy, every bit of him. He did a great job as Kaji in Eva, and you can tell this was no fluke. He\'s a real fit for these types of characters in my opinion. In fact you can tell a lot of thought went into the casting of this show. And Greenfield\'s mark is all over this one. I expect the best from him, and I got nothing less then that. One of the best ADR directors in the biz.Enjoyment - 9This is very subjective, as if this humor style doesn\'t work with you, you probally won\'t like this show very much. But I can\'t help but to love it. I laughed, I laughed,I kept laughing, I laughed some more. It\'s really a fun, enjoyable, and cute little OVA. I\'m glad it didn\'t overstay it\'s welcome, as two episodes is more then enough. Anymore and the jokes would get stale, it wouldn\'t be able to keep up with it\'s fast paced nature, and the characters could get anoying. But as this is it\'s perfect. In fact all of the characters are likeable and cool, even the truly stupid ones. That takes some good writing, because sadly many times the truly DUMB characters get anoying fast. Not so here. Now the show is kind of hallow, shallow, and devoid of anything more then joke after joke really. But I feel the crazy characters get me though that. They\'re not really deep, or very well developed, but their likeable, and you enjoy watching them.Extras:Commentaries can sometimes be the most boring thing ever, or the best extra feature on the DVD. Luckily for us, the latter is true for this one. Matt Greenfeild the ADR director, and one of the head honchos at then-ADV Films (now Section 23) is main voice you will be hearing. And he actually talks in debth about the this very shallow show, and explaisn the dubbing process. His wife, and voice actor Tiffany Grant  (who has an important role in this) joins him. And he tried to talk matter-of-factly about the show, but he really can\'t because it\'s so funny. Ok maybe because I\'m a nerd, and fan of Greenfeild, or perhaps because this commentary track is truly funny, either way I found I really enjoyed this.One of the better commentaries out there by far. Not only is it interesting and informative, but it\'s also very funny. It\'s like if your up for more laughs after watching the show, put this on to kill another hour. Now it\'s not as good as his commentary on ""Puni Puni Poemy"" but it\'s still very good. (In the commentary for ""Puni Puni Poemy"" he tries to talk about the show, but CAN\'T because the entire cast is there with him, and everyone is constantly saying something laugh out loud funny. This constant struggle between Greenfeild trying to talk in debth about another very shallow show, and everyone just goofing on the show is really an undrescrible listen. It\'s one of my favorites! Very enjoyable. In fact funny/more interesting then the show its self, at least for that OVA). So in short, give the commentary a listen if your a dub fan. It\'s one of the better ones out there.Final Vertic:This is a very shallow, and stupid show. But it\'s also very very funny. It\'s humor is hard to pin down, and you never know what it\'s ganna do next. The fantasy setting is a plus, and the characters while, 2 dimensional, are very likeable (even the bad guys and stupid dudes). The dub is one of the best for a comedy, and you will be on the floor with this one. The show may be a little too crazy and fast paced for some, but it\'s weird nature is something I couldn\'t help but love. Also Beethoven ending theme for the win! And boobies. First they try and hide them, but then they show all. I\'m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but it\'s boobies.Yeah...watch this crazy show. It\'s well worth the price of the DVD.', ""Dragon Half is one of the older anime shows that you find yourself loving for the humour, plot(-holed like swiss cheese), character personalities but not much in the aspect of imagery.The animation was well done at the time it came out, and still better than half the things I end up finding on TV, but as of recent days it would either be considered of a \\&quot;skilled wannabe\\&quot; or \\&quot;classic\\&quot; quality depending on your tastes.

When one hears the name Dragon Half, this is normally a claim that isn\'t too far away. Even though I can\'t fully say as of yet that I agree; this short OVA does make a strong drive to the title and the funny thing is, it only took two episodes to make its mark. This is actually something to brag about since there are many titles either the same length or much longer that end up as total failures.Dragon Half is like a well disciplined soldier; it knows exactly what its objective is, and it heads straight for it with intentions...on accomplishing the mission. From go, the anime is non stop comedy and never, ever, lets up. The interesting part about the anime is that it doesn\'t have to rely on sex oriented jokes or an overabundance of fan service to get a good laugh out of the viewer. Although they are used in very low supply, it never had a forced feel to me.The laughs are provided within the dialogue, character\'s actions, and the sheer insanity on the screen. Most of these hilarious moments appear out of nowhere and they work most of the time. Those out there whom are big fans of characters shifting into the deformed disproportionate versions of themselves will love this one because it seems to revel in it.Character development is rather low, but this is the most memorable group of characters I can remember from such a short series. The solid voice acting for both languages do them justice and only helps to provide more laughs. The anime is virtually plotless, with things happening at random only to provide more comedy; but a solid plot clearly wasn\'t the aim here anyway.Another aspect of the series that I really enjoyed was the abandoning of certain anime cliches. The series isn\'t the least bit predictable which adds to the fun factor a great deal. The animation is decent at best; I really didn\'t notice anything noteworthy.  The goofy character designs are top notch for this type of wacky anime, and the soundtrack fits well by meshing perfectly with the silliness. This also applies to the ending theme, which is just as wacky and makes very little sense. The voice acting or should I say overacting, hits the mark every time. Both the sub and dub shined brightly for me and it was pretty much flawless.Dragon Half to me is a pretty good OVA, but one thing I don\'t agree with the fans on is the short length. Despite the mindless fun of the series, I think two episodes was enough. This type of insanity for me began to overstay its welcome and a couple of jokes began to grow stale: such as the super deformed bodies. When it comes down to anime comedy for me; one or two seasons can actually damage the show due to many re-used jokes, because eventually they begin to lose their appeal. The anime series Slayers, definitely comes to mind with its repetitive gags that carried through to the very end of the series, and once they reached into the movie features, nearly the entire franchise lost all of its steam and eventually Slayers became a shadow of its former self. Dragon Half could have very easily fallen victim to the same fate.I only recommend this title to the most diehard, comedy driven anime fans. If you enjoy the comedic elements I mentioned. Then this is for you. If you\'re new to anime, then I recommend avoiding this and going straight into Slayers because even though I have issues with it; the series(not the movies) still provides a great story, better characters, and a rock solid plot.Highs: Excellent voice acting, comedy that works...Lows: ... but can overstay welcome for some on accomplishing the mission.

I wish I could go back in time, rob a bank, and then buy buttloads of VHS and LD to fool the studio into producing more installments (and then hopefully figure out a way back to the future to avoid prosecution). I love this show!! I even feel that it makes the world a better place with its good-natured silliness. But animating shows isn’t cheap……And it is possible that coming hot on the heels of the classic ""Record of Lodoss War"" OVA,...but before the perennial 90’s staple ""The Slayers,"" that Dragon Half’s screwball envisioning of the anime/high fantasy world simply got lost in the mix. It is shame, as the manga was fairly long lived (Update: I have read it now!) and could have supplied at least a few more adventures.  One can find the show’s kindred spirits in stuff like ""Ultimate Teacher"" and of course ""Excel Saga,"" but ""Dragon Half"" is still a shining gem that old-school headz likely love already and younger peeps should give a chance.As you may have surmised, this joint is funny. and not always in the usual anime manner either. The creative staff were clearly fans of Merrie Melodies/Looney Toons tradition: mallets, rope-weights, X-Lax and other tricks out of the Warner Bothers playbook are thrown in with hilarious results.  And where else can you get a “sinister royal vizier” who uses dry-ice to make his dramatic entrances? If you know, please DM me RIGHT NOW.What really sells this pair of OVAs are the lovable and well designed characters that are expertly used by the screenplay and voiced to perfection. Our heroine Mink is a bucket of fun (voiced by none other than Sailor Moon herself, Kitono Mitsuishi, and Jessica Cavillo, who seems to be training for her throat-murdering work as Excel). Think Judy Jetson if she was also a half-dragon wrecking ball. Mink follows the proud tradition of anime girls who are harder than steel and not always aware of their strength. It is a trope that I like, and she could hold her own against the likes of A-Ko and the mighty Diacon-Girl if the need arose. The supporting cast are equally awesome, and feature Princess Vina, a stuck-up fire-mage with a (hilariously) tragic past, the doofus warrior Damaramu, who has a “compact brain,” and the perfectly named Dick Saucer, who is somehow both a teen idol and a chivalrous dragonslayer.  Saucer also is the object of affection for most of the female characters, and has to balance his duty as a warrior along with entertaining his legions of adoring fans. Mink and Vina, of course, are among those fans.Visually, the show is awesome, showcasing highly fluid and dynamic battle scenes alongside adorable and goofy “chibifications” of the characters when events go awry.  And these two styles are tied together seamlessly, not a simple task. At the same time, many of the backgrounds are a little simplistic, but work because they keep the focus on the characters. Even so, a prospective viewer should keep their eye out for any sight-gags not immediately obvious.  Of course, when watching anime featuring scantily clad females, one can just FEEL the loving attention paid to their bodies by the animators.  As the titular dragon-half leaps about the screen, we see that the pen and paint jockeys took care in telegraphing her gainaxing whenever possible and making sure that her bikini-bottom is visible from all sorts of compromising angles. Princess Vina and Mink’s friend Lufa get affection from the camera as well. Extra-kudos for the “generous” proportions of the female character’s lower-halves. It is cool to see a Japanese character designer who enjoys the booty and thighs. I digress.As stated before, this series is incomplete. It’s pretty upsetting how we are left hanging after the awesome “Brutal Killer Martial Arts Tournament.” Seriously, mega-bummer. We never get to find out who Azetodeth the Warlock is or if Mink can win over her beloved Dick Saucer. What isn’t upsetting is that the show has survived in the fandom over the years with several reissues.  And the long awaited release of the manga in English is terrific.

I\'m not a fan of the comedy found in anime in general, and ""Dragon Half"" represents the worst of this kind of comedy, containing just about every anime comedy cliche under the sun. Over the top? Check. Nonsensical? Yep. Super deformity? Hell yes. The whole thing is a big joke, and not a very funny one at that. Basically, there are a couple of hilarious moments, and the rest just...bored me to the point of tears. Making witless noises such as ""Piri piri fumi fumi"" (I\'m sure you\'ll forgive me if I don\'t get these incredibly profound lyrics exactly right) over a mix of Beethoven songs in an attempt to pass it off as a funny ending theme isn\'t clever. It\'s retarded. And that\'s exactly what this show is.I watched this in dub, and unusually enough, the dub actually fits the anime quite well. Having said that, even if it did suck, I can\'t imagine watching it in sub will be much of an improvement. Shows like these can\'t be saved by having good voices - they\'re far, far beyond redemption.On top of the random nonsense contained in the anime, it has no ending, just a beginning, because it was planned for more than two episodes - I\'m knocking off major points for that.

Being only two episodes the whole story does get across, even though the plot does tell you over and over what it's about. This particular anime is mainly good for laughs. "", 'Dragon Half\xa0was a two episode OVA based on a seven volume manga by Mita Ryuusuke. It was handled by Production IG. That\'s right, the studio behind Chocolate Underground, Usagi Drop & Stand Alone Complex, to name just a few. So, how does this one hold up?Story:We open with our heroine, Mink, trying to watch a pretty boy idol on the television while her parents fight. She leaves the chaos to converse with her friends about Dick Saucer & his upcoming concert. Unbeknownst to her, the king, Siva, has the hots for her dragon mother and plans to kill her father for his crime of... not...killing the red dragon he was sent to kill so he can get together with her.Okay, I know this is a comedy and the story doesn\'t matter that much, but why did the king send a knight to kill a dragon if he wanted to have carnal interactions with said dragon? Wouldn\'t it have made more sense if he\'d sent the knight to try to woo her for him or something?In any case, the king\'s wizard, Rosario, has a cunning plan, he\'s basically Baldrick. If they kidnap Mink, her father will be forced to try and come to her rescue which will get him right where they want him. This rapidly devolves into schemes to get Mink from Siva & Rosario. All the while Mink and her friends are looking for a potion to make her a normal human because Dick Beaker doesn\'t like dragons.Okay, this gets on my nerves. She\'s going to try and change who she is to appeal to this Dick Nugget? You know what? Just be who you are. If a potential romantic partner isn\'t interested because they can\'t handle what that is, they aren\'t worth your time and effort. You should be able to be a dragon if that\'s who you are. Just incinerate anyone who doesn\'t like it because you\'re a motherfucking dragon.The humour of the series is largely based on absurd, over the top stupidity. For example, the ending theme tune uses a composition by Beethoven but gives it lyrics heavily focused on food and a lot of vocalisations that aren\'t actual words but just weird sounds. There\'s also the obvious gag of the antagonists having all their traps backfire. As a whole, it\'s not bad but it\'s also not really funny. About the funniest it gets is with Damaramu\'s over the top entrances, followed by very anti-climactic exits.Characters:There\'s not much to them. Dick Sauce is a generic pretty boy. Mink\'s friends have very little in terms of personality. Mink herself is just a hyperactive comedic protagonist. Now, I\'ve talked about how comedies don\'t need great, complex characters before. They just need characters who have strong comedic interactions. Unfortunately, that\'s not really something we get here.Art:The bulk of the series uses a very simple, chibified style. Occasionally, it pulls out of it and uses a more standard action style. A lot of the time it pulls a Panty & Stocking and uses that for fan-service purposes. Because if you can\'t be all that funny, you might as well show some boobs.Sound:I will say, Mitsuishi Kotono is a really good choice for the protagonist in the type of fast-paced, absurd comedy they\'re going for. Her performance has a lot of energy and, if it were paired with stronger comedy, it would be infectious. They\'ve got some other good actresses like Sakuma Rei, Kouda Mariko & Kawata Taeko but I have to call them ""good"" based on their performances in other anime. In this one they\'re just mediocre. The music is fine. I\'d be tempted to call it better since they do use classical music, but they kind of weaken it with their attempt at giving it a comedic twist.Ho-yay:There is a scene where Mink\'s elf friend decides that she should kiss Mink for a really stupid reason, but it\'s obviously intended for a joke and they both have the hots for Dick Frisbee so, obviously, nothing happens.Final Thoughts:Dragon Half\xa0does have a few funny moments but the comedy is largely just over the top nonsense and, overall, it\'s pretty sub-par. If it sounds like it could be your type of comedy, I would still suggest trying it, especially since it is short. For myself, I can only give it a 4/10. It\'s not bad, but it is weak. killing the red dragon he was sent to kill so he can get together with her.Okay, I know this is a comedy and the story doesn\'t matter that much, but why did the king send a knight to kill a dragon if he wanted to have carnal interactions with said dragon? Wouldn\'t it have made more sense if he\'d sent the knight to try to woo her for him or something?In any case, the king\'s wizard, Rosario, has a cunning plan, he\'s basically Baldrick. If they kidnap Mink, her father will be forced to try and come to her rescue which will get him right where they want him. This rapidly devolves into schemes to get Mink from Siva & Rosario. All the while Mink and her friends are looking for a potion to make her a normal human because Dick Beaker doesn\'t like dragons.Okay, this gets on my nerves. She\'s going to try and change who she is to appeal to this Dick Nugget? You know what? Just be who you are. If a potential romantic partner isn\'t interested because they can\'t handle what that is, they aren\'t worth your time and effort. You should be able to be a dragon if that\'s who you are. Just incinerate anyone who doesn\'t like it because you\'re a motherfucking dragon.The humour of the series is largely based on absurd, over the top stupidity. For example, the ending theme tune uses a composition by Beethoven but gives it lyrics heavily focused on food and a lot of vocalisations that aren\'t actual words but just weird sounds. There\'s also the obvious gag of the antagonists having all their traps backfire. As a whole, it\'s not bad but it\'s also not really funny. About the funniest it gets is with Damaramu\'s over the top entrances, followed by very anti-climactic exits.Characters:There\'s not much to them. Dick Sauce is a generic pretty boy. Mink\'s friends have very little in terms of personality. Mink herself is just a hyperactive comedic protagonist. Now, I\'ve talked about how comedies don\'t need great, complex characters before. They just need characters who have strong comedic interactions. Unfortunately, that\'s not really something we get here.Art:The bulk of the series uses a very simple, chibified style.

It is very short, but it sets up a ton of hilarious events that resonate great with the tone of this series which is a very lighthearted comedy.  This anime also does well in parodying common tropes of medieval stories which was great.The art and sound are fine overall.  I do like the unique art style which really ressonates with the comedy of this anime.The characters of this anime are excellent at making the audience laugh for this anime.  The characters are very silly, but...their motivations are well done.  I thought this series was very enjoyable overall in which it had the funniest tornament arc of all the anime I seen so far.

I had a blast watching Dragon Half and the biggest joke of all is that nobody ever picked this show up for real. First off, why are there only 2 episodes? Ridiculousness, I say!

Half dragon girl…Dragon...slayer…And a dude named Dick Saucer. i do really believe that someone was on some very very naughty stuff when writing this but i don\'t care a bit..In fact i want to meet the whole team that made this possible and have some old school time fun with prostitutes, drugs and silly anime.Back to the story, a dragon slayer and a dragon fall in love…Now before you say AWWwwwwwww or anything like that i need to remind you that despite what this anime wants you to believe having fiery sex with dragons is not only illegal but cruel to these noble animals. Well the dragon slayer not only fucked the creature but also impregnated her which resulted to a half dragon daughter, Mink. Like most female teens everywhere in the world she tends to have a crush on pop idols..Enter our pop idol and her fated enemy Dick Saucer and my god what a beautiful lad and what a name..Strikes fear into the hearts of maidens.As the ""plot"" thickens we learn that there is another pervert in town..Namely the king of the land who wants to take his revenge against the fellow bestiality enthusiast(the father of Mink) and have the female mama dragon for himself..So basically the king tries to kill the father to become the rightful dragon fucker and Mink is trying to find the magic “People Potion” which will make her all woman cause as it seems Sir Fucksalot is the only one not into dragon pussy.At this point you might think that this sounds a lot like another kids story...I think it was called ""Pinocchio""..You know, he wanted to be a real boy so that he could join the fun the other kids had..It\'s a sad story really but what pinocchio lacked was fan service and that was the main reason it never really caught on. But Dragon Half has fanservice in spades and thank lord for that..Who came here for the story anyways?Which brings me to this..What is this anime all about then?I trully believe it was made to poke fun at all the anime being made that time period, with its\' weird characters and weird animation and even more weird music...It\'s a giant orgy of parody,hysterical laughter..Who gives a fuck about the animation? It doesn\'t need great animation! It works like a charm for this show and the characters themselves are quite well developed considering this is 1 hr long.Should you watch it? Hell yes and if you don\'t i\'ll smack you silly. slayer…And a dude named Dick Saucer. i do really believe that someone was on some very very naughty stuff when writing this but i don\'t care a bit..In fact i want to meet the whole team that made this possible and have some old school time fun with prostitutes, drugs and silly anime.Back to the story, a dragon slayer and a dragon fall in love…Now before you say AWWwwwwwww or anything like that i need to remind you that despite what this anime wants you to believe having fiery sex with dragons is not only illegal but cruel to these noble animals.

Let me get this out of the way, don’t take it seriously assholes it’s a comedy. Its humor while at times off the walls it’s incredibly fun to watch. If you’re going to watch it I recommend the English dub as opposed to the subs as the English voice acting is surprisingly good.Animation:The animation to me is a mixed bag. While most of the non-human characters look fine, the human looking ones have derpish...faces, likely intentional at that. Also many of the woman’s faces are weird elongated at times.Characters:This aspect of an anime is important as if you don’t have characters we like your anime will fall flat, Dragon Half doesn’t have this issue. I’m astonished this ova gave us characters like this. Even the main character while some may consider her annoying at times is very fun to watch. The characters in this ova can range from demon warlocks like Doug Finn or musical sensations like Dick Saucer (yes that’s his actual name) and he has his own theme song.Overall:Like I said before I had no expectations for this OVA going into this and was pleasantly surprised. If you’re looking for a funny off the walls ADV dub with likable characters then this is for you. However if your that one guy who watched attack of the killer tomatoes was stupid for all the wrong reasons then don’t watch this anime. faces, likely intentional at that.

This period wasn’t quite as sensational and over the top as the wild West of the 80s, and although much of the OVA market at this point was made up by industry veterans and they were the ones deciding to throw ideas to the wall and see what sticks, the OVA shorts affected by the economic decline still had some hidden gems not often discussed in most modern otaku internet threads. Normally, if it was an anime original, under appreciated manga, light novel, or even literary...adaptation it would be made as an OVA. One such example is Dragon Half.Dragon Half was once meant to be a four episode OVA but then, ironically taken the title literal, and halved the planning into two episodes instead. This was unfortunately another incident related to budget and interest from the higher ups. Despite the concern of adapting a couple arcs of this show into two episodes (even after the knowledge in assumed issues that come from only having four episodes originally), they made it work. These episodes are not anything extraordinary in terms of a suspended payoff you could only get from a story set in the span of 12 or 24 episodes, but they are simple fun and enough to care about the characters. Out of the OVAs I’ve watched from this decade, this one is a personal favorite of mine.Comedy is the key component of this show. Part of the enjoyment of Dragon Half stems from recognizing the RPG parodies and overall nonchalant take on being a teenage girl who is half dragon and the pressures that come from it. Mink is that girl. She is the daughter of a dragon mother and human father. She’s a fangirl over her celebrity crush Duck Saucer, a pop star who also happens to slay dragons, something Mink happens to be. To combat this she wishes to turn into a human to remove this conflict form ever taking place before she meets and marries him, hopefully. Some hijinx occur from this and it becomes more of an ill fated romance (maybe quite literally), but this isn’t a shock or deal breaker for Mink as she kind of expects it. She’s also very aloof and stubborn which certainly seemed to add a mental block between that problem.If you thought Dragon Maid was the start of cute dragon-humans trying to fit in with society, realize Dragon Half was the precursor to that. This show was no short of ecchi moments, and although comedy governs most of the writing, never did those lewder moments feel like I was being pandered to. The funnies came first here people. In fact, I’d even argue those moments were done more tastefully and at “earned” checkpoints of the show. It’s just a nice bonus to those who enjoyed what they were laughing at and hope to check out the manga after these episodes.You can find these two episodes on YouTube and will be the first to pop up too. If I were you, do what I did and knock these two episodes out of the way and log in the progress made on here. The parodies, the chibis, the RPG elements turned inside out, they’re all there! I haven’t looked into the manga yet, but if it’s anything like this then I’m sure I’d enjoy it. Kind of frustrating when you remember there was a lack of an interest during the pre-planning of Dragon Half’s production. It’s a cute comfy sort of show and although its on the short side, has good art but nothing that standouts out too far from the crop, and has a lack of progressive story that isn’t rushed, you’ll still find plenty to love about the show and not even bother with much of the downsides because you’ll be far too enamored with Mink and her friends to even worry about it all. It’s a show that’s a mix between Dragon Maid and Mahoujin Guruguru but only two episodes, and if that doesn’t sell it for you, then maybe check out those awesome shows too and come back, then you’ll know what I mean. adaptation it would be made as an OVA.

While I am glad I had the chance to watch this for the anime watching contest, it is not something that I will ever likely watch again. The actual story itself is very sound, but the execution of the overall art style and character design were not to my taste. Often the characters are chibi in design, and other than for very rare instances I do not care for this style.I feel that the creator should have picked one or two character designs for Mink and stayed with them. Also,...Mink seems to be about 15/16 years old, and her and her best friend walk around wearing nothing but glorified bathing suits/underwear. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against fan service, but I think it should be done in moderation.Definitely worth the hour to watch the 2 episodes if for no other reason than exploring early 1990's anime.

anime."", ""Warning possible SpoilersYou know you've found a gem when you see a character called Dick Saucer and that the show gives off a strangely nostalgic feeling of old cartoons from the 90's and early 2000's.The story is about Mink a half human, half dragon that is a big fan of the dragon hunter Dick Saucer and wants to get concert tickets to see him, however King Siva has a plan to stop Mink from gaining her goal so he can make Mink's mother his wife.Looking at the description I wasn't really putting a lot of faith into enjoying this yet in some ways I did,...despite being only 2 episodes this show gave off a vibe that I hadn't felt for a long time and that feeling is the funny randomness that you get from old cartoons where you see the main character outdoing the main villain in ridiculous ways and that is what I got from this since the way Mink always win's is by sheer dumb luck which surprised me and made me think this kind of show could've lasted a long time, but it didn't.Considering this is only 2 episodes it's quite difficult to describe the characters other than their there for comedy.Mink is the female MC and despite being half human, half dragon she can fly, breath fire and has incredible strength though these aren't really what she uses to win her battles, her personality is very much like a school girl is has a huge crush on a popular idol hence Dick saucer and she can be a bit clueless, but whenever she gets stopped in her tracks towards her goal she does manage to clear the rubble in front of her.Mink also has her companions to help her who are Lufa and Pia though they don't really do much other than getting in Minks way when it comes to the battles.Mink also has a rival called Vena who is actually a half human, half slime and she also has a fangirl crush on Dick Saucer so their pretty much in the same predicament making it look like a childish fight over their high school crush.King Siva who is also Vena's father is stupid and mainly relies on others to do his bidding's though despite being stupid he doesn't seem entirely like a cruel king.Dick Saucer is the crush of pretty much all of the female characters and has to put up with their attics that usually impact quite a bit like Mink accidentally giving him a laxative or accidentally becoming his enemy after he was told that Mink was an evil Red dragon, however despite being a popular guy he does seem like a nice person who put's the people above fame.The artstyle looked really weird and the same can be said for the characters too since they have extremely tiny faces and the way their heads are shaped doesn't look right too, but what also seems weird is how the female characters have surprisingly large thighs and legs making the rest of their body small in comparison and the show does mix it up with them being in Chibi form when the scenes turn into comedy.The comedy was a little funny and nostalgic as it reminded me of the old cartoons that relied on the main hero or heroine in this case going on random adventures and beating the bad guy in some ridiculous way and this is no exception as one way they defeated a villain was by him accidentally throwing his sword and somehow hitting him right through his head so yeah pretty ridiculous then again it has the parody tag so it makes sense having that.Overall this is something that you watch in an hour that will give a decent laugh, it certainly isn't memorable, but at least it wasn't completely stupid and ridiculous where it isn't funny. despite being only 2 episodes this show gave off a

Half is a fantasy parody, plain and simple. This is all about the jokes and not so much about actual adventure. Back in the early 90s fantasy was more about D&D stuff than what we get to see today and it plays with all the clichés. The two OVAs are episodic in nature and while there is somewhat of a goal (the concert), it\'s just an excuse for the plot to revolve around Mink, Dick (hihi) and the others. For a comedy, that\'s all you need, provided you are able to work with...it. Dragon Half is more slapstick oriented, which is not my favourite kind of comedy, but I don\'t mind it either. What I missed however was any kind of ending. It appears that more episodes were planned but never came to be.8/10Art:Simplicity in comedy is not at all unusual and works well most of the time. Dragon Half takes simplicity to new heights though. Even for 1993, this is very...whatever the opposite of visually amazing is. The times a character is drawn ""seriously"" can probably be counted on one hand. At times I started to wonder if Mink ever had feet to begin with or if that was just the way she\'s drawn right now. It\'s still above ugly, but you might be appalled by the quality.3/10Sound:You can tell the voice actors had a lot of fun recording their lines. They also did a really well job, since most characters have a serious and a joke voice, so it\'s basically twice the work they did. The background music is stereotypical fantasy fanfare, which contrasts nicely with the slapstick sound effects. The ending song is awful in a funny and cute way and quite the earworm.9/10Characters:They are all jokes, no exception. While they are not as clever parodies as the characters in Konosuba for example, they still work. Mink is the one closest to normal, a likeable, happy-go-lucky girl who just wants to see her beloved Dick (hihi) in concert. They\'re all funny and that\'s what counts (not that you could give them much depth in two episodes anyway).7/10Enjoyment:I had a good laugh with this, even though some jokes are a bit dated, which is to be expected in a comedy that is more than 20 years old. The artstyle looks horribly dated, which will undoubtly put off many people from giving Dragon Half a chance. But if you\'re into slapstick and you don\'t demand an artistic masterpiece, you should be able to have an amusing hour with this.7/10Overall:6.8/10 it. Dragon Half is more slapstick oriented, which is not my favourite kind of comedy, but I don\'t mind it either. What I missed however was any kind of ending.

While they are not as clever parodies as the characters in Konosuba for example, they still work. Mink is the one closest to normal, a likeable, happy-go-lucky girl who just wants to see her beloved Dick (hihi) in concert. They\'re all funny and that\'s what counts (not that you could give them much depth in two episodes anyway).7/10Enjoyment:I had a good laugh with this, even though some jokes are a bit dated, which is to be expected in a comedy that is more than 20 years old. The artstyle looks horribly dated, which will undoubtly put off many people from giving Dragon Half a chance. But if you\'re into slapstick and you don\'t demand an artistic masterpiece, you should be able to have an amusing hour with this.7/10Overall:6.8/10', 'No. Just no.One of my friends bought Dragon Half at Anime Punch and we decided to watch it on the way home, because our bus had a dvd player.I felt my ears begin to rot at their voices, especially at the main characters. The plot was....ridiculous. It was basically a small chibi half-dragon that wanted to get laid by some random Dragon Slayer/singer. HELLOOOO YOU\'RE A DRAGON. HE WON\'T WANT YOU, HE\'LL WANT TO STAB YOU! SOOO, because she\'s THAT DESPERATE to have him,  she decides ""Frick, I need to become full human or he\'ll never love me. -tears-."" God....I think the only...reason this show isn\'t forgettable is because of the squeaking and squealing like pigs they called ""voice acting.""Seriously, this attempted for comedy and it FAILED badly.

Basically a Dragon Girl is a teenager who attends pop concerts and wants to become a human again because is mocked by everyone she meets...along the way for being a Dragon Half.It seems stupid but I understand the feeling of being unwanted by society, what I did not expect was the insane stuff that happened afterwards.

That screams screwed up to me.Just try it and hey you may personally like it.', ""Dragon Half is a creative, self-aware, raucously funny parody of 90s anime and all its stereotypes, complete with complicated fantasy setting, slimes, dragon girls, and magic. It handles itself with the exact amount of seriousness it ought to- none at all. It is archetypal of the mindless good time that many of these tiny OVAs had on offer during that era. Beginning with the story, it's a simple setup that makes sure not to get in the way of the comedy. Mink, a girl who's half dragon, and her two friends, are under attack by a fat oaf of a king and his hapless henchmen,...whose ridiculous and self-absorbed plans always fall through. I'll call the story the strongest part of the anime, since the comedy is just so hilariously well-written. With such a short total runtime, they make sure not to waste a moment when it comes to making you laugh, be it through physical comedy, ridiculous gags, or writing which scathingly parodies anime of the era, especially fantasy adventure stories, while still remaining eager and independent as its own thing. Dragon Half, in this way, can be enjoyed both for what it is and what it's making fun of. In short, I cannot stress just how funny it is throughout- the comedy holds up fantastically well, even to this day. The art is unique and distinctive, with a fun, playful style which changes on a dime. This sometimes proves to be a boon for the prominent and well-executed physical comedy, but other times is a little jarring. Though, the character designs are great throughout, managing to be unique yet referential to the popular styles they're poking fun at. The sound is really great, with strong, characteristic voice work and a soundtrack that is wacky, energetic, catchy, and emblematic of an early 90s OVA. Copious use of synthesizer paired with creative musical direction combines to form a fun, carefree, and memorable soundtrack, adding to the generally lighthearted tone of the anime as a whole. The characters are also pretty good, save for Mink's dad, who comes off as flat and unfunny. He doesn't get much screentime, but in a show which doesn't have that much screentime to begin with, it is still suboptimal. Of the otherwise hilarious cast, my favorites are definitely Rosario and Damaramu, both for the same reason- they absolutely nail the inept henchman schitck. Rosario's constant attempts at being a mysterious mastermind and Damaramu's regular failures to live up to his boastful warrior persona mirror each other in their hilarity, and watching just how bad they crash and burn is probably one of the best parts of the show. Overall, while it isn't perfect, Dragon Half is a blast of an OVA, and deserves to have more episodes than it does. whose ridiculous and self-absorbed plans always fall through.

Unplanned interventions occur when the dragon-half girl and her friends set out to attend his concert.Dragon Half is a short 2-part dumb-fun comedy with lascivious undertones. The humor is mostly slapstick, the circumstances in which the characters find themselves are often absurd, and the story is ridiculous. The animation fluctuates by the scene, caricaturizing its own characters and oversimplifying their designs, and then shifting back to fully illustrated; the animation itself is good. The writing is parodical of the fantasy/adventure genre, picking on classic tropes...and characterizations.Somehow, this very brief OVA has bundled adventure, villainy, rivalry, fan service, a tournament arc, a love interest (and the subversion of mutual attraction), and a myriad of classic fantasy elements into 40some minutes of runtime. It is a whacky and somewhat amusing ride, though a lot of the gags would appear to be simple compared to what else has been released in the past 30 years.If you are seeking a quick fantasy comedy with low viewer investment required, I recommend Dragon Half. It is short, simple, and stupid fun. It does nothing outstanding, but nothing wrong either. and characterizations.Somehow, this very brief OVA has bundled adventure, villainy, rivalry, fan service, a tournament arc, a love interest (and the subversion of mutual attraction), and a myriad of classic fantasy elements into 40some minutes of runtime.

Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37623/Chiisana_Eiyuu__Kani_to_Tamago_to_Toumei_Ningen,"['MODEST HEROES, a 53-minute (yes, that\'s how long it is) animated feature which is actually three fifteen-minute featurettes in one program, is the second animated release from Studio Ponoc. Founded in 2015, the fledging studio found success nationwide with their first feature, the charming if derivative MARY AND THE WITCH\'S FLOWER. That film, handled by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and many other former animators at Studio Ghibli (who temporarily closed in 2014 but thankfully reopened recently), was more of a crowd-pleaser and technically more of a ""Best of Ghibli"" kind of showcase. MODEST HEROES, on the other hand, is something quite different, and may actually be all...the better because of it. This ""package film"" (a term borrowed from the 1940\'s Disney releases MAKE MINE MUSIC, FUN & FANCY FREE, etc.) provides the animators the opportunity to experiment with various animation techniques and aesthetic styles. Each featurette, handled by different directors, is loosely tied together with various shots of the quirkiest film projector I\'ve ever seen in any movie.The first featurette which opens this anthology, ""Kanini and Kanino"", handled by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, is an absolutely breathtaking and imaginative underwater fantasy about a pint-sized family who wield staffs with crab claws (shades of THE SECRET WORLD OF ARRIETTY) who dwell at the bottom of the sea of all places. The titular characters are two siblings who are separated from their parents and set off on a journey to find them. This featurette is the only one of the three not to receive a dub, and interestingly, is rather limited with dialogue, giving the picture a bit of a semi-silent film treatment. (There are occasions where the characters call out each other\'s names.) This short mixes traditional animation with computer generated imagery to realize both its underwater environment and the monstrous fishes who cast ominous shadows above our tiny heroes.After this stunner, we shift gears to a more down-to-earth, slice-of-life kind of tale, aptly named, ""Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose."" Directed by Yoshiyuki Momose, this short is based on an actual true story about a little boy who is lethally allergic to eggs. His mother strives to support him while managing her career as a dancer, and the boy must eat special foods and avoid getting contact with egg yolk. It\'s a very relatable and nearly heart wrenching tale. The animation here is a bit more like a watercolor-painting style, but the short is no less impactful for it. This dubbed version features the voice of Maggie Q as the boy\'s mother.The final tale, and arguably the gloomiest, is Akihito Yamashita\'s ""Invisible"", in which we follow a man who is literally invisible to everyone around him. All we see is his coat, hat, glasses, shoes, and gloves. He needs to carry a weight in order to stay on the ground, because otherwise he will float away. He does good deeds, but is unnoticed by others... until he sees a runaway baby\'s carriage. This short is animated in the classic hand drawn style, and with more shadowy colors. Again, dialogue is sparse in this short, but not to the same degree as in the first.All three featurettes showcase the visual range of Studio Ponoc in ways that will leave you eager to come back for more and more. Interestingly, after the showing I went to, an interview with Ponoc producer Yoshiaki Nishimura aired, who expressed the need to try to stand out from other studios in Japan. His solution--to try to push the limits of animation and make their movies the kind that kids would enjoy and would also inspire adults. It\'s very rare to see animation studios today with this kind of thinking. Bravo to Studio Ponoc for making the approach. It will be very interesting to see what they do next.

The film is a collection of three non sequential shorts that each tell a unique story about a heroic character and his or her respective journey. ""Modest Heroes"" is obviously not going to beat ""Mary and the Witch\'s Flower"", but it\'s still an enjoyable watch and it did certainly kept me interested the whole way through.Short One: ""Kanini & Kanino""""Kanini & Kanino"" surrounds the tale of two crab siblings whose life of living underwater becomes...drastically different when their pregnant mother goes to the surface to give birth, leaving only their father to protect them from the dangers of the river. One night, one of the siblings attempts to travel to the surface, only for something dramatic to occur, ultimately leaving the two siblings to fend for themselves in the vast river environment. I can\'t really say much about the short. I enjoyed the visuals way more than the characters or the plot, with its fantastic blend of 2D animation with splashes of CGI for the river environment that is eye-catchingly beautiful to say the least (despite the CGI fish, but whatever). I\'m not really invested in Kanini or Kanino, as forgettable as they are, and the fact that the short doesn\'t have any dialog hurts their dynamics as a whole. For the story and characters to be lacking in depth, the visual did make up for it to be considered for an enjoyable one-time watch.Short Two: ""Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose""""Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose"" is about the relationship between a mother and her son, Shun, who has a severe egg allergy that in-contact, could cause a life-threatening case in which Shun only has minutes to live. The short is based off a true story (claimed by the director) and it does a pretty good job keeping me interested in the characters and how they deal with Shun\'s condition. The mother is overly protected of Shun and tries her hardest to protect him from any harm, just to amend for all the times that she isn\'t there for him. Shun himself quickly learns to stay strong and formidable despite his unfortunate state and is eager to overcome any obstacles in his life to prove that he isn\'t frail and weak. The characters in this short are way more realistic and the hand-drawn artstyle complements it by having a sort of nostalgic feel, reminiscent of a children\'s storybook. The animation is fluid and the movements are more expressive that doesn\'t distract you from the overall atmosphere of the short. The intriguing aesthetic and the lovable character makes this short exceedingly enjoyable for anybody to enjoy, and this, along with the next short, produces a well crafted compilation if it weren\'t for the first short.Short Three: ""Invisible""""Invisible"" contains an interesting and ingenious concept that is explored in a very creative way. The short follows an invisible man, whom others cannot see. The man is required to carry a heavy object since he could easily be carried by a gust of wind without it. The short basically surrounds a day of his life, in which he ponders about his identity in life and his struggle of loneliness. What makes the short especially unique is through several brilliant action-packed moments that is exemplified by the gripping animation and the spectacular choreographer of the whole segment. Aesthetically, the short is bleak and almost depressing with its dimmed colors and almost dreary tone that sets it apart from the bright and colorful visuals of the previous two shorts. The Invisible-Man himself carries a dispirited mood that I can\'t help but feel sympathetic for. These design choices overall make the conclusion of the short extremely satisfying and makes the whole experience well-worth the watch.So what can I say? Studio Ponac did a fine job producing these shorts and I highly recommend this to those who are fans of their previous film. Creatively impressive and tremendously entertaining, ""Modest Heroes"" is huge step for Studio Ponac to work with other directors and their consistency in quality has me anxiously waiting for their next project. drastically different when their pregnant mother goes to the surface to give birth, leaving only their father to protect them from the dangers of the river.

I will give my opinion on each one. (Spoilers maybe)1. ""Kanini e Kanino"" - I think it started well, but over the course of history it has become somewhat confusing, having so many events grouped together, children who seem not to have, and it is not well explained about them, or why the mother of children simply rise to the pregnant surface, or why children who would be aquatic beings managed to get to the surface so fully....In addition to the aspects of the story, the combination of 3D and 2D to a certain extent is cool and acceptable, as the scenario has a more realistic style, while people are drawings, but I think it ended when the fish appeared! Why was the fish 3D in the water, but not out of it? I thought it was a good story at first, but confusing at the end.2. ""Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose"" - It was a story that I particularly liked, showing Shun\'s egg allergy and the things he went through because of it, or his mother\'s concern for him. My favorite scene was that of the stairs when he had an allergic reaction to the ice cream shop, the stylization in that scene, the colors and the bubbles that move and give the air of explosion. Still, it wasn\'t one of my favorites from the 3 stories.3. ""Invisible"" - It was one of my favorite stories. The scenario has a more abandoned style at the beginning of the short film, combining with the feeling of loneliness that the invisible man feels, always being alone. I can even empathize with him, seeing his loneliness, and how ignored he was everywhere. And at each moment he hopes to be seen, showing that perhaps this would make his invisibility disappear - as in the scene where the owner of the convenience store ""calls him"" and his face begins to ""lighten"". I twisted the entire short film so that it got along, and in the end I feel that I was rewarded even a little. It was my favorite of the 3! Despite its more lonely and abandoned aesthetic over time it gets simpler.

These 3 shorts films give us a much better indication of how Ponoc films are going to be different from Ghibli. I first have to say some sad news if your wondering ( probably not) why is this film so short like it doesn\'t even reach an hour all together well sadly this was supposed to have a 4 short film directed from the legendary late Isao Takahata for a personal reason or to give these new directors more exposure.   Also got to give credit to Yoshiaki Nishimura...the producer and is the only reason why this studio was formed giving these animators a chance to show off their abilities.1st  Short directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi definitely the most established director out of the 3 directing two films from Ghibli "" The Secret World of Arrietty "" and ""When Marnie Was There"" plus the debut film of this studio ""Mary and the Witch\'s Flower"". Plus he a veteran animator some of his best works in animation was Ponyo where she was running on the water catching up with the car...Unfortunately, this is weirdly the weakest film out of the 3. It doesn\'t feel as intimate and personal than the other two felt for the directors ( how I see it).  However, what this man is really known for is his expectational background work how he characterises his surroundings.  They is a youtube video that does a solid job describing it but basically, his backgrounds is a reflection of characters attitude. it shows the rawness of the sea how its not only beautiful but dark and scary due to pollution ( not hamfisted) its easily done from symbolism.  Unfortunately, the characters for me is really that effective however you got to appreciate its animation and making up a language. When watching i thought was watching the Japanese version however i was incorrect it just a made up language and its brilliant through characters expression you pretty much understand everything you need to know. The blend of CGI and 2D is usually hated for good reason as its uncanny however similar to Metropolis from Osamu Tezuka\'s the mix between the two is pretty good, however some moments it is noticeable. Takatsugu Muramatsu did the music i ain\'t much a critic of music however its really good his past work was all this directors film except The Secret World of Arrietty however the sync between the two is great two artistic complementing each other. I feel like this 18 minute short should have at least been 30 minutes for a good introduction however its still worth watching. A2nd Short well this one is fantastic but first the director for this one named Yoshiyuki Momose a veteran Ghibli animator work since Grave of the Fireflies by Isao Takahata.  This man done severely great key animations you just got to search it up, however for directing he\'s also just been doing music videos, specials ... hasn\'t really got too much experience directing however animation he\'s a champ.Lol sorry for long set up anyways this film is about a kid dealing with food allergies. Its also about a mother dealing with these circumstances and teaching her son the right ways. Honestly thinking about it truly sad like going to festivals bunch of food around you and if some accidents go on ur mouth you could die ... They some interesting circumstance with the mother, however the short doesn\'t showcase it for too long however really looking at it it\'s kinda sad about how a child can affect ur dream career ( however maybe that\'s looking too deep into it). I don\'t want to give anyone spoilers as you know its 18 minutes each so i won\'t. However, will go little more in depth.The animation is excellent that\'s a given but holy damn they is like one section where people are dancing and honestly reminded me of the animation style of Princess Kaguya. Anyways less said about animation the better but visually it reminds me of those flashbacks in Only Yesterday well it does make sense as he did storyboard the movie.  Ohh yeah the English dub is excellent highly recommend and the facial animation is truly top notch maybe not as good as Only Yesterday ( best facial animation in anime period fight me lol) however comparing a legendary film to this is unfair.  its basically maybe just about standard Ghibli ( which is a truly high bar) definitely better than Kyoto Animation. Also last note is the music is done by Masanori Shimada is i think his first music in anime however has tremendous talent can\'t wait for him to be apart of more projects in the future.3rd and final short directed by Akihiko Yamashita which is my favorite film out of the bunch however strangest.  His credits is impressive Animator director from From Up on Poppy Hill, Howl\'s Moving Castle, The Secret World of Arrietty ... done alot of key animation like Evangelion: 2.0, Spirited Away ... he got an impressive career however in this directorial not so much only a small 13minute short for the Ghibli museum which is like impossible to access.They aren\'t really a lot of to be said for this one because they aren\'t really a plot of a sort. It\'s about an invisible man I think literally and figuratively. I won\'t really talk about the plot as its something you just have to experience.The animation is the most fantasizing out of the 3, due to the main protagonist being an invisble man. They is an end sequence which is just epic.... the use of color is excellent and how the background is kinda a reflection on the main protagonist mindset everything being a kinda greyish hue.  The cinematography is spot on and the camera work is damn impressive. Yasutaka Nakata the person who did the music did an excellent job can\'t really commend on more.Conclusion these 3 shorts are pretty good, considering how mediocre anime has been becoming this is definitely a breath of fresh air. I wish the success for this studio and live up to Ghibli legacy as i assume after Hayao Miyazaki last film How Do You Live? ( however its miyazaki he probaly never retire at this point lol). Anyways hope you check out these 3 shorts by any means possible as these shorts aren\'t really for the money basically giving the studio exposure where the money rake in will be the studio next big project. the producer and is the only reason why this studio was formed giving these animators a chance to show off their abilities.1st  Short directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi definitely the most established director out of the 3 directing two films from Ghibli "" The Secret World of Arrietty "" and ""When Marnie Was There"" plus the debut film of this studio ""Mary and the Witch\'s Flower"". Plus he a veteran animator some of his best works in animation was Ponyo where she was running on the water catching up with the car...Unfortunately, this is weirdly the weakest film out of the 3. It doesn\'t feel as intimate and personal than the other two felt for the directors ( how I see it).  However, what this man is really known for is his expectational background work how he characterises his surroundings.  They is a youtube video that does a solid job describing it but basically, his backgrounds is a reflection of characters attitude. it shows the rawness of the sea how its not only beautiful but dark and scary due to pollution ( not hamfisted) its easily done from symbolism.

And as you may have been able to ascertain by the title of the film, that theme happens to be the concept of ""modest heroes."" Everyday people, some average and some not so much, who make sacrifices and acts of heroism both big and small. This can range from a young boy simply trying to not let an egg allergy get the best of him (in ""Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose"")...to an invisible man (""Invisible"") striving to find his place in a world that doesn\'t even acknowledge his existence.Hiromasa Yonebayashi, director of Arrietty, Marnie and Mary, directs the first segment of two crab-children embarking on a journey to save their father. While my least favorite of the bunch, this is still quite the exciting journey during its runtime.Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose is directed by Ghibli veteran Yoshiyuki Momose, who was the art director behind the stunning visuals in many of Isao Takahata\'s most artistically bold films (particularly Princess Kaguya and the Yamadas), in his (surprisingly) first ever role as a director despite him being such a storied artist. This film was certainly my personal favorite by far. The story was the most grounded, yet the animation and emotions portrayed gave it perhaps the most weight and impact of them all. Sometimes the most epic tales are those that can already happen in our own world. Fitting, as the inspiration behind this story was itself inspired by a colleague\'s detail of raising a child with severe allergic conditions.The final segment, Invisible, is a visually jaw-dropping affair with an ambiguous and abstract plot that begs the viewer to see with their hearts instead of their brains. Loose and erratic line-work perfectly renders a protagonist that for all intents and purposes is not visible. Ironically, or likely even intentionally, this short features arguably the most impressive character acting out of the entire trio of films. The director was specifically tasked with bringing life and expression to someone without a face. Needless to say, the results speak for themselves.As with nearly any anthology, the quality is variable, but always relatively high and impressive. And unlike Studio Ponoc\'s previous film Mary and the Witch\'s Flower, which was good but very derivative of the Ghibli-alumns\' past work at said studio, it\'s clearly apparent that these stories were produced to be above all else, original, daring, and artist driven. I only lament that we will never get to see the contribution Isao Takahata was slated to put forth before his unfortunate passing. Beyond that though, this is a consistently impressive showing from Ponoc and I am absolutely in support of more thematically-tied anthology films coming from them in the future. They may not be as profitable, but the imagination and inspired drive behind them is far more apparent. to an invisible man (""Invisible"") striving to find his place in a world that doesn\'t even acknowledge his existence.Hiromasa Yonebayashi, director of Arrietty, Marnie and Mary, directs the first segment of two crab-children embarking on a journey to save their father.

The gimmick of characters only saying each others\' names can work, but this ain\'t it chief.The CG water effects clashed so badly with the backgrounds that my heart ached to see it.Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose:Feeling curmudgeonly about this one. I never got invested in either the kid\'s plight nor the mother\'s (such as it was). The tragedy of this one comes from how normal and everyday this dangerous situation is, but that doesn\'t make it automatically gripping. It\'s got to have something else. And this just didn\'t.The art was mostly fine, but I didn\'t like the soft modern...look here. I know I\'ve enjoyed the style in other stuff, and this is making me wonder what I was thinking before.Invisible:This is the best of the three in ""Modest Heroes"" by a significant margin, and I can\'t help but think that my opinion of it is dragged down by the other two. As a somewhat recluse these days (amplified by quarantine), the symbolism is immediately readable to me and it got me a little invested to start with.

The scenarios are very neat, and the details are very characteristic, in all 3 shorts.Each of these shorts has a different animation format and this gives more identity to each of them, contextualizing that they are different stories, but that in the end they are there for a single purpose.Even the CG animation of the fish in the first short, plays very well...with the whole atmosphere and the outfit, so it\'s really cool to see.The soundtrack even gives you an incredible sense of immersion within each story presented in this film, even if it is not memorable and easily identifiable afterwards. It works and it\'s all she needs to make this movie incredible.The first short tells about creatures that look very much like humans and live under the sea. It is an extremely visual short, you don\'t need dialogues to give you a context of what is happening, and everything ends up resulting in the message about overcoming your biggest fears and facing the challenges.The second short has dialogues and carries a message about the difficulties of life that are already born with you and how to deal with it with a smile on your face, showing the day-to-day life of a very caring mother having to take care of her young son who has intolerance to egg.I admit that this second short made me get emotional with a very raw scene that shows the boy doing one thing at a time inside the house until he ends up eating a scoop of ice cream that contains egg in the ingredients.It is obvious that I will not say what happens after that or how it all happened, but here is my comment on this scene, because I was really moved.And the third short tells the story of a person who is excluded from social life and ends up dealing with several fantastical situations in those 15 minutes, simply to meet and create a characteristic and an image of himself in the end so that people start seeing it.You see several things happening and isolating the protagonist from this story, and it\'s quite sad if you think about it a lot.In the end, that\'s why the name of this movie is Modest Heroes. With all these 3 short films, the final message that this film wants to convey is that we are all heroes within our own lives, and we all go through difficult stages, but facing problems and overcoming them is what really makes us stronger each day, and consequently heroes.And you can even say that this film is too simple, but that\'s exactly what it wants to be. The name ""modest"" says it all. It is simple and unpretentious; simplicity is what makes everything vague, magical and rich within this narrative, and nothing fails.That\'s why I found this film sensational and I recommend it to you.In fact, this film is more proof that notes on websites do not matter much, when it only scores 6.95 on MyAnimeList...

The first short is about two brothers braving the dangers of the river to save their father from a fish. It is a straightforward story that children will enjoy and adults will not be too interest by. The second short is about a boy that is allergic to eggs. This has more application to adult life because it shows how the mother must change her lifestyle for the safety of her son, and it shows how there could be any number of unknown threats with such a common food as egg. The best short is about...an invisible man who is both physically invisible and socially invisible. It is my favourite anime short because of how it handles this premise. The art style is not smooth and fluffy nor sharp and edgy, and has a particular aesthetic, helped by the animation style, to visually explain what sort of a person this invisible man is. Although he is invisible, he still does the right thing and helps people even when they don't even acknowledge his existence. He is the most modest hero of all.Modest Heroes is primarily for children, and while not all the shorts may appeal to you, The Invisible Man is the best short ever made and deserves your attention. an invisible man who is both physically invisible and socially invisible.

After years of Miyazaki retiring, then coming back, over and over again, somebody finally told him that it was time to move on. Unfortunately for the sake of the many, phenomenally talented animators, Miyazaki insisted that if you didn’t create a film exactly the way he told you to, then it simply wasn’t good enough to make the final product.All of this information is forgotten when people mention that studio Ponoc came from ex-ghibli animators. These people undeniably...have the talent required to make a movie that, at a surface level could easily be mistaken for a Ghibli film. Unfortunately, after years of being told that they are only valued for their talent as an animator, and having their originality be stripped away from them, the Staff at Studio Ponoc completely lack any of the leadership qualities necessary to make a Ghibli-worthy narrative, to match the Ghibli aesthetic.Inconsistencies plague Kanini & Kanno. At times it can be beautiful, at others you get the ugliest CG fish ever created. At times the characters can be charming, but then you remember that some dumbfuck had the stupid idea of making everyone speak Pokémon. If Mary and the Witches Flower showed us that the studio has the talent required to make a Ghibli film, but may have been misguided in their narrative delivery, Kanini & Kanno shows a studio unwilling to learn from it’s mistakes and unwilling to risk daring to leave the shadow of its parent company. When one of the notes I took while watching said “Who cares?”, you know that the film has completely failed at delivering the quality one would hope for from a film that can look this good.4/10Life Ain’t Gonna LoseLife Ain’t Gonna Lose immediately improved my opinion towards the lack of leadership within Studio Ponoc. Finally, the changed art style shows a studio with animation talents beyond simply emulating what came before. It shows a director, hungry to make a name for himself, that understood that super-detailed animation simply wouldn’t work with the short-film he was trying to create.It’s the narrative of the film that truly made me pay attention to a director that has proven his talents, and also that he can make a really fucking terrible movie (Ni no Kuni). First of all, the characters can say more than each other’s names so now I can see them as people and actually care about the struggles they go through, regardless of how mundane they might be. The film revolves around the relationship of a boy with an extreme egg allergy, and how his mother tries to help raise him to overcome, what the film clearly presents to be a disability. I won’t say anything more than that because it’s so short, but trust me when I say that it’s worth your time to check it out. Not many films can make me feel anxious from watching a kid eat ice-cream.9/10InvisibleThis film is surprisingly dark when you consider who made it, and what it’s being packaged with. It follows an invisible man getting ignored to the point of what I can only assume to be a mental breakdown. Honestly the film is really depressing, not sad, just depressing. Like Jesus, imagine living everyday of your life, knowing that most people ignore you, that nobody cares about you and that you are just one of several billion completely replaceable human beings.

I found these shorts adorable, heartfelt, well-animated, and full of life with the limited time granted. I particularly loved the design of the crab characters from the first episode, the invisible man from the last, and the fact that almost no words were needed in either to create a moving piece of work. I'd highly recommend to anyone that likes heartfelt shorts.While none of the stories are particularly unique, that's a big part of the charm. The art style varies from story to story and I found it especially fitting. The only story I found a bit lacking...was the middle one. was the middle one."", ""Modest Heroes is a 53-minute long movie composed of 3 short films from Studio Ponoc, these shorts are more about Studio Ponoc showing their potential and aptitude for great animation while still providing small stories with passable story arcs.Kanini & Kanino:The character design and their setup were very intriguing. There is no dialogue and the characters are only able to say each other's names. I'm a fan of silent films and think that when used properly, they can be more powerful than dialogue, coupled with a world that piques your interest only to fall flat, makes for a bad combo. -SPOILER- I really thought the...mother character 'Kaka' died from one of those big fish, which reminded me of Finding Nemo but, it seems that she just went to give birth. Which then begs the question, why would you let a pregnant lady go alone in waters filled with threat? This is the weakest of the 3 short films in regards to the story.The animation was good, the CGI water and backgrounds were great except in some frames where the blending between traditional and 3D was noticeable. I wasn't a big fan of the CGI fishies. Even with great animation, This comes in last compared to the other 2 shorts.Life Ain't Gonna Lose:Is a more grounded story about a boy suffering from an allergy to eggs and a mother dealing with the anxiety of her son's safety and the world's ignorance and dismissal of her son's allergy. The boy eats an ice cream only to feel weird and find out that eggs are one of the ingredients, going to a festival and accidentally getting something on you that has eggs and almost dying. The mother's valid reason for over protecting the boy and the boy feeling weak as a result. The mother feeling that her son can't be by himself and she has to risk her dream career to take care of him leads to a great story.The dynamic cinematography and animation in scenes where the mother is peddling on a bicycle with her son on her back, the boy running down the stairs with his epi-pen, the mother and her dance team practicing their moves. This short had the second-best animation in my opinion.Invisible:The title says it all. It is a story about someone who feels invisible, literally and figuratively. Someone who feels that no one notices them, their actions carry no weight and are unnoticeable and insignificant. Someone who needs the aid of something else to give them weight, balance and footing. Growing up I was an invisible person for most of my life and I related to this one the most. There is nothing else to say than to watch this one and feel for yourself.The premise with an Invisible man provides great animation opportunity, which studio Ponoc used to the max and then some. The character design, backgrounds, cinematography, coloring, music and rain were spectacular. The scene where the invisible man flys off his moped and the camera goes from in front to behind him through his clothing was revisited by me multiple time. The best animated short of the 3.Final verdict, This is a must-watch if you enjoy great animation and are open to good short stories. mother character 'Kaka' died from one of those big fish, which reminded me of Finding Nemo but, it seems that she just went to give birth. Which then begs the question, why would you let a pregnant lady go alone in waters filled with threat? This is the weakest of the 3 short films in regards to the story.The animation was good, the CGI water and backgrounds were great except in some frames where the blending between traditional and 3D was noticeable. I wasn't a big fan of the CGI fishies. Even with great animation, This comes in last compared to the other 2 shorts.Life Ain't Gonna Lose:Is a more grounded story about a boy suffering from an allergy to eggs and a mother dealing with the anxiety of her son's safety and the world's ignorance and dismissal of her son's allergy. The boy eats an ice cream only to feel weird and find out that eggs are one of the ingredients, going to a festival and accidentally getting something on you that has eggs and almost dying. The mother's valid reason for over protecting the boy and the boy feeling weak as a result. The mother feeling that her son can't be by himself and she has to risk her dream career to take care of him leads to a great story.The dynamic cinematography and animation in scenes where the mother is peddling on a bicycle with her son on her back, the boy running down the stairs with his epi-pen, the mother and her dance team practicing their moves. This short had the second-best animation in my opinion.Invisible:The title says it all. It is a story about someone who feels invisible, literally and figuratively. Someone who feels that no one notices them, their actions carry no weight and are unnoticeable and insignificant. Someone who needs the aid of something else to give them weight, balance and footing. Growing up I was an invisible person for most of my life and I related to this one the most. There is nothing else to say than to watch this one and feel for yourself.The premise with an Invisible man provides great animation opportunity, which studio Ponoc used to the max and then some. The character design, backgrounds, cinematography, coloring, music and rain were spectacular. The scene where the invisible man flys off his moped and the camera goes from in front to behind him through his clothing was revisited by me multiple time. The best animated short of the 3.Final verdict, This is a must-watch if you enjoy great animation and are open to good short stories."", 'Modest Heroes is a 53 minute movie about 3 short stories. These shorts are beautifully animated and each carry a raw emotional power with them. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I would recommend you to watch it as well.The animation is insanely good. The movements feel alive, the CGI is superb and best of all, the scenery is amazing. Each short boast an impressive amount of details as well as a natural feeling. Looking at each scene give you the impression of immersion while keeping it as simple as possible.The movements act with stretched lines and exaggerated body movements which makes it lively and...smooth to look at (I forgot the animation technique). This is close to anime like Redline or Gurren Lagann. An impressive feat is that you can “feel” the weight behind each action.The sound design is very fitting for a movie format. Listening to it feels in a word “Grand”. The heavy drums or the high chimes sets the tone of the scene and beautifully accompany a certain feeling. The music was what sucked me into the dramatic scenes very well.Another thing is that the sound effects sounds so crisp. I once heard that David Production (studio behind Fire Force and JoJo) had a good sound design within their anime, but this feels even better. Just try to focus on the sound of bubbles or on a door opening. It makes me think that the world I look at is real.What the three movies have in common is that there is a struggle to overcome, hence the name Modest Heroes. Each short carries their own theme but captures the essence of a modest hero. The “heroes” overcome a problem greater than themselves. But their act of heroism is just perfect for them. I think that the focus on the character themselves is done just right. They know how to paint a start very quickly to let it escalate to the point of their deepest point. To see how they turn the tides is a feeling equal to taking a fresh breathe of air.There is little to no narrative, so the anime heavily focus on the animation part. If you’re into a good spoken plot, then this might not be your cup of tea. On the other hand, if you love to focus on greatly animated short drama then this is your pick! I liked it for what it tried to be. A simple yet powerful story. smooth to look at (I forgot the animation technique). This is close to anime like Redline or Gurren Lagann.

I liked it for what it tried to be. A simple yet powerful story.', 'So I recently watched a movie named ""Modest Heroes"" and I\'m pleasantly surprised. Before I start with my review of the movie, I should say, that Studio Ponoc, which made this movie, was completely unknown for me until I decided to watch this movie. Also I should say, that this is no ordinary movie, you\'re used to, because this movie is only like 55 minutes long and is made out of three short movies of lenght from 10 - 15 minutes. Every movie is, how the title of the movie hints, about heroism. But it\'s not about typical universe saving heroes, but more about normal...""everyday heroes"". However, let\'s get to the movie(s).First movie short named ""Kanini and Kanino"" (Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi) tells a story of two crab siblings, whose mother went to a surface to give a birth. And only their father stays underwater to protect them. The plot is good in my opinion, but honestly, it probably won\'t be the main reason, why would you want to watch this movie. The main reason will probably be the animation, which is breathtaking. It\'s a combination of classic 2D animation and CGI, which looks really bad very often, but in this movie it looks more than magnificent. And the animation was even more enjoyable in combination with beautiful soundtrack, some of the songs I would describe as ""magical"" and it really helps to add a right atmosphere to the movie. Of course, it\'s not a best soundtrack I\'ve heard, but I think that it\'s good enough to help you enjoy this movie.Second movie short which posses a name ""Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose"" (Directed by Yoshiyuki Momose) throws us right into the life of the young boy named Shun and his mother. But little Shun has a lethal allergy to eggs, so his mother is trying to protect him every day from everything what contain eggs. It sounds pretty easy, but it\'s not, if you consider that she also have to maintain her career as a professional dancer.The plot in this one is little bit better in this one. It aims on the relationship between Shun and his mother, it acts very naturally and tempo is pretty smooth, thanks to the great script made by Yoshiyuki Momose. Animation here is a typical 2D animation, we are used to from before, but it looks more... Artsy, I would say. And of course, soundtrack in this one is also great. It perfectly underlines the mood of a movie, because it\'s cool and happy, but if I remember correctly, there was one or two little bit more dramatic songs.And now, let\'s move to the last movie of the trio, which is named ""Invisible"" (Directed by Akihiko Yamashita) and it\'s about literally invisible man (which is probably just some metaphor for a person overlooked by society). But it\'s not his only and main problem, his main problem is that he is lighter than air, so he have to go out with some little bit heavier object in his hands, because if he would go out without it, he would start to float up to the big and scary storm clouds and then he would disappear for ever.So, the plot here I found little bit more enjoyable than the plot of ""Kanini and Kanino"", but also little bit less than ""Life Ain\'t Gonna Lose"". The animation of this one is just beautiful. It\'s again a typical 2D animation, but here it looks perfect and the backgrounds are just breathtaking. But this movie has one small problem for me, a soundtrack is not very significant. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s still good, but the animation just got all of my attention, so the soundtrack was moved on a different track.So, ""Modest Heroes"" is a great collection of animated movie shorts, which carries a lot of smaller or bigger problems, but is still something I would recommend. ""everyday heroes"".

Lovely animation, and adorable characters, but very predictable and hits all the story beats that you would expect. I enjoyed the world and am sad that the short runtime meant we didn’t get to see much of it. Overall, whilst I wouldn’t say it did anything wrong, it wasn’t very impactful in the end. 7/10Life Ain’t Gonna Lose—as a slice of life fan, I very much enjoyed this one....Just focusing on the struggles of a mother and her son who had a severe egg allergy in a world where most things have eggs in them. It sort of made me thing about how difficult that must be, as eggs are something used in a plethora of products; even things you don’t think would have them do. Again, the animation style was gorgeous—more unique than the last story, reminiscent of ‘Up on Poppy hill’ and ‘only yesterday’. 8/10Invisible—I loved this one! It’s about an invisible man that no one notices; and who is tethered to the ground only by the fire extinguisher he straps to his back to stop himself from floating away into space! This one had my favourite animation style of the three, being shaky and somewhat gloomy to match the characters state of mind. The sound design was also impeccable. 10/10So overall, I gave it an 8/10 as I feel it was the best balance of the three scores!

Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17827/Daitoshokan_no_Hitsujikai,"[""The idea in which equating popularity to greatness is disappointingly common in our modern world. Many people will claim that 50 Shades of Gray is high quality literature and many others will consider Drake to be a great rapper. They are blinded by the delusion that something being popular automatically makes it good. Obviously those people have never looked further into the media that they claim to be an aficionado of and have never read Infinite Jest or listened to Yung Lean before. This leads to Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, an unfortunately overlooked show in the Fall 2014 season. It did not stand out and the...publicity was nearly nonexistent. However, if you were one of the people who decided to give the show a try, you were in for quite a treat. You would have experienced a coherent plot, enjoyable characters, entertaining drama, and an overall comfy feeling that viewers have not experienced since Non Non Biyori last Fall. The fact that people would rather discuss popular, yet mediocre shows is downright depressing. It brings back bad memories of last Summer when a terrible Adam Sandler movie beat out Pacific Rim in the box office for that weekend. Regardless, those of you who overlooked this show have a chance to redeem yourself if you change your ways and look to the less popular and more obscure things in life. Following that ideal will take lead you closer to the path of enlightenment.The overall story for Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was nothing extraordinary or groundbreaking. It compares to other typical club-type shows where you find both drama and comedy as the main ideas. A word that would describe the story would be “unoffensive”. It was rather soothing and made the viewer feel comfortable when watching it. The overall arching plot was a typical slice of life show with a bit of a supernatural twist added in, but that is once again typical for this genre of visual novel from which the show was adapted from. The story itself could have been more fleshed out, but that would not have been easily done with the time constraints of a 1 cour show. The pacing was also quite well done, it did not drag or feel boring at any time and gave the viewer a relaxed or comforting experience. The fact that the show was adapted from a visual and had such a comforting feel to it is rather unique. Many times visual novel adaptions are rather fanservice driven or focus mainly on the exciting action related parts of the game. That being said, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was not without fanservice (it had plenty), it just came off in a bit more subdued and enjoyable than the typical smut that you would expect to see. It did not feel out of place or forced into the story to sell more Blu Rays, it just had an overall natural feel due to how the story was told and how it was directed.One aspect of this show that was rather interesting was the studio choice. Many people will remember Hoods Entertainment as a studio that did some of the most obscene fanservice shows that have aired on regular television. However, it seems that they have turned over a new leaf since their latest projects have not been lewd at all. It is a strange change of pace to go from doing Manyuu Hikenchou or Seikon no Qwaser which were over the top in terms of smut to the rather tame and pedestrian shows that they have done in recent history. Regardless, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was a rather pleasant show to look at. It featured a pastel color theme and the overall quality of the show was relatively high. Once again, the term that describes it best is “unoffensive”. That would also describe the sound for the show. The voice actors used were the same from the game which are commonly heard in visual novels. Experienced viewers will recognize a few voices, especially if they read visual novels. Regardless, the voice acting was well done and felt natural for the show. The OST and sound direction was also perfectly acceptable, it had that typical visual novel flair to it which fit the mood of the show perfectly. It definitely added to the comfortable feel that the show gave off.In regards to characters, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai did not feature anything special in particular. The cast was composed of rather cut and paste type characters with various back stories to give them some sort of depth. Obviously, the anime viewer would not see their full stories since it is not the original source material in which the reader would go through an entire route dedicated to all of the main characters, but it was easy to pick up on the various drama points and other traits from what was shown. However, what stood out for this show was the character interaction. That was top notch and it really felt like the characters had chemistry with each other. It was incredibly well done for this type of show and it really made it incredibly enjoyable to watch.When looking at the complete package of Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai, it is hard to consider it to be anything but enjoyable. The fact that it was one of the least popular and overlooked shows for the Fall 2014 season is rather disappointing. However, that may be for the better. The discussion and subsequent translation project for the visual novel were in part done due to the smaller and tight knit community that enjoyed watching this show. Regardless, if you are looking for something enjoyable that you can sit back and relax to, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai would be an excellent choice. It goes to show that it does not matter if something is relatively overlooked, it could end up being better than many high profile options. That being said, the moral of this review is look in unlikely places and you will find true hidden gems. Worshiping nothing but mainstream media is a terrible habit and you should try to think outside the box more often.

If you're not a big fan of those, you may not want to watch this one. I enjoy slice of life, romance, comedy, fantasy, sci-fi, and other light-sided genre, so it appealed to me.This show also incorporates a fantasy element - a magic library. I won't go into a lot of detail, so as not to ruin the story, but this library (while only briefly and periodically mentioned) is a theme that is important to every...character in the show (but two, specifically). Your Main Character, Kakei, is seen having premonitions right from the get-go. He has this strange, but imperfected, ability - which he uses mostly to save people. The First girl he saves using it (Shirasaki) was distributing flyers to start a club with the unspecific goal of 'making people happy' at the time, and later invites him to join her and her friend. The club grows in size and popularity as the show continues, as does the back story and magic library information.The characters are pretty fun to watch, their interactions are light-hearted and fluffy, but there are some tensions here and there between some of the side characters and the main characters. There is also the typical 'harem-style' anime theme of 'who does the MC really love?!' going on between the main female characters. The show doesn't have any naughty bits exposed, but there are some brief nudity scenes and some suggestive humor, but it is mostly a clean, happy romantic-style slice of life with little drama. Perfectly suited for sitting back on the couch or bed and relax while watching. You don't have to think too hard to follow the story. character in the show (but two, specifically).

Along the way, friends are made and decisions are chosen. Sometimes, though, teenagers need that tiny extra ""push"" to get them going down the right path. Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai will most definitely ""be telling this with a sigh"" that the path they took was ""the one less traveled by.""**STORY**Daitoshokan follows the life of Kakei, a young...high school boy who, one day, saves Shirasaki from a fatal accident. Their newfound friendship causes them to form a group known as the Library Club.What\'s unfortunate with Daitoshokan is in its handling of the major plot device at play. Known as the ""Shepherd,"" it is designed to be an important aspect of the show. However, it is never perceived as such. The first half of the anime consists mainly of character introductions, which is perfectly reasonable. But the characters themselves are largely uninteresting, and coupled with the fact that the foreshadowing is handled so poorly causes the big reveal to be rather small.Even worse, it never elaborates much on the ""Shepherds"" either, making one not understand the full extent of their powers. When the second half of the season begins, it then fails to utilize this established plot device effectively. It is used quite sparingly, causing its use to hold no weight, drama, or emotional attachment. Simply put, this anime is exactly the same with or without the idea that is supposed to separate it from other shows.While Daitoshokan is considered a romance anime, it never tries to be. Instead, it\'s confused as to whether it wants to pursue a single, established relationship or have all the girls involved be potential suitors. In other words, it can\'t decide if it wants to be strictly romance or strictly harem. This causes a lot of the scenes to feel segmented; the continuity between differing events doesn\'t exist because the anime is always flip-flopping between both ideas, without coming to a clear solution.At its core, the anime is about doing something for yourself versus doing something for others. It\'s an important life lesson that is usually learned at an early age. And there are similar ways to describe it: ""it\'s about giving, not receiving"", ""treat others as you would want to be treated.""The problem is that the show never really attempts to demonstrate such an idealistic message. It may come about as dialogue, but the actions that Kakei and the others take never fully portrays their movements as such. It all feels worthless, that the events taking place are neither for a single person or for a group of people; they\'re just *there.***ANIMATION**Daitoshokan continues its trend, having a tough time in the art and animation department.The art style is wholly uninspired. It is boring, generic, lacking detail, plain, unadventurous, pretty much any adjective that places it in a negative light. The environments refrain from being enticing, and while the characters involved switch between ""realistic"" and ""comical"" in drawing, it does not save it from being hard to watch.The character designs follow the same format as the art. That is to say, they are unappealing to say the least. The uniforms for the cast are forgettable, everyone\'s faces are eerily similar, and the only major difference between characters is their hair and bust size.As for actual animation, it\'s average at best with a minimal amount of it existing. Character movements vary in complexity, but usually with one character moving on-screen at a time. To add salt to the wound, other avoidance techniques are incorporated, such as having dialogue with no one on screen or having the camera zoom out to a large degree.**CHARACTERS**The downward spiral continues; the cast of Daitoshokan completely fall flat, with zero qualities to separate them from other shows, let alone each other.As the main character, Kakei is as generic as they come. Nice, calm, and trustworthy, he enjoys reading to talking any day of the week. Initially hesitant about joining the Library Club, the time he spends with his friends within it cause him to view life in a different way. He starts off being rather reclusive, but by the end, he\'s willing to help the people who have allowed him to break from his shell. He\'s as one-dimensional as protagonists go, with his sudden shift from being single to open-minded lost somewhere among the comedy, poor dialogue, and fan-service thrown his (and our) way.As the leader of the ""Happy Project,"" Shirasaki is a clumsy yet affable girl. Her determination to make life filled with joy should be lauded. She is quick to be jealous, easily teased, and cute when she doesn\'t mean to be. The first to have feelings for Kakei, she is not the best at expressing such emotions. Nevertheless, she makes a good effort, making her the main romantic interest in the series. Outside of this, though, she does nothing else. She doesn\'t contribute to the narrative nor does she provide any insight that wasn\'t previously made available. She is, more or less, an object.Senri is arguably the most complex character within the show, but that isn\'t saying too much. Holding an elegant beauty, her voice is angelic, making her the center of attention even when she doesn\'t want to be. Her rigorous training and unfortunate past made her become an isolated person. Her development sees her going in the opposite direction as Kakei. That is, instead of doing something for everyone, she starts to do things for herself, proving that there should always be some room for ""me time."" However, she somewhat rescinds on her new thought process, making it seem as if the realizations she had were for naught.Kodachi is the resident jerk, looking to disrupt the flow of the Library Club. With a large bust and an even larger attitude, her sarcastic remarks and constant joking make her difficult to deal with. Her past and person are shrouded in mystery...with that mystery being discovered within the first episode or two. She is the shining example when it comes to the highly misused ""Shepherd"" idea. If anything, she provided the most laughs to the show, making it at least somewhat tolerable.The ""kid"" of the bunch, Kana is outgoing and not afraid to swing both ways. She normally refuses to wear her emotions on her sleeve, making her incapable of acting like her true self. She shares a love of books, just as Kakei does, giving her the opportunity to connect more easily with another person. Her past, while sad, provides the reasoning as to why she goes about doing what she does. Unfortunately, after her little and literal episode, she is relegated to the side, becoming another member of the unnecessary harem.The last character to mention, since this process is beating a dead horse, is my personal favorite: Tamamo. The classic ""tsundere,"" she holds a trademark fan, both to conceal her embarrassment and to smack about the characters when needed. Among everyone, she tries the hardest (and fails the most) at getting Kakei to notice her properly. What\'s interesting is just how much she is tossed to the side. Her introduction early on, and sparingly over the course of the season, make it almost seem as if she isn\'t even a part of the cast at all. Surprisingly, she contributes even less than Shirasaki. Tamamo is just a trope to be filled. A last, lousy attempt to get viewers invested in the characters.**SOUND**The OP has, like everything before it, a generic beat, making it quite unmemorable. The only good part attributed to the song is the rising and falling note effect, similar to swiping one\'s hand back-and-forth along the keys of a piano. Other than that, it\'s not worth hearing.The ED is slightly better, with its very slow drumming and vocals. The vocalist is given the opportunity to demonstrate their chops a bit more, too. It\'s whimsical in nature due to the jingling bells and background singers.The soundtrack contains appropriate pieces that fit the mood at hand. Melancholy piano playing and bass/guitar arrangements for more tense situations. Nothing to phone home about when all is said and done.The voice acting for the anime is average, with no notable performances to be had.**ENJOYMENT**I\'d be the first one to tell you that romance is great and should be seen by everyone. This show does have these small moments, where the girls hug or otherwise get nervous when around Kakei. It can be cute and funny, depending on the girl involved, allowing for a reprieve that the show desperately needed.The rest of the anime is mired in disconnected drama, strange sub-plots, and misshaped character backgrounds. Furthermore, the club\'s cat, Gizaemon, should never have been included. They try to use him for comedic relief, but it never got a laugh out of me. They never even explain his amazing ability to understand and communicate with speech, but I think at this point, it doesn\'t even matter.As it stands, Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai does not do anything right, or even okay. When it comes to harems and supernatural abilities, other anime out there do it so much better. It\'s a wonder how this one got green-lit in the first place.**SUMMARY**Story: Terrible, inconsequential plot, romance trying to be a harem, lackluster themeAnimation: Bad, boring art style, generic character designs, slightly below average actual animationCharacters: Bad, low amount of development all-aroundSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, get that cat out of hereFinal Score: 2/10 high school boy who, one day, saves Shirasaki from a fatal accident. Their newfound friendship causes them to form a group known as the Library Club.What\'s unfortunate with Daitoshokan is in its handling of the major plot device at play. Known as the ""Shepherd,"" it is designed to be an important aspect of the show. However, it is never perceived as such. The first half of the anime consists mainly of character introductions, which is perfectly reasonable. But the characters themselves are largely uninteresting, and coupled with the fact that the foreshadowing is handled so poorly causes the big reveal to be rather small.Even worse, it never elaborates much on the ""Shepherds"" either, making one not understand the full extent of their powers. When the second half of the season begins, it then fails to utilize this established plot device effectively. It is used quite sparingly, causing its use to hold no weight, drama, or emotional attachment. Simply put, this anime is exactly the same with or without the idea that is supposed to separate it from other shows.While Daitoshokan is considered a romance anime, it never tries to be. Instead, it\'s confused as to whether it wants to pursue a single, established relationship or have all the girls involved be potential suitors. In other words, it can\'t decide if it wants to be strictly romance or strictly harem. This causes a lot of the scenes to feel segmented; the continuity between differing events doesn\'t exist because the anime is always flip-flopping between both ideas, without coming to a clear solution.At its core, the anime is about doing something for yourself versus doing something for others. It\'s an important life lesson that is usually learned at an early age. And there are similar ways to describe it: ""it\'s about giving, not receiving"", ""treat others as you would want to be treated.""The problem is that the show never really attempts to demonstrate such an idealistic message. It may come about as dialogue, but the actions that Kakei and the others take never fully portrays their movements as such. It all feels worthless, that the events taking place are neither for a single person or for a group of people; they\'re just *there.***ANIMATION**Daitoshokan continues its trend, having a tough time in the art and animation department.The art style is wholly uninspired. It is boring, generic, lacking detail, plain, unadventurous, pretty much any adjective that places it in a negative light. The environments refrain from being enticing, and while the characters involved switch between ""realistic"" and ""comical"" in drawing, it does not save it from being hard to watch.The character designs follow the same format as the art. That is to say, they are unappealing to say the least. The uniforms for the cast are forgettable, everyone\'s faces are eerily similar, and the only major difference between characters is their hair and bust size.As for actual animation, it\'s average at best with a minimal amount of it existing. Character movements vary in complexity, but usually with one character moving on-screen at a time. To add salt to the wound, other avoidance techniques are incorporated, such as having dialogue with no one on screen or having the camera zoom out to a large degree.**CHARACTERS**The downward spiral continues; the cast of Daitoshokan completely fall flat, with zero qualities to separate them from other shows, let alone each other.As the main character, Kakei is as generic as they come.

Second glance: it failed with the potent material and became Slice Of Life garbage.SYNOPSIS:Bland protagonist was shown this random ticket from his Dad for no reason. Finds a chick to join her club, thought about it, then joins it with his newly found friends. Now do a bunch of random shtuff to apparently spread happiness for the school. And yeah, there\'s a supernatural element thrown for no reason.REVIEW:Fortunately, there was a sense of risk in this project, or at least it tries to be interesting from the first episode with this girl trying to be...less introverted with this club she runs. Now this opens up character development with theme for the whole cast, but she then magically loses timidness at the second episode. As if that trait never existed! The rest of the cast seemed to open up to the club too easily after the protagonist joined the party. All of the characters are archetypes, like the cool leader, Kudere, Moe, comic relief etc.Now the show isn\'t sold as a complete harem, you have an extra male. But that\'s it. Seriously, this guy has the least screen time and is completely useless in every aspect of the narrative, coming of as another comic relief cliché. I never cared about him, and the show was fine as a harem.At the end of each of the early episodes, we see tid bits of mystery elements; like the school librarian has connections with this mysterious man who has a link to some supernatural thing to the plot. (does anyone notice a Key reference there?) Though it does try to keep the whole mystery aspect a ""mystery"" until the end of the earlier episodes, but does it seem interesting? Yes. Was it well presented? No. Because the show makes it a quirky back drop and its not like in Kokoro Connect when the whole show centres around it, and was used to create humour and drama. Ultimately, it is meaningless, and adds jack to the show.If the show were to present the supernatural at some point, effectively, that makes the rest of these episodes (once the whole cast was introduced) seemed like filler. Though it seemed too late for it to have any real effect since you were trudging so many pointless episodes that lead to nothingness, making it poorly handled in that sense.Simply put, this makes it no more than just Slice of Life with failed elements to hook the critics interest. Since all these factors granting the show of higher value has failed, it does deliver its job well for just being used effectively as the day to day lives of a bunch of teenagers without realism to kill time with. Excluding that, its not worth the watch.LEGACY:What else was there to say? It has the potential to become something ""a bit more"" but presented it badly. Let it be: Another Slice of Life High School show; that it may fade away to obscurity... Soon we are all hyped for the doushjins!CRITICAL SCORE:CHARACTERS: 4/10 - Forgettable archetypes in the long run.STORY: 4/10 - Had potential at first.

The accident happened due to Kakei\'s seeing the future power. With Kakei and Shirasaki meeting, the two embark a typical school life journey towards the completion of ""Happy Project as they meet new friends. But here\'s the catch, a mysterious entity called the ""Sheppard"" stirs things up that either helps them or hinders them along the way.Pros:- Slice of life and Supernatural genre blended well in...the plot- fun characters (even the cat, which I think is the most interesting lol)- minimal fanservice- story pacing is smooth, not confusing- a happy anime, you will always feel fuzzy insideCons:- nothing groundbreaking in terms of story- visuals are not as good compared to other modern day anime- typical kindness will get you girls MCOverall, you can\'t hate this anime because of it\'s light-hearted atmosphere that gives you while you watch it. Though you might forget this anime in a month or two because to be frank there are no memorable moments here. If you want to take a break from fanservice or action anime you typically watch, this anime will give you a nice experience. the plot- fun characters (even the cat, which I think is the most interesting lol)- minimal fanservice- story pacing is smooth, not confusing- a happy anime, you will always feel fuzzy insideCons:- nothing groundbreaking in terms of story- visuals are not as good compared to other modern day anime- typical kindness will get you girls MCOverall, you can\'t hate this anime because of it\'s light-hearted atmosphere that gives you while you watch it.

if yea then remember the voice of aikawa ayumu, he is the same as this one.the BGM was nice and fitting, but not to the point that ill download it and listen to it, it\'s not memorable after all. it felt the same way as the visual novel adaptation.  same for the OP and END.when looking back at the whole show with his different aspect it surprises me that it\'s the least popular one in it\'s season not to mention the score it was given in myanimelist 7.08. it\'s kinda disappointing since it deserves more than this. personally i didn\'t expect a romcom harem show to be this enjoyable at all, even though the adaptation was a little bit faster than it should compared to the visual novel. but yea, adapting 5 different route in 12 episodes is not that easy.overall i recommend Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai to any romcom harem fan as it feature different aspects in a limited number of episodes.to end up this review am giving it a score of 7.8 out of 10.story 8- animation and arts 8 - sounds 7 -character -7 enjoyment 9.(this is the first time am posting an anime review^^ so i hope helped some of you make a decision after reading this) over 50000 students. and out of all this huge number, it follows our first main protagonist Kakei Kyoutarou a loner who enjoys reading books as his favorite passion.however, he has a supernatural ability that lets him see the future of some people around him, and also that dragged him out of his peaceful book reading life.the nice aspect about the story here is the mystery theme that follows the events of his daily harem life, since our 6 club members get some weird mails from someone called a shepherd, mentioning something about their fate and life.while getting into the story this shepherd secret will have a big impact in kakei\'s life, or rather his ""fate"" and that will make stuff a little bet complicated since it has a relation with his past self.now the one and only thing that didn\'t look right to me was rushing the events and especially in the last episode where everything will get settled down in the last minute rather than the whole episode. but the ending coveres this matter.(i\'m trying as hard as i could not to split any spoiler while writing~~)now to the art and animation. i would like to say the art is unique but the only thing that makes it looks special is the different eyelashes color, and also that beautiful eyes design. as for the character design matter, it doesn\'t really stand out, most of them resembles some other ones in different series (at least for me) but it is still well done though....and cute. there are some little details that bothered me while watching the show too, like that over brightness in the whole scenes, everything is too bright! or the background drawing that looks kinda old, it just doesn\'t match with the characters. but i guess all that is because the animation it self was not made to be realistic. it will be nice if it did~~for the characters part, it was deceiving. when expecting some different turns of events that will make the show stands out of his harem genre, in the end it\'s always the same way. 5 or 6 girls of differents types surrounding the main protagonist, who can\'t make a goddamn decision and choose one heroine. and of course his one and only unpopular friend who helps in bringing the comedy mood. yeah, it\'s just you\'re cliche sets of characters that lack development. the worst is it felt like the whole 12 episode were forming a circle because everything in the end got back to the way it was from the beginning, in other word.""initialization""of course it\'s not only about bad things. there\'s also that interesting change in the protagonist throughout the series, while trying to choose between his old loner self that only looks for peace, and someone who sacrifices himself to save people and guarantee their happiness. and the reason behind this change has a relation with the shepherd and magic thing again (no spoil desu) and also because of his new friends that changed the world around him.anyhow, the characters aspect was good enough for a series like this. it had some surprising plot twist sometimes (discovering his sister was....) and didn\'t ruin the show at all. it was just ....normal.to be honest, the main reason i choose to watch Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was because of kakei voice actor. did anyone watch ""is this a zombie"" ?

You know the moment I\'ve watched this.................thing, well, I could say plot wise it was good. It kinda have some similarities with the movie ""The Adjustment Bureau"" where shepherds does the job of guys with hats and that instead of a door to another portal , in this anime it was books. Here the main protagonist Kakei is a just a regular guy who is just another one of those bookworm characters who somehow got involve with  Shirasaki\'s ""Happy Project"" and where his simple  and ordinary life starts to go upside-down and he and his club members/ harem wonders about...the mystery behind the messages left by a certain individual called the ""Shepherd,"" thought Kakei doesn\'t know yet, he is an unwilling player of the \'Shepherd"" which is also initiated by his half sister and Shepherd wannabe, Nagi, which for me it does add something good for the anime\'s plot, but, most of the time, everything were just utter random cliche situations where the main focus was on the members of the Library Club and  Shirasaki\'s ""Happy Project"" than anything else. So, my ratings:StoryI\'m gonna go with 5 and just refer to the explanation above.ArtI\'m gonna apologize to everyone, cu\'z this anime\'s art was basically just cliche eye candy, there maybe some limited fanservice, but realistically this anime or manga where just banking on such eye candy thing, so it\'s a 5 for the art.SoundWhat I like about it:-  The VA\'s who did the voices of; Shirasaki, Kodachi, Sakuraba, Kakei, Kana and Ikkei.- I like the opening and closing theme- I also like the VA who did Misono\'s voice, but not when she is doing opera.But:-The cat Gizaemon, should have just meow, than to have some one line speaking lines.-My rating, a good 7.Character:Ok let\'s go to some of the characters, btw, I gonna give this part an 8:Kyoutarou Kakei, ok, so he maybe the usual harem guy, but he is one usual harem guy that I like, though a joy killer, I really like that he get\'s int situation where he has to this dark horse who has to help people that the library has set him to do. Also, , I like the short moment where he and Shirasaki where intimate.Tsugumi Shirasaki, ok, she is this usual pesky nice girl who gets into the guy\'s life and turns it upside down, but then again, I like her. I like the way how she diligently tries her best to make her happy project to help others in a way that she has this sweet touch where everyone feels a certain comfort around her. Despite of her being a klutz, it is that thing which gives her character a certain charisma.Nagi Kodachi, as much as I hate to say it, she is one heck of a train wreck where her character is a mystery, where at one point she isn\'t gonna be a shepherd and in the end she becomes one, also detail about her in the manga seemingly conflicts her character in the anime (btw, I\'ve only gone to just  couple of chapters in the manga), never the less, she the quintessential girl who should have a brocon on Kakei.Misono, Kana and Tamamo, well they\'re just the usual harem member, that I kind like.Ikkei Takamine, I kinda pity that character for not having a slice of the harem pie, if he can have one he should be with Tamamo or with Maho.EnjoymentBasically it was enjoyable when I see the harem members competed for the guys affection, also the intimated moment that Shirasaki has with Kakei and how Kakei saves Shirasaki from a death flag. But most of all,  the sweet moment when the two met back stage where Kakei seemingly is saying goodbye to Sjirasaki, where I\'m giving this a 7.OverallTbh, it\'s a 1, since the concept having somekind of secret magic library in school whose functions has some similarities with the 2011 movie ""Adjustment Bureau"" was just too fancy for an anime whose plot revolves around the members of the ""Library Club"" and Shirasaki\'s Happy Project. To add some kind of magic element in this anime was more like a miscellaneous thing that just adds to some complications with the anime\'s story. So amigos, have fun watching the eye candy that this anime provides. the mystery behind the messages left by a certain individual called the ""Shepherd,"" thought Kakei doesn\'t know yet, he is an unwilling player of the \'Shepherd"" which is also initiated by his half sister and Shepherd wannabe, Nagi, which for me it does add something good for the anime\'s plot, but, most of the time, everything were just utter random cliche situations where the main focus was on the members of the Library Club and  Shirasaki\'s ""Happy Project"" than anything else. So, my ratings:StoryI\'m gonna go with 5 and just refer to the explanation above.ArtI\'m gonna apologize to everyone, cu\'z this anime\'s art was basically just cliche eye candy, there maybe some limited fanservice, but realistically this anime or manga where just banking on such eye candy thing, so it\'s a 5 for the art.SoundWhat I like about it:-  The VA\'s who did the voices of; Shirasaki, Kodachi, Sakuraba, Kakei, Kana and Ikkei.- I like the opening and closing theme- I also like the VA who did Misono\'s voice, but not when she is doing opera.But:-The cat Gizaemon, should have just meow, than to have some one line speaking lines.-My rating, a good 7.Character:Ok let\'s go to some of the characters, btw, I gonna give this part an 8:Kyoutarou Kakei, ok, so he maybe the usual harem guy, but he is one usual harem guy that I like, though a joy killer, I really like that he get\'s int situation where he has to this dark horse who has to help people that the library has set him to do.

So amigos, have fun watching the eye candy that this anime provides.', 'Ah, harems.  One of the most subjective anime genres that exists, as well as one of those that can be both hit or miss.  On this review, I\'ll b talking about Daitohokan no Hitsujikai which...falls into the latter.Story (5.11/10): The story of Daitoshokan, or ""A good librarian like a good shepherd"", a boy by the name of Kakei Kyotaro enters a prestigious school with the thought of going to school and sort of delving into the crowd, spending his time in his books.  However, one day, he meets a girl by the name of Shirasaki Tsugumi, and gets invited to her little...plan called the ""Shiomi Happy Project"", in attempt to make the school a wonderful place.I\'ll be blunt here.  The story is shit.  And that\'s kinda putting it lightly.  Like a lot of anime, the show does have a bit of a decent start to it, as well as some pretty interesting story concepts, really, it doesn\'t really deliver on anything.  There are a couple pluses to this story, but there are a lot more negatives to counterbalance it.What really gives this show something to make it interesting is the concept of the shepherd.  The shepherd is what made the show interesting.  But in addition, it\'s also a double edged sword.  In the beginning of the series, the shepherd was introduced to be a mysterious character and concept of sorts that gripped the audience.  It was mystery element that made the show a lot more interesting than it was, which, after being told what it was, kinda brought the show to rock bottom.  The shepherd when fully explained, well, ""fully explained"" felt incredibly forced and amateurly done because after the groundwork was placed, the show essentially uproots itself and makes up things in its place, making everything the show created, irrelevant.Aside from the idea of the shepherd, there\'s really not much story.  Every event in the story feels horrendously forced and it plays out like a generic harem in the sense of all the girls having their own little ""arc"" that doesn\'t really add up to anything, before going into a story that was even more poorly written.In the end, the show really didn\'t end up to be more than a gigantic mess.  The ending really didn\'t do more than bring a happy ending of sorts for this show, which does give it a somewhat positive not on account of the sweetness that the ending did have, but the poorly done story and the show basically rewriting its own plot ideas and previous groundwork put the nail in the coffin to a very, very poorly made show.Overview:+/-  Good mystery element at the beginning-  Awful storytelling-  Show basically rewriting its own rulesCharacters (5.00/10): Oh boy.  If the story was bad, the characters put the topping on the cake.  While harem shows aren\'t necessarily known for good characters, there comes a limit as to how bad they can be.Kyotaro Kakei is our main protagonist, and as a harem protagonist, he\'s not really much to look at.  Kakei simply just wants to write books.  That\'s kinda it.  He agrees to become part of the Happy project, but aside from that and the so-called ""development"" he gets, which is so cliched and forced that it hurts, there\'s nothing significant about him.  His goals and his actions often times come into great conflict with one another and it just turns the show into a very big mess.  Not to mention this guy has the personality of a brick.  Do anime chicks like bricks or something?  Cause this guy got like 5-7 girls easy without trying, no problem.Aside from him in the main cast, there is Kodachi, who really should be the main girl and not Shirisaki because comparatively speaking, Kodachi is a much better character.  While formally introduced a little later than all the other characters, Kodachi definitely proves to be the show\'s best character on account of the fact that she has more personality than everyone combined, as well as her own goals that separate from all the others.  However, she does suffer from the same problems as all the other girls, gaining a very forced feeling backstory that really does things half-assed, as you really only get a tiny, tiny amount of information, leading you to want more, thus making the character incomplete.  She\'s an interesting character, and really saves the show a bit by being more interesting, but still fails to be anything more than that since there are other girls who take the spotlight.Speaking of the other girls, how about them?  Kanasuke, Senri, Tamamo, and Tsugumi are the token harem girls of this series, Tsugumi being the ""main girl"" and the ""end girl"" seeing as how the show apparently took her route.  Nonetheless, I\'ll just be blunt here.  They suck.  There all have ""personality"", by which I mean stereotypes seeing as how they all reflect on a harem girl stereotype that they don\'t really depart from.  And, as I have mentioned before, all four of them get an little, ity-bity backstory that doesn\'t really add very much.  (Like seriously, talking about a character\'s important moment for like three minutes doesn\'t count as a backstory.  You need more than that.  Or at least something more than just one of the girls suddenly wanting to tell their problems to  guy they just met a couple weeks ago.)In addition, there are two characters that serve roles so stereotypical that it really just hurts to watch, because even they know it themselves.  And those are Takamine, and the cat, King Gaza.  Which serve as the ""best friend character that doesn\'t get a girl"" and the ""mascot"".  Honestly, it would\'ve been better to just oust these two because they don\'t even serve as comedic relief.  (Sunohara would be ashamed.)As for side characters, well, you can forget them.  Side characters in those show mean nothing, as the amount of screentime combined out of the entire supporting cast equates to about 20 or so minutes.  You don\'t really understand them, you don\'t get why they do what they do, they just serve as confusion for the audience because it\'s obvious that the show didn\'t even try to incorporate them into the story well, opting just to throw them in at random times.Overview:-  Awful MC protagonist (even by harem protagonist standards)-  Harem troupe girls that aren\'t very interesting-  Useless stereotype characters that didn\'t serve much purpose-  basically unknown supporting castArt and Sound (7.11/10 and 6.99/10):  Honestly, the aesthetics are the only real high point of the show, and that\'s not a good thing when taking a look at the individual category scores.The art is bright, it\'s whimsical, it\'s...meh.  There\'s not really much to look at, really.  The art serves its purpose by being pervert bait, as the show does often enough show off its jiggle physics with Kodachi and Tsugumi.  In addition, the show, being drawn in a cutesy moe style, doesn\'t really do much beyond well, being a cutesy moe style.  The art serves its purpose, giving a decent visual experience to the viewer, but really nothing elseThe music is also meh.  The opening while yes, has gotten stuck in my head on some occasions, doesn\'t have anything to offer, period.  It\'s a generic track, kinda like its ending, and are just these nice to listen to, but not memorable cutesy anime tracks.  If you want to skip them, go ahead, they\'re not really worth listening too.Overview:+/-  Meh art+/-  Meh musicPersonal Enjoyment (5.99/10):  I love harem.  There, I said it.  I really enjoy harem shows.  The ludicrous idea of having a bunch of girls surrounding one guy just makes me smile for some reason.  However, there does come a breaking point where a show that can be tolerable to watch (since I have a decently high resistance to the amount of crap I can watch) to something that\'s just honestly, quite unbearable.Did I like this anime?In the beginning, I admit, I was enthralled to some extent.  I knew at the time, it was going to turn into a generic harem, but I thought the idea of the shepherd was going to save the show to some extent.  It didn\'t.  It only confused me even more and gave me a bad feeling.  Although, I admit to liking Kanasuke as a character.  I dunno, characters like that appeal to me.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Let\'s run through the list here.  The entire plot, how they screwed up their own ""Shepherd"" idea, the characters.  What did I miss?  Oh yeah, the pacing was awful.  In the beginning, the show as kinda slow.  But towards the end, the show rushed by so many things, that the entire thing fell into the realm of mediocrity.  Not to mention how forced the development, the story, and the romance was, making the entire thing so much less enjoyable to watch.Would I recommend this show to anyone?Daitoshokan is the Fall 2014 equivalent of Glasslip.  (Now you may shriek in terror.)  While compared to Glasslip, the show trades aesthetics and a decent soundtrack for a somewhat easier to follow story, in the end, it\'s still not worth your time.  I seriously want the time I spent watching this back.  So...don\'t even put this one on the list, folks.  It ain\'t worth it.Overall Score: 5.48/10 plan called the ""Shiomi Happy Project"", in attempt to make the school a wonderful place.I\'ll be blunt here.  The story is shit.

It ain\'t worth it.Overall Score: 5.48/10', 'This series made me realize just how many harem series I\'ve watched, to the point of knowing what the series was gonna end in just a few episodes. But for some reason, I enjoyed it a lot.This was perhaps because of its concept of ""having the ability to see the future"" without anything relating to time travel. Also, its idea of becoming a being who can change the fate of a person to create a better world is not something anyone can come up of on the fly. I swear, this series had potential... if only it didn\'t become a harem series.The reason why I...think harem broke my interest for this series is because it didn\'t even need to have a harem tag in the first place. It would\'ve been fine as simply ""a boy who had the ability to change the fate of humans"". But no, they just had to add that tag. Personally, it would\'ve done well even without the harem tag. There was already romance, so bringing in other girls to the story just makes it a nuisance.I gotta say though, the animation and art style was really smooth. It wasn\'t so rough or full of highlights or shades. Because of that, the show maintained a light atmosphere.Overall, it wasn\'t a bad series. I\'m just pissed off that they placed a tag that shouldn\'t have to be there in the first place. Doesn\'t matter if you like or hate harems though, because when you watch it, you\'ll just want to become a shepherd. think harem broke my interest for this series is because it didn\'t even need to have a harem tag in the first place.

At the end of the day, adapting a visual novel into an anime is a game of compromises. One of the advantages of a VN is that they're such a slow burn, building up characters and plot lines slowly in ways that feel natural and that get you really invested in the characters. It's pretty much impossible for an anime to have everything from a VN due to time constraints...as well as a lot of things not translating that well to animation such as the structure or routes. Hence, adaptation comes down heavily to picking what to put in and what to leave out, with more than not generally left out. How these compromises are made is just as important as the source material in determining the quality of the anime, and ultimately in this case it feels very much like a case of a good story that didn't come through all that well.The overarching narrative is really interesting, with the presence of supernatural elements adding very unique elements and occasionally very high stakes to a standard slice of life story. The cast of characters too seem very interesting with interesting personalities, motivations, and relationships to each other that slowly develop, in part due to their backgrounds. However, it feels like the anime tried to do an adaptation where it tried to show a little bit of everything, and didn't really show anything in depth. The story starts off very slowly, spending a lot of time giving a proper introduction to each character, which hence ends up pushing the reveals of the true main story and special mechanics until about half way through the show. After that, it quickly tries again to show a bit of everything, events that develop all the various plot threads, while also showing off all the heroines. However, because of this it doesn't go in depth into anyone. The plot moves at a pretty fast pace, with a good amount of character development and emotional moments. However, it goes so quickly it doesn't spend enough time to truly capitalize on them, and thus the impact is diminished. Everything makes sense, but it leaves a lot of things implied rather than explicitly stated which combined with the speed can make things feel confusing or random at times. And finally, while it does have a lot of stories, it doesn't feel like it follows any of them to completion. The stories are good in and of themselves, and how it ultimately concludes is solid and satisfying from the perspective of a season, however it feels like just a season, not the ending to the whole story, which within the context of the anime adaptation it is. Plus, while there is some great humor, it feels like they didn't have time to put in as much as it needed, and hence the atmosphere kind of suffers. Because of all this, even though the story does hit a lot of good notes and feel like its great in a lot of ways, it feels like there just isn't enough, and hence it feels kind of lacking.The art style and animation are mostly solid, wherein it's never really amazing and there are occasional cheap feeling moments but overall is good enough throughout. I will note that I especially liked the end cards. The OP and ED are solid in both visuals and audio. The soundtrack is okay but unmemorable. as well as a lot of things not translating that well to animation such as the structure or routes.

If you like Grisaia No Kajitsu you might like this but I doubt you will enjoying this because I think some of the episode are so so boring, and its totally different compared to serious Grisaia, this is a not-so-comedy anime. I intend to drop this anime since episode 10 but there is always something interesting happen towards the end so I cancel my decision and give this a try and to be honest its so tiresome. For me, a plot about a...bookworm who wants to be a shepherd, a shepherd here mean a person who hold a book of fate of all people in the world and they have a power to change the fate. This is what the MC have here but I think this suppose to be main plot is just a subplot because they are not really focused on that shepherd stuff, only a few episode cover it, other than that just some random episode about every girl problem that MC will help to solve. I love the hint of romance but I don't think shojo lover will come to love this anime because its totally just some another subplot, but sometime its cute. If you like harem-little ecchi anime you might like this, but you know you must try hard to love this anime because for me its really slow and boring sometime. bookworm who wants to be a shepherd, a shepherd here mean a person who hold a book of fate of all people in the world and they have a power to change the fate.

Oh well...There is nothing wrong or right about this anime. Its another harem where MC is being liked by everyone and is the best because the writers said so. The story is sort of interesting and there is potential here, though I feel its squandered on the harem genre.I liked the characters though there is nothing special about them. The MC is also nothing special, maybe the whole reading books is kind of cute, in a nerdy way. I like it, its nothing special.You aren\'t missing much by not watching this, but its a cushion anime...- made to comfortably fit around your fat ass.

The story is interesting I think it focuses on some Japanese Folklore probably other cultures but lets say its Japanese on something called the Sheperd, and the Sheperd consists on some Transcendent Being that helps people be happy while taking...control of theyr fate, cause they can see the future, past and everything a person has done when something is about to go wrong lets say an accident, the Sheperd takes action to save that person. All that Information are in books and our MC is a Bookworm wich makes him a Sheperd Candidate, so for 12 episodes its his ""persona adventure"" where he meets people and cultivates his friendships with them learning about theyr pasts and stuff. But for one to became a Sheperd a sacrifice has to be made and that is to became an existance who everyone forgets. So find out if he becames one or not you wont regret watching this. At least consider adding this to your planning to watch list when you have the time.About the Characters each character is unique, the girls, wich made me not feal bored and distinguish each and every one of them. Also the MC is pretty smooth like a persona MC and goes along with some stuff and says funny stuff to get a reaction from the girls. Also im sure he is not stupid, like not at all he is top student in a prestige school or whatever and is pretty sharp as well, I think he just acts dumb towards the girls or has you progress and learn more about him trust issues. Yes this is a Harem one.The Art is nice made by Funanimation but I dont think that has to do with anything but Im ignorant towards that stuff so Ill apologise and get back on the subject. The art is well done and the humour with the characters its funny as well when they make the expressions and stuff like that.I thought this was gonna be a simple review but it turned quite long, As for my personal enjoyment and recommendation:Yes! I do recommend this and as I said it before at least consider adding this to you Planning to watch List as for the enjoyment Yes! I did quite enjoyed it myself giving it a nice round 9. This deserves a sequel!Sorry for the bad english hope that this Helps when your looking for a good one to pass the time at least. control of theyr fate, cause they can see the future, past and everything a person has done when something is about to go wrong lets say an accident, the Sheperd takes action to save that person.

So it ended up being just a backround for their meetings, which I didn't appreciate.The sound and art were mediocre, except from the singing girl, which again didn't have an impact because it wasn't developed correctly.None of the characters had an impact on me in general.

The difference in this was one was that it gave a little something more on the harem plot and it was an interesting story.Story: The story about all of the characters wanting to find themselves and become someone they want to be proud of is nice. Adding the romance on top of it helps it all go together quite nicely and gives something that was enjoyable.Art: The art for this anime was good, I liked the designs of the characters a...good amount and thought everything was visually appealing.Sound: If anything this was the worst part about this anime, the sound quality was not the best, especially at the parts where Misono is singing, the audio seemed to dip more especially then.

The female characters seemed to be well developed characters, especially Kodachi, which got seemingly the most character development despite technically not being the main female role, while on the other hand it seems like Shirasaki didn't really get enough development or background other than the parts with her sister.Overall, I enjoyed watching this anime and I enjoyed the more romance based harem more than the ecchi harem.

I don\'t mean the fake future as in Glasslip but the real future like in Kara no Kyoukai Mirai Fukuin. Well, in the world of Daitoshokan there is a secret Men In Black type organization that wields magic and can guide people to a ""good"" future. This organization of ""shepherds"" takes an interest in our particular protagonist, a bookworm named Kyoutarou, who happens to save an innocent bystander from a horrific future, and ends up conveniently fondling her in front of a massive crowd just for good measure.Daitoshokan is the latest August work to be...turned into an anime following Fortune Arterial. While the shows share some similarities (harem and school based slice of life elements), the story in Daitoshokan is much less organized and builds to a not-so-interesting climax. If you\'re looking for anything above an average slice of life show this is going to disappoint. The overall work is passable but quickly forgettable.Animation:The animation quality is only average at best. The animation isn\'t particularly crisp and backgrounds are bland and have a characteristically painted style. The characters themselves are drawn well with a style that focuses more on moe than maturity. Tsugumi sometimes has this happy carefree look that reminds me of Tenma from School Rumble. Expressions are fair overall but nothing out of the ordinary. The standout character in this show is actually probably the cat. Seriously, the cat has more personality than over half of the supporting cast.There isn\'t much action in this show though, as alluded to in the introduction, there is a fair amount of light ecchi. There isn\'t enough to really tag this overall as ecchi but expect a few suggestive scenes and conversations nonetheless.Sound:The show opens with a light and relatively quick-paced pop piece though the melody isn\'t anything special. The ED is a slightly more memorable piece with a good beat and melody. The BGM is composed of standard fare supportive but forgettable pieces.The VA cast is mixed on this one. Madoka Yonezawa comes from the lead in White Album 2, but unfortunately not in a singing role. A lot of the other VAs are relatively junior and don\'t give their characters a great deal of depth; it\'s not completely their fault though given the nature of the story.Story:Our protagonist is a smart loner who prefers books to the trouble of dealing with others and their facades; he feels that everything to be learned is written in books. This ridiculously naive premise is quickly blown away when the girl he rescues and fondles suddenly asks him to join the ""Happy"" club. Not understanding what could possibly motivate her, Kyoutarou decides to humor her. A few small projects later, the club has grown into a fully-fledged harem for Kyoutarou, plus a useless but obligatory male friend. However, as he grows closer to this new group of friends, he struggles with whether or not to use his future-sight abilities to guide everyone to a ""happier"" future. Will he sacrifice himself to help everyone else?While not necessarily a bad premise to start on, this story tries to tackle too many genres and issues at the same time. Unlike Fortune Arterial where there was a clear, central plot and a primary heroine, this show has multiple tangential stories going on concurrently with different heroines. In addition, the entire secret organization and future-sight ability isn\'t developed in an appealing fashion and fails to involve the viewer to the same degree as the vampire concept in August\'s previous work.The story is a mix between episodic character introductions and generic slice of life school events. There is a random tension introduced around half way through the series that eventually somehow develops into the very unnatural climax. The show then concludes in a copout manner; let\'s just say that I felt as betrayed as the ending to Shana 3.Character:Protagonists in general have gotten a bit better about being slow and overly soft. However, they still are as slow as ever when it comes to love. To make matters worse, the heroines feel rather generic and shallow. Though they each get their own arc, their interactions with the protagonist never feel genuine, and relationship development is all but missing. There is a bit of character development but it\'s spread so thinly between the characters that the value is greatly diminished. As I said before, the cat is probably your best bet for entertainment.Value:Overall, this is an average at best slice of life. The characters lack depth and the story is neither engaging nor focused. This series is one shepherd that the sheep will avoid, and you should too unless you are really out of things to watch. turned into an anime following Fortune Arterial.

The original material is beyond the scope of this review and is not a factor for consideration.Story: The story has an interesting premise but that premise was poorly executed upon. Certain plot points do not make sense by the end of the series while others were outright ignored when it was convenient for the plot to do so. For example, it was an explicit plot point that shepherds do not have books, and thus people forget about them. However, in episode 5, Kakei seemed to have no problem remembering Nagi when everyone else had forgotten who...she was. The most egregious plot hole of all comes at the final conclusion of the story: it was shown that Kakei's book was destroyed, yet somehow Nanai was able to restore it in the final scene. This cheapens the final payoff immensely. There were some minor pacing problems.Character: The characters were quite likeable but their characterisation was somewhat inconsistent: some character traits were forgotten when it was convenient for the plot to do so. There was some decent character development for all of the main cast, though it feels like some characters managed to get more significant/memorable developments compared to others. It's worth nothing that Ikkei got very little in terms of character development in spite of his reasonably large share of screen time. Overall, however, the character interactions were probably what ultimately helped carry the show.Visual: The visual art was perfectly serviceable and unremarkable. The character designs were generally well done, even if somewhat generic. The background art does its job. The animation was perfectly average and even below average in a few places. In particular, there were some uses of CGI in scenes set within the magic Library which are not as well integrated as one would have liked them to be, though it is worth noting that one could also do much worse than what was done here.Audio: The audio was perfectly serviceable and unremarkable. The (Japanese) voice acting was generally well done, though there were no particular standout performances (that the writer could identify). The music generally added to the experience, though there were no standout tracks. The sound effects were unremarkable, but they did their job.Enjoyment: Despite its technical flaws, I actually found the show to be relatively enjoyable - though whether or not it is enjoyable enough for me to rewatch it remains to be seen. I liked the opening theme song and it has ended up on my playlist. I suspect that the original material has much better execution of story and character and is able to avoid many of the problems identified in this review. Overall, this was a mediocre adaptation.Objective Score Breakdown:[1/3] Story[2/3] Character[1/2] Visual[1/2] AudioFinal score of 5 out of 10.Subjective Score Breakdown:[2/4] Story[3/4] Character[3/4] Visual[2/4] Audio[2/4] EnjoymentFinal score of 12 out of 20. she was.

Within the first few minutes, I somehow knew there must be a VN of this somewhere (prior to writing this, I checked, and lo, there it was). You\'ll get the same feeling from ""Shukufuku no Campanella"" or ""Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate"", for instance. Anyway, this class of anime tends to be largely slice-of-life, with a comedic harem romance being the main attraction. Some kind of mystery is hinted at throughout the show, and in the last few episodes, some major plot events...occur, and the hinted conflict is resolved.Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai is, I think, a standard yet high quality addition to this category. It\'s a fairly calm and peaceful slice-of-life, with comedy, harem, and romance undertones. Genre-wise, it is the classic anime school setting, but with a hint of fantasy. Ecchi is present, but the level of such fanservice was not overbearing I felt (I wouldn\'t have minded a bit more even). As a fan of relaxing moe slice of life, and not minding a good old fashioned harem romcom, I felt it was a great watch.The story plays a relatively minor role for the first, say, 6-8 episodes, as the show introduces us to the characters and is basically a slice of life as they grow closer to each other. After that, things grow more dramatic, but were still relatively light-hearted, despite some mature themes subtly appearing. No spoilers, but the sequence of events at the end was actually quite unexpected to me, and the plot turned out to be better crafted than I thought (I will admit my bar for plot isn\'t as high when the ""plot"" is good, but here I swear it\'s ok).Technicals: art and sound are both great. The backgrounds and settings are not highly varied, but fine. There is a place with a lot of 3D CG gears, which was odd, but what really matters is the character art, and I thought the grills looked great.Character-wise, we have a great selection of waifus for the gentleman (or gentlewoman I suppose) connoisseur. There\'s a Genki girl, a studious hard-working more classic Japanese girl, a shy untalented girl doing her best, a *very* well-endowed tsundere-light, and an ultra-talented singer struggling with the pressure that brings. I will note that these are actually not as stereotyped tropes as one would expect: no tsundere loli, no classic osananajimi, no megane-wearing bookworm. Furthermore, these characters are not so simple, in my opinion, to be encapsulated with such brevity. Why the genki girl acts the way she does, for example, is actually explained for once. Of course, in such a short series, the characters are not as well developed as one would prefer, though I\'m sure they are fleshed out in other mediums. Nevertheless, I didn\'t find them too lacking and didn\'t dislike any of them.In the standard categories, I\'d put this one as follows:- Moe: medium- Comedy: medium-low- Drama: medium-low- Action: low- Romance: medium- Harem: medium-high- Ecchi: medium-lowIn terms of moe, I felt pretty warmly about most of the grills. Often, there are one or two members of a standard harem that I don\'t really like, but here not so much. There are tender moments for all of them, and in the end, you really feel they did a good job making them relatable, dynamic, and kawaii.I\'ve put the drama and comedy mid to low, because they are not the focus of the show, though they are present. I never found the drama cringy and it was always very short. The comedy was always present; I laughed often but not continuously. In terms of action, there\'s a little fantasy-style action at the end, but not much.For ecchi, the fanservice is mostly just the girls themselves, not anything specific they are doing, and is not particularly out of place in their environment. There are rather few situations that I would say are effective ecchi fanservice. However, there were a few moments that made my, uh, eyebrows rise, so it gets a medium-low.Finally, for romance, the series largely stays in the *blush* phase. Some further developments happen near the end, however. This is also why I\'ve put harem at medium-high instead of high, because an explicit one never forms: instead, we have only the (strong) beginnings of a potential one. I felt that the ending was somewhat open (something I do not always mind): while one girl (the best) was sort of seemingly chosen, it was a bit implicit.Overall, I think it\'s best to view this as a slice-of-life first, harem romance second, and ecchi comedy third, with a final dash of mystery-fantasy. The quality of the art, cute characters, and acceptable story make this a fine addition to the VNy genre.

The characters, though uninspired, were cute to watch, and the plot makes you think a little.Overall - 7/10Overall, the show is decent. Not much can be said about a show that had its plot rushed within the second half of a series that is only 12 episodes. Its a decent slice of life series at the most."", 'As someone who read (most) of the original visual novel it was based on and wasn\'t a huge fan... this anime adaptation of Daitoshokan no Hitsujikai was... mildly better, but barely?Anime adaptations of visual novels (and well adaptations of anything) tend to mostly be used for advertising the original visual novel, and at least for me this anime was mostly better for one thing: actual good pacing. (if a bit fast at times)The main problems I had with the visual novel were that it too slow paced, even for a slice of life heavy visual novel, AND most of the characters were boring. I could...take maybe one of these issues if a VN eventually gets good but having both made the original VN a struggle.Thankfully the anime had the decency to skim past a lot of the cringe stuff of the original visual novel like forcing the MC to crossdress multiple times, Nagis obnoxious humor, and Ureshino\'s dumb ""femdom loli"" tendencies.The anime also competently gets the main characters\' personalities down well and adapts SOME of their backstory melodrama into the plot. They at least introduce the library clubs goals, introduces the Shepard magic, and has a clear beginning, middle, and end and ties up things well for a 12 episode anime. One of the big flaws I had with the original visual novel was how long it took to even introduce the Shepard ""magic"", especially since you had to finish a side route to see more.However, despite the improvements the anime made, they can\'t fix a lot of issues I just have with Daitoshokan as a story no matter the medium. As said earlier, I think the characters are mostly forgettable archetypes. Most are at least not bad (outside Nagi who I find more annoying more often than not), and at least have kinda interesting backstories, but I just don\'t care much due to their incredibly basic personalities. The only character I legit like was Kanasuke (which thankfully seems to be the majority opinion). She is very goofy and has by far the most interesting backstory. The anime may make it seem like the characters\' backstories were rushed but honestly... they were also THAT short in the original.I think the story in general would just be better if it focused much on these character focused backstories instead of a mediocre mix of those plus this Shepard magic plot that had a really boring pay off, both in the VN AND Anime. Instead we got a half-assed mix of both along with mostly mediocre characters. If it weren\'t for the anime\'s fast pacing, I would likely have dropped the anime.However, one big flaw with the anime specifically... is the weird way they implemented the harem romance. In the original visual novel, there were proper buildup about how the main girls have feelings for the main characters but only get their dramatic romantic payoff in their respective routes. In the anime? It implements A LOT of these romantic payoff scenes including multiple kissing scenes but the main character Kakei never really 100% chooses a girl by the end. The anime mildly prefers Tsugumi, but there\'s so many scenes where I\'d be like ""wait but she kissed him but now there\'s romantic tension with this other girl now?"". Sadly this flaw is partially due to the visual novel\'s structure and the animations clearly trying to keep the spirit of it, but imo they should have just went all in on the Tsugumi romance ending since the animator\'s clearly preferred her.Overall, the anime adaptation of this story is watchable, but it can\'t really fix many of the flaws I had with the original outside pacing.

As it went on further and more episodes passed, so did my ratings of this show as i felt it showed plot holes.The idea seems a good story, guardian angels of a sort are working in the background to give humanity its best chance without people ever knowing, yet somehow can email people and interact with them, even admitting they are these people with no actual oversight.As time goes on we see these guardian angels willing to sacrifice one person, for another, and to...me, I felt that went against the theme of the story, although it was made clear early on, the willingness to help those who will make a bigger difference, it felt off, how much they would potentially damage the future(which they see as already set), despite this anime proving otherwise as is always a butterfly effect, which they paid little heed too.Then after about 8 episodes of hearing how shepherds these guardian angels are public, the MC gets told, Shepherds have to be kept secret.lol.   It just seemed stupid on that level.We also see all these girls fall harem style, for the guy who has suddenly changed his personality set for years, where he sticks to just his 1 friend.   Yet suddenly he is outgoing away from his books in a total personality transplant,   Add the usual harem of girls who like him, but have no idea why, get brushed off by him to a degree, and he doesn't pay attention to them outside the club duties and says the aloof-ness of the harem man.   Sadly, it just didn't add up.    It was your typical generic school harem, which is poorly nothing new, outside the shepherds.So although the idea of the story was intriguing, how it was carried out was poor, the art was ok, sound ok, we didn't know much about the characters backgrounds unsurprisingly for what i am guessing is a filler anime, and it just added together to a dissapointing bad to average anime. me, I felt that went against the theme of the story, although it was made clear early on, the willingness to help those who will make a bigger difference, it felt off, how much they would potentially damage the future(which they see as already set), despite this anime proving otherwise as is always a butterfly effect, which they paid little heed too.Then after about 8 episodes of hearing how shepherds these guardian angels are public, the MC gets told, Shepherds have to be kept secret.lol.

It\'s not really a standout, and to be honest, doesn\'t use the themes and idea\'s very effectively. The idea that a Shepard can see the future, was only used about twice in the show. It would\'ve been better if that feature was touched on a bit more, and it\'s kind of a let down that it wasn\'t. A Good Librarian has fun characters, and the first episode was actually a great introduction. But, after that, it just wasn\'t the same. Even though the Shepard idea was cool, the significance of one just lurks in the shadow. The big ""twist""...is just eh, and kind of a throwaway. HOWEVER...""Large Breasts are merely lumps of fat.

Where the hell should i start??? i still have some remnants of overexcitement & jumping out of the chair moments that i had some hard time to hold me and my childhood in check( yes i was i in my inmagination a fucking young prat again, just like in the happyer days).Toei animation once again shows me why that studio is my #1 fav. by showing traces of stuff what they can do best and what has famed/immortalised them for in the anime world, and thats has been a standard for them since 1984( hokuto no...ken) wich made them notable ofc and so on.Bandai co. was back then a big distributor and giver of ( in partnership with toei amongs other studio's) videogames based of populair serie's and merchandise, and had partnerships with developers like sqare enix, wich is since 2003 called squaresoft i believe and namco.Dragonquest is still one of toei most beloved and prominent products ever since 1986 ( it started out on the Famicon, EU had the nintendo modified for the market, and the PC-Engine system wich is mostly unknown outside Japan) and has been seen as one of the first RPG franchises, little before Shin megami tensei(1987- ongoing) or the Final Fantasy series ( 1987 ongoing)or the breath of fire serie's ( 1989-??) to name a couple. sadly i've only played some old rpg but never the first release of the serie's.The story itself give's WAY more than the summary says i mean omg shit became intense halfway through!! and remember , its LOOSLY based so it means than some elements and /or npc's dont even appear in the game itselfbut does not take away the potential of what it could do more and adds a extra taste to it in following the 'Rpg guideline, the further u get and more levels u unlock, the harder the enemies and terrain unlock special artifacts , meeting new charachters, upgrade items  ect.ect.Animationwise, if Dragonball never exsisted, there would never been  Dragonquest, like 2 drops of water.The soundtracks itself fits , but gets repeated a lot during action scene's.If we imagined to take a peek inside goku's head what he is dreaming about  to be a legendary hero in a fantasy world we got this:Abel=GokuYoung abel = 13 year ol gohanMokomoko =YasirobiSlime ( the onion like creature's abel has a blue one) he calls ChiChiBaramos the devil= Hatchiyack from the DBZ ova  plans to eradicate the sayians ovaTobi = a long silverhaired trunksJikoku= a demonlike overambitious impression of vegetajust to name a few.i enjoyed the fullest out of this show and is a FREAKIN DISGRACE that it never had a official DVD release outside japan, yeah keeping the best shit for themself alright ):Overall, i would watch it all over again because it appears as a kidshow but it give's a very colourfull and dark aspect in itself , and its damn funny plus its is one show that makes a lot memorable thanks to a lot of positive factors!!!I LOOOVE DRAGONQUEST!!!!

u got + 1 up life"", ""This show was surprisingly enjoyable for something that has not necessarily aged very gracefully. Not to insult it, but the animation and art consistency was a bit budget at times.I would recommend this to any fantasy/adventure fans, even if you are not big on Dragon Quest specifically. It is very much a product of its time but I found myself genuinely surprised at some of the directions the story went in when my initial opinion was that it would be a super generic spin off anime to make money off the games popularity when it was beginning to really take off as a series.Besides...the budget feel from time to time, my biggest problems were that it had a slow start and how magic works in this world. Most good adventure stories start off a bit slow, so I get that, but this was my second attempt to watch this and didn't really get into it till around episode 15ish I believe. My first attempt being back when DQ9 first came out, and between it being hard to find and super slow in the beginning, I just gave up. So if you are not feeling it completely, I don't think I can blame you for not wanting to stick with it.The other thing is magic healing is super inconsistent, which I feel is somewhere between a nit pick and a legit issue with the story at times. It really just comes down to what the plot demands at the moment.So, like I said, if you like adventure stories I would say check it out. It is no Record of Lodoss War, but it really was surprising how well it turned out and how much it succeeded in translating the feel of an RPG adventure into an anime. the budget feel from time to time, my biggest problems were that it had a slow start and how magic works in this world.

Dream Festival! R,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34552/Dream_Festival_R,"['Compared to the first season, there is some improvement as found in Dream Festival! R. Sadly, though, the improvements only apply for the secondary issues. The primary issues --the issues desperately in need for improvements-- are still pretty much intact.Let\'s start with the good points. For this second season, the art is definitely better. The characters are more animated, making their body language seem fluid and their facial expressions more engaging. Moreover, the Dorika element is better utilized this time around. While it seemed like in the first season the Dorika element occasionally felt forced and unnecessary, this time around it seems like Bandai Namco...Pictures had become so much more confident, the Dorika manages to become both magical and sensible.Now with the bad points. This is supposed to be the point of redemption for Bandai Namco Pictures to polish the main protagonist, Amamiya Kanade, from being too much of a blank canvas to being a proper center of the entire narrative. Unfortunately, lack of character developments makes Kanade even worse than a blank canvas: it is as if the studio commanded, ""Look. This is the hero of the story so you HAVE TO like him!"" Additionally, the introduction of brand new supporting characters ultimately does not deliver the spice this series had needed to make things more interesting. Another disappointing point is the development of KUROGANE. While in the first season this unit was the proper antithesis of DearDream, the overall ""let\'s-be-friends-forever"" vibe of the whole second season manages to neuter KUROFUNE\'s edge. Finally, we have that horrifying series finale-slash-recap episode.At the end of the day, I decided to score the same grade for Dream Festival! R as its predecessor\'s, Dream Festival! At least with the unfortunate balance between the interesting and the disaster, both seasons manage to feel cohesive and it does make it better for the audience\'s experience to watch both seasons as one inseparable package. However, does this anime require the third season?

Gekitou! Crush Gear Turbo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3012/Gekitou_Crush_Gear_Turbo,"[""Allow me to share my thoughts on Crush Gear, Battle of Toy Cars. Rare in anime, but 90% of the main characters are cocky asses. Kyousuke is very inch and cocky, the shrimpy kind that thinks he's pro because he knows more about cars than you. Kuroudo is prideful and cocky. He hates to lose because losing is traumatizing to his pride. Takeshi is super cocky because he thinks he's the strongest. He's the kind that always look down on you as a noob until you defeat him. So in this anime, Kouya is the noob beginner that need to keep up to the abilities...of everyone else. He becomes a crybaby when he loses a battle he thinks will win. But it is always the noob that works the hardest. On a occasion, Kouya ripped his hand ligaments when launching the car to have more thrusting speed. His hand was wrapped in bandages later. Every match is a real challenge so there's no way he can be cocky. Aside from the characters, the battles were really good. Losing car sometimes gets smashed up bad, there is no mercy in this anime. 100 X rougher than Beyblade. This is one heck of a anime. of everyone else.

Cause after watching Pokemon, I never got the feeling of wanting to own my own real life Pokemon, opinions vary among people here, but not me. I like Pokemon, but a real life Pokemon partner is too much. Maybe use them to do work as workers, or fantasize going to Pokemon world, but never to bring life-sized Pokemon to real world. Hope I'm not being too confusing :P Same thing with Yu-Gi-Oh. I mean maybe some people want...Duel Monsters in real life, but they're just going to be holograms and it looks more amazing in anime. Besides it's kinda stupid if an epic monster in real life is for games ^^ Crush Gear is different because after seeing the anime, I wanted one of those epic life-sized Crush Gear cars for real life. Not as toys, but size of real cars. Drive around and maybe cause some destruction. Or maybe take it for a high speed drive in the empty desert and smash some rocks. Or maybe have real life Crush Gear fights, but that would be dangerous so not a good idea. Crush Gear was just so appealing to me it went into my imagination.

Lots of jazz and fancywork present in fights. Crush Gear you shouldn't miss this at all.Ok now I talk about my personal preferences. Before I begin, I let you know, the equipped weapons are at the front of a car. My favorite would be Kuroudo's car. It has a spinning drill as...a weapon that would pierce, and sizzle down anything on impact. The drill's long, thin, high speed spinning shape is a puncturing force. Second would be Kyousuke's car. It has two weapons, a pair of double, razor sharp spinning sawblades that would slice and mow anything down, Kyousuke's car is the most epic car! Kouya's car for the weapon is a sword, the car itself is a knight design, His car has the weakest weapon, no match for the others whose are much stronger.

Kouya wants to revive the Tobita club, and although he's not bad, he's a brat, noob, and underachiever. The better player he recruits, Kuroudo, Kyousuke, both who are no shows at training, would abandon Kouya at times, and at times too I wish they would stick with that. In battle, the 2 of them are far more interesting than Kouya, but its still a shame though when facing stronger opponents, they would win by outmaneuvering rather than hitting head on. That's why I root for Takeshi because of his...OPness. Only Takeshi's car Gaiki shows that much raw power with his steamroller car hitting head on and destroying. He needs more screentime to replace Kouya, it would only strengthen the show and make for a super good battle. OPness.

While I did like the main story for Euphonium and it was straightforward as it could be, the thing I felt was missing was a lack of humor or characters that I could personally relate to. The shorts cover the characters in wacky situations, I had a couple of laughs from them. I've come to love the main characters after watching these shorts TBH, and those who haven't watched them should do so after watching the first season to fill in that humor gap lacking in the main story. "", ""I don't normally watch TV specials whether it be due to laziness or not wanting to watch it. However I was bored so I just decided to check out this series of specials.What this is is basically a bunch of misadventures with the characters of Hibike! Euphonium. None of the episodes have anything to do with each other and plot is non existant though some of the episodic stories were decent.

But I guess they were pretty funny and worth watching for fans of the main series."", 'To summarise, this series of specials for the first season of Hibike Euphonium creates a more lighthearted take on the anime that preceded it, which was certainly lacking in the typical humour or nonchalance compared to most other KyoAni titles - the Wind Ensemble symphonise, rather than choogle. While there’s nothing wrong with employing such a tone, easing the mood with some specials like these is a welcome addition, especially seeing as there’s only seven of them, two minutes in length each, ED included, and so there’s not a huge amount that can really be conveyed in such a short span of time, but, a...good job was done with the limited tools they were given. As far as minisode spinoffs with a greater emphasis on comedy than their main series go, I’ve seen better ones, but I really haven’t got much to complain about regarding these specials, the animation quality is of the same standard as the rest of Hibike Euphonium, and the characters are as well written as they always have been, so, in conclusion, this suffices, I wouldn’t call it mandatory viewing, but if you want something with a total runtime of 19 minutes that enhances your overall Hibike experience, this does a perfectly good job of precisely that. good job was done with the limited tools they were given.

Euphonium: Suisougaku-bu no Nichijou is a hilarious series of short clips that can be enjoyed by anyone in just one sitting, regardless of having watched or not watched Hibike! Euphonium. The series is extremely short, with no episode being longer than three minutes, so as a result this review will also be very short.Usually my first paragraph would be a story summary, but Hibike! Euphonium: Suisougaku-bu no Nichijou is a seven-episode miniseries of non-episodic events, making a summary very difficult. Usually each clip follows Kumiko, Hazuki, and Sapphire with the ending being Hazuki surprised by something that Reina does, such as playing a C...on her Trumpet. There isn’t too much to summarize but the series is less than twenty minutes in length, so it isn’t too hard to watch it in one sitting.I rather enjoyed this short series quite a lot. The joke with Reina and the end of a few episodes made me laugh each time and I loved to get to see a small snippet into the lives of a few members of the band. The lack of an intro or end credit song is unfortunate but the music that is present is already good on its own so that slightly makes up for it. There isn’t too much else I could say on this show, in the sense of praise.I do unfortunately have a few complaints, but nothing too bad. As I stated before, I didn’t enjoy the lack of an intro or outro but that is understandable due to the length of each episode. Besides that point, the animation was a lot less present than in the main series, which is understandable because this series was made in between episodes for the main show.I know I didn’t have too much to say, but I really did enjoy this short series and would recommend it to anyone, even if they haven’t seen Hibike! Euphonium. The episodes are actually more like a teaser that people interested in Hibike!

If you like those genres then you should definitely check this one out.  Allow me to break it down for you...STORY 7/10- Other than the story behind the main character's arrival we don't have much of a plot, which is fine given the anime's episodic nature which I personally find fitting for a comedy.  There are numerous strong ecchi scenes which an outspoken population of anime viewers find distasteful,  but I generally look at it as another form of...comedy since my typical reaction is to laugh when I see vulgar acts groping and molestation.  It all depends on your taste.ART 7/10- Everything was drawn well, characters were cute in my opinion.  Nothing particularly amazing, but it was all in good taste.SOUND 8/10- Voice acting was great, a lot of big hitters in the cast: Toyosaki Aki (Shugo Chara, K-ON!), Horie Yui (Higurashi,Umineko), Kugimiya Rie (Gintama, Saki), and though not as popular but one of my personal favorites Hirohashi Ryou (Kaleido Star, Bamboo Blade).  I must say though, pretty much all these roles are in the shadow of the work that you may find in these fine actors' resumes.  Great nonetheless though.  I also greatly enjoyed the song for the ED credits... Yahoooo! : )CHARACTERS 8/10- Our main character is someone you feel very sorry for, which is where this show draws some of it's comedy.  Some people might think that that's a horrible thing, but it's not as cruel as it may have been suggested and I personally saw the humor in it.  The supporting cast are all very like-able, distinctive characters including a chief who for some unexplained reason is a small child that has the maturity of a 30 year old, a perverted drunk, a lesbian couple and someone who collects money (or something like that.  She wasn't in the spotlight much) all female and all moe-tastic!ENJOYMENT 8/10- I was always excited about this one.  It's funny, charming and sentimental (and slightly explicit).

Character design is pretty cute, and the vivid coloring was nice though. Some outdoor scenes had a decent atmosphere using blurring techniques, but overall, lacking detail.Sound: 3/10Extremely poorly done and annoying voice acting. Perhaps it\'s my personal preference, but voicing of all the young girls sounded strained and tiring after couple of episodes.Music/OP/ED were bland, and didn\'t really stand out.Story: 8/10Despite the technical flaws in this series, the story was extremely strong. Kana slowly...learns the job, and gets along with fellow workers while facing various obstacles of the tough delivery job. What really impressed me, was the focus of this story. Even though Kana is a middle-schooler, there were very few scenes in her junior high school, and very limited school life. Her classmates appear only to develop the story, and does not deviate the central theme of this anime, which is delivering newspapers. Use of Kana\'s \'memo\' to grandma was also a very effective device for narration.Character Development: 5/10Kana\'s character was developed fairly well from a hopeless new recruit to an unreliable yet vital existence in the team. She slowly found her place in the \'big family\'.Sadly, the side characters were all overly predictable and lacked depth. In fact, all the coworkers can be characterized under two words.Saki: Chibi adultHinata: CheapYume: Rich lesbianYuuki: Quiet lesbianHaruka: Drunk pervertKujiin Mika: Tsundere.Interaction with these side characters were always same: Kana is molested by Haruka, Hinata or Saki shows up and violently stops it, while Yume and Yuuki are making out in the back. The producers persistently pushed these developments long after they stopped being funny.Enjoyment: 5/10I haven\'t seen the manga (as usual), but ""Kanamemo"" was clearly a failed attempt in anime adaption. The story and setting was good, but overall it was extremely poorly executed. It was neither slapstick nor drama.One thing I really enjoyed though, was the \'finding small joys in life\' aspect of the story, but otherwise, this series had very little to offer.

Not terribly offended by yuri? (PROTIP: Yuri doesn\'t have an everlasting effect, there is little to mild yuri hinted here, may be disturbing but most of the time it is quite used in a comical sense)Then Kanamemo is easily one of the newer ones I would recommend to you. Remember though, that this is a very hit-or-miss thing. What you would benefit from, is to not think of it hugely as a comedy series but instead as a simple slice of life series...that is, very easily, a simple slice of life series.It has got the light-hearted atmosphere that some animes aim for but fail miserably at like it was nothing and it virtually looked like the crew didn\'t even try making it light-hearted, it was as if it was naturally light-hearted. Compared to some animes that force themselves to look so.Never put a huge expectation up for this anime for most of the time you will be disappointed.Of course I had an overall expectation of 8/10 and I did not walk away saying,""I am disappoint."", I instead just closed my video player and told myself how great I am by finishing an anime and did a backflip (lacking faith in some people\'s sarcasm radar, I will point out I was being sarcastic, seriously).With a very simple starter story of a run-away girl (grandmother passes away, title character runs away, finds new home in this newspaper center, starts life anew with her newer and more ecstatic friends, leaving behind her old life, although not completely) and an aftermath that doesn\'t even look much like a plot, there is as much worth to rating this plot as there is to rating Lucky Star\'s or even telling a refrigerator to make instant curry out of thin air.The soundtrack, is as of now, an unknown quantity to me. I haven\'t had a chance to properly listen to it. Most of the times, I don\'t get to listen to it properly (as I had done with Toradora!, which had a fantastic OST I still listen to today) unless it\'s in some way very attractive or the BGM was made much louder than the talking seiyuu (e.g Honey & Clover and CLANNAD\'s soundtrack caught my attention in not 10 minutes) so I don\'t deem myself too worthy to check on it yet.Its humour, although not sporadic throughout the whole series and not roll-around-die-laughing humourous, is quite enjoyable. It is very easy to see that some people will complain that its humour is totally non-existent and there are others who\'d laugh at it without stop, either way, stuff like this are usually pretty hit-or-miss, but more hit than miss. To be honest, if you wanted a guarantee, it\'s not as hit-or-miss to most as Lucky Star or Bakemonogatari, that\'s for sure.With jokes that aren\'t at all original, Kanamemo still manages to deliver funny lines every now and then. Sometimes it gets me laughing or it gets me in the cold.Of course besides the joke itself, intonation is a pretty big factor and in anime, intonation is pretty much the characters. Speaking of the characters, it holds a pretty big all-girls cast with what I could say a great seiyuu line-up (brushing off a certain Tsundere Queen aside, since some people seem to have gotten sick of her).The cast (pretty much ALL cliched) are comprised of a timid little girl, also title character Kana, \'cheapskate\' type-girl (although this isn\'t hugely shown by her daily attitude but is shown in scene) Hinata, strict-elementary-schooler-boss-but-never-blushing-tsundere Saki, the hyperactive Yume, her quiet companion + requited female love-interest, Yuuki and some yuri-craving/loving drunkard Haruka along with a later-introduced character, a pink-haired tsundere, Mika. Personally though I like Hinata the most as the rest are rather much more bland than her in general. And I never grew to LOVELOVELOVELOVE Kugimiya Rie Tsunderes™ either, aside from.. Toradora\'s? No never mind.Might not seem so loveable to you does it?Of course this again represents my plain saying of how hit-or-miss this show has been. I for one, like it. Simply because it\'s pretty easy to read, to understand, to pretty much just do anything. If I had to use a metaphor, it\'s as easy to understand as it is to see something.Views may vary, that\'s very obvious and here and there there will definitely be critics but really, I never did expect too much, and got what I wanted, if not marginally surpassed.So Kanamemo is definitely a title I would recommend to you (depending on who you are) if you said yes to either of my first questions. that is, very easily, a simple slice of life series.It has got the light-hearted atmosphere that some animes aim for but fail miserably at like it was nothing and it virtually looked like the crew didn\'t even try making it light-hearted, it was as if it was naturally light-hearted.

It\'s not bad, but has a few bumps in the road. Could be better, but for what it is you should have fun if you enjoy SoL/Comedies in general.Story: 4What story? There is barely a story if you can call it one. The main character Kana\'s parents have passed and she was in the care of her grandmother who soon passed and now she is homeless and looking for work. She ends up finding a place to work and live, but it\'s filled with eccentrics and quite the busy place. Her...new found job is working as a papergirl delivering news to the neighborhood daily. This is the over-arcing story and all the rest is in a typical SoL episodic fashion. It\'s more or less cute girls doing cute things, but there is still some merit to this show despite the lack of plot.Note* There is one episode centered around going to a public bath and it\'s heavily censored with a comical cat face. May or may not affect the enjoyment of the series, just a warning. Pretty fanservicey and feels like an OVA instead of an actual episode.Art: 7The art isn\'t bad, but not particularly good either. Nothing much stands out. I do enjoy the soft pallet of colors they use in general and the way it\'s colored and shaded adds very nicely to the laid back atmosphere. Animation is average at best, this is a SoL so expect stills and scenes without much animation as its very dialog heavy. Aesthetically it is pleasing, but nothing you\'ll be likely to remember.Sound: 7The sound is a mixed bag for me. I personally dislike the main character\'s voice as it is at least to me somewhat annoying. The rest were pretty average to me, and that\'s not surprising considering this is mostly a comedy and SoL where they aren\'t trying to captivate you emotionally, so it is acceptable; and suits the atmosphere. Sound effects are pretty average themselves, not deviating from the norm either. Music I found was a bit better than most. There is one theme that is constantly used for most scenarios (Mainly a flute/recorder That mixes well with the show.) and its gotten stuck in my head, so if nothing else it\'s catchy. Don\'t expect anything too much from the OP or ED because both are pretty average; SoL fitting themes.Character: 7This is the main catching point for this show and what gives it an edge over other shows in the genre. They use tropes that we all know of and have probably seen a handful of times, but executes them in a fresh feeling way. Not to mention this is the first time I saw a comedyesque show take a homosexual relationship seriously, without forcing it more than is necessary. They portray them extremely casually and never put an emphasis on ""HOLY SHIT GIRLS KISSING WTF/BBQ!!!???!1 LOOK HOW EDGY OMG"" (AHEM, Sakura Trick...) There is usually a joke about them every other episode but it\'s almost always lighthearted.We have the other characters that don\'t show much development or change outside the main, but none the less are all likeable. And since this is primarily a comedy that\'s OK. Their tropes are what set up certain jokes and changing from them too much would endanger the fun aspect since this show should be taken with a chill pill anyway. The only character I absolutely couldn\'t stand was Haruka (The child molester essentially.) because she was just so effing annoying, and the joke of her messing with Kana got old quick.Enjoyment/Overview 9/7Kanamemo does everything by doing nothing, and has a few redeeming values. One of few SoL\'s I deem as something you should watch. While it isn\'t inherently great it has it\'s pluses that give it a pretty enjoyable feel. Something to be watched passively and without much thought because it is in essence just plain fun.

If you don\'t, however, while at times the comedy can be very crude and ""slapsticky"" the series is very much in the style of ARIA.

Kana, upset and frightened panics and packs her things immediately and sets on her way to find a place to live. She ends up working for a newspaper delivery “place”; room and board are provided, just as long as you can do the work! So it’s a quite the sad start, but worry not! The actual anime is very happy...and very fun and really super adorable and cute. BEWARE: This anime contains some ecchi scenes such as a bathing scenario and things; there is also a character who is quite perverse.For the girls, it’s rather interesting. We have Kana, our new comer, she’s inexperienced, naïve, gullible and an incredibly nice middle school girl. There is Haruka, the college student who drinks a lot of sake (A LOT), she also happens to be a lolicon and will try to grope and feel Kana any chance she gets. We have the yuri couple Yume and Yuuki, Yume is rather codependent on Yuuki and Yuuki is in total love for Yume, in-fact Yuuki prefers knowing that Yume needs to rely on her because they can be together forever; there is a lot of implied sexual acts between them and they tend to have very cute yuri moments between each other, such as cute pecks on the cheek or hugging and holding each other and even kissing. They’re a super cute couple and it’s really fun to watch them get all lovey dovey with one another. Saki is the chief, she runs the newspaper organization and the best way to describe her is to think of Renge from Non Non Biyori, then add a whole ton more cute to her character! The last girl (I know I said 6, think of her as a + 1) is Mika. She’s also another middle school girl; she’s very tsundere and has a super crush on Kana. The yuri potential between them is huuuuuuge, but it’s never really expanded upon since Kanamemo is more about growing up and slice of life for Kana herself. Mika is funny though, her tsun side and dere side are often at conflict with one another and it creates some amazingly funny scenes to watch and experience.The stories are cute, it’s episodic and they tend to deal with issues that Kana may be going through, though the girls she works with are always there to help her. We have many clichéd anime stories, but even at this stage of watching anime, I still find them to be fun and honestly, Haruka + co make the entire anime so much fun to watch, full of great laughs and heartfelt moments. All the girls get a large portion of screen time, aiding us in understanding their motives and feelings towards one another, even Saki, who’s very serious and is all about making money and getting new subscribers, has some very soft sides to her that are shown incredibly well.Art is incredibly soft. It’s peaceful to look at and everyone is drawn in a way that it feels like everyone is rather dreamy. The lines are soft, the background art is soft and cute, the girls are drawn well and animated well too, it’s a cute anime to watch and you can tell from the second you start watching that it’s very very very cute. The colors aren’t pastel, not overtly vibrant either, rather, they’re just colorful and soft enough to give pleasant smiles to the viewers; the combination of it all works so well that you can’t help but feel at peace with the ongoing commotion in Kanamemo, a job well done if you ask me. (Soft soft soft, I couldn’t have used that word more!) The reaction faces for Kana are simply amazing and will make you laugh so hard, they’re unbelievable and truly funny.Music is surprisingly enough, very good! OP and ED though are amazing, full of energy and happiness and being over all super cute and mega fun. The BGM is well executed and the sounds are done well enough too. Seiyuu are your very moe, super cute type of seiyuu, expect to be battered by the constant cuteness of Kana’s voice and Mika’s voice, just hit after hit after hit until your heart just explodes with “AHHHHHHH, Kana you’re so cuuuuute!!!” Yeah, it’s really good.Kanamemo is great fun and I enjoyed my time with it 100%, would recommend if you’re looking for a cute slice of life/coming of age type of story, though keep in mind about the ecchi things that Kanamemo has. and very fun and really super adorable and cute.

The characters and very likeable and realistic. One of my personal favorite aspects of this show is that there is a girl x girl couple, but they're not there just for the sexual appeal, yuri, or fanservice aspect many other girl x girl couples are. So, kudos to you, Kanamemo. :)Art: The art in this series wasn't anything special, really, but it was in no way an eyesore. It was your typical animation, with bright colors and soft backgrounds. While it was nice, it didn't leave any major lasting impressions on me, unlike...other shows, like Attack on Titan (the backgrounds), or Puella Magi Madoka Magica (also backgrounds).Sound: A personal favorite episode of mine was episode four, where the entire cast performs several songs for the viewer, all of which I found hilarious and have since searched for again. Other than that, the soundtrack wasn't memorable, though the ending and opening were very catchy, and have earned a place on my playlist.Character: The characters, as I touched on earlier, were very well written, likable, and memorable. The viewer can see relationships forming between each character, and each episode showed more development of the main character, Kana.Enjoyment: This show was a nice break from all the other dramas, horrors, and generally sad shows I'd watched prior to this one. It was very sweet and innocent (to some point, considering the actions another character, Haruka, exhibits), and, if/when another season comes out, I would definitely watch it.Overall: Kanamemo was great. It was a likable show, with likable characters, and some catchy and memorable songs.

And what i think of this show as a whole is one of the hardest things to judge ever due to some episodes being extremly funny while i literally fell asleep during other episodes. But i will try to review the story, characters, animationStory: the story is based around a girl named Kana who just lost her grandma and in search for a place stumble on a newspaper were the other characters are living so she start to live there  and from there it\'s the typical slice of life story were each episode is...individual.

Another Robert\'s Too Late Review coming down! As always, synopsis, minor spoilers maybe, yada, yada. Today we\'re going to be looking at the interesting case of Kanamemo. This anime is very interesting in that I discovered it via recommendations that don\'t really fit the style and type that this anime holds. I\'ll not deny my enjoyment of ecchi and yuri anime genres, and I came to Kanamemo via recommendations about it being one or the other. The thing is, only one character fits the ecchi side of things, and not in any kind of good way, and...the yuri aspects are limited to that same character we\'ll discuss, and a lesbian couple that are smaller parts of the overall cast. Let\'s talk about now, if this show works as a slice of life comedy, and about the overall series in general, and answer the age-old question as to if this anime rates a place on the Great Wall of RTLR fame.Story: 7I liked the story for the most part, which is firmly in the slice of life category, with the homeless Kana finding a place first to stay, then a place to call home, in the newspaper office. Most episodes deal with issues that Kana has to face and is framed around her speaking to her now deceased grandmother and assuring the woman\'s soul that she is learning to make it on her own. The episodes are for the most part self contained, maybe having slight references to the previous one, which of course is a common things among the slice of life genre. Some of the stories are simple, like going to the public bath for the first time, or the first time Kana weathers a bad storm and power outage with her coworkers, who tell ghost stories and scare Kana out of her wits. This bite sized set works well, and keeps the story from bogging down.If you are looking for something meaty to hold your interest, then pass on, that\'s not to be found here. In fact there is room for them to have done more with the story than what was done. The Fate series, this is *not*. That\'s okay, as one doesn\'t have to have a Game-of-Throne-ish level of story complexity for enjoyment. Some people even prefer simpler, cleaner stories, believe it or not! What we get here is a young girl who faces a new problem at the beginning of each episode, and resolves it by the end with a hopeful prayer to her grandmother.Art: 4I did not care for the art form at all. The coloring is agreeable, but the style isn\'t my bag for sure. I can\'t put a single word down on the problem, just that the art doesn\'t seem as expressive as it could be, the lines are too simplistic for the most part, and this makes some of the supporting cast seem a bit wooden. I have heard complaints that the censored version featured overly large grey-out boxes in certain scenes. I have only the uncensored version to go by, but acknowledge that I\'m aware of the issue, and that it\'s reported to be quite overblown, so I\'ll take the word of those that have reported on this, and pass it along for you guys that do watch the censored version.Sound: 5I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the voices are not very well done, and the younger girls\' voices can sound strained and/or make you grimace as they are a bit overdone. Overall, some of them seemed to be going over the top, and the others weren\'t very good matches to the characters they portrayed. The musical aspect felt jarring to me, the themes not seeming like a fair fit to my ears. In fact, I usually skipped the songs.Character: 6Here we go. First off, the entire newspaper is ran by Saki, who appears to be a 10 year old girl. They all call her \'chief\' though she is the chief\'s assistant, she\'s still the highest ranking character we have contact with. She\'s basically an adult (and a jaded one at that) in a little girl\'s body. It\'s a slightly humorous setup for the first few minutes, then the joke wears off. I think the choice to make Saki a child is because there were too many young adult/college aged cast members already, so they didn\'t want another, and to make Saki a possible target for Haruka. Otherwise she could easily been depicted much older without having to lose the hardnosed edge she has, and none of the \'boss humor\' would stop working, like where she\'s often yelling ""pay cuts for everyone!"" This would not have been compromised by her being older.Then we have Yumi and Yuuki, the resident lesbians and where I think some people came to think of this as an \'yuri\' anime. These two are not overtly romantic beyond a few small measures such as momentary jealousy and such. They were often referred to being in the back in their room and being \'busy\'. Considering they live in the same room, sex is the obviously implied event taking place. We are not party to any scenes with them that would show any part of this aspect between the two, nor do we see any real romantic growth between these two either. This is not a yuri anime. It is an anime that features a lesbian couple (and Haruka, we\'ll get to her) that are treated as normally as any other newspaper staff member.Hinata is the real cheapskate of the group, being very stingy with her money most of the time. She\'s not a negative character, however, and is quite likeable in and of herself, just she\'s the resident money hoarder. I found her a little self centered and selfish, but at least that added a layer to her depiction. She\'s not a bad person, just a little more fleshed out than the quiet Yuuki of the lesbian couple who comes across as quite one dimensional.Finally the elephant in the room, the college aged alcoholic perverted (and possibly pedophile) lesbian serial groper, Haruka. This girl is mainly drunk, VERY quick to sexually assault Kana, and even Saki herself. This gets bad enough that the other girls are required to come in and smack Haruka around to get her to stop her lecherous activities. The few times Kana is alone with Haruka, there is tension in the air, and Kana acts like she\'s kind of scared for her innocence if not her life. This is our ecchi character, and the only one to truly engage in lewd acts, hands all over breasts or butts as often as possible, and when she\'s not touching, she\'s fantasizing about sexual encounters with the younger girls. Haruka is played off comedic relief, but most of her actions just come across as utterly creepy.I think I could have knocked the character score a bit more because of Haruka\'s hijinks, but I understand what they were trying to do; they were going for a silly pervert. They just failed, so it was clearly a bad idea.Enjoyment: 7I actually think this show is a bit more than the sum of its parts. Kana is sweet, and her overall story of coming to be self reliant and coming into fitting in with her new newspaper family are enjoyable. Saki is gruff, but even she\'s given an episode that shows her softer side. The characters are thin on attributes, but a lot of the time, they aren\'t really needed to be more than they are. I just can\'t find Haruka all that funny when she\'s drunkenly trying to grope a 10 year old girl.I would cautiously recommend Kanamemo, as it comes together well enough. It has rough edges but if you can look past them, then its a sweet little slice of life with a positive message that life can go on even in the face of loss. I say give it a couple episodes before passing your full judgment on the series. I keep printed pictures of characters from every anime I enjoy on my bedroom walls, so I remember how much I liked those shows. I do recommend Kanamemo, but sadly, she did not make it on my wall. the yuri aspects are limited to that same character we\'ll discuss, and a lesbian couple that are smaller parts of the overall cast.

Do not misunderstand me, it is not up to the aforementioned garbage, but it fails in the most basic and at the same time important thing in a comedy, making people laugh. Although it begins with an argument that could lend itself to something else, the development of the story and characters is excessively superficial (if we can call it development). Again, that wouldn't bother me if the show made me laugh... but it doesn't. The whole show tries to sustain itself based on moe and fanservice...of the most questionable (among them a pedophile woman, who tries to assault the girls of the residence, and it seems that the author thinks it is funny because she is a woman, then not bad). Anyway, if you're really looking for something funny, they have much better things like azumanga daiho, asobi asobase, nichijou, school rumble, among others. Don't waste your time with kanamemo, unless you just want to touch yourself with cartoons and see moe faces every 30 seconds. of the most questionable (among them a pedophile woman, who tries to assault the girls of the residence, and it seems that the author thinks it is funny because she is a woman, then not bad).

It was brought to anime form by feel. One of the studios behind the 4th series of Galaxy Angel, which I\'ll get to eventually & the studio behind Oregairu. It\'s a shoujo-ai slice of life, so it should be pretty firmly within my area of expertise. Let\'s have a look.Story:The plot is simple enough. Young Nakamachi Kana loses her grandmother and finds herself without any relatives to look after her. Fortunately, she manages to find a job at a paper and it comes with boarding. It also comes with a bunch of...quirky co-workers, which results in either completely normal events or shenanigans. As a premise for a slice of life comedy, that\'s fine but the true test lies in the execution.My big issue with the way the comedy is handled goes back to one of Kana\'s co-workers, Haruka. Haruka\'s comedic quirk is based around two things: She drinks a lot and she tries her utmost to molest little girls. That\'s the big ""joke"" with her. And it\'s not funny. At best, it comes across as uncomfortable and cringey. Haruka\'s big scenes are, by a wide margin, the worst part of this series.That being said, a lot of the humour that ignores her character works pretty well and the series does have a lot of funny moments. It goes in some weird directions as well, like having a musical episode but it generally does it well. I also appreciate Kana\'s character arc as she becomes more secure and capable thanks to her determination and the help of those around her, besides Haruka who\'s just interested in groping the thirteen year old. Have I mentioned that Haruka is horribleCharacters:The big flaw in the characters is probably obvious after the preceding discussion. I do have to say, Haruka isn\'t exactly a unique character type. She\'s reminiscent of Akane in Yuru Yuri or Kimura from Azumanga Daioh.\xa0The problem that Kanamemo encounters is that she\'s a much more prominent character than either of those two. You can go episodes without an appearance by Akane or Kimura. You can have episodes where they appear for maybe a minute and the rest of the episode is good. Haruka, in contrast, does something despicable in every single episode. Usually in longish segments.That being said, there are some great characters in this too. We have the love birds, Yume & Yuuki. The two of them are consistently adorable. We also have Hinata, the stingy ronin who\'s trying to get her life together and has a bit of a clueless attitude when it comes to judging others. For example, there\'s a scene where she calls Yume out for being irresponsible. When really, Yume has things together pretty well, certainly better than Hinata. She\'s studying to be a pastry chef, she works hard, she has her bride lined up and their relationship dynamic is pretty well defined. She\'s just weird and can come across as childish. We also have Saki, the strangely serious ""chief"" of the newspaper, who also happens to be in grade school. Then there\'s Mika, an employee at a rival paper with a serious crush on Kana. What I like about her character is just what a genuine portrayal you get of a young teenager\'s awkward first love.One thing I do appreciate about the characters in general is that they\'re shown as having goals and lives outside of the paper. Even Haruka is trying to become a sommelier. Although, in her case, that pretty much just translates to drinking a lot. I also like the way Kana\'s character arc and consequential development are handled. If you exclude Haruka, I also like the dynamics you get with the characters. They work well for comedic purposes and characterisation purposes.All of these characters are shown as having positive aspects to their personalities, except Haruka and negative as well. Which helps make them a bit more rounded. For example, Saki can come across as cold and, possibly too serious, but she also displays genuine concern for her employees. Yume can be childish but she also has a kind heart and tries to bring joy to those around her. Yuuki can be possessive and needy when it comes to Yume but she\'s also a hard worker, loyal and she mitigates her jealous tendencies with understanding.So, if Iwami can write characters this well, why did she just decide not to bother with Haruka?\xa0Inquiring minds want to know.Art:As a whole, the art is fine. It\'s not among the best I\'ve seen, even for the genre, but it\'s passable. The big thing I don\'t really like about it is the way animals are drawn. They\'re portrayed with these tiny, button-like eyes that makes their faces look huge by comparison. Especially when it comes to dogs. One thing that\'s a bit interesting is that the series likes to censor out its potential fan-service with little cat pictures. Which is better than being fan-servicey, but it\'s also kind of bizarre.Sound:Feel did get some strong actresses for this. With excellent performances from Toyosaki Aki, Hirohashi Ryou, Kugimiya Rie, Endou Aya & Mizuhara Kaoru. Even with Haruka\'s actress, Horie Yui, I can\'t fault her performance. She does about as well as anyone could when voicing such a trash character. Hashimoto Yukari\'s music is good. Then again, she\'s done well in every series I\'ve reviewed that used her music. So, no surprise there.Ho-yay:There is a lot and of greatly varying quality. Any time Haruka gets involved, it\'s awful. Yume and Yuuki are the opposite. These two are like really affectionate newly weds and they make for an adorable couple. Any time there\'s a scene of them lying in bed together, sneaking a kiss or just interacting, it\'s fantastic. There\'s also Mika\'s obvious feelings for Kana, Kana\'s friends even notice and use that fact to tease Mika, and some strong indications that they\'re reciprocated.Areas of Improvement:1. Get rid of Haruka. This one is really simple. Haruka single-handedly brings the series down. I would say there are two ways to go with this. The first is to just have one less major character. The second is to replace her with a not despicable character. Maybe a charming womanising girl who isn\'t a rapey paedophile.2. Learn to draw animals. I just really don\'t like the way animal eyes are drawn in this.3. Give us the scene where Mika learns that Johnny is a goldfish. This one, I just think would be really funny and probably cute. So, I\'d like to see it. And I\'m sure someone is going to say ""oh, that\'s in the manga. Just read it."" I intend to check the manga. I\'d still like to see it animated.Final Thoughts:Kanamemo\xa0is one of those series that really works when it\'s doing what it\'s good at. Unfortunately, it also has a massive flaw that really hurts it. And her name is Haruka. Without her, I could say this was great, maybe even fantastic, and whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who likes slice of life. With her, I have to pull back and say it\'s just okay. If you can tolerate Haruka in all her horribleness, you\'ll probably appreciate all the fun, charming moments it does have. And it may be worth watching just for the Yume and Yuuki scenes. So, I\'ll give it a 6/10. quirky co-workers, which results in either completely normal events or shenanigans. As a premise for a slice of life comedy, that\'s fine but the true test lies in the execution.My big issue with the way the comedy is handled goes back to one of Kana\'s co-workers, Haruka. Haruka\'s comedic quirk is based around two things: She drinks a lot and she tries her utmost to molest little girls. That\'s the big ""joke"" with her. And it\'s not funny. At best, it comes across as uncomfortable and cringey. Haruka\'s big scenes are, by a wide margin, the worst part of this series.That being said, a lot of the humour that ignores her character works pretty well and the series does have a lot of funny moments. It goes in some weird directions as well, like having a musical episode but it generally does it well. I also appreciate Kana\'s character arc as she becomes more secure and capable thanks to her determination and the help of those around her, besides Haruka who\'s just interested in groping the thirteen year old. Have I mentioned that Haruka is horribleCharacters:The big flaw in the characters is probably obvious after the preceding discussion. I do have to say, Haruka isn\'t exactly a unique character type. She\'s reminiscent of Akane in Yuru Yuri or Kimura from Azumanga Daioh.\xa0The problem that Kanamemo encounters is that she\'s a much more prominent character than either of those two. You can go episodes without an appearance by Akane or Kimura. You can have episodes where they appear for maybe a minute and the rest of the episode is good. Haruka, in contrast, does something despicable in every single episode. Usually in longish segments.That being said, there are some great characters in this too. We have the love birds, Yume & Yuuki. The two of them are consistently adorable. We also have Hinata, the stingy ronin who\'s trying to get her life together and has a bit of a clueless attitude when it comes to judging others. For example, there\'s a scene where she calls Yume out for being irresponsible. When really, Yume has things together pretty well, certainly better than Hinata. She\'s studying to be a pastry chef, she works hard, she has her bride lined up and their relationship dynamic is pretty well defined. She\'s just weird and can come across as childish. We also have Saki, the strangely serious ""chief"" of the newspaper, who also happens to be in grade school. Then there\'s Mika, an employee at a rival paper with a serious crush on Kana. What I like about her character is just what a genuine portrayal you get of a young teenager\'s awkward first love.One thing I do appreciate about the characters in general is that they\'re shown as having goals and lives outside of the paper. Even Haruka is trying to become a sommelier. Although, in her case, that pretty much just translates to drinking a lot. I also like the way Kana\'s character arc and consequential development are handled. If you exclude Haruka, I also like the dynamics you get with the characters. They work well for comedic purposes and characterisation purposes.All of these characters are shown as having positive aspects to their personalities, except Haruka and negative as well. Which helps make them a bit more rounded. For example, Saki can come across as cold and, possibly too serious, but she also displays genuine concern for her employees. Yume can be childish but she also has a kind heart and tries to bring joy to those around her. Yuuki can be possessive and needy when it comes to Yume but she\'s also a hard worker, loyal and she mitigates her jealous tendencies with understanding.So, if Iwami can write characters this well, why did she just decide not to bother with Haruka?\xa0Inquiring minds want to know.Art:As a whole, the art is fine. It\'s not among the best I\'ve seen, even for the genre, but it\'s passable. The big thing I don\'t really like about it is the way animals are drawn. They\'re portrayed with these tiny, button-like eyes that makes their faces look huge by comparison. Especially when it comes to dogs. One thing that\'s a bit interesting is that the series likes to censor out its potential fan-service with little cat pictures. Which is better than being fan-servicey, but it\'s also kind of bizarre.Sound:Feel did get some strong actresses for this.

So, I\'ll give it a 6/10.', ""I downloaded this series to watch something funny, and I found more than what I was looking for. Kanamemo is jam packed full of moe with familiar characters and back stories.~Story 8/10~Kana's grandma dies leaving her all alone in this big scary world. When looking for a job and a place to stay she stumbles upon a group of weird chicks at a local newspaper business. She promptly skips this option and tries to look for other opportunities, but all either need her parents permission or have no living place available for her. Kana inevitably finds herself getting run over by one of the chicks...of the freakish newspaper place, cementing her place in the household and the job.The story felt a bit unique, but also familiar, a good combination for a comedy.~Art 6/10~The art is okay, but with a combination of constant bright colors and incomplete backgrounds, I often found myself getting blurry vision. The mouthing when a character speaks looks cheap and effortlessly drawn.~Sounds 6/10~There wasn't anything really remarkable about the sound. The characters sometimes sang songs, but that was mainly focused in one episode. One of my favorite voice actresses plays a supporting character, so that automatically makes me happier.~Character 6/10~The different types of characters is okay, I guess. They all seem familiar and predictable. A Yuri couple, a perverted drunk, an elementary kid (who is the smartest) that runs the local newspaper business, and an innocent girl who is often attacked with insults and perverted hands. The characters often fained ignorance and stupidity, I do believe there is a place where Dumb and Dumber makes a good comedy, but the scenarios that the characters have themselves put in are pretty damn childish. The characters also don't have much depth to them as well, it's like watching a elementary kid acting out a scene with cardboard figures that have little to no background.~Overall 7/10~Overall, I liked the show, I found myself laughing here and there, but the blurry vision thing really doesn't sit well with me. The moe was gushing from the seams and yet again, here is another show that is made purely for simple enjoyment.There are pros and cons to this show, but it is worth giving a chance if you want to watch something that is mindless and somewhat repetitive.~~Subs Used~~CoalGirls of the freakish newspaper place, cementing her place in the household and the job.The story felt a bit unique, but also familiar, a good combination for a comedy.~Art 6/10~The art is okay, but with a combination of constant bright colors and incomplete backgrounds, I often found myself getting blurry vision.

Which is sad, as while they are plenty of boring slice-of-life shows, they are a whole lot of good ones too. Kanamemo is one of those.Based off of a manga by Iwami Shoko, who has done nothing else of note, and directed by Takayanagi Shigehito, who was also the director for the first two seasons of The World God Only Knows, it tells the tale of a girl named Kana. Her grandma, who was also her guardian died, and...due to the fact she apparently has no other living relatives, she is all alone. She flees her house when the movers begin moving stuff of her grandma out, fearing they will take her too, and ends up finding a job at a newspaper place that also offers room and board, giving her a place to stay. The other people working at this newspaper cafe are of course a group of eccentric girls, and the comedy begins.Like the majority of slice-of-life anime, Kanamemo is a rather episodic show, with no true plot for it. One episode Kana is attempting to put on a perfect work smile, another all the girls want to go to the beach but can't as they all have different days off (doubled with the musical episode also. Don't see those too much in anime), and another episode has Kana believe one of the girls left the place and it also has them playing with sparklers and a meeting between two characters at a vending machine tacked on the end, because hey, they need to fill 23 minutes. Things are not purely comedy however, Kana just lost her grandma and her only family after all. However, all the drama is purely light and fluffy and works, but it's enough for the characters to develop a bit. Due to this, I consider Kanamemo to be more of a iyashikei or a healing-type slice-of-life show instead of a purely comedic one. Speaking of comedy, the show has nothing spectacular in that section, but nothing bad either. It did make me smile a lot and laugh like, twice I think. They are a few running gags that get annoying though, but even then they still aren't that bad.You cannot talk about a slice-of-life show without the characters. There is of course Kana, who fulfills the role as the ditz in the cast, but it's actually used. Kana feels somewhat guilty a few times as she's not that good of a worker compared to the rest of the cast. But yeah, most of the times she's just another ditz, nothing truly special. Then there's Saki, who is somehow the boss of the place despite only being 10, younger than Kana. She is rather mature, typically has a deadpan snarker air about her, and seems to care a whole lot about her job. However, she is hinted to care more about the other workers more than she seems, and is actually called a tsundere at one point (though a character I'll discuss later fits the archetype much more). Then we have Hinata, an idiot who has failed her entrance exams 3 times and cares a whole lot about money. Then we have Yume and Yuuki, the yuri couple in this cast. Yume is always bright and happy and Yuuki is much more calmer, though does get jealous when Yume gets too close to another one of the cast members, but despite this they still manage to have a rather cute relationship. Now, all of these above cast members are good, but the final worker at the newspaper place is not very good. Haruka, who is a lolicon that loves to try and group Kana. Now, I wouldn't mind this, but this is literally the only element to her personality. It is taken to such extremes that Kana yells for her to stop- While the other members of the group do nothing but watch as Haruka more or less molests Kana. She takes away some of this show's purity and makes it more into otaku bait. Oh, and there's one more, Mika, who works at a rivaling newspaper company and is tsundere for Kana. Despite the fact she seems to be a rich girl, she is for some reason working at a newspaper company, which sort of makes no sense, but ah well.Now, there is one more thing you need to know about this show- The censoring. Most of the censoring is done by these huge boxes with a picture of a cat on them (it's a slice-of-life show starring a bunch of cute girls, of course there's gonna be a cat in there). These boxes are humongous and whenever they appear on the screen they are distracting. And they're so big too, you can't see anything at all. At least make them a little smaller, or just find more better ways to censor. And some of the stuff they censor does get useless (Kana's pants rip, and they put a big huge cat box over the rip. Either she's not wearing any underwear, or the TV station that aired this was so paranoid they didn't want to get sued over seeing a young girl's panties or something like that, I don't know. The censorship gets in the way, is what I'm trying to say.Besides that, the show is rather nice. Soundtrack is good enough, though the opening is an idol song of the dull variety instead of the catchy one and the ending theme I think I already forgot and I finished this like, 20 minutes ago, but besides that it's good. The animation is on-par from what you expect from slice-of-life shows, with a rather colorful color pallet in there. It looks cute at least.Kanamemo is a good slice-of-life show. It has enough drama to make it relaxing but concentrates enough on comedy to not make it boring, unlike a few other iyashikei slice-of-life shows, like, say Tamayura (which suffers from a few other problems, but I'll review that some other time). While one annoying character and some nonsense censorship get in the way a little bit, it remains an entertaining show from beginning to end. A must-see for all slice-of-life fans. due to the fact she apparently has no other living relatives, she is all alone.

Mika and Kana couldve been so much more, the yuri is actually slight aside from the underage perversions. but it could...have been so much more. i wish it couldve been and i believe there could be a second season but i would hope the time would be invested equally in every episode with each one being fufilling instead of rushing it out. have been so much more. i wish it couldve been and i believe there could be a second season but i would hope the time would be invested equally in every episode with each one being fufilling instead of rushing it out.', ""Dear anime industry, I feel these aren't lessons that need to be learned by here we go:1) Sexual assault isn't funny generally (well, it can be but you have to be super careful). It's particularly bad that in this case what's painted as comedy is an adult alcoholic sexually assaulting young women. This is acceptable workplace behaviour, it's explicitly stated that it's fine because Haruka's female.2) Lesbians aren't there for your amusement. It's nice that a big deal isn't made of the lesbian couple, but the fact that 2 women have sex is all to often another punchline. Honestly, this is progress for anime though,...sadly.3) Call it Lolicon or whatever, but I have a real problem with this general acceptance that it's ok to sexually desire/assault someone whose barely a teenage, or more often than not even younger. It can be done in an acceptable fashion, but here it absolutely isn't.There's a lot of potential in this show. As I say there's a lesbian couple that just are there, it's never stated and they don't have to explain who they are. Not to mention Kana is kind of an adorable protagonist and reasonably well realised. Shorty is good fun too. The setting and artwork all work and the writing can be pretty good at times.What is impossible to move past is the general feeling that the main intention behind this show was the desire to anime sexualised children. I tried, despite all the warnings I tried and got to episode 5. I may still finish it but I find myself too angry to want to watch it. I watched, and enjoyed, Wataten despite it's content so I'm no prude here. Wataten had a really different vibe and it really felt quite sweet and wholesome at times, I rarely felt that the show was trying to gain my interest by using sexual predator behaviour. This is a different beast, the main aim of this show is to gain viewers who want to sexualise kids, at least thats the way it feels.This all sounds like pretty strong, moralistic stuff to some but I'm pretty angry at the unrealised potential here. It's such a great set up but the few problems are massive ones.Don't try it, there is plenty of other anime. sadly.3) Call it Lolicon or whatever, but I have a real problem with this general acceptance that it's ok to sexually desire/assault someone whose barely a teenage, or more often than not even younger.

Reading the summary it has a cool premise with a fun cast of gals working together. But that is not what is happening here. This show is 13 episodes of uncomfortable, gross, yuri stereotyping that feels like a group of horny guys just threw together their fantasies. If it was just some sexualized ladies that would be one thing, and it probably wouldn't be that bad. But like half of the characters are literal minors? One is literally in elementary school??? Honestly it feels...like something borderline illegal is going down here. I know that censorship and age of consent and sex culture is different in Japan and it's not cool to judge another country's culture by my standards, but this is just okay.Do not waste your time on this garbage, there are plenty of other shows out there with much better yuri relationships. like something borderline illegal is going down here.

Hanebado!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37259/Hanebado,"['Those who derive all of their entertainment and lasting impressions from anime out of said work’s production values alone, those in the so called Sakuga Community, have always interested me, because while their commitment to technical quality is something I deeply share and respect, their equally unshakeable lack of concern with every other aspect of the work has perplexed me to no end for as long as I can remember. I mean, no matter how beautifully made it may be, I just can’t imaging enjoying a show if the plot composition, character writing, visual direction, or even just the music or color design alone is...bad in any combination. These are the people who convinced me to watch a show as embarrassingly incompetent as Fate/Apocrypha for its action sakuga alone, and watching a show that heinously awful just to see a few flashy fight scenes which I could’ve just as easily seen on sakugabooru is something I will happily never do again. In light of this resolve, however, I for some reason decided to watch a show as melodramatic and cheaply written as Hanebado just for its ambitious athletic choreography and gorgeous animation direction, and this review will detail to you the sad reality of this mistake.The direction, the shot composition from storyboarding, the digital and hand-shaded lighting, the angles and framing, the perspectives and editing, the aforementioned choreography and base animation, and just about every other facet of the visual presentation this monster has to offer was spot on perfect every time it absolutely needed to be so, and while it could be called mildly inconsistent, the average quality of artwork and animation will still blow you away. Directing often done in perspective animation of the birdie dashing like lighting back and forth across the court with quick, intense, energetic frames of the characters’ enlivened faces intermittently flashing onto screen. Powerful storyboards punching in the impact of the birdies ricocheting off the rackets like bullets off plate metal, the muscle it takes to vault for wide shots like the athlete’s life depends on it, and the beats of sweat leaping off the athlete’s face when they switch directions to dance across the court faster than the in-betweeners can even draw them. Never does the spectacle slow, drop detail, or pan across stills, thusly spending every waking second zipping around the court and the players atop. I cannot stress just how much time, money, and manpower was clearly expended crafting these brilliant sequences. Do you remember the documentaries of Production IG staff meticulously studying professional volleyball players to animate Haikyuu, or Silat martial artists to animate Psycho-Pass? If not for the fact I know and can evidently see LIDENFILMS rotoscoped half the matches, I would’ve sworn similar amounts of Herculean effort was put into the production of Hanebado, because it’s just that beautiful.As for the rest of the show, well, it’s pretty not great.Our protagonist is a girl named Ayano who is the daughter of the most decorated female badminton athlete ever to grace Japan, and with such expectations rested upon her shoulders and with such big shoes to fill, she has been raised for the sole purpose of playing badminton and living up to her mother’s lofty ideals of her development. As if such an overblown conceit wasn’t already embellished enough on paper, Ayano is portrayed as a being an almost literal “badminton monster”—which I know sounds hysterically stupid, but seeing as they actually use this descriptor multiple times in the anime verbatim, I’m going to stick with it—who will periodically flip her crazy switch in tense matches which literally makes her eyes dilate like a psychopath and also makes her hair turn messy like a rabid animal. I guess I could take this seriously if her mother beat her or something abusive to warrant this level of distress, but every single flashback to her childhood shows her and her mother happily practicing badminton with no stakes and all smiles, so when the show suddenly cuts back to present day with Ayano looking like she’s ready to murder her opponent over a simple practice game, I can’t help but wonder how she became so comically overdramatic. And it’s not just her either. Her opponents are just as outrageously overreactive and unbelievably over-the-top. For example, one of Ayano’s early competitors is a Danish girl who pushed aside her life and home country to move to Japan for the sole purpose of beating Ayano and winning her mother’s favor. How any of these personalities and character motivations are supposed to be believable or realistic in the slightest bit is beyond me.Despite the badminton matches being absolutely stunning on a visual level, the script which stands meekly behind them can only be compared to that which you’d find in your standard shounen battle manga. If I had to give an example, I would say Fairy Tail, but all shounen battle manga have their own version of the infamous Power of Friendship, or what I like to call the-writer-is-a-hack-and-the-main-characters-are-just-going-to-win-now-for-no-good-reason-other-than-the-fact-it-will-make-all-the-kids-and-teens-self-inserting-as-the-carboard-cutout-of-a-hero-feel-good-about-themselves. And, of course, Hanebado has its own version of this as well. Instead of following the examples of critically acclaimed sports anime such as Haikyuu, Baby Steps, or Hajime no Ippo, shows wherein the cast has to work for their skill and success with blood, sweat, tears, and precious time, Hanebado will just haphazardly throw characters in your face with predetermined skill sets which you’re then just supposed to accept with no questions asked. At no point in the show does anyone actually sit down and explain HOW or WHY someone is a good or bad player even though everyone is continuously using badminton terminology without explanation or demonstration. After watching the aforementioned shows Haikyuu, Baby Steps, and Hajime no Ippo, I know the rules of Volleyball, Tennis, and Boxing like the back of my hand, but after watching Hanebado, on the other hand, the only thing I really understand about badminton is when the birdie hits the ground, someone gets a point.And speaking of the ostentatiously contrived script, I forgot to mention the people who are competing in this show only win or loose when they WANT to. As I just mentioned, there isn’t any progression in the characters’ skill sets, so the element of surprise which ends up deciding the matches is—you guessed it—their emotions. If Ayano is feeling unmotivated or corrupt, then she looses, and if Ayano is feeling determined or righteous, then she wins, and this is true for every single character in the entire show. If the lesson they have to learn involves suffering defeat, then they loose, and if the lesson they have to learn involves tasting victory, then they win. Skill and most certainly technique simply do not matter in this anime. Like, oh my god, you don’t even know. There’s a match towards the end of the show wherein the opposing player knows, in no uncertain terms, her opponent has a weak knee. Her coach knows this too, and he advises her to make her opponent run side to side in order to blow out her already weakened knee so she herself can score the win with ease, and she then decides to ACTIVELY DISOBEY HIS OBJECTIVELY HELPFUL INSTRUCTIONS AND DELIBERATELY PROCEED IN A MANNER IN WHICH SHE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN SHE WILL LOOSE THE MATCH, because his strategy, and I quote, “was not the badminton I wanted to play.” I suppose you could make the argument this allows the thematic depth of the show to shine, but when said theming is the same paper-thin conversation on hard work versus talent which you see in every sports anime ever made, the integrity of the script and consistency of the logical progression is hardly worth sacrificing.In the end, despite having sought to never do so again, I finished a show I didn’t enjoy just for some pretty visuals, which I guess—if for no other reason to mention than to give myself an excuse—paints a really ugly picture of the fact most anime are so utterly lacking in technical quality, I would become so starved for a polished product that I’d just settle for this. Now please don’t go interpreting my bitching too far, though, because Hanebado is not complete and total failure. Its character art is really nice even if the designs themselves are cliched at best, its music was quite invigorating and the hype opening theme and animation were just as much so, the voice acting was really well-done and emotive even if the dialogue itself was pretty milquetoast, and the pacing was legitimately good. But again, if you’re looking for appeal at a level deeper than the absolute surface, you will be sorely disappointed with Hanebado. If you’re sick of being recommended the latest popular success by A-1 Pictures or Bones only to watch it and find it to be ugly as sin, just as you should, then check this out with your brain turned off to ease the pain, but beware, because if your brain accidentally comes alive, you’ll find yourself quickly confused, annoyed, and then immediately bored and turned off once again.Thank you for reading. bad in any combination. These are the people who convinced me to watch a show as embarrassingly incompetent as Fate/Apocrypha for its action sakuga alone, and watching a show that heinously awful just to see a few flashy fight scenes which I could’ve just as easily seen on sakugabooru is something I will happily never do again. In light of this resolve, however, I for some reason decided to watch a show as melodramatic and cheaply written as Hanebado just for its ambitious athletic choreography and gorgeous animation direction, and this review will detail to you the sad reality of this mistake.The direction, the shot composition from storyboarding, the digital and hand-shaded lighting, the angles and framing, the perspectives and editing, the aforementioned choreography and base animation, and just about every other facet of the visual presentation this monster has to offer was spot on perfect every time it absolutely needed to be so, and while it could be called mildly inconsistent, the average quality of artwork and animation will still blow you away. Directing often done in perspective animation of the birdie dashing like lighting back and forth across the court with quick, intense, energetic frames of the characters’ enlivened faces intermittently flashing onto screen. Powerful storyboards punching in the impact of the birdies ricocheting off the rackets like bullets off plate metal, the muscle it takes to vault for wide shots like the athlete’s life depends on it, and the beats of sweat leaping off the athlete’s face when they switch directions to dance across the court faster than the in-betweeners can even draw them. Never does the spectacle slow, drop detail, or pan across stills, thusly spending every waking second zipping around the court and the players atop. I cannot stress just how much time, money, and manpower was clearly expended crafting these brilliant sequences. Do you remember the documentaries of Production IG staff meticulously studying professional volleyball players to animate Haikyuu, or Silat martial artists to animate Psycho-Pass? If not for the fact I know and can evidently see LIDENFILMS rotoscoped half the matches, I would’ve sworn similar amounts of Herculean effort was put into the production of Hanebado, because it’s just that beautiful.As for the rest of the show, well, it’s pretty not great.Our protagonist is a girl named Ayano who is the daughter of the most decorated female badminton athlete ever to grace Japan, and with such expectations rested upon her shoulders and with such big shoes to fill, she has been raised for the sole purpose of playing badminton and living up to her mother’s lofty ideals of her development. As if such an overblown conceit wasn’t already embellished enough on paper, Ayano is portrayed as a being an almost literal “badminton monster”—which I know sounds hysterically stupid, but seeing as they actually use this descriptor multiple times in the anime verbatim, I’m going to stick with it—who will periodically flip her crazy switch in tense matches which literally makes her eyes dilate like a psychopath and also makes her hair turn messy like a rabid animal. I guess I could take this seriously if her mother beat her or something abusive to warrant this level of distress, but every single flashback to her childhood shows her and her mother happily practicing badminton with no stakes and all smiles, so when the show suddenly cuts back to present day with Ayano looking like she’s ready to murder her opponent over a simple practice game, I can’t help but wonder how she became so comically overdramatic. And it’s not just her either. Her opponents are just as outrageously overreactive and unbelievably over-the-top. For example, one of Ayano’s early competitors is a Danish girl who pushed aside her life and home country to move to Japan for the sole purpose of beating Ayano and winning her mother’s favor. How any of these personalities and character motivations are supposed to be believable or realistic in the slightest bit is beyond me.Despite the badminton matches being absolutely stunning on a visual level, the script which stands meekly behind them can only be compared to that which you’d find in your standard shounen battle manga.

Long story short, this show is not impressive in the slightest. Abysmal writing and comic book antagonists (that would actually be disrespectful to comic book villans though)Remember the show ""Everyone Hates Chris""? This is pretty much Everyone Hates Ayana. They introduce a new rival every week that just make no sense. The characters don\'t care about badminton at all for the most part. Everyone seems like they hate it. The whole show is just doom and gloom. Every week we think they are turning a corner,...but it stays the same. It is just a really gloomy show. We get it, badminton requires a lot of sacrifice, but this show is over the top dramatic.Brings me into my next segaway. This show is not funny. Contrary to the cheerful cover poster, there is barely any ""fun"" to be had. It is just drama after drama. There are no lighter moments. The only source of anyone trying to be funny is a the coach who feels like a blatant ripoff of ""Trainer-san"" from Uma Musume (miraculously he is one of the better characters which gives u a good glimpse of this show) I know comedy is subjective, but there isn\'t even a moment to critique the comedy, because it isn\'t even there. Serious shows can have lighter moments. Not everyone has to be so miserable.I will give credit where credit is due and that belongs to the amazing art which is one of the best and solid soundtrack as well as the OP and ED (especially the ED as it signals the end of this show). But in all seriousness, one of the prettiest shows to ever be animated.At the end of the day, Hanabado is everything bad about Sports Anime. No ""falling in love"" with the sport, not meaningful matches, and no realistic characters to like. If you want a sports show, watch Harukana Recieve.

This time, our series focuses around edgy feelings stuff, crying scenes and other melodrama, and the title itself already acknowledges it is bad.Apparently, life is pointless and so is badminton, so wearing an edgy face directly from Madoka Magica whenever someone hits the ball, or cringe flashbacks with sad feeling stuff occurs, is obligatory. I have no idea what the series tries to accomplish by anyone crying every 5 minutes and reflecting their suicidal vanity via badminton. Better cut myself some wounds that won't heal to understand how deep it is, I...guess.Our characters are pretty boring. Moeblobs whose character design has gone thru more planning than their personalities, filled with bunch of psychological problems and depression, used by the author in purpose of trying to make someone feel for them because they are so full of these emotions, man. Practically the whole crew is Inside Out's take on what being a bitch in different ways is about.This series also contains one of the most random scenes I have ever seen in the history of anime. Girl 1 yells at girl 2 in anger, followed by girls 3-5 yelling at girl 1 for yelling at girl 2, further followed by girl 4 starting to walk off into the sunset while girls 1-3 and 5 watch. All of my wat.Originally, I was hyped to see the animated trajectories of badminton, but I have been too distracted by the obviously-an-anime character models and the thought that someone might start crying or kill themselves in the middle of a match, to get impressed by it.Perhaps those who don't find the shonen sports formula to be very appealing, will find some satisfaction from this, but be warned: some edgy series are fun and some are this anime. I will still give this a generous 5 because there seems to be a chance of it getting better, which alone is worth of something because most airing series don't even have that. guess.Our characters are pretty boring.

Alright, then…..carry on.Its just, this anime bears some resem—….oh, you still don’t care.  Okay.  I’ll just leave you alone….F—k you!  I’m writing this review whether you like it or not....As regular as the seasons change, another sports-genre anime has graced our computer screens for what seems like the umpteenth time, the flavor of the month being: badminton.  Not the most exhilarating sport in the world, but it definitely has intermittent moments of shock and awe (much like Hanebado!).Following in the footsteps of its male counterpart, Hanebado! is a semi-serious sports anime that deals with the psychological consequences of youth athletics.  As the story progresses, we begin to learn that each girl is plagued by a personal shortcoming that impedes their progress as an individual player.  These visceral, psychological battles become the focal point of the entire series, making the girl’s opponents, more or less, inconsequential, as they are primarily focused on their own internal “demons” (i.e. battling themselves).  An excellent example of showcasing this internal struggle happens in episode two, where chalkboard animation is used to emphasize the duality of Aragaki’s height “advantage,” provoking her to overcompensate in other facets of her game.  Not only is her height an emotional weakness (as other children call her a “beanpole,” and make fun of her masculine appearance) but it turns out to be a physical one, as well.  The astute coach for Nozomi employs a strategy to force Aragaki to move from side to side, putting an enormous amount of stress on her knees, resulting in overexertion and possible injury.  But due to her commitment of staying true to herself (i.e. overpowering her opponent through strength), she is able to circumvent this clever scheme.Of course, this is all well and good for our protagonist, but a more pressing dilemma emerges during the match, because while Aragaki simply needs to impose her will — her identity, if you will — on the game, Nozomi comes to the realization that she has no identity.  Her entire career has been dictated by “guidance” of her coach; thus, deteriorating her passion and creativity for the game.  The themes that Nozomi and Aragaki experience are quite typical for teenagers in high stress, athletic competition, yet the resolution of said themes felt a bit artificial, too romantic.  Is it truly believable that Nozomi’s coach would transition from yelling at her profusely (like she’s a red-headed step—…you know what, I’m just going to stop right there), to accepting her new perspective on badminton in the middle of a match — literally, on the drop of a dime?Quixotic happenings aside, Hanebado! suffers from the same deficiencies that infect its male counterpart, those being:-Random comedy from which there’s no reasonable explanation.-A character (i.e. Ayano) with “superhuman” ability that cannot be matched by anyone else.-The EYES of Ayano and Hinata both resembling a predator stalking its prey (both are small in stature, as well).-Displaying unrealistic feat’s that are not attainable in real life for the sake of entertainment-[Insert 5th point here — too lazy at the moment, its 3:30 in the morning]Hanebado!, in all seriousness, had an extremely promising start with interesting conceptual ideas about the psychological consequences of competitive athletics; yet, with each passing episode, it quickly decayed into a bizarre, nonsensical comedy with a weird daughter/mother/step-daughter dynamic that was particularly unappealing for the viewer.  Furthermore, the amount of melodrama was off the charts, with an innumerable amount of peaks and valleys, making even the most mundane task feel like it was a life or death situation.  Ayano’s metamorphosis from a timid, reserved girl, to a heartless, animalistic human hybrid was remarkably far-fetched, not to mention tropey.  It seems the desire to emulate its male counterpart was too strong, reducing Hanebado!’s effectiveness as a compelling story that can stand on its own weight.

Phantom Thieves may have their own show this season but the one who stole my heart in this season actually not them but this very particular badminton anime. While many people resent how this anime flows (being overly dramatic), I am personally love them just because I could analyze everything in this anime scene by scene or even second by second. Hanebado! proofed that sometimes it is not too bad to change course from how the original material works for the sake of character building.Let...me start with how I could be dragged into this anime. Actually, there are two things that dragged me into this anime. And the first one is that first match between our two main characters, Ayano and Nagisa. This very first scene is beautifully animated with very good camerawork, integrated CGI and 2D animation, SWEATS! and the character tension. This very first match settled the whole series\' vibe and set the very first bar to how they will animate the rest of the series. When I thought that they were setting the bar too high, I WAS WRONG. They really kept their animation quality as high as that from the first episode to the end. It is a huge kudos for the animators who have been very passionate from the very beginning to the very end.The second thing that made me into this anime is Nagisa Aragaki and her character. While I could say that the writer did a very good job  as they did not shy away to make a bad mother character that is Uchika Shindou when the community is full with good mother characters courtesy of Boku no Hero Academia Season 3, I should gave the kudos because of their exceptional job on writing Nagisa as a character. I always love tomboys as they tend to have insecurity conflict. In Nagisa\'s case, she is overly tall so everyone around her overestimates her and overlooks her hard work. After she lost from Ayano (who still a middle school student at that time), her insecurity came out afloat. Nagisa wants to be acknowledged by her hard work. I love how they made Nagisa\'s resolution to beat Ayano at the final match is because she wanted to beat herself from the past. You don\'t know how much I am rooting for her to win.The other best part is... The writer is successfully made Nagisa as Ayano\'s mirror but with a very different characteristic. If I analyze a bit further, while being very different, Ayano wants to be acknowledged by her hard work just like Nagisa. But the reason is very different as her (very bad) mother left her because she was not good enough. And not just Ayano, because in the end, this anime heavily gravitates around acknowledgement while building their characters. Just like what the last sentence of this anime said ""What you see on the other side of that net is always a reflection of yourself.""And then we enter the sound and music department. I would say that the soundtrack is very fit to the theme of the show as it has this tension around the music and made matches more heated than anything else. The soundtrack is full of determination just like how sports anime should be. I love the opening and the ending songs, too. They are very catchy but sometimes the opening feels out of character as it is too cheerful for the episode and not fit for the high tension and heated episode.Oh my, did I just overdone this review? Just like I said before, the main reason I love this anime is because I could analyze everything scene by scene or even second by second. I just love an anime that invites me to talk about it or giving a huge room for any discussions because that is a very much proof that the writer did a good job to make us speculate while finishing the whole plot.

Kudos for Hanebado! and all its production staffs.', 'Sometimes, I wish sports anime gets more attention whether it’s swimming, basketball, soccer, tennis, or anything competitive in nature. Sure, there was Free! from these past few years but it clearly had an audience from the very beginning. Badminton is a one of those sports where it doesn’t get too much attention, at least not on an international level. Yet Hanebado has its own fame when it comes to selling its sports drama.I would have originally watched this show just for the sheer competitiveness feeling. However, Hanebado persuaded me to invest into its character cast from the first few episodes. We meet a colorful group...that includes Ayano, Nagisa, Riko, Elena, among others. From my initial impression, it reminded me of characters trying to make a name for themselves. But as more and more the story progressed, it felt like some really were pushing themselves to the limit. The most noticeable character is Ayano where she enter an insane beast-like mode when she is motivated.  Some of her matches are noticeable of being extreme such as the case with Kaoruko. While Ayano is a main character, I find it difficult to root for her. The show chronicles her personality as being overly competitive to the point where it can toxic to watch her matches. On the other hand, I do think that Ayano is able to bring out the nature of badminton to a level that people were not anticipating for.It’s probably easy to overlook some other characters at first glance but the show does attempt to bring out the best from others. Nagisa is another noticeable name that I ended up rooting for late in the story. As a way to prove herself, she pushes Ayano to her best in one of the most intense matches in the series. We also got to learn a bit more about both girls along the way. But unfortunately, I can’t really say this series makes Ayano likable. It’s like there’s two completely different characters of her – one that evokes fear and another that behaves like a casual schoolgirl. It’s much easier to relate to the latter. Ayano’s competitive side often reaches to a point that is unbelievable in this show. I find it even baffling at how she deals with depression because her past shows a case of abandonment.Realism, in fact, does exist to some extent in the show. The characters skill sets are easily watchable as it’s not hard to tell who can beat who before a game is even over at times. But on the contrary, some matches feel like it didn’t live up to expectations with curb-stomp like moments. I also have some problems with how much characters changes, not just in the case of Ayano. For instance, there’s Connie who develops a meaner attitude after facing off against her. Regarding Ayano herself, it seems no one really tries to help her change either. This extends to their coach, Kentarou Tachibana. I’m not going to lie, this guy is hard to accept. He helps out Nagisa with her own problems but doesn’t attempt to do the same for Ayano. The show did make him likable in the beginning but his development doesn’t get enough attention.As you may have guessed, Hanebado isn’t going to spoon feed you information much so you’ll have to learn along the way. Badminton isn’t an overly complex sport but it does require a lot of attention. To me, the pure competitive energy of the sport is enough sometimes. The series sells its drama this way during the matches. It’s a bit strange though. The more I watched badminton, the more I feel like this show mixes in psychology during the storytelling. Every match feels like there’s something at stake such as a player’s pride. As one of the positives in this series, every match carries an emotional weight that I think is worth watching for. If only the main character cast could be worth talking about just as much in a positive light.That isn’t to say the series is unwatchable even with its questionable character roster. Jumping into Hanebado is a visual feast to the eyes with the production quality. There’s a lot of fluidity in the motions of the characters. Every movement in the series felt real and important especially during key moments of the matches. This ranges from the clever camera angles on the muscles to little details like body language. Character designs also look clean that gives each character a distinctive look. Ayano is an exceptional case once you see both sides of her character. That also leads to character expressions that I see very much as impressive. Ayano’s personality is highlighted with how she reacts to her friends or rivals. Others show their emotions without holding much back. Even during lighthearted scenes, there are moments that defines characters for what the creators wanted them to be in this adaptation. The theme songs (particular opening) contains a variety of dynamic camerawork that is admirable. It’s stylish that enhances the energy of the show. The ED theme song contains carefully crafted framework and artistic coloring. Definitely very thought provoking like a work of art.There’s not too many sports series that hooks my attention and Hanebado did that in the beginning. While I still can’t forgive the character destruction of some of the cast, there’s definitely a few that are worth watching. You can be the judge on who to root for. For a show with sports competitiveness, there’s the feeling of emotional stakes. I did hope the series took better care of its characters in terms of their development and personalities. But Hanebado is a watchable. It’s not perfect by all means or even outstanding. Yet, it has an ability to tell a dramatic sports story. that includes Ayano, Nagisa, Riko, Elena, among others. From my initial impression, it reminded me of characters trying to make a name for themselves. But as more and more the story progressed, it felt like some really were pushing themselves to the limit. The most noticeable character is Ayano where she enter an insane beast-like mode when she is motivated.  Some of her matches are noticeable of being extreme such as the case with Kaoruko.

I came across Megalo Box and it proved me wrong, so I thought why not give this a try? It might impress me too... but it didn't.The story is about a tournament in which challengers play against each other. I guess that's it, that's the most of the story. There's also the unnecessary drama which is also criticized by its fans, but if you dislike the drama, then what do you exactly like about the show?...The tournament? Is it really something praiseworthy? I'm not here to judge anyone's taste, you can like whatever you want to, but I really want a legit argument as to why this is likable. Anyway, each character has some sort of story with badminton and they're as forgettable as the characters themselves, with the exception of Hanesaki because the anime shoves down your throat that she plays badminton for her mother and you should not forget that. Then her mother comes back to live with her one day and we don't even get any kind of development or reunion scene. She comes back, and the director thought, let's skip to another scene, shall we?I'm guessing the animators thought they could win over the fans with some good animation for the games and forget that a story or even character designs exist. The characters were so forgettable that I had no choice but to distinguish them by appearance, but even that was impossible because the characters pretty much look the same, just alter the hairstyle a bit, or not, depends on the character. They even forgot how to draw Hanesaki in episode 12 and made her look like she grew 30 years in the time frame of one game. They tried to have style over substance but couldn't nail both. As for the soundtracks, easily best part of the show, they were chill, intense, or anything that was needed. They didn't stand out much but they made the show a bit more enjoyable.And now come the characters. I mentioned how forgettable they are so I pretty much forgot what I wanna say about them. Hanesaki hates the world for some reason, Nagisa is flat, not her breast though, and she was just... there, possibly to rival Hanesaki. The teacher had Nobuhiko voice him and that alone made him a bit remarkable, he was encouraging I'd say. Other characters had an episode dedicated to them but I can't really recall their names, personality, maybe even their looks, or their motives. They played games constantly and the game were just shortened to add in some irrelevant drama which does not affect the game. Characters keep on playing regardless of their past in their oddly paced matches. But it's notable to say the strategies used in the games were convincing so that's a merit to notice. Anyhow, I kind of lost track on what I was gonna say about them, but losing track is what their personality is best at. They're just bland and present to give you a well animated, oddly paced match featuring characters that look and act the same.Rant of the day is over. You can now go watch this (or not) and ignore my opinion because this is definitely AOTY. The tournament? Is it really something praiseworthy?

Instead of relying on gimmicks like crazy superpowers and overpowered shonen protagonists, it seeks to tell a more personal story by focusing more on the characters and them dealing with their internal struggles through a sport that they all enjoy.Story:The story setup for this one is about as simple as you would expect for a sports anime. A struggling badminton team is on the verge of closing when a new coach and an ace badminton player show up to join the group. With their powers combined, they begin playing matches...against other schools and will probably work towards some grand, national tournament where all of the personal character stories will come to their conclusion.The simple nature of the plot and its inherent predictableness are probably Hanebado’s weakest points. It’s not that outlandish for sports anime to be fairly predictable, but it would be nice if this one threw some kind of curveball towards the viewer with regards to its overarching plot. The real strength of this show will be the characters and their personal stories and struggles.Characters:With only a few episodes out, I’m already a big fan of the show’s two leading ladies: Ayano Hanesaki and Nagisa Aragaki. Hanasaki is the aforementioned ace of the group who, 6 months prior to the events of the show, destroyed Aragaki in a tournament 21-0. Without spoiling too much, this victory ran hollow to her due to the strained relationship she has with her mother, who happens to be a superstar player herself.Though Hanasaki can come off as a bit edgy early on as she lays out her distaste for badminton really thick, seeing her come out of her shell and embrace her new team members is an absolute treat. Though she is shy and soft-spoken, there is an overwhelming kindness and sweetness to her character. Seeing the internal struggle between these two different sides of her will certainly be the main driving force for me with this show.Aragaki is the more hotheaded and standoffish foil to Ayano. The show brilliantly sets her up by showing her inability to accept her loss and weaknesses by straight-up torturing her teammates to their breaking points. Though this might seem like a really unlikeable direction for this character, she does mellow out fairly quickly. Personally, I’m really interested in seeing how her inner turmoil will affect the team and her relationship with Hanesaki going further.The other characters feel mostly like background objects that play badminton. None of them have any particularly unlikeable personalities, but I really hope the show has time to touch upon them at least a little. At the very least, Hanebado is teasing some very outlandish personalities for its antagonists which is definitely something to look forward to.Presentation:The other strength of this show is its art, animation, and sound. The show beautifully captures the feeling of being at an actual match. Everything from the sharp squeaks of the players’ shoes skirting against the court to the earth-shattering sound of a Forehand Smash to the sweat staining the floors as the characters desperately try to catch their breath bring an immersive intenseness to every match. Coupled with the fact that the protagonists aren’t completely overpowered, there has yet to be a single game that left me losing interest.The characters themselves have also had no problem staying on model, though this aspect is particularly interesting to me considering studio LIDENFILMS doesn’t have the best track record with keeping their quality intact. Though their recent work “Killing Bites” didn’t really have that problem, works like “Koi to Uso” and “Berserk” show that the studio may have problems if they misuse their budget or become heavily reliant on CG. Considering that they are also working on “Phantom of the Twilight” this season, I hope LIDENFILMS will be able to keep the quality of Hanabado’s art and animation within acceptable standards. against other schools and will probably work towards some grand, national tournament where all of the personal character stories will come to their conclusion.The simple nature of the plot and its inherent predictableness are probably Hanebado’s weakest points.

No over the top nonsense like super powers or bring undersized and overcoming tall obstacles (im looking at you Haikyuu) or going down a Yaoi fanbase (im looking at you Yuri on Ice). Instead Hanebado focuses more on two girls who overcome personal issues to better themselves not only in Badminton but in life as well. I really would have liked to give this Story a 10/10 however the introduction of side characters backstories and side stories set this...back as a whole. I would have focused more on Ayano and Nagisa's issues and worked with that instead of bringing in the team issues.The Art and Animation was simply flawless throughout the entire series. I cannot wait for the Bluray to be released because it is only going to be BETTER. The last 2 episodes were some of the most beautiful animated Sports action I have ever seen. Simply astonishing.Awesome opening and ending with great insert music. The voice actors did an amazing job as well. No complaints at all.The characters again would have been a 10/10 if the focus was more on Nagisa and Ayano. Connie and Kaoruko were two characters I really didnt care about along with most of the Badminton teammates outside of Riko and Sora.I throughly enjoyed this anime because it was different compared to most Sports anime out there. Most Sports anime the MC only gets better with the power of friendship and trust with their teammates even if they are already talented. Ayano is OP from the start and eventually reaches a breaking point mentally and her character just gets better by the week. Same thing with Nagisa as each episode progresses their development is amazing.Overall this is one of the best Sports anime I have seen in a long time. Realistic and the Drama in it was very well done. 10/10 anime. back as a whole.

Personally, I like nothing in this series starting from plots, ideas, characters, pacing, tones, dialogues, progressions and developments. This is one of most pandering and corny sport series I have ever seen for a while. It feel like I'm not even watching sport or let alone the series itself. Everything look fan service to me.Plots that building up to be an obnoxiously over-dramatic sport life where everyone don't play sport as they feel...like or love to play it anymore. They only play sport for winning which in my opinion isn't the purpose or goal of sport itself.Ideas that having weirdly morals about you can being a jerk and having no sportsmanship to everyone but if you are good at sport or you feel some kind of sorry, everyone will forgive and forget what you do even though they have no reason to.Characters that are mostly confused because they don't know how to separate sport logic form life logic. You don't have to win every time or have to be the best at it. You can be yourself and happy to do the thing you like. If you don't feel like to play sport, just quit it. It's not like badminton is only occupation in the world right ?The pacing and tones that keep going back and forth as director doesn't know how to direct other type of tones and pacing rather than drama and sport that only smack their shuttlecock to each others' face with no plan or strategy. (except the very last match between main character in final episodes which some kind worth to watch)Dialogues that totally horrible as everyone always speak aggressively to each other and keep complain about how life so bad in a metaphoric way.These are brief examples of the problems why this series is so bad in my opinion. Now let's get into the detail explanations.1.) I don't like how this series present the ideas of badminton or sport at all. The ideas of badminton and how social life work seem so separate and don’t go along with each others so much. Even though the series want us to think that badminton is a life for characters or the whole world to move along with. But most of the time the logic and gimmicks to link this two ideas together don’t make any senses. Every scenes and plot points look extremely corny and forced. It feels like everything in the entire series always try to reason with each other by using badminton and sport as an important factor in every arguments. When characters and scenes are executed by using these badminton and sport life as main arguments, they look so stupid and so hard to understand what they are thinking. Some people may say that these combinations of both ideas are just some metaphoric and hidden massage of how realism work, but the point is in the end, these just make everything much more complex and over dramatic for unnecessary reason. Just drop the badminton things for a second and make character do and think like a normal person will make this series much more realistic.2.) The morals in each episode are so moronic and hard to actually believe and work in real life. Again if this series follow the way of trying to be “REALISTIC” then the morals are actually important and it is the matter of fact that these will make the series to have much more visualize images of “what get what after done what” things going on along the entire run. Some scenes and plot points are exaggerated and pandering so much. Doing things that are absolutely not gonna happened in real life and then get away with it or characters and plots just forget about it seem so convoluted and doesn’t make any senses. This will be an exception to cut the score or to even considered as a bad point if the series doesn’t try so hard to become “REALISTIC” though (based on how the series tones and plots were presented). This circumstance actually make me believe that characters and plot points don’t have their own morals and stand points and they are changed over the time with no subtlety and development at all.3.) This series have one of the worst dialogues I have ever heard in my life. This is the most important key that absolutely ruin this series in my opinion. First, characters usually talk nonsense and metaphoric which kind of annoying and irritating and actually extend the running time to become a boring mess that ruin both tone and story progression and development. Second, this series are extremely over dramatic because of dialogues alone as every characters usually talk like they want to punch each other face for all the time. They insulted and roasted each other for absolutely no reason which even make plots and sequences look so much pandering and fan-service which some time even extend the length of dramatic tone to the maximum limit that later destroyed other tone and plot as well. Third, characters usually repeat the same thing they have been speak and think for several time for no reason which even make this series so long and boring.4.) Scenes and plots arrangements, pacing and even execution in this series aren’t very good at all. In fact most of them look so confused and hard to tell what viewers should actually focus at the very moment. They are too cramped for the starter. In one episode they have over 100 plots going around and none of them have an impact on each others. Also these plots are always appear randomly with no enough development and subtlety. They cut so many tone and story of an important point that viewers kind of care for the most of time and even make the overall episode to be much more chaotic and confused. Additionally, the storytelling and pacing in this series is sometime totally bad in terms of timing, cliffhanging and swapping. They are so many plot points that are telling in those stage which quite annoying and irritating for those viewers who doesn’t want to watch the three kingdom of badminton.5.) There are so many stereotype of characters that viewers can actually see and predict their plot for a mile away and even stay the same with no developments or changes during the entire run. The hard strong shounen women who doesn't know how to give up and extremely hot-blood. The want to be winner innocent character. The senpai lover. The girl who look kind and nice outside but her life is very sad. Everything you can easily guess.6.) This series is easily predictable. Nothing significantly going on during the entire run rather than things that you might seen and think since the very beginning of the series about girls who want to play sport (and win) so much which in each episode will have dramas as a layer to it as always and in the end will conclude with we are friend now kind of cliche'. Furthermore, every morals in each plot arcs (yes, the entire 2-3 episodic sequences) are actually the same. This is so boring in both short and long running viewing experiences. Watching this series only in the beginning and the last would actually give you the same result you want as watching the entire series.And that's all my opinion why this series is so bad even though it has very good productions. If the main important characteristic of the series, plot isn't compelling enough or even downright design to be fan service, then I have no reason to watch such failure series.The final score is 1/10. 1 score comes from quality animation productions alone. like or love to play it anymore.

This series have one of the worst dialogues I have ever heard in my life. This is the most important key that absolutely ruin this series in my opinion. First, characters usually talk nonsense and metaphoric which kind of annoying and irritating and actually extend the running time to become a boring mess that ruin both tone and story progression and development. Second, this series are extremely over dramatic because of dialogues alone as every characters usually talk like they want to punch each other face for all the time. They insulted and roasted each other for absolutely no reason which even make plots and sequences look so much pandering and fan-service which some time even extend the length of dramatic tone to the maximum limit that later destroyed other tone and plot as well. Third, characters usually repeat the same thing they have been speak and think for several time for no reason which even make this series so long and boring.4.) Scenes and plots arrangements, pacing and even execution in this series aren’t very good at all. In fact most of them look so confused and hard to tell what viewers should actually focus at the very moment. They are too cramped for the starter. In one episode they have over 100 plots going around and none of them have an impact on each others. Also these plots are always appear randomly with no enough development and subtlety. They cut so many tone and story of an important point that viewers kind of care for the most of time and even make the overall episode to be much more chaotic and confused. Additionally, the storytelling and pacing in this series is sometime totally bad in terms of timing, cliffhanging and swapping. They are so many plot points that are telling in those stage which quite annoying and irritating for those viewers who doesn’t want to watch the three kingdom of badminton.5.) There are so many stereotype of characters that viewers can actually see and predict their plot for a mile away and even stay the same with no developments or changes during the entire run. The hard strong shounen women who doesn't know how to give up and extremely hot-blood. The want to be winner innocent character. The senpai lover. The girl who look kind and nice outside but her life is very sad. Everything you can easily guess.6.) This series is easily predictable. Nothing significantly going on during the entire run rather than things that you might seen and think since the very beginning of the series about girls who want to play sport (and win) so much which in each episode will have dramas as a layer to it as always and in the end will conclude with we are friend now kind of cliche'. Furthermore, every morals in each plot arcs (yes, the entire 2-3 episodic sequences) are actually the same. This is so boring in both short and long running viewing experiences. Watching this series only in the beginning and the last would actually give you the same result you want as watching the entire series.And that's all my opinion why this series is so bad even though it has very good productions. If the main important characteristic of the series, plot isn't compelling enough or even downright design to be fan service, then I have no reason to watch such failure series.The final score is 1/10. 1 score comes from quality animation productions alone."", ""Hanebado has proven to being one of the more unique, emotionally driven sports anime. What I mean by that is it tackles the genre by having a more serious tone, focusing on the ‘dark side’ of competitive sports that sports anime don't usually show. It doesn’t have those stupid “special moves” or fanservice crap you see in sports anime.Hanebado is basically a sports anime about badminton. Whilst saying that, I think one of the core strengths of the series is it focuses more on the characters, their inner struggles and overcoming their emotional tramua. Badminton is in a sense the platform to have to...have these characters interact and and advance the plot of the story.Plot: 8The foundation of the story revolves around two MCs who are depicted in the classic “talented prodigy Vs hardwork underdog” tale.The first is Ayano Hanesaki, a talented high school girl who was trained by her prodigy of a mother, and has years of built of tramua that are rooted from Ayano wanting to live up to her mother’s expectations who left her. The other is Aragaki, the head strong, hardworking team captain who has earned her stripes through hard work. While she does have her height at her advantage, she has no natural talent. It’s mentioned early on Hanesaki and Aragaki have a history playing each other in middle school. This event gave birth to a new rivalry/relationship between them. Aragaki, fuelled by her loss to Ayano, hardened herself to train harder.\u2028\u2028 These two depressing stories create a beautiful parallel between the girls, where they both ask themselves the question:“Why do you play badminton?”Characters: 8The characters are well written, diverse and memorable. Ayano’s rivals (Aragaki, Connie, Kaoruko) especially get fleshed out really well and get a good amount of character development (albeit Connie’s wasn’t the best executed and her changes come off a bit unrealistic imo). We get insight into their characters, their childhood, what shaped them to be the people they are now and their motivation to playing badminton.However, the ones who stand out and I’m most invested into are the main leads, who I think are brilliant characters. I love the fact that Ayano has a split personality and the way the show portrays the dichotomy between her shy, soft spoken self to this absolute merciless, monster on the court, which is entertaining to watch. It’s a unique and refreshing take on a MC that I haven’t seen in a sports anime.I know some may be turned off by “Darth Ayano” and think she’s edgy because of her blunt and rude attitude, her lack of sportsmanship or love for the sport she plays. However, I feel some people fail to grasp the depth of Ayano’s psychological tramua and how badly it’s affected her. Also, seeing Ayano slowly breaking out of her shell slowly and coming to accept her team in her character arc is brilliant to watch unfold.Animation: 10The visuals are beautiful. Every time I see a close up or zoom in of a badminton shot, I’m in awe of how absolutely stunning the animation is.Sound: 9The opening is probably my favourite out of all the anime I’ve watched this season. The OP is energetic, lively and upbeat. The chorus especially is catchy and fun.Overall: 7I liked Hanebado. It was one of my most anticipated anime I looked forward to watch of Summer 2018.While there’s some flaws, for example the input of excessive drama- while removing some of the comedic aspects and moments of lightheartedness were we see the team bonding in the manga annoyed me. The anime changing the characterisation of some of the characters e.g. Connie and Kaoruko, who were portrayed to being more of bitchy rivals to Ayano in order to further along the regression of her mental state so we see Darth Ayano sooner. Also, the overall direction/route it took in some scenes weren’t executed great and I thought were much better handled in the manga. I still think the show gets a lot of unnecessary flack.I’m glad it’s not all happy go lucky shit where the team all gets along and everyone has the same mentality reducing their personality to a ‘herd mentality’ like for instance, in Haikyuu. I don’t mean to throw shade at the show, I just think it’s too idealistic and unrealistic in the way it portrays how everyone puts the team first above themselves in any given situation. That’s why I like the interpersonal drama in Hanebado because it adds realism. Not everyone is going to get along, and their will be some conflict/drama that arises in competitive sports, but we accept each other’s flaws or weaknesses and move on. Here, the characters are treated as people with their own personalities and motivations that drive them to playing badminton, as well as being a team.I prefer the manga more, but that doesn’t change how much I love the amazing storytelling, visuals, beautifully animated matches, the techniques and information about badminton, and drama potrayed within the anime.

Gotta love the drama ;)"", 'No words could better describe this series than a progressive trainwreck of its characters, amidst the overall setting, and we literally just got so trolled over the fact that we don\'t ever know what this anime wants to be anymore. And that was the result of Hanebado!, a pretty intense yet mind-boggling series that has everyone calling foul over many issues that have since happened.Let\'s get the bad things out of the way, then we can end this on a good note. (Spoilers be warned)First off, it is the adaptation from the manga that immediately develops its own material while taking snippets from it. Immediately,...with how Episode 1 focuses on the introduction of Ayano Hanesaki, a normal looking high school girl with a hatred from playing badminton, and that was displayed magnificently. However, it is from there that the anime adaptation slowly leashes away from the light-hearted manga adaptation, and drops the ball, heavy and hard, on the original drama that we\'ve come to see throughout all this time.And that brings me to my next (and BIG) pointer: the biased character development.3 months of production runtime was more than enough to showcase every character\'s development of how they had persevered throughout timeless trials and tribulations, but somehow, series composer Taku Kishimoto (Joker Game, Erased, Haikyuu!!) had chosen the route that with the light-hearted manga source material, it wasn\'t good enough, so the heavy character drama was what we got instead, for good and for bad.Take our MC Ayano Hanesaki for example. She is the stereotypical character of a lunatic, that is not apparent at first, but throughout the series, we definitely can see why she has to act like a sovereign BS of a character that\'s crapping over everyone else, and that\'s due to her upbringing. WHICH immediately questions the single-handedly bashed neglected side of a perfection: her own mom Uchika. Every parent wants the best for their own children, but Uchika\'s actions paving the way for Ayano\'s devilish side is really pushing the extreme limits of a stereotypical adult teaching his/her own children of what to do and how to follow in their footsteps.Another hindrance followed with competitor Kaoruko Serigaya, wanting to compete dirty with the high consequence of getting Ayano sick and limiting her potential of losing the junior finals, adding onto that with Uchika\'s ""seeking for perfection"" causes her to abandon Ayano and find her next line of protégé (which resulted in another stranger, Connie Christensen). All that pent-up frustration is solely there to give the thought that Connie lives up to Uchika\'s name and Ayano being the back-burner is seriously excruciating enough. With that set in mind, Ayano has to work her way up again and regain her own neglected mom\'s very high expectations, to prove to her that no matter her growing-up years of staying away from badminton (and brought back by Elena), she still has the in-game going for her and hopefully her mom will recognize her again.The other characters had lesser screen-time to focus on their weaknesses and problems to eventually get better at their craft. One such side character, Nagisa Aragaki, falls into that pit. She lost to Ayano at the junior finals, and swore that she will never take anyone lightly, which explains her initial amounts of frustration for perfection from others that limits her potential. Only once did she start to understand that with strength comes confidence in playing better, then she is able to enjoy playing badminton (and that\'s for Episodes 1-3), and that sets the basis for future matches to try and outwit Ayano\'s prowess and play badminton her way. In the midst of focusing in both Ayano and Nagisa\'s efforts, the other members (mostly Riko who has been playing alongside Nagisa) of the Badminton club too have each of their shortcomings, but they do work hard (off-screen, that is) to also prove why they play badminton in the first place.Honestly, with so much that the anime has shown us, it almost felt like the character drama was very overbearing to the point where people started to drop this series, and honestly it\'s a very big flaw on the series overall. The (minimalistic) redeeming part is the small snippets that it actually adapts from the manga, but then again, the overarching mainstay of the drama still will force people to turn away with conviction.The best thing going for the series is the art and animation. As I\'ve mentioned before in my prelim review, the art is good, but the animation\'s way leaps and bounds better. The production staff at Liden Films really took extreme care to showcase the realism of the characters from the non-grotesque body motions to the 3DCG stop-gap motions of the badminton rackets and shuttlecock responses, so much so that it stands out from the get-go. And throughout both art and animation didn\'t let me down as it\'s mainly used for the badminton matches, which makes me wonder that if this aspect is meant to eclipse the over-the-top character drama that we had seen the ugliest of it. Which side wins, it\'s up to you to decide.On the music side, it helps that Kazuhiro Wakabayashi has maintained his flare when it comes to brilliant OSTs and his work here doesn\'t let us down as always. This is YURiKA\'s third OP (accounting for Little Witch Academia and Houseki no Kuni) and as nice as it sounds, it is nothing short of methodical and fantastic and was an OP that I couldn\'t afford to just skip and let loose. Alongside Yuiko Oohara whom has the same music repertoire with YURiKA (performing the same series songs, plus Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san\'s sweet OP), it was an excellent song through and through and really spoke life into the host of characters. Overall, another great strike for the win.Hanebado! as a series, it\'s very controversial as much as its realism depict and reflect the happenings of such sports in real life. The reasoning for not being able to follow in the parents\' footsteps, to one that eventually makes and breaks oneself is brutal AF (but definitely not the way to go), and I thought that it did justify the case studies of such family-based situations, and for what it does, it did a heck of a job (but not everyone\'s gonna take it well). So unless you care for such forced unnecessary drama, you can throw this series out of the bag. I never thought I would say this, but if drama is your forte like so many cringeworthy drama-based shows act like the way it should be, then this is your sauce.

If you ain\'t any match for drama, then why are you watching this?', ""“this badminton anime has had like 6 or 7 different characters break down crying in the first episode. badminton must be absolutely miserable” -@shaun_jenThe protagonist of a sports anime will typically have some talent that makes them eligible to be the protagonist – Kuroko lacks presence, Hinata jumps high, Sawamura has flexible wrists, and the list goes on. This is an ability that they have, that no one else will be able to develop, no matter how hard they try, and it’s what gives them the edge over their competition. Hanasaki Ayano has every talent there could be when it comes to badminton – handedness,...reflexes, etc – though it’s never quite that simple.Ayano isn’t just talented; she’s also worked hard to hone her skills through a childhood of practicing against her mother Uchika, a champion at the sport. However, said mother’s love was conditional on whether she was able to beat her peers, which forced Ayano into a mindset of viewing the game only in terms of winning and losing, and destroyed her ability to simply enjoy the sport or have any respect for her opponents. Ayano plays not for a love of the game, but for her mother’s approval, and the only joy she seems to find in it is the sadistic glee of destroying those who dare believe that hard work will get them anywhere.So, what about hard work? Luckily, Ayano isn’t really the protagonist of Hanebado – that honor goes to Ayano’s senior and rival, Aragaki Nagisa. Aragaki is definitely talented (though not on the same level as Ayano), but her true strengths lie in the effort that she puts into every match she plays and her love of the sport. That said, this effort often crosses the line into self-destruction, so her behavior isn’t to be emulated either, even if it is a step above Ayano’s. Still, she embodies the ideals that hard work and perseverance are able to overcome talent, and that winning isn't all that matters, and for that, the show roots for her.In the end, Hanebado is a messy show. It challenges the quixotic foundation of the sports anime, and while it ultimately affirms it, it only is able to do so by being willfully ignorant of its own flaws. It can be repetitive in its ideas, and often borders on melodrama. But for all of its missteps, Hanebado also gets a lot right. The animation for the badminton matches is stunning, and it nails the catharsis factor that’s essential for any successful sports series. If you're looking for a sports series with more focus of the drama outside of the game, and you're willing to deal with tonal whiplash and other issues, then Hanebado might be the show for you. reflexes, etc – though it’s never quite that simple.Ayano isn’t just talented; she’s also worked hard to hone her skills through a childhood of practicing against her mother Uchika, a champion at the sport.

This anime has come under a lot of praise and criticism since it first released this summer. Some have praised it for its realism while others have criticised it for bad writing and character inconsistencies. For me though, I’m actually really happy with the way this anime went. I got invested in this show because there’s a lot I can relate to. To give us out some serious talk, all us have had some kind of issue growing up especially with our parents. Now granted, most of us didn’t have the kind of issue that Ayano has with her mother, but the anime gives...a good example of what happens when you make a bad decision that has a long lasting effect along with showing just how bad life can get. This is the reason why so many people are so frustrated with this show.And I get it. No honestly, I do. I get why people wouldn’t like this show because most of us have never experienced the kind of hardships that Ayano has been through. Most have never even experienced the pain or fear of abandonment. Simply put, the people who hate this show comes from a lack of experience themselves, not because they’re bad people themselves. That’s why I like this show so much. The writers were not afraid to tell this story the way they did instead of playing it safe, even at the risk of being heavily criticized themselves. It’s easy for the younger anime fans to criticize these things because they have yet to experience real hardships themselves. On the other hand though, it’s easy for the adults, the older fans, to forget that they were once teenagers themselves. And since the majority of anime characters are teenagers, we as a whole tend to forget that at that age we are bound to make more mistakes than we would as an adult.The thing you need to understand about Hanebado is that this is not a typical moe show with cute girls doing cute things while all sharing the same passion like Harukana Receive or Yuru Camp. And while this anime is about badminton, the sport is not the main focus of the story. In fact, it never has been. This isn’t a sports story with a bunch of drama thrown in, this is a character driven story that is mainly about one character’s tragic journey with badminton being her driving force. The sport itself acts both as a subplot and a driving force for its characters. Every major character you see has their own story to tell. What they went through to get where they are, what hardships they had to face, and ultimately how they feel about each other.To give some comparisons, Hanebado shares a lot of parallels to the Rocky movies, specifically the first two, and it’s story is essentially the dark side of the those film. While Rocky Balboa was on quest to prove himself, Ayano is on a quest for revenge. Additionally, many characters in Hanebado represent other characters in the Rocky films, with some obvious differences of course. To truly understand Hanebado and the story it’s trying to tell, we have to look at every character individually. Which is why for this review, instead of doing my usual EASY TO UNDERSTAND kind of thing, I am going to talk about every who has played some role in Ayano’s life. On that note this will not include Nagisa or Nozomi because both of them virtually have nothing to do with Ayano. Hopefully, even if you still don’t like this show after this review, one day you will come to understand and perhaps even appreciate it because as we get older we begin to have a better understanding or not just fictional characters, but the human mind as well.KAORUKO SERIGAYA - The Arch NemesisLet’s start with the one who inadvertently started the whole thing. When we first see Kaoruko she immediately strikes you as a person who is very arrogant, very disrespectful, and perhaps a little crazy. Her history with Ayano is that of a classic arch nemesis. Being one of the earliest of Ayano’s opponents, Kaoruko was unable to beat her until she deliberately got Ayano sick with her cold, sabotaging their match while using the excuse that she wanted to fight on even terms. Because of that, Ayano ended losing, something that would a devastating effect on her. A few years later she shows up at Ayano’s school unannounced and challenges Ayano, beating not through skill but through psychology.So in the beginning it’s easy to dislike Kaoruko. She intimidates her opponents by talking down on them, making them feel that they’re no match for her. She even trash talks her own teammates. However, there’s a lot more to Kaoruko than you realize for she is essentially the Apollo Creed of this anime. In the Rocky movies Apollo also liked to brag and trash talked his opponents, but he also had the means to back it up. He didn’t become the heavyweight champion for nothing, he did it by doing the work that was required. Kaoruko is exactly the same way. She may be rude and disrespectful, but she didn’t get where she was by doing nothing. She’s worked harder than any other player on her team. She doesn’t play badminton for popularity points. She plays it because she wants to, and she wants to be the best out there. She’s earned the right to brag and trash talk.But of course, her arrogance eventually got the better of her. In her second official match with Ayano, she made the mistake of thinking she was facing the exact same opponent. Well, she soon found out she was wrong and lost because of it. However, she didn’t go down without a fight and this is where I really do admire her. Like Apollo, she’s very knowledgeable about the sport she plays. In addition, she does have a cute side to her which is shown when she develops a schoolgirl crush on Ayano’s badminton coach. However, when it comes to badminton she gets serious. When she realizes she is not facing the same Ayano from before, she changes her strategy. She uses all her knowledge of badminton in a effort to beat her opponent, believing that she can win after falling behind. All the work she’s put in shows, to the point that even her teammates, who she was rude to before, can’t help but cheer her on. But in the end, it’s not enough and she loses, her pride being further damaged by Ayano’s own trash talk.Now you can say that she had it coming, and she did, but I like to believe that her loss against Ayano finally showed her that she wasn’t invincible, that she was as vulnerable as every other player, and that she finally accepted her human. This may sound crazy but I actually consider Kaoruko to be the best girl of the anime. The reason why I believe that is because in that final scene when she broke down after her loss, it showed me that beneath all that arrogance there is a sweet girl there. The problem is that she lacks the social skills to really express them. So in the end, Kaoruko is not an evil person. Arrogant, yes, but not evil. And she actually respects Ayano because she is the reason she works really hard to perfect her skills. And again, she may have started the whole thing with Ayano, however she is not directly responsible for Ayano’s mother leaving. And speaking of which, let’s now shift our focus to…UCHIKA HANESAKI - Worst Mother Of The YearWe have every reason to hate this character, for under no circumstances should a parent ever abandon a child. However, I disagree with everyone who says that she is a terrible person. A terrible mother, definitely, but not a terrible person. The thing you need to understand about Uchika is that she is a badminton fanatic. To her, badminton is her life to the point where it’s her obsession. It consumes her everyday thought. And when you look at her past, it’s understandable. She was a ten time national champion… who suddenly became pregnant and had a child. Now we don’t know what the exact circumstances were leading to her pregnancy, but even though her life had suddenly changed her obsession with badminton didn’t. And sadly there’s a lot of parents in the real world who are like this.When you’ve had such a successful career in whatever your profession is, settling down and starting a family is the furthest thing in your mind. You’re either ready for it, or you’re not. And that’s the thing with Uchika, she was simply not ready to become a mother yet because her mind was always on badminton even when she was pregnant with Ayano. This carried on through Ayano’s childhood and later Connie’s. In every scene Uchika is in, flashback or otherwise, she is always talking about something related to badminton. It’s never about them. Heck, she doesn’t even see them as her daughters or even as children. She sees them as her proteges. She doesn’t see herself as a mother, she sees herself as a coach. It doesn’t mean she didn’t love them any less, it’s that she doesn’t know how to be a mother. Her obsession with badminton is her undoing.Her leaving Ayano initially wasn’t because of Ayano, it was because of herself. When Ayano lost, her badminton mind told her that she had failed as coach. Because of that, she leaves Ayano to relieve her frustration by training her other student Connie but ended staying longer than she planned when Connie started to show potential. Again, her mind is always on badminton. Later on, we discover that the real reason was because she wanted Ayano to develop her skills on her own without having to rely on her. Now of course, this doesn’t excuse her actions but when you look at her character it does make sense and she even acknowledges that she’s been a terrible mother. A terrible person wouldn’t say that. In families who are financially successful, especially the very rich ones, more often than not we see the children of those families grow into spoiled brats, sometimes even violent ones. This is because either the parents are spoiled brats themselves or were so focused of their lives and careers they ended up neglecting their own children. In the case of Ayano and her mother’s successful career, who’s to say Ayano wouldn’t have turn out the same way if she continued to cling to Uchika?When you really think about, Ayano’s strained relationship with her mother is not much different from Indiana Jones and his strained relationship with his father. Both their parents are very much alike and yet they were both trying to teach their children to rely on themselves rather than their parents. Henry Jones ignored his son for the most part partly due to his obsession with the Holy Grail while Uchika took the more extreme method by leaving Ayano behind. Both had the same idea, but Uchika’s method was entirely wrong and she knows it, but again her mind is always on badminton. Her decision has left a permanent scar on Ayano, one that she will have to deal with one day. Luckily for Ayano, she had at her side…ELENA FUJISAWA - The Childhood FriendAt this point in time Elena was the closest person to Ayano after Uchika’s departure. She had tried to support Ayano the best that she could as a friend though. In a way, she’s essentially Mickey Goldmill, Rocky’s original trainer. Her mistake though was that she didn’t fully understand Ayano’s trauma with her abandonment. You see, a lot of people claim that Elena is entirely at fault for bringing Ayano back into badminton when she didn’t want to when in truth it wasn’t because how was she supposed to know what was going to happen to Ayano? Simple, she couldn’t have and it’s because she didn’t know about Uchika’s other student Connie.The reason why she forcibly brought Ayano back into the sport of badminton was she because she felt that Ayano’s reason was very foolish, and I agree with her. Why should you abandon the sport you love so much just because you’re mother left you? Elena is basically trying to tell Ayano that, “Hey, there are better ways to play badminton. Forget about your mother. Play for yourself, or better yet, play for a team.”. Elena was simply doing was friends do, helping her friend out by telling Ayano she shouldn’t give up her passion just because her mother. And in the first five episodes, Ayano begins to see a new light in the sport. She begins to enjoy it again and becomes fascinated with the idea of being with a team. Elena had done her job by bringing happiness to Ayano again and all was going well. That is until the sudden and unexpected arrival of…CONNIE CHRISTENSEN - The Other ProtegeNow Connie is the most misunderstood character in this anime. A Danish girl who is rather tall, she was trained by Uchika at an early age due to the overseas trips Uchika often took. People write off this character because of how she initially treats Ayano and for her sudden character shifts. I understand perfectly well why people really dislike this character. However, the reason for the dislike isn’t necessarily because of bad writing, but rather the anime’s poor execution of her character especially when she tries to be nicer to Ayano. For me though, Connie is the character I feel the most sorry for because she is basically the innocent victim in this story. Granted, she pretty much brought on herself but let me try to explain Connie’s character as best I can.The thing about Connie is that she’s very competitive when it comes to badminton. Her coach Uchika is also very competitive in badminton, so naturally she assumed Ayano would be the same. Like Kaoruko, she wants to prove that she’s the best in the sport but the big difference is that she has a more personal reason. She wants to prove that she’s the better student of Uchika’s two proteges. In a competitive sport like badminton where you’ve been trained by the same teacher this is a perfectly normal thing to do. Who wouldn’t want to prove who’s the best of the two? The problem was that Connie was overcome by her overeagerness to prove herself. While it’s never shown in the anime it’s heavily implied that Uchika did not want Connie to face Ayano just yet. Whether this was because Ayano would beat her easily or because she wouldn’t take to well with suddenly having a stepsister is uncertain, but given Uchika’s character it was quite likely both.Now some of you I’m sure are asking about Connie sudden request for Ayano to accept her as her sister instead of her rival when she was so hostile towards her in the beginning. Well, to understand that you have to look at Connie’s own past for it’s very similar to Ayano’s. Through her flashbacks we see that Connie had lived a very lonely life in her childhood. Every scene we see her she is always alone. We’re never shown why exactly that but considering she was living in a very nice house it’s safe to assume that she had parents that virtually ignored her and not because she was an orphan. She developed a passion for badminton but this did little to cure the loneliness in her heart. Then comes Uchika, who not only becomes her coach but takes her in as her daughter. Despite Uchika’s faults, this is one of the kindest things she’s even done even though it would later have a devastating effect on Ayano.The reason for Connie’s initial hostility isn’t actually directed Ayano personally, but rather at the idea of being part of a team as shown in their first match. This has nothing to do with any so called rivalry, it’s actually has to with Connie’s insecurity. When you look at her past, it makes a lot of sense. Given the lonely life she’s gone through she’s pretty much taught herself that she doesn’t need to rely on others. However, deep down she wants to be part of Ayano’s family, but now that Ayano is adopting a new family with her team Connie considers this to be a threat. When she realize she that she wasn’t alone through her teammates, she discovered that her entire thinking was wrong and she tried to make up with Ayano. At least, that was the intention. The problem was that the anime didn’t execute very well which is why her sudden change came off as both unrealistic and unbelievable to many. However, by the time she realized this the it was already too late. Her declaration to Ayano about being Uchika’s second daughter ended causing much more damage to their relationship than she realized.Connie’s mistake though was that she rushed in without thinking. Her even bigger mistake was on how little she knew about Ayano. She only knew what Uchika had told her and had assumed that Ayano would be no different from her. What she didn’t know was the fact that Uchika had abandoned Ayano and that it had left a very deep scar. She didn’t know about Ayano’s mental state until she actually saw it for herself. And when she did, it scared the living hell out her. All of a sudden she found herself right in the middle of ugly family feud, something she wanted no part of. She could have attempted to apologize to Ayano for her reckless behavior, but at that point Ayano had already gone over the edge. Yes, she may have cause it but again this was due to how little she knew about Ayano. Any apology now won’t do her any good. This was now Ayano’s and Uchika’s problem. They have to sort it out themselves. Luckily for Connie, she had her teammates to support her. And now let’s finally talk about…AYANO HANESAKI - The Near TragedyAyano’s story is a very sad one. It is a perfect representation of someone who fell to the dark side. To quote the famous words from Jedi Master Yoda:“Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.”One thing these characters all have in common is the fear of losing, which is quite common in single player competitive sports. All of us who are very passionate about sports hate the thought of losing. It is a bitter pill to swallow. But for Ayano, it’s a much more personal reason.Ayano’s fear started when she lost to Kaoruko and that loss was greatly magnified when she sees her mother literally walk out of her life. No phone calls, no letters, no communication of any kind, nothing. She believed she lost her mother because her loss to Kaoruko was too much Uchika to bear, not knowing the real reason behind it. Because of this, she was afraid she was never see her mother again. She convinced herself that the only way she can get her mother back was by winning again. Winning every game she played would bring her closer to her mother. Any loss would take her further away, so losing for her was not an option. And that’s exactly what she did, she turned into a badminton monster. Then one evening she sees a badminton magazine with Uchika on the cover, the very first time she’s had any contact with her mother. However, when she opens the magazine she see a picture of her mother with a stranger at her side, kissing her on the cheek along with a quote that she won her championship thanks to Uchika as her coach. It is here that Ayano’s fear turns to anger. To her, it is the ultimate betrayal.Luckily she was able to put aside her anger by pursuing other sports such as tennis, as we saw in the beginning, only to be dragged back into badminton by Elena for reasons I’ve already stated. Understandably, she was nothing to do with the sport she once loved. Before then she only playing in the hopes she would get her mother. Now that she knows that Uchika has another student, she no longer has a reason to play. At this point, she feels she’s lost everything. Her rematch against Nagisa reminds her of her loss against Kaoruko. Then Kaoruko herself shows up and Ayano tries to quit the badminton club after Kaoruko beats her again, and then later on when she loses against Connie she nearly suffers a mental breakdown. She tries to make excuses for it but then runs away. However, before that game happened she was beginning to see badminton in a new light. She was beginning to fascinated with the idea of playing for a team. Unfortunately, Connie’s untimely arrival would destroy whatever hope Ayano had from saving herself from her anger. When Connie declared that Uchika was her substitute mother and she was going prove her worth over Ayano, this finally pushes Ayano over the edge. Her anger has now turned into hatred. She now wants revenge for all the suffering she’s gone through.Elena is the first to see Ayano’s yandere like eyes and it scares the living hell out of her. The sweet little girl that she knew from childhood was no longer there. It was now replaced by this monster who is out for revenge. At this point, Ayano wants the people who put her through all this suffering to pay for it. She starts with Kaoruko, the one who again inadvertently started it all. As mentioned before, Kaoruko made the mistake of thinking she was facing the same opponent. But at this point, Ayano’s quest for revenge was in full force. While Kaoruko did fight until the very end, she was no match for this new version of Ayano. All the trash talk she had gave Ayano earlier was thrown right back into her face and it really hurt her pride. Ayano’s next target would be Connie, possibly followed by Uchika who she intends to abandon in the end. She wants to prove that she no longer needs her mother. However, she will have to get one last obstacle who is in the form of Nagisa.To give an comparison, Ayano in the beginning is very much like John Rambo. In the movie First Blood, Rambo was both abandoned and betrayed by his country simply he was a Vietnam War veteran. He was alone and very depressed. He virtually had no reason to go on. Ayano is very much the same. She was abandoned by her mother for no good reason and later on she lost the will to play badminton. Then Rambo finally snaps due to his mistreatment from police and goes on rampage for survival. The same thing happens to Ayano after Connie’s declaration, except this time it’s more personal. Ayano essentially becomes a more extreme version Clubber Lang from Rocky III. Like Clubber, she develops a very cold and arrogant personality. She treats everyone like they’re below her, even her own teammates. She’s no longer interested in teams, she’s only interested in playing the actually good players with the intent of destroying them entirely and then giving payback to both Connie and her mother.IN CONCLUSIONDespite these great characters and a really powerful storyline, I'm really disappointed with how this anime ended. I had hoped for, and even wanted, a second season. With the way the story was going, I just didn't believe that LINDEN FILMS wouldn't end the way it did. Unfortunately though, that was too much to ask and the ending we got I felt was both underwhelming and it made the story feel incomplete.While I didn't expect Ayano to forgive her mother right away, she really learn anything throughout her experience through the whole series. It pretty ended the way it started. Nothing was really resolved between Ayano, her mother, Connie, and to lesser extent Kaoruko. It was just left the way it was, leaving you feeling really unsatisfied. Worse yet, Ayano is still in her her crazed state. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see Ayano go completely to the dark side, but I would like to see some kind of redemption.The best characters, heroic characters that is, are the ones who make a mistake, a very big mistake, and then go on a journey to redeem themselves and to make things right again. For this anime I felt that some major tragedy should have befallen Ayano, one that finally wakes her up from her craze state. I knew her being beaten by Nagisa might have some impact, but not one powerful enough to really get through to her.I would have liked this better if season one ended on a tragic note and then season two picks up right where it left off with Ayano going on mission to redeem herself while receiving help from a completely unexpected source and ending with her biggest and most important match against Connie. And it the end, all are able to forgive each other and peace is brought back into their small world. That would have been a much more satisfying ending, at least for me.Overall, Hanebado! is not a bad anime, but a really underwhelming one. The story and characters are great despite some poor executions. However, the ending does not doe the story justice for how it resolves some things but leaves others unresolved. A prime example of wasted potential. This anime deserved a second season, but sadly it's unlikely we'll ever get one.I'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned! a good example of what happens when you make a bad decision that has a long lasting effect along with showing just how bad life can get. This is the reason why so many people are so frustrated with this show.And I get it. No honestly, I do. I get why people wouldn’t like this show because most of us have never experienced the kind of hardships that Ayano has been through. Most have never even experienced the pain or fear of abandonment. Simply put, the people who hate this show comes from a lack of experience themselves, not because they’re bad people themselves. That’s why I like this show so much. The writers were not afraid to tell this story the way they did instead of playing it safe, even at the risk of being heavily criticized themselves. It’s easy for the younger anime fans to criticize these things because they have yet to experience real hardships themselves. On the other hand though, it’s easy for the adults, the older fans, to forget that they were once teenagers themselves. And since the majority of anime characters are teenagers, we as a whole tend to forget that at that age we are bound to make more mistakes than we would as an adult.The thing you need to understand about Hanebado is that this is not a typical moe show with cute girls doing cute things while all sharing the same passion like Harukana Receive or Yuru Camp. And while this anime is about badminton, the sport is not the main focus of the story. In fact, it never has been. This isn’t a sports story with a bunch of drama thrown in, this is a character driven story that is mainly about one character’s tragic journey with badminton being her driving force. The sport itself acts both as a subplot and a driving force for its characters. Every major character you see has their own story to tell. What they went through to get where they are, what hardships they had to face, and ultimately how they feel about each other.To give some comparisons, Hanebado shares a lot of parallels to the Rocky movies, specifically the first two, and it’s story is essentially the dark side of the those film. While Rocky Balboa was on quest to prove himself, Ayano is on a quest for revenge. Additionally, many characters in Hanebado represent other characters in the Rocky films, with some obvious differences of course. To truly understand Hanebado and the story it’s trying to tell, we have to look at every character individually. Which is why for this review, instead of doing my usual EASY TO UNDERSTAND kind of thing, I am going to talk about every who has played some role in Ayano’s life. On that note this will not include Nagisa or Nozomi because both of them virtually have nothing to do with Ayano. Hopefully, even if you still don’t like this show after this review, one day you will come to understand and perhaps even appreciate it because as we get older we begin to have a better understanding or not just fictional characters, but the human mind as well.KAORUKO SERIGAYA - The Arch NemesisLet’s start with the one who inadvertently started the whole thing. When we first see Kaoruko she immediately strikes you as a person who is very arrogant, very disrespectful, and perhaps a little crazy. Her history with Ayano is that of a classic arch nemesis. Being one of the earliest of Ayano’s opponents, Kaoruko was unable to beat her until she deliberately got Ayano sick with her cold, sabotaging their match while using the excuse that she wanted to fight on even terms. Because of that, Ayano ended losing, something that would a devastating effect on her. A few years later she shows up at Ayano’s school unannounced and challenges Ayano, beating not through skill but through psychology.So in the beginning it’s easy to dislike Kaoruko. She intimidates her opponents by talking down on them, making them feel that they’re no match for her. She even trash talks her own teammates. However, there’s a lot more to Kaoruko than you realize for she is essentially the Apollo Creed of this anime. In the Rocky movies Apollo also liked to brag and trash talked his opponents, but he also had the means to back it up. He didn’t become the heavyweight champion for nothing, he did it by doing the work that was required. Kaoruko is exactly the same way. She may be rude and disrespectful, but she didn’t get where she was by doing nothing. She’s worked harder than any other player on her team. She doesn’t play badminton for popularity points. She plays it because she wants to, and she wants to be the best out there. She’s earned the right to brag and trash talk.But of course, her arrogance eventually got the better of her. In her second official match with Ayano, she made the mistake of thinking she was facing the exact same opponent. Well, she soon found out she was wrong and lost because of it. However, she didn’t go down without a fight and this is where I really do admire her. Like Apollo, she’s very knowledgeable about the sport she plays. In addition, she does have a cute side to her which is shown when she develops a schoolgirl crush on Ayano’s badminton coach. However, when it comes to badminton she gets serious. When she realizes she is not facing the same Ayano from before, she changes her strategy. She uses all her knowledge of badminton in a effort to beat her opponent, believing that she can win after falling behind. All the work she’s put in shows, to the point that even her teammates, who she was rude to before, can’t help but cheer her on. But in the end, it’s not enough and she loses, her pride being further damaged by Ayano’s own trash talk.Now you can say that she had it coming, and she did, but I like to believe that her loss against Ayano finally showed her that she wasn’t invincible, that she was as vulnerable as every other player, and that she finally accepted her human. This may sound crazy but I actually consider Kaoruko to be the best girl of the anime. The reason why I believe that is because in that final scene when she broke down after her loss, it showed me that beneath all that arrogance there is a sweet girl there. The problem is that she lacks the social skills to really express them. So in the end, Kaoruko is not an evil person. Arrogant, yes, but not evil. And she actually respects Ayano because she is the reason she works really hard to perfect her skills. And again, she may have started the whole thing with Ayano, however she is not directly responsible for Ayano’s mother leaving. And speaking of which, let’s now shift our focus to…UCHIKA HANESAKI - Worst Mother Of The YearWe have every reason to hate this character, for under no circumstances should a parent ever abandon a child.

Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.”One thing these characters all have in common is the fear of losing, which is quite common in single player competitive sports. All of us who are very passionate about sports hate the thought of losing. It is a bitter pill to swallow. But for Ayano, it’s a much more personal reason.Ayano’s fear started when she lost to Kaoruko and that loss was greatly magnified when she sees her mother literally walk out of her life. No phone calls, no letters, no communication of any kind, nothing. She believed she lost her mother because her loss to Kaoruko was too much Uchika to bear, not knowing the real reason behind it. Because of this, she was afraid she was never see her mother again. She convinced herself that the only way she can get her mother back was by winning again. Winning every game she played would bring her closer to her mother. Any loss would take her further away, so losing for her was not an option. And that’s exactly what she did, she turned into a badminton monster. Then one evening she sees a badminton magazine with Uchika on the cover, the very first time she’s had any contact with her mother. However, when she opens the magazine she see a picture of her mother with a stranger at her side, kissing her on the cheek along with a quote that she won her championship thanks to Uchika as her coach. It is here that Ayano’s fear turns to anger. To her, it is the ultimate betrayal.Luckily she was able to put aside her anger by pursuing other sports such as tennis, as we saw in the beginning, only to be dragged back into badminton by Elena for reasons I’ve already stated. Understandably, she was nothing to do with the sport she once loved. Before then she only playing in the hopes she would get her mother. Now that she knows that Uchika has another student, she no longer has a reason to play. At this point, she feels she’s lost everything. Her rematch against Nagisa reminds her of her loss against Kaoruko. Then Kaoruko herself shows up and Ayano tries to quit the badminton club after Kaoruko beats her again, and then later on when she loses against Connie she nearly suffers a mental breakdown. She tries to make excuses for it but then runs away. However, before that game happened she was beginning to see badminton in a new light. She was beginning to fascinated with the idea of playing for a team. Unfortunately, Connie’s untimely arrival would destroy whatever hope Ayano had from saving herself from her anger. When Connie declared that Uchika was her substitute mother and she was going prove her worth over Ayano, this finally pushes Ayano over the edge. Her anger has now turned into hatred. She now wants revenge for all the suffering she’s gone through.Elena is the first to see Ayano’s yandere like eyes and it scares the living hell out of her. The sweet little girl that she knew from childhood was no longer there. It was now replaced by this monster who is out for revenge. At this point, Ayano wants the people who put her through all this suffering to pay for it. She starts with Kaoruko, the one who again inadvertently started it all. As mentioned before, Kaoruko made the mistake of thinking she was facing the same opponent. But at this point, Ayano’s quest for revenge was in full force. While Kaoruko did fight until the very end, she was no match for this new version of Ayano. All the trash talk she had gave Ayano earlier was thrown right back into her face and it really hurt her pride. Ayano’s next target would be Connie, possibly followed by Uchika who she intends to abandon in the end. She wants to prove that she no longer needs her mother. However, she will have to get one last obstacle who is in the form of Nagisa.To give an comparison, Ayano in the beginning is very much like John Rambo. In the movie First Blood, Rambo was both abandoned and betrayed by his country simply he was a Vietnam War veteran. He was alone and very depressed. He virtually had no reason to go on. Ayano is very much the same. She was abandoned by her mother for no good reason and later on she lost the will to play badminton. Then Rambo finally snaps due to his mistreatment from police and goes on rampage for survival. The same thing happens to Ayano after Connie’s declaration, except this time it’s more personal. Ayano essentially becomes a more extreme version Clubber Lang from Rocky III. Like Clubber, she develops a very cold and arrogant personality. She treats everyone like they’re below her, even her own teammates. She’s no longer interested in teams, she’s only interested in playing the actually good players with the intent of destroying them entirely and then giving payback to both Connie and her mother.IN CONCLUSIONDespite these great characters and a really powerful storyline, I'm really disappointed with how this anime ended. I had hoped for, and even wanted, a second season. With the way the story was going, I just didn't believe that LINDEN FILMS wouldn't end the way it did. Unfortunately though, that was too much to ask and the ending we got I felt was both underwhelming and it made the story feel incomplete.While I didn't expect Ayano to forgive her mother right away, she really learn anything throughout her experience through the whole series. It pretty ended the way it started. Nothing was really resolved between Ayano, her mother, Connie, and to lesser extent Kaoruko. It was just left the way it was, leaving you feeling really unsatisfied. Worse yet, Ayano is still in her her crazed state. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see Ayano go completely to the dark side, but I would like to see some kind of redemption.The best characters, heroic characters that is, are the ones who make a mistake, a very big mistake, and then go on a journey to redeem themselves and to make things right again. For this anime I felt that some major tragedy should have befallen Ayano, one that finally wakes her up from her craze state. I knew her being beaten by Nagisa might have some impact, but not one powerful enough to really get through to her.I would have liked this better if season one ended on a tragic note and then season two picks up right where it left off with Ayano going on mission to redeem herself while receiving help from a completely unexpected source and ending with her biggest and most important match against Connie. And it the end, all are able to forgive each other and peace is brought back into their small world. That would have been a much more satisfying ending, at least for me.Overall, Hanebado! is not a bad anime, but a really underwhelming one. The story and characters are great despite some poor executions. However, the ending does not doe the story justice for how it resolves some things but leaves others unresolved. A prime example of wasted potential. This anime deserved a second season, but sadly it's unlikely we'll ever get one.I'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!"", 'I honestly don\'t know why I bothered finishing this. As a child I grew up with Badminton so to see the first two episodes portraying the sport in such an ugly fashion put me off it for a while before I continued. But here we are and let\'s have a chat on Hanebado. (Insert joke about how you can\'t spell ""Hanebado"" without ""bad"" here).I\'ve watched two sports anime this season based on fanservice-heavy manga. The other one being Harukana Receive. While I can\'t comment exactly on how faithful each adaptation is, I would\'ve much preferred Harukana\'s approach to the genre. That is to say a...generic, but decently done sports anime on friendship happiness puppies sunshine and all that nonsense with a heavy dose of fanservice and waku waku shequasars. On paper, Hanebado\'s approach of forgoing most of the fanservice and light-hearted moments and instead zeroing in on the drama and misery seems right up my alley. After all, Ayano\'s character is defined essentially by her abandonment by her mother. However, in execution it just doesn\'t cut it for me.My largest complaint about the series is its lack of focus. From the first 2 episodes focused almost exclusively on Nagisa\'s development to the point of making her seem like the main character (she\'s not, but she\'s still the most important secondary character), to the side stories on sausage girl and senpai boy which I frankly don\'t give much a toss on about, the series feels somewhat schizophrenic when it comes to its plot. While ostensibly about Ayanon, she doesn\'t make much of an impact up until episode 5. I will say however I did enjoy Ayanon\'s drive and character study, especially the drama surrounding her and her shit mother, though the resolution to that in the final episode is a complete copout.Speaking of characters, they are either hate-sinks or mostly forgettable. They change personality so quick you\'d swear they were bipolar. Prime examples include Connie and Kaoruko where after taunting Ayano several times they show up a few episodes later wanting to be good friends? And to have Ayanon forget all the shit they\'ve done?? What!? You can\'t just take a shit on my lawn and say you wanna be friends me while I\'m bashing your head in with a badminton racket the next day. Good thing Ayano\'s one of the few characters with consistent personality. Her anger doesn\'t dissipate and the comeuppance she serves is cathartic. You can feel her breaking point and her insanity leaking out at any moment. It\'s brilliant. The horror music too perfectly ramps things up a notch. Making this my second favourite unintentional comedy of the season (the other being Happy Sugar Life). Though speaking of Happy Sugar Life, it\'s awful how Ayanon\'s mother came out unscathed and without any karmic retribution or even any lasting hatred from Ayanon.The audio design in this is pretty bad too. A lot of the times the BGM can overpower the lines of dialogue spoken by the characters. Especially when the horror strings are playing. Ayano with her softer voice is the prime victim in this. It always feels like her voice lines are played loud enough to be heard with any clarity, even when she’s shouting.At times I do wonder if the director actually hates the sport. Badminton is portrayed as a really ugly thing in this, being the driving force behind Ayano\'s trauma and the source of many conflicts throughout. Matches are animated well enough, and they don\'t bore me to the extent of how Harukana\'s did, but honestly the characters behind the net ruin the experience for me. Being the horrible people they are.Oh well. I wonder if Yonex ever regrets sponsoring this.3/10.

I’ve never seen a supposedly character-driven show fail so hard on every plot-related aspect while acing everything else.The OP drew me in with its slick, beautiful animation and the charming smile of Ayano Hanesaki. Unfortunately, upon finishing (or near-finishing) this show, the only positive impressions I was left with were indeed the animation and Ayano Hanesaki.Hanebado! seemingly wants to depict the growth of Ayano and her counterpart Nagisa into badminton players who play with a happy, healthy mindset. Yet while it...sets that up decently, every step along the way is fumbled. Most damning of all (and it’s hard to pick any one thing here) is the treatment of Ayano. Ayano is depicted as a girl with massive trauma lying underneath her seemingly cute, innocent surface. She’s been abandoned by her mother because of her inability as a child to be a perfect badminton robot and as a result, playing badminton reverts the paltry progress she’s made into having feelings or developing a persona separate from vying for approval from her only caregiver, even if it’s stunted, childish, and a little backwards. It’s actually a nuanced and realistic portrayal of childhood trauma that I deeply relate with.Somehow, every single character watches her relive her trauma and shift back into a zombie who plays solely to avoid being abandoned and to create some feeble sense of self-worth, with snark and arrogance as her only defense, and NOBODY HELPS WHATSOEVER. As they witness this descent that they themselves brought upon her, her clubmates fail to see that she needs people to care about her and react to her with jealousy and hostility as soon as she really begins falling apart, her coach gives up on projecting his failed Olympic dreams into her when she fails to have any emotional response towards them and dismisses all her hard work as “natural talent”, her best friend doesn’t realize she needs to take responsibility for pushing Ayano into this until the very end, and worst of all— her mother. The story idea of “I’m a poor trauma survivor and everybody hates me” isn’t impossible to work with, but everyone here is portrayed with no critical eye, and absolutely nobody has to deeply rethink their worldview. The sideplots with the other club mates whose names I can’t even recall are dumb and boring as a result, and absolutely nobody is likeable. What’s the point when we’ve clearly seen a setup of “Ayano’s trigger is badminton and she’s reliving her trauma because of that” and then proceed to have everybody stomp on our protagonist?! Shouldn’t we hate them then?! But, of course, this show doesn’t care about that— just look at the mother.The mother returns to Ayano in the second half of the show. Unsurprisingly Ayano reacts with pure numbness and completely rejects her. The mom doesn’t realize the error of her ways— AND THE SHOW REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM. Up to the end, her mom holds the same messed up belief that she raised Ayano the right way by abandoning her because she’s better at badminton now (?!?!) and the show STILL attempts to depict her as a sympathetic figure. When Elena weakly calls her out, there’s no follow up. When it’s nearly the end of the show and it’s time for Ayano to magically 180 and decide she loves playing badminton because the club mates who previously hated her also magically 180’d and suddenly don’t hate her for being snarky anymore, Ayano forgives her mom. And that’s when I closed the episode.These magical 180s pop up often: sometimes for drama or plot convenience, and sometimes for no reason at all. Whether it’s Connie suddenly coming to Japan and her flip flopping on whether she likes Ayano and what she actually wants with her (wants to be sisters, but is cruel to her? but then sugary sweet? but why?), her club mates randomly changing their opinions on her (sometimes even before she has a breakdown, club mates tell her they hate her... but now they’re friends! Even though she hasn’t talked to them for two episodes.), Nagisa’s Tension Creating Potential Injury, Nagisa’s power level, Ayano’s power level, Nozomi deciding losing is how she wants to play, Nozomi’s coach being okay with that... the character motivations and actions simply don’t make any sense. I’d praise the badminton strategy and technical showings, since it’s a sports anime, but the complete whiffing of the final Big Badminton Final (power levels aside, SWITCHING HANDS BETWEEN HITS?) also makes me strongly question the writers’ ability to write something coherent. Sure, it’s beautiful— the faces, the unabashed depiction of sweat— and the breathing sequence is ambitious, but it’s completely soured by the heavy baggage of the plot.In summary, just enjoy the opening.

(this shouldn't spoil anything for you)The art and sound were incredible at least...Now the story was enjoyable and I would argue the main points were believable for example Ayano's mom leaves her at a young age (guessing between 6-10) and she obviously resents her for it and thinks she left because of her talent. When she starts playing in high school she plays only to win to prove to her mom she doesnt need her (which i think is MORE the reasonable) which i enjoyed because it was...consistent and it separated her from the crowd of protagonists in sports animes. But of course they needed to have a happy ending so in the last episode she realized how fun badminton is and makes up with her mom when she had shown up three days before the final, and Ayano had refused to talk to her due to the anger she had. That ending felt so forced and unnecessary, she can realize its fun to play badminton without having to do a complete 180 on liking her mother and becoming the stereotypical protagonist?To be honest i only wrote this because of how mad i was after watching the 13th episode.

I liked the first 8 when she was a ruthless player and only thought about winning but after that it started talking about morals and went to shit. well maybe my rant will make you wanna watch it... though i really don't care."", 'Ah Hanebado, the sport that is really underrated in all honesty is finally being adapted into a show...except that show is disguised as a cheap drama with a competition to see who can draw the best yandere face at LIDENFILMSThey don\'t call it HaneBADo for a reason amirite?*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****...***Plot:So Hanebado delves into the perspective of 2 central protagonists. Well I say to but really we just have 1 protag while the other is pretty much disregarded for half the story. If I had to give an analogy over how the story went, let\'s use a burger shall we? Now Aragaki our hero...ine represents the buns, shown at both the beginning and the end of the story whereas Hanesaki, is like that weird special sauce that once you bite into the burger just leaks everywhere and covers the entire burger and gets your hands all dirty and gives you a bad time. Anywho our story starts off with a match between our central protagonists, in which one is clearly putting all the effort she\'s got while the other, yep you guessed it...has a yandere face on. Yandere face wins and our other protagonist goes into deep depression and copes using drugs and alcohol, which leads her to develop anger issues. Well everything except the first and last parts are false. Fast forward years later in high school and what a surprise! They\'re both going to the same school. Eventually our yandere friend (who is perfectly sane at this point) get peer pressured into joining the school\'s badminton team even though she clearly doesn\'t want to, and once she meets Anger issues guess what... she gets anger issues!! Now I would be lying if I didn\'t say that this setup was pretty promising (barring the obvious issues). What we could\'ve gotten is 2 rivals who are opposed against each other, one who is energetic and the other who is more serious, learn to cope with each other for the greater good of the school\'s team and rely on each other to develop their own skills. Sounds familiar doesn\'t it?Instead what we got was 12 eps of utter nonsense ranging from Hanesaki\'s mother leaving her when she was young (which we\'ll have fun with that later), to Hanesaki having a non-biological sister (yay yuri shippers) to pointless side character expeditions just so we know that the whole world doesn\'t revolve around our protagonists and that there are actually other members in the club. Cause y\'know, it\'s a sports animeSee the main problem with Hanebado is that it tries to fit in a bunch of shounen elements (even though it\'s a seinen) but it never takes the time to well... actually show them. What we end up getting is a bunch of half-assed executions and all problems getting resolved in a matter of minutes. Athlete is currently in a slump? Yeah just play a few rounds and you\'re good as new. Can\'t win a game even when your yandere face is active? Yeah just remember that one time everyone said ""we\'re a team"" and despite you treating them like absolute shit, they\'re still behind you. Mother left you for supposedly bad intentions when you were young? Yeah don\'t worry about it she obviously had good intentions for it, just lose a game and it\'s all settledSo how does this wonderful journey end you may ask? Well we do get that typical sports scenario where the last few episodes are all focused on the end-all game of the century where it\'s round 2 between yandere and anger issues (although she has calmed down at this point so hey, character development amirite). Now usually in shows that do this like Kuroko\'s Basket, we get these prolonged episodes to build tension and hype into the game, in order for all the elements such as sound, art and characters to come together for the epic ending. In Hanebado\'s case, what we get is the kind of shaft style art you\'d see in ef: slow motion jump cut back and forth, and constant breathing for about a solid minute or 2. Yep that\'s it. There\'s no thrilling use of OST, no witty quotes about never giving up, we don\'t even get to see SPOILER Aragaki smash it or finesse it past Hanesaki. We just get a bunch of uncolored lines, some breathing and then it jumps to the end. Even the crowd were like wtf is going onSound:Judging by the last few sentences you can probably guess where I\'m going with sound. It\'s not really there. Well it is but not where it is needed the most. One of the main purposes of the OST is to set the atmosphere, whether it be tense, joyful or dramatic like we\'ve seen recently with BnHA S3. Part of what makes OST\'s so outstanding is the ability to recognize certain tracks that play, such as Monogatari\'s Suteki Meppu, or the infamous hug scene in Clannad AS. Sure there are dramatic tracks in dramatic situations, but there\'s nothing really that gets me into the mood of the situation. Now you may be complaining ""It\'s not a shounen so don\'t expect that kind of stuff"" but even in something like the Chuunibyou movie, the use of the OST provided an excellent set to the situation. Moving on the OP isn\'t anything too spectacular/funky/outright intriguing. It\'s not a bad song per se, but the energetic vibes from it really contrast with the show in generalArt/Animation:Now this is the one field where I do have to give credit for. Not so much the art, since it was basically yandere faces and especially during the final match it was all over the place, but the animation. For badminton, a sport with a lot of rapid movements, I thought the animation was pretty well done, especially since the use of CGI was scarce (if used at all apart from the shuttlecock). Maybe the animation off the matches wasn\'t amazing, but definitely the actual matches themselves were some eye candyCharacters: As my old friend Anakin would say, this is where the fun beginsBunch of Side Characters: Literally have no use at all other than to visually show how much Hanesaki/Aragaki are treating them like shit, and to lighten the mood when those 2 can\'t since they\'re always mad. There was also a romance subplot going on with some love triangle drama, but that turned out to be rubbish because main girl didn\'t know if she like the B(adminton) or the D(ick). Spoiler, she chooses the B.Izumi: Slightly more important side character. She stays by Aragaki\'s side when she goes batshit crazy and practically causes half the club to leave. Oh yeah, she also\'s involved in a match or 2 and gets involved with some past beef with big lips and her rapist looking coachTachibana: New coach that introduced himself by molesting Hanesaki\'s hands in the beginning. Nice. Literally only there to provide commentary on the game (as every sports anime needs) and to constantly remind Aragaki that her knee is gonna get messed up (but she has plot armor so who cares)Nozomi: Big lips. I say that but they aren\'t really that big so excuse me. Anywho not much to say other than she was selected because rapist coach though she followed instructions well or something. Pretty much becomes rapist coach\'s slave until she manages to get saved with the power of Badminton, cause every sports anime needs that slave needing saving right? (Looking at you Major)Rapist coach: By far the most developed character. We see him start off as your generic douche-bag who only cares about winning, but then he suddenly does a 180 and becomes the generic old dude who gives insights on the match. Now that\'s some serious change! Oh yeah, he also completely analyzed Aragaki and her fitness by staring at her ass for a few secondsSerigaya: Pink haired ponytail antagonist. Molested Hanesaki when they were young so that she would get sick and therefore lose the game (which led to her mother leaving her). What an asshole. Eventually gets paired up against Hanesaki and gets defeated. Take that dickErena: Hanesaki\'s BFF and that girl who peer pressured her into joining. Ngl she\'s probably my least favourite character. The whole time she acts all confused as to why Hanesaki is so depressed and yandere like when she\'s literally the reason. And when she gets scolded by Hanesaki she just sits there and sulks (Well I guess what else are you supposed to do)Connie: Golden haired ponytail antag...actually I don\'t even know. In the beginning she acts like an antagonist, triggering her period when she realizes that she was at the convenience store with Hanesaki after all. Then she proceeds to rub it in Hanesaki\'s face that she\'s her half-sister and all of a sudden she acts all nice and wants to make amends with her? She literally makes no sense and we get an entire episode on her devoting herself to become a family with Hanesaki (like that\'s gonna work) and then gets dumped on and shat by yanesaki (get it cause yandere Hanesaki? No?) and then is no longer seen ever again. And that doesn\'t even begin to question the way she got with yane\'s mom. She literally impressed her with her badminton skills, Uchika tells her that she\'s her new mom and she just whole heatedly accepts? There are so many things weird about this. Where are her biological parents? Why does she completely ditch said parents and/or guardians to go and live with a complete stranger? Why is she so casual and calm about this even though she\'s a kid? Why is she at a badminton team if her parent\'s are nowhere to be found?Uchika: Oh boy here we go. Trying to understand Uchika\'s mind set is like trying to claim Ousama Game is the best anime of all time. You just don\'t. Being the all famous pro badminton player that she is, it\'s normal for her to want to get her daughter into the sport she loves. So, when she loses a game since she was playing while sick, what does Uchika decide to do? That\'s right, fucking LEAVE HER. Like seriously I don\'t even know how much weed the author must have smoked to come up with a plot line so random as this. It\'s about as ridiculous as Snake destroying a tank with solely grenades, but at least that was bad ass, this was just retarded. But wait! At the last minute we\'re presented with the whole bad mom was good all along, and her reasoning was that... she wanted Hanesaki to get better at badminton? Like seriously that\'s some ass writing. But because of happy endings and all Hanesaki and Uchika reunite at the end and hold hands and circle jerk over how Connie hasn\'t been shown for a couple of episodes and everyone lives happily ever after. Speaking of Connie, Uchika literally showed no sign of guilt over leaving Hanesaki, even going as far as casually talking about her and showing photos to a young Connie. I get how Darling in the Franxx was trying to low key promote more births, but if people are gonna give birth to Uchika\'s then humanities sense is gone.Aragaki: Arguably the best character in the series, mainly because she wasn\'t present in half of it. For real, even though she started off being some angsty teen she gradually grew to become more calm and collected in her actions, as if the writers decided halfway through that they forgot to include the quiet type character into the show. Despite constant moaning from coach molester, she soldiers on and eventually wins the whole tournament and goes to nationals. Whoop di dee.Hanesaki: Yay saving the last character for last. If you\'re ever bored and want to play a drinking game with your friends, drink every time Hanesaki puts on her yandere face. By the end of the show congrats! you\'d be in hospital. Seriously the amount of times she puts on her yandere face makes Yuno look like your average harem girl. And the constant mood swings don\'t help either. Her personality changes so many times even a mathematician would have a hard time finding that angle. As the story progresses, we come to learn more about our protagonist. Like how she got molested, got sick and then got her mother leaving the front door. But don\'t worry, she wasn\'t mad that her mother completely abandoned her, she was mad that she thought her mother thought she was shit at badminton. That way at the end, all the pieces were put together for their heartfelt reunion amirite? Oh yeah, she also treats everyone like shit for pretty much her whole time, but as soon as she returns to normal everything\'s all good and no harm done. If only irl sports teams worked that way.Conclusion:Overall I wouldn\'t say HaneBADo is the worst sports anime there is, but it certainly is far from the best. On paper it\'s good that they took a more dramatic approach to typical sports shows, but if you\'re gonna do that route, then it kinda makes you look bad when you start adding cliche shounen sports elements to it ***Plot:So Hanebado delves into the perspective of 2 central protagonists.

Most major characters in the show, including the protagonist Ayano, act in an erratic, exaggerated manner that makes them simply unlikeable. Ayano's mother especially is an unbelievable piece of **** and while her actions were vaguely explained, none of the drama she causes is really believable or adds anything interesting, she's simply a horrible person dragging others down with her. Everything ends with a great confrontation between two deeply unreasonable individuals without anyone to really root for and...a pretty anticlimactic resolution.Other than that, the series is solidly produced - it looks and sounds very good and while I only had a very brief adventure with badminton myself, everything definitely felt right with how the matches were portrayed. If someone enjoys the tension and detailed animation of sports anime, they should be satisfied with this one. Much of it is drama though and I've found basically all of it rather questionable.While the beginning of the season was interesting, for me the show proved ultimately unsatisfying and I recommend it only if you're seriously into its theme or the kind of visual spectacle it offers. a pretty anticlimactic resolution.Other than that, the series is solidly produced - it looks and sounds very good and while I only had a very brief adventure with badminton myself, everything definitely felt right with how the matches were portrayed.

I will admit that I\'m a sports anime fan. As such my view is a bit biased. But this anime tackles the genre seriously without all the moe crap and whatsoever.Like any decent sports anime, the sport itself is just a part of the story and the overall story focusses on the characters and their personal issues. You don\'t need to expect any ""special moves"" or such. While the MC is overpowered, it still seems to be in range of realistic badminton play.The characters are fleshed out well (better than the manga actually), the art is good, the pace of the story is...good, too. At this point in time, I\'d rate it as the dark horse of this anime season. good, too. At this point in time, I\'d rate it as the dark horse of this anime season.', 'One year ago studio Lidenfilms gave us the wonderful Killing Bites and now they\'ve graced me with this epic anime about Badminton (yes you read that right), Hanebado! If we graded anime based on production quality alone this show would seriously be a 10/10 masterpiece. The choreography in the badminton matches is superb, like you feel like you\'re watching two real athletes compete, because their movements are so lifelike. The animation is just superb as you see the sweat flying off these girls as they compete, you see their muscles straining under the pressure of returning that smash shot. CG is used appropriately to show...the shuttle cock flying around the court at breakneck speed, and all of the sounds effects are perfect. For these reasons I\'m giving a 10 to Art and Sound. Sadly this show has one fatal flaw: its protagonist.I really, REALLY hated the main girl, Ayano, in this show, to the point where she almost made me turn it off a few times. If literally any of the other players in this show had been the protagonist, the show would have been about said girl\'s dedication, passion, and love for the sport of Badminton. The problem with Ayano is her motivation ISN\'T ANY OF THESE THINGS! She just wants to crush her opponents, doesn\'t care about having fun or making new friends, and just wants mommy to notice her. Sounds like she\'d make a good season villain, I\'ll grant you, but the heroine we\'re supposed to root for? Never in a million years!!! What\'s worse is we HAD a good protagonist in episode 1 with Nagisa (short haired tomboy),before the bait and switch and it turns out Ayano is actually the main character by episode 2. We see Nagisa\'s muscles straining, the sweat collecting on her forehead as she trains. Compared to Ayano, who never has to practice hard because she\'s a prodigy, who easily crushes her opponents and even mocks them after beating them? What were they thinking making HER the heroine? Ugh. The score for Character was hardest for me to give since I LOVED Nagisa as a character but I HATED Ayano so much more, and she turned out to be the ""heroine"" of this story. Ayano starts out annoying and she only gets worse and worse with every episode, picking fights with people for no reason and rejecting any kindness people show her. So I ended up giving Character a 3.I gave Story a mediocre 5 because it\'s just a show about badminton, after all. There\'s the usual cliche high school drama, but that\'s not what you\'re here for. You\'re here for the epic badminton matches that seriously got me as hyped as a boxing match in Hajime no Ippo! But the games themseves aren\'t story per se, so I\'d throw that back in the Art/Sound category. I still had a lot of fun watching the show, but my Enjoyment score dropped from a 10 to an 8 from episode 1 with Nagisa as the protagonist, to the later episodes with Ayano in the lead role. Overall I wanted to love Hanebado but ended up only liking it. I probably would have given it an 8 but that one character Ayano made the show so hard to watch I had to drop it down to a 6. the shuttle cock flying around the court at breakneck speed, and all of the sounds effects are perfect.

Beautiful animations and so forth but it turned out to be a bad date. Most reviews are boring so heres my ""bad date"" review of this anime.I was excited as hell. I learned so much about her and I was hoping to finally meet her in person. I waited until the date we\'d air. It was everything and more. But I had no idea she would Sword Art Online me.Episode One; No spoilers: Beautiful animation, beautiful women, and I like them a bit tall with chunky arms so this was EVERYTHING after being forced to watch...underage waifu\'s and best gals. Beautiful opening scene which Japan never does as well as the U.S.. I thought this WAS IT! I didn\'t need 3 episodes to get into the anime like most shows. Finally an anime that nailed the PACING and CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS. Usually we are introduced to 100 characters, half of which don\'t really impact the story but, hey, the ramen animations are awesome right ? HAHAHAHHAHAfukmeahahaha.Episode two: I was excited for our date. All her manga exes kept telling me ""wait till you see ___."" They\'re so annoying. This, was a great one as well because it pushed away from the usual ""protagonist overcomes ____"" With three protaganists, and no essential main characters it was YET another trope japanese filmworks never seem to be able to do. Which is why shows like Boku No Hero Academia, Justice League, Naruto, One Piece, and Teen Titans are so interesting.But thats pretty much all it had to offer. The anime died on me, I already downloaded episode seven so ill finish it. But im absolutely dissapointed in the character development and pacing. You CANT just introduce a character and milestone then retract them. Also, the girl\'s backstory isn\'t sad. It\'s completely unrealistic, and they should\'ve spent more time helping me graph and understand her empathetically. She has no personality traits and im six episodes in.""Its not enough to just love something."" A quote that fits this anime perfectly. Like most japanese filmworks they try to stride through with animation, kawhi best gals, and fan service. Im sure the manga is great but this show is bad for ONE reason. It...it doesn\'t hold my interests. Hopefully the next episodes help the audience understand the characters and dig deeper into ""why."" Not how... underage waifu\'s and best gals. Beautiful opening scene which Japan never does as well as the U.S.. I thought this WAS IT! I didn\'t need 3 episodes to get into the anime like most shows.

Not how...', 'I didn\'t like this anime which you can obviously guess from the score. But I couldn\'t resist an urge to write this review to get it out of my system. So basically consider this review as a rant from an angry badminton lover. I have watched quite a few sports anime. So before I start this review let me note few lines for the two anime I like the most. Feel free to skip to the ""Review part"" for actual review.**********************Few months ago me watching Haikyuu: Wow even though as usual these guys are focusing on flashy impossible moves like smashes, I am loving this...show because even with these non-realistic moves to capture the audiences they are significantly focusing on the defense as well as strategic elements of the game. Few episodes in OMG net-blocks, strategy to avoid them, analyzing and covering their holes in their game awesome I am loving this Anime as well as these awesome characters.Some time after, while starting anime ""Baby steps"" me talking to myself: I don\'t think any sport anime will try to cover technical, mental and physical aspects of a sport because their main aim is to entertain people who otherwise will not watch the actual sport. So similar to myriad of Tennis anime this will be the usual emotional cliche sport anime which will never come close to Haikyuu. Few episodes in: WTH is going on there is no way people will like this kind of detailed story but I am loving it. After few more episodes: This is too much of sport technicalities even for me to handle. After finishing 306 chapters of manga: Me watching and reading this story was the best decision of my life. I wish there was a similar story about badminton.Me today browsing through MAL: OMGGGGGG there is an anime about badminton. Awesoooooom. I am fu*king excited.*********************Review:If you have read above paragraph, you can guess that I started watching this anime with too many expectations. I myself being a (local) badminton player and an enthusiasts who follows international badminton I had set the benchmark too high to cross. But to my utter disappointment this anime came nowhere close to it. After watching the 5th episode I realized I couldn\'t take this anymore. I must drop this utter disgrace to the sport of badminton.Story: AverageIt the usual cliche sport story with one hardworking girl who loves badminton and is struggling through a past traumatic loss. When a cliched GOD-GIFTED lefty player joins their team who had suffered since childhood because of oppressive parent. Then you have rivals and other things, the usual stuff you find in other sport anime. Just like any other sport badminton is also a game of skills and strategy. But this anime shows neither of those. Rather whatever is shown is either a stereotype or a complete wrong tactics. It gives zero insights into the game. Story and characters are lackluster as well. Read the spoiler at the bottom to know why I hate this anime.Characters: BadAll the characters in this anime are average. The interactions and personalities of the characters felt artificial. Aragaki Nagisa, their team captain felt too much out of character when she changed from badminton obsessed relentless captain to an accommodating team player who puts faith in the team. Same can be said about Hanesaki Ayano who is the left-handed prodigy with shy personality. Side characters are also average or below average. I didn\'t feel any connection or understanding with any of them.Art: Very GoodFirst episode is extremely well animated. Trust me after watching badminton for so long I was awestruck by the details of the sport the animation covered. The quality of the animation dropped after the second episode but it was by no means bad. I think there was nothing for me to complain.Sound: AverageEven though the sound tracks are good they felt out of place in certain situations. For example in initial episodes during a serious match between Captain Aragaki and new member Ayano the pleasant music ruined the mood.Enjoyment: Very BadI literally hate this anime. I usually don\'t drop anime no matter how bad they are. But may be this being too close to my heart I was unable to stand it to the end. May be some of you will find this enjoyable if you ignore the sport aspects of the show or view it from some other perspective.*********************Spoilers:Episode 5:In the last doubles match between Kitakomachi high-school and other team, the girl from other team decided to play solo against the two girls and goes on to win the match. Are you kidding me. This is total bullshit. Even if assume that the single player is \'that\' good all she does to win is to hit strong smashes. Even from an entertainment point of view all we get is how emotional they are during the game and zero strategic thinking from both sides. To add to this utter disgrace the coach gives advice where the two girls will play front-back which is THE WORST thing you can do to defend against an attacking player. For those of you who don\'t know much about badminton let me put few things in perspective. In badminton if we combine two \'singles\' players who have won lets say Olympics and ask them to play again an average \'international\' doubles pair. They will lose the match because those two game categories (singles and doubles) are that different. So if an Olympics medalist is playing one on two match with any two local \'serious\' players he will lose very badly. And here we get to see two talented players (who I am sure are going to win in future) loosing from a single player without any strategy. Hope you got my point. show because even with these non-realistic moves to capture the audiences they are significantly focusing on the defense as well as strategic elements of the game.

Hope you got my point.', ""First of, full props to the animators and sound designers, the badminton match sequences were some of the most well-animated I have seen in sports anime. The sounds were also great, special mention to the OP and ED which I loved.That aside, the story did suffer at points, and at times it just got a little bit too over-the-top with the drama, especially for a sports anime. Some of the characters also had flaws, it's just a little rushed to watch a character do so many u-turns in personality over a few episodes.All in all, still a decent watch. I did enjoy myself especially...at the episodes of badminton matches. Some of the matches got me really intrigued and I could feel the excitement and intensity just by watching.Now excuse me while I go out to play some badminton. at the episodes of badminton matches. Some of the matches got me really intrigued and I could feel the excitement and intensity just by watching.Now excuse me while I go out to play some badminton."", ""As a sports anime enthusiast, I was excited to watch this. Badminton may not be the most exciting sport in the world but I was interested to see how it would be handled. However it managed to do something few sports anime have ever done: it bored me to death. And that's saying something considering that I'm easily amused.Story: The typical tournament arc with bits of training sprinkled throughout is a classic sports anime element. This anime manages to turn it into personal drama plus some training with bits of competition in between. If I'm watching a sports anime I want to watch people play...the sport. Adding in some drama is fine, but not to the point where it becomes the main focus of the show.As for when the sport is actually played, it's a bit of a letdown. The characters don't really show any progression in regard to their skills. And whether they win or lose often comes down to willpower rather than ability. Also the matches themselves just aren't very exciting. There are only so many ways you can hit a birdie over a net, so there isn't much variation. Either you hit it or you miss. There are no plays or special moves. It ends up becoming repetitive.Art: I was pleasantly surprised by the art. While the character designs are nothing special, the animation is consistently good throughout the series. The characters' movements are fluid and pretty realistic. I have no real complaints about it either.Sound: The sound was fine. Not bad but not amazing either. The characters' voices match and although the music is forgettable, it wasn't offensive either.Characters: Ugh. What a lackluster if not questionable cast of characters. The main character is a garden variety Mary Sue who just so happens to be a badminton prodigy. The other main is obsessed with badminton and doesn't take losing very well. They're mediocre at best. The rest of the cast is flat and forgettable except for the Danish exchange student that has beef with one of the mains.Enjoyment: Look, I really like sports anime and it takes a lot for me to genuinely dislike one. This series managed to do it. I was bored after the first few episodes and felt that it wasn't  worth finishing. It isn't the worse anime I've ever watched but it certainly didn't entertain me.TLDR: If you're an avid sports anime fan, you can give it a shot. Just don't go in expecting much. If you aren't, just skip it. the sport.

At one stage, I also decided to quit watching anime since there weren\'t many I enjoyed and I started to play games instead of watch cartoons or TV series. However, my friends saw this anime and recommended and I was bit excited. But the more I watched, the more I was disappointed. Story was terrible, some crazy girl how was addicted to badminton, wasn\'t very that emotional although the creators tried to be. However, the way they play Badminton is supposedly ""national/professional badminton level"". Other commenters say that...Hanebado! is one of the most realistic sports anime at the moment due to ""no special powers"" although you not only stupidly play with some long ass anime hair (which will get in the way) but able to dive smash in front of the net (which is not only practically dangerous and risky but impossible because you will hit the net), a 180 degrees spin to receive (stupid to do unless you\'re having fun which she is not) but for Ayano to be able to smash like a bullet is impossible. There are many reasons why in reality, she is trash and that this is not realistic. First, you will not get a full power smash when you\'re playing tennis for badminton, jumping to the sides and doing them god-like smashes. It\'s possible for the professionals you say? Well not only do they rarely do it in real life but the way they smash in the anime is not realistic. They are playing VOLLEYBALL. When smashing, the power comes from the wrist and a very quick swing of the elbow, a bit like a whip. Jump smashing is not always seen in Badminton but you only jump smash when the shuttlecock is high up enough and you have enough time to both move and jump. Movement in Badminton is very long and quick, taking large steps in order to get to the other corner. However they\'re doing... tip toe steps??? Ayano also cannot smash that strong if she grips her raquet that tight. In general, people who say how these people don\'t have super powers literally do not understand anything about what\'s going on. Kuroko no basket although have special abilities are still realistic with jumping, shooting, passing and movement are still realistic, although Kuroko doesn\'t really have a superpower, just people can\'t see him. In Haikyuu, it\'s not that Hinata can spike eyes closed, it\'s just stupid but it comes from all the trust he has for the prodigy setter Kageyama. Therefore, Hanebado is just trash and full of bullshit and nonsense.

This series get\'s compared to Haikyuu, and in a formulaic manner they bear similarities. Trade relative heights of the two rivals turned teammates who face off at the beginning of the series, there\'s a blonde alumni male coach there to help, just drain the importance of every other character on the team away. This series is also admittedly well animated with great dynamic motions that make you feel the whirring speed and cracking pop of the shuttlecocks.However where Haikyuu universally inspires a love of volleyball in its...viewers, this series is more likely to just piss you off constantly, in fact it\'ll become the main reason you keep watching. This series masquerades a bit under the mask of friendship and good sportsmanship. But will hit you repeatedly with nasty encounters that just make you want to see people lose in ways that will break their spirits rather root for any particular person to win. Seriously, I assure you I\'m not exaggerating.While the series does stick to realistic sports action, I found it lacking for in-depth explanations at times for terms it would throw out, strategic logic, player tactics or specialties, often just vaguely asserting that someone is good or fast. This can vary from slightly noticeable to very jarring depending on how much the series cares about the characters involved. However these are small gripes in the long-run, because quite frankly the sport isn\'t the most important thing here oddly enough, and it\'s not the reason to keep watching.The reason to watch this series, is for the hope of revenge, and that sweet sweet revenge ain\'t coming.This section contains spoilers of varying degree.The main reason to watch this series, and the main reason you will if you do not heed warnings will be your desire to see the main character\'s mother suffer or at the very least receive her comeuppance. She spent years raising her daughter to feel she only had worth if she could perform up to her national champion mother\'s standards. Only spending time with her seemingly to play badminton, and cutting their time short literally the moment her daughter lost a point. Then after her first big loss the mother literally abandons her daughter, packs up and leaves the country to raise another kid to play badminton.Honestly the tournament action grew boring and predictable quickly, it really won\'t surprise you, the only reason you\'ll still feel invested will be to see her get revenge on the woman who abandoned her and crushed her spirit. But unfortunately, like many series this one lacks the stomach for proper confrontation or repercussions, so by the end everyone\'s smiling with literally nothing having changed at all. The mother has this annoying permagrin that she\'ll get to keep the entire time as she leaves again, feeling in her heart she did the right thing all along and the series acting like ""yeah this is fine"".Yes sometimes it\'s easy to get worked up over a desire for retributions for a character\'s sake that the series simply won\'t fulfill, but these are often placed there by us the viewers. When a series spends it\'s entire season focusing on the main character\'s reason and plan for revenge against their own parent, you expect some sort of payoff.But no, at the very end it tries putting the smiling mask of shounen-style friendship back on and expects us to not notice the cheap hunk of plastic and string it\'s wearing.Afternote:The manga seems more like a lighthearted comedic romp that might be more enjoyable, I can\'t really bring myself to read it though after realizing I\'ll never get to see Ayano take any action against her mother. This feels like its put scars on my heart in places where I\'ve never been cut, and I fear the only cure will be a better anime to wash out the taste of this one. viewers, this series is more likely to just piss you off constantly, in fact it\'ll become the main reason you keep watching.

I loathe it. Get it out of my sight.It's a shame too, this show had potential with nice animation for when they're playing and decent art that actually looked fairly alright at times with the lighting and attention to detail. However the budget has seemingly gone to the animation as opposed to making the show a genuinely enjoyable experience for the viewer.Soundtrack? Mediocre and forgettable (that goes for the opening and ending as well).The overall plot of the show was mind-numbing and infuriating with poor writing and terrible developments that made me...question my own reality and why I was dedicating my time to it. Add onto that an underwhelming ending and you've got yourself a show not worth your time.Could have been a nice introduction to the sport of badminton for many...

Bad characters, decent sound design, terrible secondary characters, and an extra terrible main character with an even more terrible mother.Of all the sports anime I've watched Hanebado! is the most infuriating to watch. It honestly doesn't even feel like a sports anime but rather a drama anime for edgy teens that just so happens to be about a group of people who play badminton.Connie is a bitch but then isn't? She claims she wants to...be a family with Ayano but treated her like dog shit she stepped in when they first met. Okay. Nagisa should have been the main character because Ayano is insufferable to watch. I get it, it's supposed to be like PTSD or something but it's just not fun to watch at all. She's a complete bitch to everyone around her for 75% of the show and somehow no one slaps her. Ayano's mother is worse though. what a bad parent that we are supposed to understand... some how?

Review may contain some spoilers here or there, so if you're planning on experiencing this for yourself. Be warned.But seriously. Watching this a year and a half after it ended, I really enjoyed it from start to finish. Sure, there are poor writing elements here and there, such as the characters and coaches hardly doing anything to help Ayano through her troubles up until near the end of the show. To the moment where her and her mom seem to be on more friendly terms. But those elements aren't enough to ruin the show at all.I...really felt they really developed both main characters well, and even the side characters. Showing them go through their own personal struggles, and reaching an end goal. Nagisa went from being the brute and wondered why is she even trying any more, to more down to earth and considerate. While still having that drive and passion. While Ayano at first was a sweet timid like girl,, only for her emotion baggage to get the better of her, which flipped her personality in a whole 180. You can thank her mom for that. Both characters in that regard were really written well. Along with it being realistic. The way they developed as the series went on, it was great. You felt passionate for Nagisa as she tries to adapt compared to what we first saw her as. While feeling sorry and bad for Ayano.The art style was colourful and very appealing. Even during the matches, it flowed together nicely. Much like the sounds through out the show. Being perfect for each scene.All in all I'm glad to have checked this out.

Even during the matches, it flowed together nicely. Much like the sounds through out the show. Being perfect for each scene.All in all I'm glad to have checked this out. It's something I wanted to for a long while now, and I'm glad I did. A must watch."", ""Hanebado was a show that left a bitter taste in my mouth. Sure, with its stunning animation, it stood out to me as a show I need to watch. Unfortunately, with its lack of direction and poor characters, the show was a little more than underwhelming. I had high hopes for this show. Being a huge sports anime fan and having 2 new sport shows come out last season, it was more than a treat. Unfortunately, both have disappointed me in more ways than one. When I first saw the preview back in April for a new show about girls' badminton, it blew me away....They showed 30 seconds of a match with the most detailed animation. The speed and intensity of the match was just astounding. It reminded me a lot of Haikyuu!!, plus, it was about badminton which is a sport that hasn't been explored in anime I believe. The animation is stunning and very free flowing. The things that stand out to me the most are the watercolor painting style of the ED, the smoke dissolving into different characters in the OP, and the movement in the matches. The insane cuts between characters and the shuttlecock and the court make it more intense. The soundtrack is also very good and plays at all the right times. The opening song is very good too. Other than that, the show definitely falls flat in terms of writing.Hanebado! starts with 2 girls, Nagisa and Ayano, who don't know why they even play badminton because of certain events in middle school. When Ayano gets into high school, she is forced by her peers to join the badminton team. That's basically it. Sports animes don't really have a centralized story like most shows but they focus more on the characters. In Haikyuu, we follow Hinata as he joins the volleyball club with skills that are necessary for volleyball but with no knowledge of the sport. We learn the details about the sport with Hinata. In this show, both Ayano and Nagisa know the sport very well so they decide not to talk specifics about badminton. They don't tell you the rules or even show you strategies, they just assume the audience knows.As for the characters, most are boring and uninteresting. Now I know that this is only 12 episodes so it's not a lot of time to develop characters. I don't think this is an excuse though. Ping pong the animation has great characters and they space them out well enough so we know about everyone. That show is only 11 episodes too but back to this show. Ayano, who is supposed to be the main character, is a girl who was raised by a badminton pro to become a prodigy. There isn't really a lot of pressure put onto Ayano until she loses a match. Her mother just straight up leaves. This leaves Ayano in sort of a trance like if I don't get better, my mom will never come back.  Uchika, which is the mother, decides that if she keeps helping Ayano, she's gonna play badminton for her and not herself. Ayano begins to hate her mother. The way the whole situation is resolved is just stupid. Ayano says like 2 sentences and then leaves. Can't go into details because spoilers, but if you watch it, you'll see. Uchika also reminds me a little of Ging from Hunter x Hunter. Ging leaves Gon to become a hunter. Gon thinks that it's amazing that he would leave to pursue his dream but that's messed up. Just like Uchika, Ging places importance of Gon becoming a hunter over raising a child. She places badminton over all. When Uchika leaves, she goes to train other kids in foreign countries and one of the kids is Connie. Connie is an orphan who Uchika takes in and raises to become a badminton prodigy. She tells Connie about Ayano and mentions that she played badminton. I feel Uchika provokes Connie to find and verse her, but Connie's main goal is to become a family. This sounds nice, but Connie goes all the way to Japan to verse Ayano and when they meet, she is super rude to Ayano. Why! If you want to just ask about the family situation, just straight up ask. Ayano versus another girl with pink hair named Kaoruko who is also like a cartoon villain. She provokes Ayano into a match and it shows her past very little. They were rivals when they were little, but Kaoruko loses a lot to Ayano. One day, Kaoruko gets sick so to keep it fair, she gets Ayano sick and wins the match. This is also the match where her mother just leaves. Ayano remembers this and starts acting differently from this episode. That whole situation was outrageous and pretty dumb. What else is dumb is the badminton team. They are there for moral support and that's it. They don't stand out, they don't have any unique personalities, and we don't see them play badminton much. The coach is pretty bad too. He finds Ayano and sees the potential in her. He asks if she would join and she says no. She obviously joins later but this is the only time where the coach is interested in Ayano. He picks his favorite which is Nagisa, the other main character basically. They focus on her for the beginning of the show then just push her off to the side for the rest of the show. She is a lot like the coach, so the coach sees that and helps her out. She thinks she isn't talented but through the hard work she puts in, she can succeed. This could've set up for much more but since she's put in a side character role when she's basically a main character, the ending doesn't work. She talks about how much work she's put in throughout the year, but we don't see it, therefore, we don't care.Again, this show had lots of potential. If the show focused on both characters with their ideals and talents but erased their knowledge of the sport, I think it could have worked better. I also think that if every match was like the one in the last 2 episodes, it would make matches more intense. I watched it for the animation, but the writing just isn't there.

But not like this where the main character itself is the antagonist herself, and we're talking about Hanasaki Ayano, who from a sweet girl who abandons badminton when she was left by her mom, to a condescending bitch when she finds herself going back to the sport that made her quit in the first place thank in part from her childhood friend, Fujisawa Elena. As the protagonist we see Ayano doing what the...usual antagonist does , attitude , winning, smirking and then trash talking. Ok so the story plot has that cliche drama of the main character, being alone, and finding his or her place in the world, but then again, this isn't about badminton , rather it all about the two competitor , Ayano and Nagisa, as they struggle to be the best and at the same time having the obsession of beating the other in order to put the loser in her place. But in the end , it didn't when that way as nothing tragic has happened with nay of them , nagisa only have a not so serious injury, Ayano lose to her by just 1 point , and then the no good mom of Ayano, finds herself being forgiven, I mean, not much of a good ending. But to me, I really find ayano being an antagonist that I like and where her bitchyness is something I can forgive, Nagisa, well, she may have this never give up attitude and work hard thing for her but much of it was her frustration from losing to a middle schooler in a badminton tournament  which we see from the first episode, in fact I would have love to see her lose again to Ayano and at the same time really have a bad injury that she'll never play again kind of thing, but like I've said it ended like everything is ok and everyone will be friends again kinda shit. But enough of that, here are mya ratings:Story-Good 7: Cu'z it was just the usual cliche sport drama, but then again, having the kind of character like Ayano and Nagisa make up for it somehow.Art-Poor 3: Cu'z there weren't any intense fanservices around, but I do have a fuss about the  Kitakomachi High School Badminton club attire, which look more like the old haydays of Superman and Batman wearing their underwear outside their suits, except here it looks like they're wearing leotards outside of their rompers that I find it dorky.Sound-Good 7: Cu'z you can feel the sound of being tired or being exhausted as each players duke out with each other in the court.Character-Very Good 8: To me it's very good since Hanasaki Ayano is one main character who is the antagonist that I like.Enjoyment- Very Good 8: Since it was something that makes one empathize with the character.Overall- fair 6: I may have like how the plot of focusing everything on Ayano Vs Nagisa on a rematch, but I kinda hate how it ends as if studio LIDENFILMS and director Ezaki, Shinpei wanted an good ending where everyone move forward for the best, I mean, it just has that cliche ending..........so , don't even think about another season bitch. usual antagonist does , attitude , winning, smirking and then trash talking.

After the show runs out of ideas, they decided to make characters into superhumans, which isn't what we would want to watch.But this show isn't all about sport!The show started off on an unexpected footing where it portrayed Aragaki as a tragic heroine. She currently doesn't have a good relationship with the team members and creates an arrogant image of herself. We meet another character, Ayano, who is a prodigy and the...person who is responsible for Aragaki's personality. The first episode builds up to these two characters well and sets the tone of the story. The episode focused more on the characters and drama rather than the main character becoming exposed to the sport and starting to flourish their passion for it.As for the art, it doesn't emphasize the attractive features and shots of the character's body parts (Don't let the PV fool you...). I'm glad the show does this because we have seen too many shows that try to entice the audience with the characters. The art is fitting for the story because it doesn't have the over exaggerated character features and puts the focus more on the story.For the animation, the preview was gorgeous. Most of those shots are used in the first episode, but more dynamic animations will be present in the upcoming episodes. Sports animes definitely needs eloquent animation to feel the intensity.However, the third and fourth episodes start to weaken the show. The focus changes from Aragaki to Ayano and new characters that have unrealistic personality comes to the stage.To conclude, I can't emphasize enough that this anime feels more like a drama with good animation than a sports anime. The first two episodes are great, however, I wasn't as amused for the third and fourth.

But when I do...Well, let\'s just say this is yet another disappointing anime to write home about. We\'ve been getting a lot of those lately and my hopes and dreams for the future have been nigh diminished. But enough about my self-pity, let\'s get a move on and see why exactly this show fails at nearly everything.Story: 4A weak part of this anime is the story. I mean, it\'s an anime about badminton. What more can one want? Here\'s an idea: how about a realistic depiction of the sport? With actual tournaments arc? And not individual matches here and there...in the first half and then one boring tournament that focuses on only 2 of the characters? Quite frankly, there is nothing to even compare this to - story-wise it\'s a dry dish. No spice, no flavor.Art: 7Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. I found the art to be satisfying and enjoyable. I didn\'t go ""OMG"" and my jaw certainly didn\'t drop but it was ""ok"". Minus the unrealistic amounts of sweat comign from the bodies of those teenage girls. I mean, you\'d reckon they were playing badminto in a sauna with the amounts of sweat protruding from their pores.Sound: 5Was there sound? A forgettable OP, even mroe forgettable ED, almost no thrilling soundtrack during the actual matches. In other words - mediocre.Characters: 2Yet another weak point. Probably the worst thing about this anime was its character cast. We have 2 main protagonists and... that\'s it. Pretty much 0 development for the rest. (sure, we get some dramatic training sessions with some minor characters that - guess what, go nowhere). On top of that we have contradictions left and right. To finish off, we have absolutely scum characters trying to act all righteous.A mother that abandons her child and goes abroad to play mommy with some other girl. One could say that Ayano gets NTR\'d by some danish chick. That\'s a new...We then have Ayano herself, who goes from being an absolute monster of a badminton player, to being an average schoolgirl that hates badminton, to then being a psychotic badminton player, to being an average school girl again. If I was even a mildly-proficient doctor, I\'d lock her up in an institution.Her counterpart, Nagisa, is your typical ""hard-worker"" that overcomes everything. As if... give me a damn break, people. If this anime wanted to shove this ""hard work beats talent"" crap down our throats, they should have renamed the anime to ""Hard-working sweaty teenagers beat the shit out of a badminton shuttle"". You go try to play a 3-set badminton game with a blown-out knee against a far stronger opponent, and try to score a point. Then come and tell me about all that hard work that paid off.And my least favorite character is that danish NTR chick who goes to Japan to fight Ayano because ?she has some ?beef with her?? I\'m really not sure about her motivation. She then basically mentally insults Ayano with that little speach about ""Mom only cares about winning"", ONLY to come a few episodes later and try to be all friendly and family-like with the girl, who\'s life she single-handedly ruined. Talk about being the lowest of scum...Enjoyemnt: 2The only way I could have enjoyed this anime less was if they added bad CGI. Which is saying A LOT.Overall: 4Again, the rules of mathematic prevent me from giving this anime a lower score. And I would have, believe me. This is one of those rare times, when I actually think MAL\'s score is being TOO generous.As parting words, all I can say is: Watch at your own risk. in the first half and then one boring tournament that focuses on only 2 of the characters?

After watching Hanebado!, I'm re-thinking that position. The best way that I could describe the story in Hanebado! is that the scenes focused on badminton (the matches, the training/coaching, etc.) are actually quite excellent. And everything that happens away from the court is just an absolute mess. Maybe some writers are just better at telling a simple sports drama and shouldn't try to extend too far beyond that (although, I recently watched Cross Game, which handled the balance...quite beautifully).Without spoiling too much, Hanebado!'s major plot is driven by Ayano's psychological state, which is in turn driven by her mother's abandonment. Badminton focused heavily in their mother-daughter relationship, and her mother's disappearance from her life causes Ayano some serious mental anguish. I'm no shrink, but she has some really wild mood swings, going from sweet, adorable character to total bitch. It makes her very hard to like, which is a problem in a show like this. Some shows might benefit from anti-heros, but I don't think this one does. On a side note - Ayano's mom seems so cool and loving and caring in every scene she's shown in, and there's just a real disconnect over how she could just up and leave. I kept waiting for an unexplained reason that would make sense, but that doesn't come. Her reason is dumb, and it just doesn't jive with how her character is portrayed at all.On the flip side, despite initially being kind of bossy towards her teammates, Nagisa is a much more likeable character. We understand her and her motivations - her passion and drive to better herself in the sport that she loves. And her own mental battles (having lost so thoroughly, despite all the work she's put in) are much more relatable.If the story had focused more on the matches and less on making Ayano some sort of mental case, I think it would have made for a much more enjoyable experience. I still enjoyed the badminton scenes quite a bit, so the show gets a pass from me. I'd even watch a second season if they ever made one. But mostly I just feel like this was a missed opportunity, given the obvious production value put into the effort - this is the nicest-looking show I've watched in a while. The animation is amazing, and the character designs are all top notch. They clearly put a lot of effort into the aesthetic of the show, it's just a shame they couldn't salvage a decent story. quite beautifully).Without spoiling too much, Hanebado!'s major plot is driven by Ayano's psychological state, which is in turn driven by her mother's abandonment. Badminton focused heavily in their mother-daughter relationship, and her mother's disappearance from her life causes Ayano some serious mental anguish. I'm no shrink, but she has some really wild mood swings, going from sweet, adorable character to total bitch. It makes her very hard to like, which is a problem in a show like this. Some shows might benefit from anti-heros, but I don't think this one does. On a side note - Ayano's mom seems so cool and loving and caring in every scene she's shown in, and there's just a real disconnect over how she could just up and leave. I kept waiting for an unexplained reason that would make sense, but that doesn't come. Her reason is dumb, and it just doesn't jive with how her character is portrayed at all.On the flip side, despite initially being kind of bossy towards her teammates, Nagisa is a much more likeable character. We understand her and her motivations - her passion and drive to better herself in the sport that she loves. And her own mental battles (having lost so thoroughly, despite all the work she's put in) are much more relatable.If the story had focused more on the matches and less on making Ayano some sort of mental case, I think it would have made for a much more enjoyable experience. I still enjoyed the badminton scenes quite a bit, so the show gets a pass from me. I'd even watch a second season if they ever made one. But mostly I just feel like this was a missed opportunity, given the obvious production value put into the effort - this is the nicest-looking show I've watched in a while. The animation is amazing, and the character designs are all top notch. They clearly put a lot of effort into the aesthetic of the show, it's just a shame they couldn't salvage a decent story."", ""A sports anime with no sportsmanship!That is the thing that went into my mind after going on half of the episode. That way, it gave me a bad impression already in the story. Too much drama, arrogant characters, inconsistent development, all in a sports anime. If this is reality, then Japan must be one of the most hated country in any world class sports tournaments for sure!Okay, now move one to every aspect of this anime. It has a rather inconsistent visual as well. During the early part of this anime, everything looks very good. However, on the second half of the story where everything...gets more serious, the art started to look downgraded. Not sure the latter part was rushed or not, but the inconsistency is just too obvious for me. Over hundreds of anime I've watched, this is the third title that shows obvious inconsistency in artwork quality. The artwork was going between just very good to just okay. But overall, I'd still consider it is as good.The sound effect is one thing that this anime quite excel. The music is also very good. I'd say the audio quality is actually the best part of this anime. You got an energetic and motivating opening theme that doesn't really match the story. Also an energetic and cheerful ending theme that again, doesn't really match the story. But it is not bad. I am just saying the music is too good for this type of gloomy story.The characters are... mediocre. Nagisa is the only one with good development. She went from a loser to a... winner. Ayano is all over the place. From nothing to loser to villain to whatever the creator wants her to be. Most of the characters from different schools have no sportsmanship which is terrible for a sport anime. The other supporting characters in the same school barely shown any development. Oh well... none of the chicks are the type that one would want to make them wives though.And finally... about the story. Honestly, having a story with a flow like this and type of female main character like this is something new for me. But not in a good way. Actually, the story itself is what dragged this anime down in my view. It shows a bad example of people should behave in sports competition. I know, it is just an anime. it is just a fiction. But should you know, fictions have power to shape or motivate people! See how Long Riders attracted people to do cycling or Yurucamp attracted to do camping for example. Hanebado doesn't show the good way of Badminton. It's just a drama which sets around Badminton unfortunately.Overall... I have too many complaints about this anime. Mainly the story and characters' personality. They ruins the enjoyment of the anime. They don't motivate people to do Badminton. They showed how bad sportsmanship in sports competition.

It does not necessarily mean that sports anime should feel like a docu-drama-- it means that sports should be the medium in which the characters grow and find themselves and resolve their conflicts and finally, aim for the better future. Sports would subtly become the metaphor of life itself. One should train hard to have a better life, that one should be able to...compete to elevate such life, and that both victory and defeat are simply the beginning of a brand new chapter of life. As time goes, though, different types of sports are adapted and become a breath of fresh air, let it be archery (Tsurune) or sumo (Hinomaru Sumo) or even karuta (the lovely Chihayafuru). Nonetheless, the rule shall be universal. Come to think of it, it is not as easy of a genre, is it?Hanebado! attempted to defy the one and only rule. Now look at what it had become.On the surface, the narrative seems strong and the characters even stronger.

With the yandere-ness getting overboard, all character developments feel elementary, the conflicts become some sort of a farce, and the resolution becomes ultimately pointless.

But when you get to...those final 7 episodes, it changes, Hanebado becomes something more than just a typical cute girls or sports anime, and takes a different turn on characters.

Some of the most memorable scenes, contrasting with some of the most bland, working well.These thrilling scenes as mentioned before definitely carry the entire show, the character development in concluding episodes, while being dragged down by some of the more dull episodes in the beginning, still manage to hold quite a strong spot in my heart.

This anime has done nothing to do either of those. Hell, in my opinion, Keijo!!! was far better than Hanebado. The only saving grace, in my opinion, was the animation in the matches which had the smashes swooshing in and the receiving top notch. I really liked the use of CG there and the sweat and anticipation really mimicked the intensity of a real-life match. However, apart from that everything was really bad.Starting with the story....the characters were not true to their motivations. Instead of having a well-defined goal, we had the story of a mystery novel with the mother being the ultimate bad. I mean come on the mother left because she lost a match.

The story follows Ayano Hanesaki, A high school girl who is very gifted at badminton. Hanebado features a large cast of characters whom all have some sort of quirk and shortcoming to their personality. The anime initially seems to be a coming of age story about overcoming said quirk. Unfortunately, Hanebado slowly turns into a narrative and ethical mess that by the end makes all the events that happened in the middle seem pointless and infuriating.One major problem with the anime throughout its runtime is the...meanspirited atmosphere. Hanebado insists on pushing animosity, melodrama, and insults in its script without having a meaningful outcome. An example of this is one character being defeated by the MC of the show, the MC of the show insulting and mocking her and then moving on. The character who got insulted own character arc ended on sadness and depression and then just threw her back in the background. Granted this character was stingy to the MC in the past, but the arc this character received did not make her a better person, it did not make the MC more likable, and it didn’t give a viable explanation on why she did these actions.Another downfall is the plot device of Ayano’s mother which is so outlandish and disgusting, that it is completely unbelievable and takes the immersion out of the viewer. It is so over the top that it leaves the viewer frustrated with the actions of the MC’s mother not changing and not realizing her mistakes in an actual meaningful way. The mother’s actions were not properly justified and seemed so fucking stupid that it just made me think what the writers were thinking hyping up this plot since the beginning for such a drab explanation. The “development” that does occur between them on the last episode felt so artificial too. The problems between them were patched up far too quickly instead of properly fleshing out their relationship over a span of episodes. This was solidified with episode 10 and in all honesty, made me feel disgusted.This doom and gloom throughout make the show feel depressing and it makes the very slim number of lighter moments feel so out of place that it gives you whiplash. Hanebado is not an ideal sports story in all accounts. It does not show the viewer the benefit of being on a sports team. It does not properly show the sacrifices of being in that sport because it shows the negatives of those sacrifices without showing how the characters grow. The characters either don’t grow at all or are not developed properly and the main plot device of the show is so stupid and achieves nothing to grow the MC and her mother.

It's been getting way too much flak in my opinion, when that time would be better used on series that deserve it more, especially in this abyssmal season. Hanebado is not that bad, and imo, it's got some things going for it.I have no issues with the premise, I've never felt one way or another with badminton. Little bit too much drama as everybody and their mother has pointed out, but makes it at the very least not completely boring, even if it's pretty asanine. I'm watching for the well animated matches anyway,...so if it isn't completele paint drying in inbetween, it's not huge problem or anything.Art is really good. Backgrounds aren't anything special, but not terrible. With the animation, I like the use of rotoscoping in particular, and the animation outside of that is generally really good, exceptional by this season's standards. I really disliked this season.The voice acting was pretty good, no qualms really, music was unremarkable to me honestly. The OP is pretty catchy I guess.You only need to know anything about two characters, Nagisa and Ayano. Ayano, you are supposed to dislike. She does have backstory and all, but the overall intention is to dislike her personality she develops through the Hanebado's duration, especially after her mother returns. Is it a good character arc? No. Is it a character arc? Yes. In the end she's kinda cute and more bearable too. Nagisa is a good character. She's tall, and people misjudge her and think the only reason she's good at badminton is because she's tall. She's actually a very hard worker, and she is also struggling with a knee problem. She has determination and good work ethic. More importantly, she's a tall, short-haired tomboy with big titties and bigger muscles. Hot. Should be noted I thought she was the main character for at least half the run of the anime, so that says something about it.Side characters are pretty boring. No one gives a shit about Hayama, he didn't need the attention he got.Enjoyment was the only thing I scored this off of, because literally everything here is boiling down to how much the other elements contributed to enjoyment, or bogged it down. I enjoyed it. The matches were good and fun to watch, the drama wasn't boring at least, and Nagisa is a good, sexy girl.Overall 6/10. so if it isn't completele paint drying in inbetween, it's not huge problem or anything.Art is really good.

The matches were good and fun to watch, the drama wasn't boring at least, and Nagisa is a good, sexy girl.Overall 6/10."", 'This is actually the first-sports referred anime I have watched, starred out with episode 10/11 then I was confused I just tried it out, this somehow has somewhat of an impact toward me as well ""feelings"" of what I also really could be enjoying at those years wanting to actually play badminton but back then I didn\'t even know how good or hard this sport really was and by watching this it really puts me under the edge where it motivates me or it actually tells me how I also could have gone for that sport, I do have lots of energy too but never...spent them seriously I did enjoy sports but for some reason I\'ve stopped after the age of 16, here I am 19th years old--   back to the review, I\'ve started watching this from the beginning and I\'ve only watched three of the episodes, this anime should also have like minimum 20 of episodes, really.I don\'t really have any experience or knowing how good these animes are but for a new-starter into that kind of a genre to watch, it\'s really something perfect to start with, about personalities, characters etc the slice of life feeling it\'s there, they\'ve got interesting attitudes too and seeing themselves questioning or being confused about the sport and why are they there really, it gets tricky from time to time but it can also add up unto real life-situationsI totally recommend watching this. For some reason it made me cry in the second episode it made me realize something, it\'s also really lively and funny in some lines but can also be sad from time to timeNagisa\'s pretty worked up though and about that rival feeling with Ayano----I\'ll edit this review in further more about the anime, I\'ll probably watch it with a friend too spent them seriously I did enjoy sports but for some reason I\'ve stopped after the age of 16, here I am 19th years old--   back to the review, I\'ve started watching this from the beginning and I\'ve only watched three of the episodes, this anime should also have like minimum 20 of episodes, really.I don\'t really have any experience or knowing how good these animes are but for a new-starter into that kind of a genre to watch, it\'s really something perfect to start with, about personalities, characters etc the slice of life feeling it\'s there, they\'ve got interesting attitudes too and seeing themselves questioning or being confused about the sport and why are they there really, it gets tricky from time to time but it can also add up unto real life-situationsI totally recommend watching this.

There were a few cases of ""quality"" but it didn\'t bother me too much. The anatomy and proportions checked out. The overall style was modern-standard. There were a few nature and panoramic shots that looked pretty good. There were a few impact shots that looked alright which were mostly the ""scary"" or ""crazed"" face of Hanesaki, but that\'s about it. They looked alright but didn\'t really leave any impact or give me a sense of the kind of feelings she was having at the time.Animation: 8/10Animation was very good. I was impressed with the...kinds of motions and sequences that were used in this show. I was surprised at the level of animation that went into the actual sports sequences. Full rallies were animated which is a huge plus. Each individual swing, step, and body motion were all included in the animation. While there was some reused animation, specifically in those impact sequences, there was enough variation and new animation mixed in that it deserves a pass. The small details such as sweat and dripping sweat were also nice additions. There weren\'t as many shortcuts taken; there was a good showcase of full body motion: walking, running, etc that wasn\'t cut off by selective framing. Frames weren\'t dropped in the important bits, and generally everything looked nice and fluid. Overall, the impressive impact sequences, the regular well-done sports sequences, nice and fluid standard motions, and nice-looking supporting effects are great parts about this anime.Characters: 4/10I\'m not impressed with the characters or character development. Their annoying dynamics and character developments were two reasons that killed my personal enjoyment of this show. Their dynamics were all centered around building unnecessary and honestly really forced tension, awkwardness, and drama in almost all of their interactions. A majority of the interactions between the characters and groups had to have some sort of poorly reasoned confrontation or staring contest. Riko felt like she was only just there to serve as the mediator and voice of reason. The bit of backstory added to her wasn\'t really developed and felt sort of just like a formality. Riko felt like a typical, ""I\'m a long-time friend who always had your back who acts as the voice or reason. However, I\'ll have a telegraphed outburst at least once in the show to act as the trigger to your final resolution."" Connie was just a device to act as a temporary antagonist until the final antagonist (the antagonist in this case was an idea which was Hanesaki\'s raison d\'etre: playing for herself, and not for her mom) could be fully fleshed out. In fact, once that idea was sort of in place, Connie was basically tossed aside for a few episodes lol. Hanesaki\'s mother had weird motivations that didn\'t feel like they were properly backed up or decently executed. They made sense, but they didn\'t have enough sequences supporting them. Aragaki had a decent but simple setup. The setup between Aragaki and Hanesaki was the whole, ""Two previous rivals that just so happened to end up on the same team"" which another example of this setup would be Haikyuu. Furthermore, Aragaki had the, ""I\'ve discovered that I have a semi-serious injury which just so happens to arise NOW and conveniently be at a point to where if I decide to play against my rival in the final match, I may permanently end my career."" This same trope can be seen in Ping Pong the Animation. Aragaki\'s culmination was fine but predictable. She ended up finding her resolve to fight Hanesaki, winning, and rekindling her love for the sport. Hanesaki\'s character development was disappointing for a majority of the show. Her personal growth stagnated for almost 4 or 5 episodes which is a shame; she became that ""soulless"" yet motivated character for almost a third of the show. She only really developed in the final few episodes going over her past in greater detail and going over her personal thoughts and resolve. In the end her character development played out somewhat predictably. She fought her rival, mid-battle discovered her true motivations, and reconciled with the people she wronged during the show such as her best-friend during the park at sunset scene. I\'m not implying that Aragaki and Hanesaki\'s character development were bad. I\'m happy that they turned out the way they did. What I\'m not impressed with is the stagnation that occurred midway through the show because of the need to build on the atmosphere the forced and blatantly over-the-top drama was trying to build. Their personal asides could all have used just a bit more time and execution. I gave this area a 4/10 because of the unsupporting supporting cast, slow development midway through, and generally awkward dynamics that didn\'t feel real at all.Plot: 6/10Interesting but typical plot setup. It\'s a standard first-year joins some sports club, practices and interacts with club members, goes to a tournament, and finale. The catch is that it\'s about badminton. Something I read recently that has this exact same setup is Sesuji wo Pin! to: Shikakou Kyougi Dance-bu e Youkoso.Development: 4/10Much of what I want to talk about development I mostly discussed in the character area just because it was appropriate to do so. I do want to re-bring up the slow pacing and needless filler interactions. There were way too many dramatic scenarios between groups in this show. Why are the problems between side characters being developed much more than the main character\'s? Why are the main character\'s developments taking a passenger seat and only being developed in maybe the last 2-3 episodes? Not much of Hanesaki\'s past or motivations are looked into until the latter half of the show which means that she pretty much acts like some brat with no reasons to it during the former half. My biggest gripe about this show is that it doesn\'t teach the viewer (not an exaggeration) anything at all about the sport. The badminton was just there. No rules, no basics, nothing at all was taught about badminton. Like the character area, I gave this area a 4/10 because I did not like the slow pacing, lack of proper development to the actions and personalities of the characters, and overall execution of their stories.Music: 7/10No sound design to note. Soundboard was quite nice in which effects such as ""smashes"" and sneaker friction added a lot of flair and life to the matches. Overall, soundboard was very fitting and did very well in creating an exciting sports environment. Bgm was unmemorable and not too catchy in my opinion. Moreover, the bgm didn\'t ""feel"" like it added to the sequences. OP and ED were neat but also sounded like a ""typical anime opening."" I don\'t actually weigh the OP and ED that much; I just bring them up as a side note.Overall: 4/10I personally did not enjoy this show. It was predictable just based on the initial plot setup and it was painful to watch it develop to its predictable climax. The positive parts of this show are the above average art, the impressive animation, and the fitting soundboard. The negative parts about this show were the character and plot development, the awkward and seemingly ungenuine character dynamics, as well as the forced and over-the-top interactions between the characters. kinds of motions and sequences that were used in this show.

Because the story definitely isn't what I'd recommendI've heard some people say that this show is way too dramatic for a sports anime about Badminton. I'd say that it is more like the show takes its story too serious. Sometimes to the detriment of it's characters. Kuroko no Basket is a sports show that takes itself seriously, but still has a aura of camp to it that makes it enjoyable. This show has no camp to it's edgyness...and it just leaves you hating any character that isn't the MC Aragaki. Aragaki is great in this show as she seems completely uninterested or unfazed by the other characters BS. This amazon just wants to play Badminton.The characters are my biggest problem with the show. Motivations and characteristics seem to change for everyone on an ep. to ep. basis. Even after 12 ep., I still wasn't sure what the characters would be like in the 13th. The secondary MC, is one of the worst at this as the entire way through the show she hates her mom for abandoning her, for losing a match. However, anytime we see the mom throughout the show she seems like a super loving mom and a generally nice person. What the Secondary MC thought was abandoning, was actually a business trip that the mom didn't communicate properly..... seriously.The art and sound are the saving grace of the show. When the director stops focusing on character BS and focuses the camera on the sport, it's super well animated; using some CG and hand drawn techniques. There are numerous times we get long shots of play. One huge prop I'll give this show, is that the final showdown gets all the screen time it needs and it is very enjoyable. The Sound effects are also stellar.Overall, If you ever wanted to watch a show that's insecure about the sport it's about this might be for you. It's almost like they thought the audience would get bored of crazy well animated sports play for some reason. and it just leaves you hating any character that isn't the MC Aragaki. Aragaki is great in this show as she seems completely uninterested or unfazed by the other characters BS. This amazon just wants to play Badminton.The characters are my biggest problem with the show.

It's almost like they thought the audience would get bored of crazy well animated sports play for some reason."", 'I REALLY wanted to like this series, but I really need to remind myself that stunning visuals cannot carry an entire series and if it was based on just the animation then I would easily give this something like a 9 but it really must be mentioned it\'s major flaw of it\'s writing.The only real reason that I have put this as an 8 for my own anime list is because whenever I look back over what I have watched, personally if something is higher than a 8 that means it\'s truly very enjoyable and memorable for whatever reason. It\'s strange because I could put...this as a 9 as a reminder to myself that this series has amazing, fluid animation combined with what I\'d say was great sound design and together could be a pure basis on why to watch it, but after some consideration I feel like a 7 is better suited just because the writing simply counteracts that 9 in such a way that if I were not to consider it then it would simply be a disservice to people who want an honest opinion on if this a good series or not.StoryFor starters, throughout the 12 episodes I was repetitively questioning what the main thrive of the story is. With Nagisa, one of the main characters, I can completely understand that she wants to improve because of facing defeat and waking her up to the level she needs to reach, however with Ayano, I have no clue what I\'m supposed to be understanding. She has some strange complex about her mother that makes her amazing at the game of badminton yet personally to me makes no sense why the fact that she gets so competitive or out to prove something. She says that the only reason to play badminton is to win and to prove that she can be the best without her mother, yet she gets presented as if she\'s someone to root for when she arrogantly has no sense of social skills what so ever and doesn\'t think when she speaks and comes across as a complete asshole, yet we need to feel sorry for her being abandoned as if it\'s completely reasonable to be the way she is only when playing badminton but somehow two faced when not playing to be a normal girl. Is she a main character or what because I\'d much rather she be a stepping stone for Nagisa rather than be someone who is probably Nagisa\'s main reason for not being better in the first place with her constant dickish criticism.Art and SoundThe animation is awesome, no doubt about that. No problems with the sound that make me want to mention anything wrong with it, so it must mean it was pretty good as well.CharactersSo with the story segment of this review I suppose I haven\'t really stated what the story was besides these two girls trying to become the best for debatable reasons at least in regards to Ayano, which is either because there is just no story or because the characters are written so annoyingly that it just makes the story as a whole of Nagisa becoming a great player less clear.For me, the worst thing about this series is the characters. The other so called badminton players apart of this school club are so bloody useless it hurts and I cannot remember any of their names. First of all, you\'ve got Nagisa\'s friend who is basically there just to root her on because she\'s terrible at badminton in comparison. Then you have Ayano\'s friend, who is useless because even though she\'s been friends with her for years and introduced her to the school badminton club after her long absence from the sport she doesn\'t take any responsibility for looking after her or being that one trusty person to keep her in line. Then you have all the other bimbos in the club who aren\'t important at all, because they\'re either terrible at the sport or most crucially just are there to be on the receiving end of Ayano\'s dickish personality yet act like they\'ve been friends for ages and are surprised she\'s been so antagonist to any support or team spirit. Literally everyone watching can see how much of an asshole Ayano is and there is no reason to be friends with her at all, it\'s like these other characters just have some internal AI to always try to saying friendly things and get it smacked up in their face yet will keep trying to approach them with the same attitude without even addressing the fact she\'s an asshole.For example, Miss Short Girl whos name I cannot remember who\'s terrible at the sport. Keeps calling Ayano Ayanon or something because of ONE time on a bus where she came up with it on the spot while the team were out on some kind of training camp. Ayano on that trip displayed no real sign of being one of the girls besides occasionally being obliviously cute and apart of one photo she doesn\'t even embrace. This girl I\'m talking about throughout the whole series is like ""Keep it up Ayano, I\'m rooting for you."" and Ayano is like ""Shut up bitch i don\'t need you, leave me alone"" yet in the next scene with them together in a similar badminton situation she\'s straight back at it with the ""Keep it up Ayano."" Sure, she\'s just being a nice person I guess and isn\'t the conflicting type but she and others are on the receiving end of this abuse and throughout the whole series hardly anybody punishes her for it or tells her ""Stop being a little cunt and be our friend, we\'ll help you with your abandonment issues with your mom and teach you to live on your own without weighing on a childhood trauma.""It\'s so frustrating, because even the team coach is like ""Hmm Ayano is acting pretty weird"" yet doesn\'t address her or realise the fact that\'s she unhealthy for herself and the team even when she\'s downright telling people to basically fuck off. And don\'t even get me started on her mother. What\'s the game plan here!? Is she in the right for leaving her daughter or not and why did she actually leave in the first place? All we know is that as Ayano was a child she abandoned her and adopted a new child in a different country. What? WHY? Then she comes back and is like ""Ooh you\'ve gotten pretty good at this badminton sport that I\'ve taught you"" even though she left with no warning or reason and comes back with no reason or warning. Her adopted child doesn\'t even matter either, just to remind Ayano of her complex that she needs to get better for...providing she\'s good at badminton in front of her mum to punish her for leaving her? Are we expecting that Ayano goes to the Olympics, wins all her games and as she stands there with her golden medal she\'s like ""Take that Mum, I did it without you."" Then what? Is that her story complete? I don\'t even know. Why not just get a firm beating by her team to realise that they\'re together and simply play badminton to get good while also having fun like Nagisa.OverallI could really rant about Ayano for a decade and why everyone besides Nagisa is stupid. Maybe I\'ve been blind in some aspects and not emphasised points, but I\'m writing this as if people reading it have also completed the series and can understand why Nagisa\'s drive is much more understandable than literally anyone else.Pretty much, I feel like this series could have been much better had they made the mother an actual antagonist who left for selfish desires because her daughter wasn\'t good enough for her and turned Ayano into a sort of redemption story properly because they try to make this a psychological thing but it\'s never even addressed and just played off at the end as ""Hey, I\'m having fun playing against you Nagisa for you are a worthy, challenging opponent"" but basically meaning that it\'s alright that I\'m a dick to you and also meaning that she\'s still gonna be a dick to everyone else because they aren\'t good enough.This entire series is carried by it\'s stellar animation, and is it\'s saving grace. To be honest, for anyone considering watching this series, it\'s not absolutely awful in it\'s writing. I think that it\'s passable as it\'s just a necessary context for the characters to be playing badminton and in turn a reason to show the great animation, so I\'d still recommend to watch it if you want to watch something about badminton and have your eyes pleased because you\'ll most likely forget about the story until the end and I\'d say it\'s much easier to enjoy the series as a whole if you just put Ayano and her mother as a constant antagonist and Nagisa as the protagonist to root for as opposed to having them on some kind of even footing.7/10 this as a 9 as a reminder to myself that this series has amazing, fluid animation combined with what I\'d say was great sound design and together could be a pure basis on why to watch it, but after some consideration I feel like a 7 is better suited just because the writing simply counteracts that 9 in such a way that if I were not to consider it then it would simply be a disservice to people who want an honest opinion on if this a good series or not.StoryFor starters, throughout the 12 episodes I was repetitively questioning what the main thrive of the story is.

Maybe I\'ve been blind in some aspects and not emphasised points, but I\'m writing this as if people reading it have also completed the series and can understand why Nagisa\'s drive is much more understandable than literally anyone else.Pretty much, I feel like this series could have been much better had they made the mother an actual antagonist who left for selfish desires because her daughter wasn\'t good enough for her and turned Ayano into a sort of redemption story properly because they try to make this a psychological thing but it\'s never even addressed and just played off at the end as ""Hey, I\'m having fun playing against you Nagisa for you are a worthy, challenging opponent"" but basically meaning that it\'s alright that I\'m a dick to you and also meaning that she\'s still gonna be a dick to everyone else because they aren\'t good enough.This entire series is carried by it\'s stellar animation, and is it\'s saving grace. To be honest, for anyone considering watching this series, it\'s not absolutely awful in it\'s writing. I think that it\'s passable as it\'s just a necessary context for the characters to be playing badminton and in turn a reason to show the great animation, so I\'d still recommend to watch it if you want to watch something about badminton and have your eyes pleased because you\'ll most likely forget about the story until the end and I\'d say it\'s much easier to enjoy the series as a whole if you just put Ayano and her mother as a constant antagonist and Nagisa as the protagonist to root for as opposed to having them on some kind of even footing.7/10', ""I feel compelled to write this review as Hanebado! is a mix bag of probably the best of somethings--such as great animation during the badminton scenes, and the worst of everything else.As far at the story goes, there isn't much flow between one thing to the next, I mean in one episode we see a character enter the story, yet next mentioned throughout the next episode. This is just one example. But the story goes from some flow, to none at all as the story is trying to be super edgy and depressed while never having a real need to. It never makes a big...enough impact on you to have that edginess or that depression. And things come from random encounters and random scenes that give very little in both body language or dialogue to have you really understand what is going on.So Art and Sound go hand in hand here, as they are both equally good when the scene calls for it. The Badminton must have been done by watching real badmintoners as it's very crispy and fluent and when the music is right, it does a great job of what's needed of it, but as I said with the story above, there are unnecessary times when it's building a mood that isn't there and feels out of place at best.Characters suffer from the story as well as they are sporadic. The core cast is overall fine, but than we have two out of place badminton players which are there purely it seems to cause harm or hate on the main character. And she is somehow traumatized by it all. I understand how someone can be so engrossed into a sport, but I've seen that done far better in other anime's than this one.So really all that is keeping me watching this at this point is the fluent animation of the badminton and the very few hints that the story is good here and there.

Just Ayano's mother alone is enough to make me dislike the anime. I don't have much tolerance for terrible parenting and I certainly don't enjoy watching characters traumatized for no good reason.It would be better if it just focused on the sports/slice of life aspect but the whole mind-broken little heroine girl concept just drags down the whole feel of the anime. Rather than emotion and character depth, the whole show just feels like a long dragged out pity party.It's watchable, but just barely. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone even if they were bored...and had too much free time on their hands. The artwork and music is good and there are some good aspects. However the over-dramatic trauma and pity significantly outweighs the good aspects. and had too much free time on their hands. The artwork and music is good and there are some good aspects.

Baby Steps, Kurobas, Haikyuu, Free, all of them are really pleasing to watch. Of course, I had an expectation for this anime especially since I myself like badminton but, it was quite a let down tbh. I got immersed into it for the first 2 episodes because they did a really good job on portraying character and story but after that I don't even know what they're aiming anymore.Unlike most of the sports anime, the competition scene wasn't really appealing (with the exception of the last episode)...so I thought they would've focus more on the story but nope, not really. A lot of things in the story was just bland. Character development is undeniably just ridiculous (especially with the change of personality stuff) and there are lots of background story that are like come and go, they tell us about it a bit and just move along without really giving a conclusion.In the end what was this all about? Honestly idk, it's just a come and go for me too anyways. Story was too wrapped up to even find a good conclusion and the competition was just too bland to be attracted for. I guess they wanted to focus on the story, abandoning the competition scene but failed miserably.Overall I give this a 6. Stayed just because my love for badminton and sports anime.

In the beginning, the anime makes us care about Hanesaki's badminton career; there's a secondary character, Hanesaki's friend, to emphasize this point. What we want to see is Hanesaki grow as a character and badminton player. There are many ways to do this: she can restore her love for badminton, she can slowly overcome Connie and become a positive player, she can regain some of her former sheer skill, but maybe in...a more humane way. Instead, the anime gives us none of these. Okay, I guess the anime gives us a little of each in a small way, but what the anime becomes most concerned about is Hanesaki regressing to a state where she's fanatical over her mother, unrealistically insensitive to sportsmanship, and not enjoying badminton at all. The anime seems to be promising that these could be solved, but it really hasn't made an effort to develop Hanesaki's character in 4 episodes.Okay, I get it, the point of anime is not to just hand the viewers what they want. That's too predictable. And I wouldn't want that either. But I am 10 episodes in and this anime has just made the viewers more and more frustrated.Don't get me wrong; it's still great, and I'm hoping it turns around in the last 2 episodes. (I'm not getting my hopes up haha.)But I'm worried, because even the animation quality has taken a noticeable dip from, say, episode 4 or something. a more humane way.

If you wanted her to go to fricken Denmark SCREW IT!!(But for real though)THIS SHOW IS NOT BAD!Need to clarify it because for some reason it has only a 7.2 on MAL and based solely on that most would think it is bad.Hanebado has 2 main characters, both of which are unlikable and boring at the start.We see the tall one turn into a complete incentive piece of crap, then into a genuinely likable Caricature....We see the short one start a peaceful human being, into an insensitive piece of crap, and back into a likable Character. (notice the difference there).Ayanon is someone who i believe is actually a person, and the amount of emotionally destabilizing events she\'d had to put up with in her life make her actions and mindsets warranted.Nagasaki\'s personality is non-existant and is just a caricature of someone who works super hard at sports and has a knee handicap. Her character arc in this story is super short to make way for Ayanon (thank goodness). This character arc is just watching Nagasaki being bossy and intolerably rude to everyone... any real teenagers would have called her out on the crap the second time she did it.Sadly though, this aweful character change is not the biggest sin of this show. The biggest sin is how easy they let off Ayonon\'s mother. (spoilers about ayanon\'s mom, skip to next paragraph to skip). Ayanon\'s Mom left Ayanon when she was in middle school to do 2 things... 1. make Ayanon a better badminton player.... 2. to train Connie. These two things do not warrant LEAVING YOUR DAUGHTER IN JAPAN WITH HER GRANDPARENTS WHILE YOU GO TRAIN YOU NEXT SUPERSTAR! This show does not try to justify this,  but it surely doesn\'t try to bring justice to the child abuse that took place. I believe the quotes from Ayanon\'s mom were ""I know what I did was unforgivable... but I have no regrets about what I\'ve done, and would do it again."" The $%&*......? This ""mother"" if want to give her that title at all, abandoned her daughter because she wasn\'t good enough at a sport, comes back into her life to see if she\'s gotten better, and when she verifies that she had, the mother has the AUDACITY to say ""come travel with me to Denmark."" SCREW DENMARK!!! Tis show would be much close to an 8 if the characters treated this woman with HOSTILITY. Especially the childhood friend who had the mother take Ayanon away from her, but then threw Ayanon out when she was no longer needed. Everyone should be furious, but everyone is jsut so calm and collected i just don\'t get it.These two flaws destroy the show\'s merit from understanding believable character interaction... but there is one thing that makes this show not a 4... and that is the badminton games.The Badminton games are a fricken blast to watch. After Nagasaki becomes you general protag and Ayanon\'s trying to prove her worth to her mom through her badminton play, you just want to root for Ayanon to be happy and for her to snap out of her funk, but you also want to make sure Nagasaki doesn\'t break her knee... so like you don\'t know how this show was going to end. The last 2 epidodes are wonderful to watch, and by themselves I\'d probably rank close to a 9.So to conclude, this show\'s animation quality makes the games feel super intense and fun, you do care for Ayanon but only because she\'s been through hell as a child and you want her to have a win for once in her life that has nothing to do with her mom, and it was just a general blast watching it. Nothing special, and I think the goods and bad\'s even out each other, but i think this show had potential to be an 8 with just a few dialogue changes regarding Nagasaki in the first few episodes and Ayanon\'s mom at the end.Would not watch again, unless it was only the last 2 episodes.

Hanebado tells a story of a high schools girl trying to figure out her relationship with her mom and the sport of badminton. One unique element about this show is that the main protagonist acts like the main antagonist against the supporting characters.The characters in the show are single minded. It seems each of the characters are trying to sabotage each other or just doing badminton individually in an unhealthy way. It was hard to sympathize for the main character or the supporting characters.The sound was pretty good. The sound...of the swish was smooth, and the hitting of the shuttlecock was authentic. Plus, the music played well in the atmosphere of the show.The animation was the best part of the show. The way it goes in detail of how the shuttlecock are hit is breathtaking. of the swish was smooth, and the hitting of the shuttlecock was authentic.

The way it goes in detail of how the shuttlecock are hit is breathtaking.', 'Well, it\'s morning 4am and I\'m writing my first review for this website. I\'m actually interested how it came to this, but I digress and just blame my insomniac craziness. And craziness is actually the term I want to build this review around, as Hanebado gave me a crazy enjoyable experience here. Let\'s Jam.Hanebado or Longer ""The Badminton of Ayano Hanesaki"" is typical sports anime in which several characters are fighting in intense badminton matches to reach the top of the nationals, which is apparently the most prestiguous spot to have for them. We have Ayano Hanesaki an actually talented protagonist, that trained a lot...in sessions when she was younger. Together with her mum, who is the most notorious, well-known prodigy in Japanese Badminton she trains to become better, but one day her mum leaves the home and leaves her alone back in Japan. Ayano thought here she has been abandoned by her mother for not being good enough and thus turns into a literal ""badminton demon"". Her counterpart and rival Aragaki doesn\'t have it as ""easy"" as Ayano and has to train very hard to become as good. The anime here first introduces us Ayano as the protagonist, as the title also tells you, but it does really clever things here which puts it over the rest. The anime switches between protagonists and creates technically a back and forth between both and their seemingly tragic backstories.And this is also the tone of this anime, since it is a badminton game which is likely one on one or at best doubles, it really gets you at some point, because the games are actually well animated, show a ton of creative shots and angles and are overall just nice to see. I did not think you could make Badminton this appealing honestly. What also creates nice flow is the way the anime uses stuff like speedup shots, spins, slowmotions and more. What is first a soft-paced sports anime quickly turns into Shounen-like battles, as you actually feel when the characters are putting things on the line they turn the court into a battlezone where nothing matters but their own next creative shot and how to serve it back. Here is also where the strong point of Hanebado lies, because it never outright tells you who to root for and this is a course throughout the whole story even till the end. Hell, not even the characters in the game know who to root for so how should we? This is something everyone decides on their own as both characters are somehow depicted as harsh and villainy at times and none of them have actual a motive that would warrant them being so overly dramatic on the field. Hanebado is a Seinen Anime though and rather than a basic sports anime its a sports drama and one that will suck you in and not spit you out until you finished the series. You don\'t know who will win at the end, because this depicts the unpredictability of the sport. That is great.Something I did not like though were the characters, particularily the side characters. I\'m bad with names first so I personally just remembered the names of Aragaki and Ayano and that shows how forgettable the side-characters were. Theres the sister of Ayano who is also very good, but thinks that other people just hinder her success and outright refuses to play with them, what a bitch!Next there are the friends and team-partners of Ayano, who she completely disgustingly refuses and tells them to fuck off figuratively. Really painful to see how villainy the people want Ayano to be. The rest of the cast mostly sits on the bench and acts as a spectator.There is a memorable scene with Ayano where she actually is on the lower side of the field and loses and her trainer then blames her for not using good tactics to win. She then turns around and outright refuses his pleadings saying ""It\'s not my Badminton"". Sadly she throws away just that and says afterwards that her Badminton wasn\'t too successful and then uses the trainers strategies...and loses even harder. This scene probably just showed that there is no way to win everytime and that heart works better than theory and tactics. Good scene and a nice moral.Anyways. I would\'ve enjoyed if they toned down the musical support a bit, because it might be somewhat exciting, i just think working with pure silence and sound effects would\'ve had a better effect and atmosphere overall. In the final confrontation they actually use this and they also display a great detail. The anime at this point shows two badminton virtuosos fully at match with each other and fighting until they have no breath anymore. Absolutely thrilling and then the studio decided to cut the voices, soundeffects and panting sounds in a way the whole presentation is split the same as the field they are playing on. That detail amazed me, as it just works so well because in this battle the whole buildup of the anime just comes together well and it coincides with this concept of making you root for both.All in all Hanebado is a really thrilling experience already from the third episode forward, Ayano has this monsteresque personality that comes out only when in combat and you just want to see how she fares. There are no super-powers and special shots with fire or sure-fire win strategies. But Ayano doesn\'t have anything unique like Kurokos presence or Midorimas 3point throws that give her an edge over things. Both just compete at the highest strength with hard work and willpower and thats whats exciting about hanebado.Rating: 8 in sessions when she was younger.

Entre as personagens...a Aragaki salva no meio de um plot tão sem graça, então acabou se tornando minha maior decepção ao fim da temporada (meio triste até, porque eu estava gostando bastante).LITTLE LITTLE SUMMARY: The anime starts with a great art and animation, what gets me on my first look, and the plot gave me the impression that he was going to tell how thw group work would help the girls to increase their personal skills (because in badminton the 1vs1 is the principal game), but the plot with Ayano and her mother in my opinion totally DESTROY everything, and has turned into a mediocre story. Among the characters, Aragaki saves with such bright everything. a Aragaki salva no meio de um plot tão sem graça, então acabou se tornando minha maior decepção ao fim da temporada (meio triste até, porque eu estava gostando bastante).LITTLE LITTLE SUMMARY: The anime starts with a great art and animation, what gets me on my first look, and the plot gave me the impression that he was going to tell how thw group work would help the girls to increase their personal skills (because in badminton the 1vs1 is the principal game), but the plot with Ayano and her mother in my opinion totally DESTROY everything, and has turned into a mediocre story.

A lot of the traditional plot points of a sports anime are rapid-fired at you, just to point out one example, by the halfway point of this 13 episode series we already have major characters playing their final high school badminton matches- it\'s portrayed as...this momentous event but we\'ve had so little time to actually get to know the cast that you can be left feeling ""Wait, what, we\'re already HERE?"" Now I\'m not saying it\'s wrong for a sports series to have a faster pace than average (one of my chief complaints about the sports genre is its often extremely decompressed storytelling which can leave you having to trudge through volume after volume of manga to reach the next significant plot point) but you can go too far in the other direction.ARTNow I do have to give Hanebado credit here, the series looks GOOD. Perhaps not the *very* best thing I\'ve ever seen, but this is higher-end animation quality. I especially respect the fact that TOHO Animation used a lot of shots with different lighting- changing the lighting of a scene changes the entire color palette of a scene, and you\'d be surprised just how many anime opt to simply have all their scenes take place in broad daylight or a brightly lit room. As for the characters, their designs are solidly done, but they don\'t really break out of established archetypes. The art is also a bit excessively fan-service-y at times; let\'s just say some girls were \'endowed\' with more than just athletic ability and some of their badminton outfits looked pretty outlandish compared to what came up in my Google image search of \'Women\'s Olympic Badminton\'.SOUNDMallorie Rodak voices Shiwahime Yuika. Shiwahime is automatically Best Girl. But I digress... Ahem, anyway... Otherwise sound is fine, but I can\'t point any one thing that really pushes it above \'decent\' and \'solid\'.CHARACTERSThis one is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Bullet Train pace of the story means major characters arcs are often blazed through with little impact, and cast members can end up doing heel-face or face-heel turns on a dime. On the other hand, Hanebado did something I legitimately wasn\'t expecting with Main Character Hanesaki Ayano: there were times she was straight-up played as the villain. In most sports stories I\'ve seen, when a character is The Jerk that\'s their whole character- they ARE The Jerk. But without going into excessive spoiler territory, the more we learn about Hanesaki the more we see that while she has positive characteristics and is generally nice and likable under certain circumstances she has this nasty streak to her personality that completely takes over. And this bad part of her isn\'t glossed over, nor do they rely on the old trick of hiding a character\'s flaws by pitting her against someone far morally worse, there are times when you\'ll be left thinking ""OK, this girl needs to lose and get some sense knocked into her."" It just wasn\'t something I was expecting from the moe MC who is clearly going to be the character selling the merchandise.OVERALL ENJOYMENTHanebado is fun, but it has its flaws, some of them significant. I won\'t tell you to skip it, but I can\'t say it deserves to be near the top of your list either. Watch it if you\'re in the mood. this momentous event but we\'ve had so little time to actually get to know the cast that you can be left feeling ""Wait, what, we\'re already HERE?""

I especially respect the fact that TOHO Animation used a lot of shots with different lighting- changing the lighting of a scene changes the entire color palette of a scene, and you\'d be surprised just how many anime opt to simply have all their scenes take place in broad daylight or a brightly lit room. As for the characters, their designs are solidly done, but they don\'t really break out of established archetypes. The art is also a bit excessively fan-service-y at times; let\'s just say some girls were \'endowed\' with more than just athletic ability and some of their badminton outfits looked pretty outlandish compared to what came up in my Google image search of \'Women\'s Olympic Badminton\'.SOUNDMallorie Rodak voices Shiwahime Yuika. Shiwahime is automatically Best Girl. But I digress... Ahem, anyway... Otherwise sound is fine, but I can\'t point any one thing that really pushes it above \'decent\' and \'solid\'.CHARACTERSThis one is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Bullet Train pace of the story means major characters arcs are often blazed through with little impact, and cast members can end up doing heel-face or face-heel turns on a dime. On the other hand, Hanebado did something I legitimately wasn\'t expecting with Main Character Hanesaki Ayano: there were times she was straight-up played as the villain. In most sports stories I\'ve seen, when a character is The Jerk that\'s their whole character- they ARE The Jerk. But without going into excessive spoiler territory, the more we learn about Hanesaki the more we see that while she has positive characteristics and is generally nice and likable under certain circumstances she has this nasty streak to her personality that completely takes over. And this bad part of her isn\'t glossed over, nor do they rely on the old trick of hiding a character\'s flaws by pitting her against someone far morally worse, there are times when you\'ll be left thinking ""OK, this girl needs to lose and get some sense knocked into her."" It just wasn\'t something I was expecting from the moe MC who is clearly going to be the character selling the merchandise.OVERALL ENJOYMENTHanebado is fun, but it has its flaws, some of them significant. I won\'t tell you to skip it, but I can\'t say it deserves to be near the top of your list either. Watch it if you\'re in the mood.', ""Good things I have to say about Hanebado:-It was beautifully animated.-It brought attention to a sport that doesn't get a lot of attention.-Gave us a show about female athletes without making it entirely about fanservice.Everything else was generally not good or just not enjoyable for me to watch. I went into this thinking I was going to absolutely love it. I was so ready to fall in love with these characters. And then... I met these characters. I have rarely watched an anime where I found main characters to be quite so unlikable. I kept holding out, not dropping this show in...the hopes that they would grow on me. Instead, by the last episode I just felt more frustrated. The story and characters are both just lacking. the hopes that they would grow on me. Instead, by the last episode I just felt more frustrated. The story and characters are both just lacking."", ""Hanebado! is one of the most intense and thrilling anime I've ever seen despite the show revolving around a seemingly innocuous premise (a high school badminton club). It's secret ingredient are the conflicts and flaws woven into the characters backstories and personalities that uplift the simple but effective central plot. A game of badminton in this anime is never as carefree as a cakewalk because badminton for the girls in this anime is intertwined with their sense of identity, ambitions and pasts. This adds layers of intrigue and themes to the beautifully animated story without ever feeling cluttered or melodramatic.Even though the plot (a...sports tournament arc) is admittedly simple it's very lovable. There are enough surprises, stakes and obstacles to build it compellingly with satisfying conclusions to finish it off. No part of the plot feels underplayed or unnecessary in this story. This is refreshing to see in anime where plot is often time the most neglected piece because it's most likely awfully slow and aimless. The story here paces itself perfectly briskly with a purpose and introduces us to a wonderful array of characters that really drive it.The characters in this story have varied ambitions and personalities which makes the story feel more lively. The show manages to introduce flaws and skills into every character without any trait ever coming across as annoying or nonsensical (thankfully). These facets are treated earnestly with minimal plot armour appearing in the show. The drama and release in the show is immensely satisfying when it comes from such a well developed cast.All of this is wrapped up in God-tier production quality featuring superb writing, clean and aesthetic animation, and heart wrenching music. Season 1 of Hanebado! is a must watch for me. I pray with all my heart and soul and tears that this show gets a second season as good as this one. sports tournament arc) is admittedly simple it's very lovable.

I pray with all my heart and soul and tears that this show gets a second season as good as this one."", 'Hanebado! is the other girl-centric focused sports anime and well it might as well be the diametric opposite of Harukana Receive.Hanebado! focuses on Ayano Hanesaki voiced by Hitomi Ohwada who has talent in badminton however doesn\'t want to be in the badminton club for parental reasoning\'s, however she with the badminton coach as well as her colleagues she reluctantly starts playing badminton and faces new rivals and gets back into the game.Ok, so where Hanebado will have a mixed view is on our main protagonist Ayano Hanesaki voiced by Hitomi Ohwada, as a negative, Ayano is a unique main protagonist that yes has some parental...issues that drives her to the point of only caring to reach her goals and not caring about her rivals or allies, only her own goals to the point of seeing her as something of an anti-hero, her goals poisoned and corrupted by her own goals and devastating anyone who gets in her way in a rather clalous way possible. But to Ayano\'s defence, she does have some legitimate reasonings as to her ""callousness"" and that is because of her mommy issues and well Ayano\'s mother outright abandoned her that caused her to just break and the thing is, Ayano\'s mother abandoned her and had her own prodigal badminton daughter in the process, which by plot standards becomes a major rival for Ayano. So yes, Ayano has her reasonings and has somewhat a good defence for her personality all things considered.Hanebado!\'s cast also does well to mix with Ayano the best being Nagisa Aragaki voiced by Miyuri Shimabukuro, one of the best in her club and works her butt off to be the best badminton player and is the polar opposite to Ayano, everything from their playstyles and beliefs in badminton, along with her we also have LA\'s favorite character in the anime, Riko Izumi voiced by Yuuna Mimura, a third year and having something of an inferiority complex compared to her younger members but is one of the more supportive characters and someone that cares for the rest of the cast. Other members include Erena Fujisawa voiced by Konomi Kohara, the person who got Ayano back into badminton but doesn\'t really play badminton and is just a supportive pillar for Ayano and the rest of the club. Of course for a sports anime there are rivals and though there is the initial rivalry of Ayano and Nagisa through their ideals, there are other rivals Ayano goes through, from the irredeemably annoying Kaoruko Serigaya voiced by Asami Shimoda and Connie Christensen voiced by Mariya Ise who not only has a  rivalry through badminton but it goes further when it has to do with Ayano\'s mother in the process that LA aforementioned. Hanebado! makes some of the rivals Nagisa and Ayano goes through as either blatantly evil for the sake of it in this case of Kaoruko but also sympathetic in this case of Connie and LA is fine with that in some sense but also due to the anime\'s major focus on Ayano\'s unrelenting belief on how she plays badminton as well how it affects her family life especially when it involves Ayano\'s mother is a different thing altogether.Hanebado! goes on a different direction for it\'s clash of playstyles and beliefs on the sports in question, LA is fine with that as it\'s brilliantly handled between Nagisa and Ayano. Nagisa being dedicated to badminton her whole life and strives to be the best on her own merits, yes she sticks to a playstyles but she opens up and does new tactics to hone her skills with the backing of her friends in the process, she\'s essentially working her natural talent as a crutch and seeing how far it takes her, on the other spectrum we have the child prodigy Ayano who uses badminton as both a copping mechanism and naturally flaunts her experience, but she had no backing from her friends and family and when she DOES get the attention and help from others yes at first she accepts it and gets her back into badminton, but due to her anger, grudge and rage towards her rivals and especially her mother she discards it just to get back at her mother and her goals through winning as revenge against her mother, playstyle wise, she keeps to one playstyle but due her being a badminton child prodigy she KNOWS of other playstyles and quickly gets use to it thus being the ""experience"" vs. Nagisa\'s talent, but her playstyle reflects her feelings most of which are anger which in some cases are warranted and because of her self-isolating herself to strive for her goal of winning, she isolated herself completely without any backing from her friends she made along the way even when some of her friends WANTS to help her. This opposition between Nagisa and Ayano finally rings true by the final match and what occurs when these two finally face off with one another.....who wins, who knows as they both have great backing as to why they want to win, just with different beliefs and playstyles weighing them through the match and THAT is where Hanebado! comes into it\'s best with these clash of ideals that just made Hanebado! so great.Like, LA didn\'t like Ayano when she slowing transitioned into her demon side (though crazy badass in some sense) but through the clash and lead up to the final match of Hanebado! with Nagisa, LA finally understood what Hanebado! was going for and made Ayano\'s inclusion all the more unique and interesting which coupled with the great animation only made the anime even better...on speaking of which...In terms of animation by LIDENFILMS, well to say it\'s fluid in it\'s matches is saying not enough, considering how the actions of each of the matches are soo well done and fluid as hell, the animation done by LIDENFILMS was great, along with it\'s polished character designs making each of them distinct AND Ayano\'s demon side makes the anime\'s animation very well done to say the least. LIDENFILMS put their all in the animation and for a sports anime, LA saw some tinge of LIDENFILMS\' marks as LA primarily knows LIDENFILMS for their viscerally action packed fantasy animes, Hanebado! has some stylistic touches that LA could only see LIDENFILMS do and it helped on that front. Nonetheless, LIDENFILMS shines when doing the badminton matches as fluid, quick paced and action-filled which is the obvious main draw to a badminton anime which it did just that...In terms of voice acting, for the most part, LA was just ""ok"" with the voice cast, not horrible but not in the spectrum of great either. Though LA didn\'t like Ayano as a character, LA will give it to Hitomi Ohwada that she still portrayed her well with her calm demeanor, vastly changed into her badminton demon form and how much of a stoic monster her performance is is something to give praise too. Due to some of the rivals Hanebado! has being just outright asshole characters (like Asami Shimoda as Kaoruko and in some sense Connie as Mariya Ise), but nonetheless LA will say they did well as rival characters to contrast to Hitomi Ohwada. Overall, the voice cast is ok with some highs that caught LA\'s interest.Hanebado! was at first, LA didn\'t understand why Ayano was such an anti-hero and really unlikable but LA understood by the end of it that this was a good thing making an anti-hero of a main protagonist couple that with the clash of beliefs to her main rival Nagisa and many of her rivals reeling the tension of this badminton anime be it through parental issues or badminton itself to make it a great anime no matter how artificial or not, sure the anime has some of the typical sports anime tropes, from the shy girl opening herself up and gaining the courage, some romantic tension to some of the other cast members, jobbing rivals and ""friendship through playing sports"" and of course the main focus of Hanebado! being of Ayano and Nagisa\'s polar opposite developments to strive for their goals to be the best but with all the bad and good weighed up by the end of it, well LA found Hanebado! both uniquely interesting for an intense sports anime and by both balancing and doing good use to it\'s more psychological family drama added in that worked well, sure LA didn\'t like some characters namely Ayano but the bulk of the anime involving Ayano and Nagisa had MASSIVELY great development both badminton and personality wise. Seriously both Nagisa and Ayano\'s rivalry was the best highlight of this anime and made this anime entirely worth it. The only dividing consensus LA will see how you view Hanebado! is all on Ayano, if you hate her or you love her will have problems later on like how LA did but really it\'s small potatoes to the larger scale of what Hanebado! offers and ONE character being outside the norm is hardly something to bring the entire anime down which Hanebado! handled quite well, be it intentional or not.Hanebado! is just amazing for a badminton anime, fluidly animated and intense in both it\'s drama and intense sports and even though LA only watched two sports anime but nonetheless Hanebado! earned LA\'s respect for what it was trying to achieve and it execute it brilliantly, Hanebado! is surprising enough LA\'s favourite sports anime of Summer 2018 and fine there isn\'t much competition (the other being Harukana Recieve) but still...the point still stands and with how LA progressed through the anime, Hanebado might as well also be LA\'s dark horse of Summer 2018 as well...apt considering Ayano as a character. issues that drives her to the point of only caring to reach her goals and not caring about her rivals or allies, only her own goals to the point of seeing her as something of an anti-hero, her goals poisoned and corrupted by her own goals and devastating anyone who gets in her way in a rather clalous way possible.

It might be because I used to be play varsity badminton in high school. Or I just enjoy a good satisfying anime. Either way, I really enjoyed this show a lot.Now the storytelling is not the greatest. People complain a lot because after watching, they didn't learn shit about the game. But you know what, I don't need an episode or two to explain to me how to score a point in this game. It is about a child prodigy, Hanesaki, and the schools team captain, Aragaki. Hanesaki's talent is not god given...either. She worked hard since she was young against her mother who is most likely the Michael Jordan of badminton with how the show presented her. Aragaki, is the hardworking captain who vows to improve her game after realizing she is miles behind Hanesaki. Yes, it doesn't have a deep plot but for what it is, it works for me. An anime for a sport I used to play competitively. 8/10The visuals is where the show truly shines though. Slick looking animations and surprisingly realistic exchanges. The way the shuttlecock moves when hitting the racket. S. A. K. U. G. A. 10/10Music is good too. Especially the ending song. Man I really love playing that on my drums. But aside from that, the sound editing is excellent as well. The sound of the volleys is sweet music to my ears. 9/10The characters is where the show lacks tho, according to most of the reviews. But I will say that it is not as shallow as they say. Aragaki is well developed. You cannot help but root for her every damn time. Hanesaki, I hate. But that's not to say I hate her for no reason. She is someone I hate because the show gives you a reason to hate her. Saying more than that will spoil the show though. Erena, Connie, Riko, Kaoruko and Tachibana are decent supporting characters. The rest are forgettable but that's not the show's fault. This is not a team sport. You cannot have a match where all the players are highlighted. Or superpowered fantasy shounen where characters dress as colorful and dumb as they can to make you remember them. They are high school varsity players that wear the same uniform. What more do you ask? 8/10Overall, I really enjoyed this show a lot. Plus it has a satisfying end. Which is always a win in my book. It might be my pick for AOTS.

I'd say yes but keep in mind that there are things you probably wont likeShort version? The art and the feeling of the badminton looked great, but the way the story moved and specific characters acted felt so wrong and unnecessary. What happened in the anime was fine but because of discrepancies  and things that were over the top it turned out a lot worse than it needed to be.Now to expand...on it all.Hanebado mainly revolves two girls, one who works very hard to get where she is and another who seems to have been born with immense talent, there are lots of support and side characters that go along with them that each play a great role the make the series feel more fulfilling. The first one, Aragaki the captain of the team struggles with her own problems early own revolving around her skill due to a loss, this lead to a good change. However the main problem that causes this anime to falter in my opinion revolves around the other girl, Ayano.This part will contain info/spoilers about her, nothing will be ruined from reading this however... Ayano was brought up with badminton because of her mom being a famous player, she had fun and tried to make her mom proud by being the best player she can be as many children might do, however due to a loss the mother was disappointed and vanished from Ayano's life. One might imagine sadness or weakness and feelings of the sort to brew because of this but it became something terrible instead, Ayano became a hateful character with an extreme edgy vibe constantly going, this could have been fine if toned down and other feeling mixed it but this is not the case. The story moved in a fashion that I felt was normal/good for a sports anime like this but because of Ayano along with a few other problems directly revolving around her.Things I liked:>I actually quite enjoyed majority of the cast, some of them might not of been as fleshed out as I would've liked but it's only 1 season> The art looked really nice and pleasing, the girls were made to look cute/sexy as well but not in an overbearing way that is shoved in your face>Disregarding the clash between certain characters, I think the direction the story went was good>During the final two episodes Aragaki got a different art/style to really emphasize the situation, it felt appropriate and looked goodThings I didn't like:>Ayano was hateful and edgy to a dumb degree, a tone down of this and a mix of other emotions would've felt much better> A character acted one way and then suddenly changed to the opposite, this would've been fine if there was some show for it at least> Ayano also got a art/style change but it made her look older and more like her mother, it felt weird>I think for the purpose of the anime what the mother did was fine but it felt like it was portrayed in a bad way, there was also little follow up for the amount of tension brought up with her on it all.Hanebado mainly revolves two girls, one who works very hard to get where she is and another who seems to have been born with immense talent, there are lots of support and side characters that go along with them that each play a great role the make the series feel more fulfilling.

This is because of the inclusion of all the necessity of a typical sporting anime, such as \'Drama\', \'Social Conflict\', ""Redemption\' and \'Intense Sporting Scenes\'.What I enjoyed the most is the well-animated badminton games to represent how the athletes were feeling during the game, and showing some realism to how badminton was played. What amazes me is the amount of detail put into the movement of sweat and muscle cramping during the match. Other than that, the character animation was indeed...well drawn to meet my liking. Despite focuses more on the girl\'s side, the amount of detail into the action was equivalent to what you see in male sporting shows.Regarding the story itself, it shows a lot of family issues and psychological games. In this case, Ayano suffers from a family problem and using this to her advantage throughout the latter half of the season. As a result of becoming villainous after her match with her childhood nemesis. In this show, family relationship played a huge factor, especially for Ayano\'s case. As for Nagisa, despite acting selfishly at the early parts of the season, she progressively becomes more mature throughout and was able to move on from her dark past.

From there you will see more content than from this review. But hope this review convinces you all to give this fantastic all-girls badminton sporting anime. well drawn to meet my liking. Despite focuses more on the girl\'s side, the amount of detail into the action was equivalent to what you see in male sporting shows.Regarding the story itself, it shows a lot of family issues and psychological games. In this case, Ayano suffers from a family problem and using this to her advantage throughout the latter half of the season. As a result of becoming villainous after her match with her childhood nemesis. In this show, family relationship played a huge factor, especially for Ayano\'s case. As for Nagisa, despite acting selfishly at the early parts of the season, she progressively becomes more mature throughout and was able to move on from her dark past.

The various tournament arcs along with the exciting underdog stories make for a engrossing series of affairs.Hanebado interested me not just because its a sports anime, but also because it is based on Badminton which is a sport you generally don't see much of.The story line is good enough and even contains a hint of some of the more mature topics such as body shaming. It is the story of the badminton prodigy Hanesaki whose mother left her without any explanations and she...has been finding the reason for playing badminton ever since. It is also the story of Nagisa Aragaki who lost miserably to Hanesaki in a tournament and has been unable to get a hold of herself ever since.What it is not is the story of other characters. Most of the anime focuses on Hanesaki, her treacherous relationship with badminton and its effects on the other people. I think there was a huge possibility missed in the sense that the anime doesn't really dive deep into the story of other characters. For example- in the case of coach Tachibana, it would have been better if his background was brought out in a more elaborate and graphical way. I haven't read the manga so I can't say what happens afterwards, but speaking purely from the viewpoint of the anime, I think there was a big missed opportunity.The animation is really good. The fast paced badminton scenes, the switching of Hanesaki from a friendly to foe mode has been really well brought out. The dynamics and movements of players during the matches are quite akin to what you might see in a real life badminton match, so full points for that. Also, there is a scene in the last episode where everything is muted during the match, and you can just hear the breath of the players. I found it really amazing.The soundtrack is also great. Especially the ED which kind of gears you up for the next episode. The soundtrack during the matches used to bring out the tension and excitement has also been very well made.Again, the characters could have been developed in a better way. I really saw much potential in the likes of Tachibana and Gaku, but in the end it felt like an opportunity missed. Overall, the anime is pretty enjoyable and good enough to keep you hooked. Its not one of the best sports anime tbh because it just lacks the kind of development, which could have been brought out had it continued further. You never really tear up or go full on cheering for a certain character. Rather, you just sit there watching a nice and entertaining match which is just good good, but not great enough to rank among the best has been finding the reason for playing badminton ever since.

Another brilliant aspect of this anime is yup the killer eyes lol yes certain characters will get this look in their eyes like they are ready to kill or something which looks awesome.This is your typical sports anime nothing out of the ordinary but I will say this watch this anime and you'll feel a bit of Haikyuu every now and then I also felt it was a bit similar to Kejio but yknow with less Ecchi butt actions although this series has its fair share of fan service, there is drama but hey what's a sports series without drama there is a going to be that typical stuff like you aren't alone we are a team or the sport is more fun playing as a team etc.. and the Main Character has her drama with her shitty mother, I feel like this series could have gone for 24 episodes because it has potential so I went and read the manga and found out there are some things that's a bit different some characters are in the manga while they aren't in the anime but it's not all bad tho, I'll continue to read the manga hoping that it will get a season 2 and to see where they take the story and how the characters develop.Overall I really enjoyed this anime and that's what matters whether you enjoyed it or not...............Spoiler.............let me just straight out and say that the Main Character has a shitty mother oh my god I hate her mother, I was so happy when the Main Character Ayanao decided yknow what time to drop what ever love she had for this person because come on you can't just walk out on your daughter just to make her focus and develop on badminton and her daughter was a little kid at that time so of course t's going to be affect her at that age I'm not feeling the mother at all. and the opening and ending are brilliant so colorful and so beautiful they went all out on the ending song and visuals tho.

Ayano basic premise is finding out the reason she plays badminton and then there some mother problem or something. Nagisa is literally about showing that her effort means something.Then there is a tournament arc and everyone loves tournament arcs right?There are some supporting character that get arcs as well but my god they are not that good at all.Also it doesn't follow the manga 100%. It changes a lot of things or makes things much more dramatic.Art: 9/10Probably the reason you are going to even watch this. The animation is just phenomenal in this show. The badminton scenes...look amazing. Of course like most shows though it does tend to get worse as you get into the later episodes but it still is no where near as bad as Yuri on Ice was.Sound: 7/10Great opening and ending. The soundtrack does its job and the sound effect have a lot of impact in the badminton scenes.Character: 3/10All the characters are just terrible. Ayano becomes almost annoying as hell in the second half. Nagisa is really unlikable at the beginning, yes I get it is the point so that she gets an character arc where she gets better but in the later half of the show she is just so boring. The supporting cast aren't any better either. Connie is unlikeable Kaoruko is very unlikeable and Uchika is just the worse.By the end of the series nothing feels resolved at all with these characters.I honestly don't understand why they didn't just follow the manga accurately? The characters are much better in the manga and much more likeable.Enjoyable: 7/10The first half is very enjoyable and the animation is enough to keep you intersted. The story is just very bad and the characters are bad as well.Overall 5/10Should've followed the manga look amazing.

The style of animation really shines through especially in the opening for the anime and also the amount of details and players movement in the badminton matches....The animation quality is, in my opinion, the best of the summer 2018 season and even a contender for best animation of the year.The character development is also a strong point of this anime. Nagisa was a really good character with a lot of character developments in the first few episodes and the writer also did a great job in developing the side characters as well with most side characters given a small part in every episode or even an entire episode to develop their character without losing focus on the main characters.However, this anime is not without it’s shortcoming. I know that the anime is also called “ the badminton play of Ayano Hanesaki” but don’t forget that Nagisa is also a main character in this anime. They put so much focus on Nagisa’s character development to push her to the side to become a supporting character in the middle part of the anime. This is the reason that most people don’t like the plot of this anime but they did rectify this later on in the TOURNAMENT ARC. One more other thing that I wished that the anime could have add more is Connie and Hanesaki interaction after the tournament arc.

Let me give it to you as straight as possible. This show is great as long as you are only here for the sport or visual aspects of it. Everything else is actually dogshit.Now, this review covers spoilers! so look no further than here if you want to try the show.Now as said above the visuals of HAnebado are amazing. The details are impressive. It is one of the many draws the show has from the get-go.  Now this series starts like Haiykuu!! does. Your main girl Nagisa is the...classic work for it and will get it kind of charter. However, she gets absolutely destroyed by Ayano the op as hell character fo the series. Now after this thrashing they both end up as the same school. Where you start to think ""Oh they will team up and get over the hurtles together to be better or 1 v 1 against each other a lot and be good rivals.""Do they?....... For like the first three eps teamwork and that seem like the idea....until is dies quickly at ep 4. After that Ayano does a 180 and this show moves on with Kirito mark 2.79  I am going to stop there for if I go on I will spoil everything.Now the characters are the main bane of the story. Mainly Ayano\'s mom or any of Ayano\'s rivals.  Who I can even begin to speak of how much I hate her. I am sure she shit. Like her char. makes no sense. Like from the plot I have no idea why she had a kid. Like for eps 1-11, I have no idea how or why she would procreate. She is just a shit human being who has no regrets of abandoning her child to make her like badminton for her own sake or some dumb shit like that. Ayano is just a shit version or exact version of kirito. It is like they thought to make an antihero like Hachiman for SNAFU, but took away all the character form him. Mainly all the characters do 180 like every eps for little to no reason. The only good char. is Nagisa but she fucks off at ep 4.The writing is god awful. it seems like the animator got all the money while every other department got lackluster people. I feel bad for anyone who had to work o this show. Since it is dogshit.All in all, this is a case of the MANGA IS BETTER!!! kind of thing. I wouldn\'t know though since this anime has turned me off entirely form the series. I would personally seek to fail the show if told I could. If you think I am being too harsh or missed the point of the show you watch it and come back and call me wrong with a good backing of facts(from the show no manga facts) and I will not change but lessen my smolder hate a little. classic work for it and will get it kind of charter.

The story was not very memorable for me, but the moments that these characters shared together and how they grew from their hate was entertaining to watch.What stuck to my mind though, was when these two would play against each other, the animation of their movements, the sound of their rackets the moment it hits the shuttle cock, the passion they have when they play, the emotions they feel like anger or indifference are well shown through their eyes. I think it was a really well done anime when it...came to these moments. It's nerve-racking yet also really exciting, a lot of scenes gave me goosebumps. came to these moments.

Given my displeasure, I was so dismayed how the anime focused more on the drama aspect of the MC which took away the enjoyment of the series.

It\'s a melodrama show disguised as a sports anime. Now don\'t get me wrong, the animation was definitely not subpar; every match was well drawn out that it just looked explosive. The facial expressions during tense moments were outstanding and I dare say it sent shivers down my spine at times. You can tell a lot of dedication and hard work went into making this anime very pleasing to the eye.Now, where do the flaws kick in? If it has good animation then surely it must be good right?

ReviewAs of recently, my appreciation for sports anime has grown from what it initially was. Much of my appreciation for this genre has come from my love for Haikyuu!! and Free!! Both of these shows have managed to become some of my favorites in the sports genre of anime and perfectly demonstrate the appeal of their own respective sports in numerous ways. I didn’t want my newfound appreciation of sports anime to dwindle out immediately, so I took it upon myself to search for other well-received sports shows. The anime that I ended up stumbling upon was a series called, HANEBADO! In this review,...I’ll be talking about the story, characters, animation/art, music, and my overall thoughts on the show.Story: 6/10 (Fine)HANEBADO! is a badminton anime about hard work, determination, and the purpose behind pursuing the things we love. At first glance, this show may look like your typical sports anime, and you’d be 100% right in thinking that. Unlike Haikyu!! or Free!!, HANEBADO! doesn’t strive to do or say anything all too different from what you're used to. It plays around with interesting themes and concepts, but given the short length of the series, not much was ultimately achieved. Unfortunately, the story of HANEBADO! is its weakest aspect.Characters: 6/10 (Fine)One of the things that stood out to me in this series was how most of the characters were handled. As mentioned before, HANEBADO! is a fairly short anime. With only 12 episodes to get the viewer attached to its characters, I suspected I’d be walking away unimpressed. While not bad, most of the characters can be described as ok. This applies to Ayano Hanesaki as well. Despite being one of the two main characters in the show, Ayano came off as unlikeable and bland in almost every episode. I think a large part of the reason I felt this way about her was because of her antagonistic nature. Shortly after Ayano’s return to badminton, her personality is completely flipped. She goes from being timid and friendly, to someone who neglects her friends and only thinks about winning the next match ahead of her. I understand that she needed time to develop as a likeable character, but this drastic shift in her personality left me a bit conflicted at times. I’m sure I’m not the only one who thought of this, but Ayano sometimes comes off as the villain for a large part of the season. In fact, I found myself rooting for her rivals more times than not. Thankfully, Ayano isn’t the only main character in HANEBADO! The second main character I’d like to talk about is Nagisa Aragaki. Initially, I wasn’t a big fan of Nagisa. She came off as cold, rude, and downright cruel to her teammates at the start of the season. To my surprise Nagisa actually acknowledges these faults, and does something about them. She starts living up to her reputation as captain of the team, and even learns to support her teammates as best she can. With that in mind, I think it's safe to say Nagisa is my favorite character in HANEBADO!! She’s smart, kind, and a great representation of “hard work pays off,” in a show that’s largely focused on that exact themeAnimation/Art: 8/10 (Great)Animation is always something I’ll value in an anime. When done right, it can really affect my enjoyment of a show. In the case of HANEBADO!!, they absolutely knocked it out of the park. Movements felt fluid and really helped demonstrate how intense a match of badminton can truly be. If there’s one thing that makes this show worth watching, it's the animation.Music: 7/10 (Good)For the most part, the OST does its job right. Some of the best matches are usually accompanied with some stellar music, which made some of the scenes all the more memorable. If you want some uplifting and motivational music to listen to, I’d definitely recommend some of these tracks.Final Score: 6/10 (Fine)Overall, I’d say HANEBADO! is a fine show. Aside from the beautiful animation and top-notch music, there’s not much here to talk about. If you're looking to feed your hunger for sports anime, I’d recommend checking out this series. I’ll be talking about the story, characters, animation/art, music, and my overall thoughts on the show.Story: 6/10 (Fine)HANEBADO! is a badminton anime about hard work, determination, and the purpose behind pursuing the things we love. At first glance, this show may look like your typical sports anime, and you’d be 100% right in thinking that. Unlike Haikyu!! or Free!!, HANEBADO! doesn’t strive to do or say anything all too different from what you're used to. It plays around with interesting themes and concepts, but given the short length of the series, not much was ultimately achieved.

In sports anime, this trope is overused, so I was expecting a different end where Ayano stays in the dark side and become more twisted, such as love destroying player who enjoy badminton.I was rooting for Ayano right from the beginning, with her sad past and her dark characteristic is pretty enjoyable to watch, she\'s very quirky and special, while Nagisa on the other hand is pretty bland. She\'s boring, feels like a generic character with the...motto ""friendship, effort and victory"" shounen genre type. She lacks any specialty, so the plot ended up nerfing other character to her level for the fairness.I\'m already at the age where to understand that effort doesn\'t always equal to success anymore, so seeing this generic youth trope ending is pretty hard for my soul.It was a good 8/10, but then episode 12 and 13 comes in, and it drops to 5/10, bland and generic. motto ""friendship, effort and victory"" shounen genre type.

Weirdly I ended up reading the manga first then I think that influenced my feeling for the anime.Hanebado!'s manga isn't necessarily that much better, but I think it presented the ultimately similar tone of the story in a more balanced way than the anime did. The anime's biggest issue to me I feel like is just that, it feels very unbalanced.

And the animation was still top tiered."", ""It's interesting how much impact a few tweaks to an established formula can make to a story. Based on the early scenes of this badminton series, I assumed the main character would be a typical genki girl whose badminton pro mother suffered the usual case of Protagonist Parental Death Syndrome (Diagnositic Manual of Anime Diseases, 1st ed) before her daughter reached high school. That's not how it goes though. Hanesaki's mother abandoned her, and that's how it starts: the fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good badminton players...cruel. Having disengaged from the sport when she entered high school, her well-meaning friend drags...her back to it, little knowing that the more Hanesaki fixates on badminton, the more her pain and bitterness turn her into a monster.The other wrinkle Hanebado! adds to the usual formula is which characters it focuses on. The usual pattern in sports anime is that the perspective characters will start off in a slump and claw their way to victory through hard work and guts. While there's an element of that, Hanebado! spends most of its time in the head of the character who loses each match, focusing on what drives them to keep playing even when they have seemingly hit a wall they can't climb.The art and music deserve special mention. Hanesaki's downward spiral is a visible transformation, first in the dead-eyed stare she develops during matches, and culminating in her looking to have aged a decade in the span of a few months by the climactic match in the final few episodes. The animation for the badminton scenes is outstanding, and remains consistent throughout the series. The story doesn't focus on characters having over-the-top signature moves, instead being a pretty technical depiction of the sport, and it's impressive that the animation manages to maintain a feeling of drama and dynamism despite that. Meanwhile the music often adds an unusually dark feeling behind the action, reflecting the doubts of the characters as much as the intensity of the action.It all comes together into a good self-contained story arc in its 13 episodes. While sports stories could always carry on forever, it resolves the major conflicts it establishes, so it doesn't feel like there are too many loose ends. By daring to take a less glamorous look at what drives people to push themselves in the face of adversity, Hanebado! stands out from the crowd. I take issue with some of the actions the writer seems to vindicate in the end, but this is still one of the more memorable sports shows of the last decade. her back to it, little knowing that the more Hanesaki fixates on badminton, the more her pain and bitterness turn her into a monster.The other wrinkle Hanebado! adds to the usual formula is which characters it focuses on.

If you\'re the type of person who enjoys sports anime and sakuga you are going to LOVE this show. The animation is stunning. Matches are fast and tense thanks to the use of fast camera angles, slow-down shots to emphasise power and rotoscope animation which makes the characters (and all of the sweat [and Nagisa\'s boobs]) practically leap out of the screen.From the racket swings to the contraction of muscles to the speed of the shuttlecock, I honestly couldn\'t believe that this is a Lidenfilms production. The presentation is gorgeous and I give my compliments...to the team who put this show together.On the surface it presents the theme of its story as \'talent vs practice\' but by the end of episode 3, you\'ll start to realise that this a show exploring the psychology around bad sportsmanship and how it affects the plays both on and off the court.The first episode introduces team captain Aragaki Nagisa who, after being crushed at a tournament by an unknown player goes on a tirade against her Badminton club members, taking out her temper and frustrations on them on and off the court.We are later introduced to Hanesaki Ayano who seems shy and reserved on the service, but when she picks up the racket again it becomes evident that she\'s incredibly talented and naturally gifted with good eyesight which she uses to take out her unresolved parental abandonment issues on whoever is unlucky enough to face off against her.The other main players have their on over competitive quirks and this makes for tense, nail-bitingly and most importantly primal feeling matches.The show is very committed to reminding you of this theme. Whenever one of the other less combative club members tries to calm things down with the whole ""We\'re a team. Let\'s get along."" speech another character will immediately shut them down and the scene\'s tension will elevate further. No optimistic, shonen sports protag-kuns here.However, this dynamic makes it difficult for the viewer to truly root for any of the main leads. Characters like this in sports anime are usually the antagonist for a reason. Izumi Riko is the closest we get to a supportable character and later Aragaki Nagisa, but this might make it difficult for some viewers to stay invested in the overarching story.I also think that some plot threads weren\'t finished or resolved properly by the end of the season and I would be interested in a second season to capitalise on everyone\'s character development (which there is a lot of.)As a show, this might not be for everyone. As a sports anime though this is a must-watch. It\'s a really interesting change to the sports anime formula. It has a few issues here and there, but damn is it fun to watch in motion.8/10 Great to the team who put this show together.On the surface it presents the theme of its story as \'talent vs practice\' but by the end of episode 3, you\'ll start to realise that this a show exploring the psychology around bad sportsmanship and how it affects the plays both on and off the court.The first episode introduces team captain Aragaki Nagisa who, after being crushed at a tournament by an unknown player goes on a tirade against her Badminton club members, taking out her temper and frustrations on them on and off the court.We are later introduced to Hanesaki Ayano who seems shy and reserved on the service, but when she picks up the racket again it becomes evident that she\'s incredibly talented and naturally gifted with good eyesight which she uses to take out her unresolved parental abandonment issues on whoever is unlucky enough to face off against her.The other main players have their on over competitive quirks and this makes for tense, nail-bitingly and most importantly primal feeling matches.The show is very committed to reminding you of this theme.

What really made me not like this anime was how everyone was against Ayane when she started acting cold.  Shes the victim through all of this and yet even her own team and the anime painted her as some bad guy that needs to wake up. I understand they dont have enough episodes to tackle specific things but I dont like how the...character development and pacing with each character was portrayed. Especially with the mom, there is no reason she has to forgive her but also they don't give her any redeeming qualities or even show anyway that she has any remorse other than her grinning ear to ear talking in the most nonchalant way about how she feels bad. I began to dislike the characters around her when none of them were helping and even getting on her case when its clear and they're aware that badminton was a sport that really hurt her. character development and pacing with each character was portrayed.

I really enjoy how they animated the badminton scenes and I appreciate they didn't make it insanely slow paced with constant cut aways during the game. My main issue is they give the most cookie cutter reason for the mother leaving which was a major build up in the show. Why would she leave if she wanted to make her a better player? That makes no sense at all. The characters overall outside of 3 of them lack personality and uniqueness from each other but the show is only 13 episodes...so only so much you can do. Overall, this is a very okay sports anime. It's not bad but with the sports anime genre that has many other great shows in it its not gonna be remembered and will eventually be forgotten. so only so much you can do.

Spoiler alert, Hanebado falls into the latter category...I haven\'t read the source material, and have heard conflicting reports about how well it was, so I can only speak as to what I experienced while watching the anime. Hanebado has everything necessary to be a decent show, perhaps even above average if executed competently. Like so many great sports anime...before it, Hanebado attempts to place us in the front lines of the athlete world, and let us witness the physical and mental anguish first hand. I was disappointed by Hanebado, and that is not because I was comparing it to better works before it. I simply watched the show, and at nearly every turn was either appalled or outraged by the writing choices that had been made. Below I will attempt to explain the basis of these feelings, so please bare with me. I do not know if this fault lies with the original author or the anime studio adapting their work, but either way someone dropped the ball here.Overall the show had good animation, a decent but forgettable soundtrack, good voice acting, and never felt slow. For a sports anime, capturing the intensity of the game and making an audience care about it is crucial, and Hanebado did very well in this regard. I have never watched a game of badminton in my life, nor do I particularly care for it, yet I always found the matches engaging, if not a bit predictable. The main problem for me was the writing of the show. Hanebado essentially follows two high school badminton players as they struggle through their athletic careers.The first, Nagisa, has been embittered by a loss and thrown off her game, and must overcome physical and mental boundaries in order to rise above the player she had been when she lost, and also to maybe defeat the opponent who bested her. I have no complaints about Nagisa\'s arc, she demonstrated real growth, and more importantly, all her triumphs, defeats, and actions feel earned. She doesn\'t do 180 degree flips in personality, and her flaws seem true to her character.The second, Ayano, also has what is set up to be a profound and very moving arc. Daughter of a badminton prodigy, it is revealed that after her first major loss, her mother pretty much disowns her, abandoning her to move to a new country and adopt a new daughter to seemingly be her replacement because Ayano had failed. This sort of abusive mentor relationship is something that is present in many different walks of life, from students with gifted academics, natural talent in sports, or proficiency with instruments. It is an incredibly pernicious form of abuse, because to an outsider it appears as if the mentor is pushing their student to better themselves, when in reality the student is drawing closer and closer to self destruction in an attempt to please their abuser who will never truly be satisfied with their performance. I think the movie ""Whiplash"" demonstrates how monstrous such a ""mentor"" really is. Ayano\'s mother is certainly one of these people, and she admits as much herself in the final episodes. Where Hanebado truly fails is addressing how Ayano overcomes her toxic relationship with her mother, as well as with the other abusers that have decided to track her down no matter where she goes to try and remind her of her traumatic experiences.Ayano herself is a decently written character, and as the show progresses, her method of coping with everything that has happened in her life leads her to become a cruel and merciless person lacking any empathy or compassion for even those who had been her friends. It is very believable and regardless of how one personally feels about the morality of her actions, it was compelling to watch. With such a set up, there are really only two ways the story could have gone. They make the ending a tragedy, with Ayano never overcoming her past and continuing to tear through people on a self destructive attempt to try and win back her mother\'s favor. Or, they make the ending one of catharsis, one where the character has some sort of realization or experience with a massive emotional payoff that allows her to finally move on.What the show did instead was spend half of the run time trying to trick you into forgiving the abusers so that when she makes up with them suddenly in the end, you really believe that the power of friendship can overcome everything. Its one thing to portray antagonists as nuanced or complicated, because very rarely is someone ever just inherently bad. What Hanebado does, however, is sets up deplorable characters, people that have literally traveled around the entire world just to find Ayano and humiliate her, or track her down to whichever school she goes in order to remind her that she is a failure, that her being a failure caused her mother to leave, and that she should give up. Only for these characters to suddenly out of nowhere do complete 180 degree character flips. The girl Ayano\'s mother replaced her with who came from Denmark to beat her and prove she\'s the better daughter? Yeah no actually the whole time she just wanted to become real sisters with Ayano. The pink haired bitch that tied Ayano up and deliberately infected her with the flu prior to the game Ayano lost that caused her mother to abandon her? We should feel bad for her and forgive her because she was afraid of losing to Ayano. Ayano\'s mother, who only returns to her life once she is winning again and tells her that she abandoned her own daughter because it would make her play better? It\'s okay because Ayano forgives her.Hanebado\'s entire second half (aside from Nagisa\'s plot) are almost entirely just repeated attempts by the storytellers to force really contrived and unearned forgiveness for terrible and unlikeable people. Ayano is going to far in defeating them and its a cheap trick to try and make us swallow the sympathy pill they\'re forcing on us, but based on nearly all the reactions I\'ve seen people have, no one sheds so much as a tear when these people finally get what\'s coming to them. Except even then, they don\'t get what is coming to them. They get unearned forgiveness, and years of abuse get handwaved away. Watching the ending of this anime was like watching the Hindenburg go up in flames. Even from the half way point, I saw people discussing how whatever the show does, they better not dare try to have a ""we\'re all happy now everything is fine and forgiven"" ending. Well spoilers, they did. And it felt so jarring that it actually detracted from my overall enjoyment of the show.If you build up an person to be such a terrible character, and make it seem like the plot is going towards a direction where someone will call them out on their behavior or they face consequences, or even just have the protagonist rise above it, and then fail to deliver on that implied pay out, you have failed your audience. Had it not been for any of the painful scenes involving Ayano and one of her abusers, I might have been willing to rate the show a 5/10, maybe even a 6/10. But the offenses are as frequent as they are egregious, and for anyone who is bothered by toxic people and cant stand them to face no consequences for their actions, I suspect you too will find Hanebado unpleasent to watch. before it, Hanebado attempts to place us in the front lines of the athlete world, and let us witness the physical and mental anguish first hand.

Generally, badly written, the characters change personality btw the start, the middle and the end, their « arcs » are so inconsistent, resolved in one episode but then don’t have impact.The overarching theme of finding that she really likes the sport, and so her mum was right…is toxic as fuck and not for one second challenged, It’s way too over the top starting with people forcing her to play and then she does a...180 and becomes somebody else…Great sequences of animation using rotoscope, some good directing stuff, good music, and sometimes hyped moments. Good ending if I take it in a little bubble of its own; and same for the good match between Nagisa and Ishikawa 180 and becomes somebody else…Great sequences of animation using rotoscope, some good directing stuff, good music, and sometimes hyped moments. Good ending if I take it in a little bubble of its own; and same for the good match between Nagisa and Ishikawa', ""This review is spoiler-free!Finally, a sports anime I can watch fully! As a badminton player myself, I was really excited when this show was announced. I had high hopes for the matches because I could finally understand what was happening on court. But did this show live up to my expectations? Let's find out!Remember, people are allowed to like or dislike whatever they want. This review is mostly for myself to collect my thoughts.__STORY:The first half was messy and awfully paced, but the second felt more focused. Weirdly, the story focuses less on the supposed protagonist and more on her rival. I found that the...protagonist's character arc felt extremely rushed, so by the time I finished watching the entirety of the show, it didn't even feel like she was important to the story. Everything else I have to say about the story is more related to characters, so I'll save it for later. Most of the plot some pretty standard story of a mother/daughter relationship turned sour. I did think it was interesting in the second half, but I know it's nothing new.ART:The main setting of the school gym is unlit, making everything inside difficult to see. I thought about why this might be, and it's probably because it makes it easier to see the birdie when playing badminton (you'll see that in badminton matches, the area surrounding the court is often pitch black). As for characters, the art style is extremely inconsistent. Take for example Ayano. She's always been drawn as a cuter type of character, but during the final two episodes, she looks much older. Another girl who always has her eyes closed suddenly had them open in one scene. It's really bizarre. Colour scheme: Hanebado tends to use more realistic colours both for their settings and characters. There's nothing that stands out about it.SOUND (OP/ED):I personally skipped both the opening and ending pretty much every episode. Right now actually, I'm listening to the ending for the first time to give my comments on it. I don't mind it, it's nice but I don't think it's necessarily iconic. The opening's chorus is catchy, I can sing it in my head but the rest of the song is completely forgettable. There isn't much to say about either of them.CHARACTERS:This is going to be a long section. Like I said before, the protagonist Nagisa really doesn't FEEL like the protagonist. She finishes her character in a maximum of two episodes, and feels like an empty husk after since her only character trait doesn't exist anymore. Ayano, who I believe is the real protagonist, was a lot more interesting to watch. You can visually see how her past affects her and she is by far the most developed character in the show. Other than Ayano's mom and Connie, everyone else is absolutely irrelevant, barely developed, and could be removed from the series without changing the story. Speaking of Connie, she's my personal favourite character from this show. They still don't do a good job with her, she's a complete asshole when you meet her but later she's shown to be very pure and kind. There's no explanation given for her change in motivation later as well, which is weird considering her motivation is essentially the complete opposite of her previous one. She's still my favourite though, because she's the only character with development that is likable to me.THE BADMINTON:I decided to add this in because I can actually speak about the show's portrayal of the sport for once. At first, I couldn't say anything or really enjoy the matches. The cuts barely showed the court and matches ended too quickly for me to care. Later on, starting from Izumi's match, I found the matches to be decently done. I remember Izumi's match well because I related to her player style. The other match I remember is the final match between Nagisa and Ayano. I thought it was done really well, there was a lot of unspoken strategy that I could enjoy. The one thing I didn't like was the lack of tension from just simply needing to receive. Other than Ayano and Nagisa, the other members should not be able to receive every shot so easily at their level. Badminton isn't just about smashes and net shots, but that's all the show chooses to animate. None of the rallies back and forth are emphasized at all, but those are important in badminton. The whole sport is using the other player's receive against them, it's not playing hot potato with the birdie. Kind of disappointed that they didn't explore other ways of losing the point. Also, I watched the final match with my dad (who introduced me to the sport + trains with me). There was a move he noticed that was named, and he laughed because it's not a real strategy or move in badminton.ENJOYMENT:It's overall an okay anime. I don't think it's worth remembering, it seems like something that will end up on YouTube one day so people can binge an entire playlist of all the episodes. I think the show struggled to find it pacing until around episode 6, and from there it was a decent watch. The ending was done well, there are shows that are really popular that have a worse ending than Hanebado. I don't think I would recommend this anime to anyone other than my badminton teammates who might be interested in seeing an anime about our sport.__That's all! I feel like I went kind of hard on this show, I didn't find places to compliment it other than the ending of the final match. I'm curious what others think of this show, I found myself fluctuating between 4-5-6 ratings while watching, but I've finally settled it.Thank you for reading my review! protagonist's character arc felt extremely rushed, so by the time I finished watching the entirety of the show, it didn't even feel like she was important to the story.

The writers cut out large parts of the source material in order to get the bulk of story into one season. This, of course, left a hollow shell because of characters and entire arcs being removed. Small things like a character learning a new move or improving a skill got removed. For example a character was always able to play with two hands in the source. they even practiced doing so, but in the anime it comes out later from thin...airSo lets look at what was left over. This show starts with what will become our two main characters, Ayano and Nagisa, playing against each other in a tournament. The battle ending with both girls wondering why they even play the sport is what sets the pace for the rest of the show. We watch everyone we meet toss over the same question as the episodes tick on for different reasons. Given that everyone is only alloted a few minutes to have these arcs. I believe that the show does a good job in engaging you with them.While it may be a villain of the week story. You can still understand everyone, which is something that alot of shows fail to accomplish even with the right amount of episodes.Its not a bad show. it has good everything and im sure if it had more episodes would be held in great light. I recommend you try it then read the source. (It has ecchi angles if that helps) airSo lets look at what was left over.

(It has ecchi angles if that helps)', ""Hanebado! is the first of my attempts in the sports anime world and even though the story certainly won't wow audiences, there's so many little things that they did well that made me, at the very least, appreciate what this anime series is.  As someone who used to play badminton a lot, though not at a high level, I loved those finer details.Story & Characters: Hanebado! starts us out with us viewing Nagisa Aragaki, who is very clearly competing at a tournament, and lost 21-0.  This is obviously a hard blow to anyone who plays badminton competitively and sets us up real well...for what's to come.  Skip forward to her high school days where she is now captain and basically bullying students who don't appear to be putting in the same passion that she has.  Then, a surprise - Ayano Hanesaki, who humiliated Nagisa, is set to return to the world of badminton after a short hiatus.  What proceeds is us viewing how our characters go through their club training for tournaments, and hashing out various problems between themselves, and other rival schools.Each character has a different story to tell and basically the only similarity between them are that they want to work them out through badminton.  This has obvious cons to them in that the 'solution' always feels somewhat the same, but they are told ever so slightly that I didn't mind it here.  Nagisa is likely the most physically fit and most passionate about badminton than anyone in her school, and it very much gets to her head, even at the caution of her best friend Riko Izumi.  I really enjoyed the story elements surrounding these two because there's so much to like, and cheer for.  It allows Nagisa to open up, all while not throwing her central characteristics away.  She stands out because she's really tall her age and clear favours smashes over any other hit type.  Ayano, by polar opposite, is really not a character that I enjoyed watching.  Her mother walked out on her at a young age and while this is a decent attempt to build up a decent backstory, it completely flops when you consider Ayano's complete disrespect for her classmates and opponents when it comes to crunch time.  This stays mostly in check through the first half, but it makes the second half of the series difficult to watch.  Her standout is that she's a lefty and excels in defending more than anything else.Riko is clearly not as talented, but she's still a strong addition to this series.  She comes off as a voice of reason and attempts to be patient with her classmates.  Elena has been Ayano's friend since a young age, bit she feels too similar to Riko, outside of the fact that she doesn't play.  Her characteristics feel the same, and tries to not intervene until things start to boil down.  Individually, these two are strong, but being in the same series, they feel kind of redundant.  Various teammates have short character arcs and they were all individually nice to watch, but though don't stand out as much as our main two characters.  Kentaro Tachibana is brought in to help coach the badminton club early on and I really appreciated advice he has in this series.  He finds a way to get through to Nagisa, and is a decent character outside of the really odd first episode appearance he has.When you're watching a sport, you really do need to mix up the story formula because it's already predetermined that the sport itself will be one of the focusing points throughout the whole series.  When you watch your characters play through the story, you realize really early on that a lot of the story elements aren't terribly interesting.  Nagisa's plot points are strong because you see character development happening.  She has problems that she wants to resolve herself, but clearly needs a second hand to help her along.  I appreciated this.  However, Ayano's your other main character and I didn't enjoy any of her story.  It doesn't develop her character at all and you're not really left with a sense of relief.  Once more, while the setup for the finale was decent, I thought Ayano really brought down the mood.One of my favourite aspects of Hanebado! was all the little touches that make you feel like you're watching real badminton players play the sport.  From the familiar brands like Mizuno and Pocari Sweat, to the correct terminology used to describe hit types, everything feels so refined.  Similar to Sound! Euphonium, much of the focus is getting to the national stage, and even though that part of the story didn't have room within one series, those details makes me appreciate this series just a little bit more, despite the rough story and character development.  (Story: 6/10, Characters: 6/10)Art: Hanebado! is a beautiful anime series, no doubt.  It takes most every angle imaginable when watching our characters play the game.  It could feel a little fan servicey, though not in the traditional sense, and the extra effort put here makes this series really stand out.  I'm not sure if this is the norm is sports anime though.  Regardless, my eyes liked what they saw.  (9/10)Sound: The OST kind of meshed together and never really played a favour here.  You'd like it stick out a little more, but there wasn't much here.  The OP, Futari no Hane by Yurika, attempts to create a happy mood here, but this series really doesn't feel like it for most of the run time, leaving this to feel like an odd choice.  The ED, High Stepper by Yuuka Ohara, felt similar.  Voice work was really strong here with many well known VOs not really using their well-known voice tones, including Amber Lee Connors (Ayano), Jill Harris (Riko) and Sarah Wiedenheft (Elena).  Still, they worked well here.  One oddity that occurs here is the way in which the characters say badminton in the English dub.  I'm not sure if that's because they wanted the lip syncs to look better with the sound, but it sounds really awkward - a strange decision for sure.  (9/10)Overall: Hanebado! felt like a bit of a longshot for me because of my unfamiliarity with the genre, but I'm glad I watched it, despite it's shortcomings.  I haven't seen a series do some many little things well in quite some time, and if only the story and characters were more likable, this would have been an easy recommendation.

Koneko no Chi: Ponponra Daibouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33240/Koneko_no_Chi__Ponponra_Daibouken,"[""After the cartoon of Chi's Sweet Home and Chi's New Address, Chi now makes it to the 3D spectrum. It's been a long time watching this series, a full year since the first episode came out, and it has been a fun ride. If you have not seen or heard of Chi at all, I do recommend starting with the original cartoons before you make your way here. No matter, this review will be generally spoiler free, with only some mentioning of a couple of new characters.To be honest, the first time I heard Chi was going to be made into a 3D cartoon instead...of the 2D it was before, I was not a fan of it. I was not used to the new look and I wondered why they did not stick to the older version. But alas, nothing more could be done so I just took it for what it is. None the less, I enjoyed the series as each episode aired, which each one being 12 minutes instead of 3. 51 Episodes might seem like a lot, but if you were to put them together, it adds up to around 25 half hour episodes (approximately), which is about the average length of many anime shows.For the story part, Chi is generally a slice of life story and there is not much of an overall arc. However some stories are split into a couple of episodes. Overtime they do make continuity callbacks to previous episodes they do air, so it is best to try and watch it in order. This is technically supposed to be a sequel of sorts to Chi's New Address, however I think the continuity between the two shows is a bit muddled (unless I'm remembering wrong). Regardless, each individual episode is charming in its own way and each provides some fun. Granted at the very end of the series I was filled with questions regarding certain characters (like Chi's original family), and hoped to see more in season 2.Characters in Chi are all great and wonderful. Here we see the return of old characters like Chi, her family, and even Blackie; but we also get lots of new characters too like Come-Come (or Kocchi as its pronounced in the show) and a couple of tabby kittens that look very similar to Chi, hmm...The characters are all likable in their own ways. Even when Chi is up to mischief she appears as cute as always (although I might be biased to this cause I love cats in general).The art and animation are vastly different from the original cartoons that came before. Its in 3D for obvious terms which is going to throw people off. When I was first watching Chi I found the 3D aspects to be strange, however overtime I grew used to the 3D look of the show and eventually became pretty ok with it. Honestly compared to some other 3D cartoons/anime I've seen in the past, this one looks pretty fine. The colours all look nice and appealing, and everyone's models and characters do not seem to have any problems (from what I noticed). I will say that with the 3D characters can't be as expressive as the 2D, due to the limitations, but at least they do put an effort to try and mimic the expressions, give them props for that.The music and sound were pretty good. There isn't really much I can say for this honestly. The background music was alright, I didn't take much notice for it as the episodes past. It did its job of helping to convey mood and emotion well. The sound effects too did their part, helping to convey and time out the more cartoony and silly moments. I will comment on its opening theme, which I think its a really great and catchy song.While I would like to go full on bias and give it a 10/10 for cats, I need to be honest and give a more fairer score. This anime overall gets a 7/10 for me. Its cute and charming to watch. The characters are all great and likable, you pretty much want to root for everyone. The animation I know will throw off some people, but once you get past it, it is honestly not that bad. If you're someone who enjoys the Chi series and have not gotten around to this yet, then I do recommend it, you will not be disappointed.

This review will be 98% spoiler free.Story: The story is hardly ever confusing and is always interesting and enjoyable. It is mainly short and simple, with humor and sometimes even sadness.Characters: The characters are likeble and have quite a bit of personality without being too complicated. We get to see a few flashbacks. (Not too many). Some characters do not have all that much development, but that is usually only minor characters.Art: The art/animation is pretty good. CG is not welcomed, but Chi's Sweet Adventure is a good...example of decent CG. The animation is not at all choppy. The human character's beady eyes sometimes look odd.Voice acting (Sub): I think the voice acting in the sub is amazing. There is emotion in every phrase said.Voice acting (Dub): The voice acting is just a little less good than the sub. Still pretty decent emotion, but the actors sometimes sound like they are reading a book to a little kid.Sorry if my review was a little long. If you have Amazon Prime, I would highly suggest this anime if you are looking for a cute slice of life anime. example of decent CG. The animation is not at all choppy.

When I started watching Koneko no Chi, I noticed that the animation was totally different, I deduced that the essence of the episodes would be too. But I was mistaken! Chii is still Chii. Fun episodes, totally innocent but at the same time mixed with strong emotions that make you cry.[SPOILER]I really ""fell apart"" in the last episode, when Chii didn\'t want to go home, so Kocchi asked, ""Why don\'t you go home even though you have one?"" And she said, ""Today was empty ... I was home, but I wasn\'t home."" Only those who...have family problems will understand the emptiness that Chii was feeling. At the same time, Kocchi was sad for his brother, who was taken for being a ""cuter"" kitten than he was. These are things that really make you reflect.There was also the episode where Yohan realized that cats have a world of their own, and he would not have a place in that world. These deep thoughts also arose in the original Chii season, which is why I say and repeat: Koneko no Chii still has the same essence![CAN READ NOW!]The soundtrack is so much fun and the art is unexpectedly amazing! It also thrilled me that Kocchi became one of the main characters. I love him since he showed up at OVA, so it was a very nice surprise. Also, it was amazing that the Chii brothers showed up.I also noticed that they made Chii a little more fanciful than the original season. But it is not a defect; quite the contrary, it was great! Maybe the only thing I didn\'t get used to was that the episodes got a little longer.Anyway, although I love this new season, the original will always have a special place in my heart because she was part of my childhood and filled my past children with many tears and smiles.Highly recommended! have family problems will understand the emptiness that Chii was feeling.

Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38301/Kouya_no_Kotobuki_Hikoutai,"['The standout of the anime with its 2D and 3DCGI mix aside, it is still a satisfying show to watch in its entirety.Yet again, we have another CGDCT (""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things"") anime, this time in the reigns of the old 20th Century times when most people are air/sky pirates and doing their own stuff. Everything that we all wanted that encapsulates about being an air pirate, from airship bases to dogfights, it\'s all here. What more could you ask for this being a sci-fi action-adventure flick of inspirations from real like and even video game adaptations polishing the looks of this anime? Simply...an underrated gem and it\'s good.Going into The Magnificent Kotobuki, this show tells the stories and adventures of the main Kotobuki squadron of girls (Kylie, Reona, Zara, Kate, Chika and Emma) who are bodyguards for hire, for mercenaries that require some extensive help in all forms and sizes. Along with their airship Hagoromo housing their useless captain (Saneatsu) and one hell of a commanding lady (Madame Loulou), they\'re ready to set off into the uncertain skies.The first thing I\'ll require you to turn your senses off to, is the storytelling: it\'s a very non-linear approach, and that storytelling is based off the endless amount of adventures of the Kotobuki girls in their slick Hayabusa planes that are airworthy of all dogfights in the skies. For one, we get a lot of emphasis on the main girls: Kylie, a pancake-loving girl, once mastering with her mentor Ol\' Sab on flying, and she is an excellent pilot with skills keen to the most dedicated. Emma the short, chibi-esque girl, aside from being Kylie\'s childhood friend, she seems to be the one who holds grudges, but alongside her, another great pilot on the observational side. Reona, the leader/captain of the Kotobuki squadron, the pilot with the most ""girl power"" with a lot of experiences clocked under her belt. Aside from being the most sensible pilot, she is one that gets to the bottom of the truth and executes her mission without fail. YOU GO GIRLS, girl power!And, that\'s basically it for the characters. Oh sorry I almost forgot, the antagonist Isao, once an ace pilot who saved Reona\'s life. However, in his pragmatic business, whoever views his clown-tricking abilities are those that might look like an insensible joke from a typical person at first, but when he gets serious, he knows how to manipulate people. What an ass.The VERY startling point is the art and animation. From the same studio who did the disgusting demeanor that is the Berserk sequel (of sorts), GEMBA (with collaborations from WAO World) took an approach that is very unheard of: Mashing both 2D and 3D, and adding in lots of CGI into the mix. What resulted was a very jarring experience to even watch an episode through and not suffer hallucinations. Thank God this isn\'t another Hand Shakers though.In my opinion, it was a risk trying to incorporate both 2D support animation (from WAO World) and 3D (main cast of) characters (from GEMBA), but when used and utilized right, it could be something else. One thing I\'ve really liked though is the dogfights, in particular the endless amount of planes\' camera motions pertaining to the pilots that the animators wanted to emphasize. It\'s kinda like the modern A380 with its tail camera perching for passengers to be wowed. Not the greatest of greats, but not bad too.OST is also decent. In fact, I had a lot of vibes from Crimson Skies (the video game) as the dogfights\' music plays throughout the series, it is damn reminiscent of it and largely captures my attention for the good and great amount of dogfights this series has to keep the action pumping between the frenemies. ZAQ\'s OP is great, an atmospheric throwback to old 1930s style with its aesthetics and music, and the decent ED by the Kotobuki squad to end their missions on a good note.But then again, my recommendation of this show can only be purged on the minority of fans who like or love the old times of sci-fi sky pirates with its full-on action-adventure modes. Wonky animation aside, this isn\'t a bad show, it\'s just that while there\'s nothing really going for it, at the back of your minds, it will be like: ""Just stick till the end of the episode."" And that is where the show\'s magic happens and take hold of you, to go in deep and further.To me, it is enjoyable, but how about you?

Its genre is  Action, Military, Adventure and it did played well even...thought it was set in some wasteland and them girls were part of a mercenary group under the Ouni Company, whom were the very epitome of girls who can kickass. Given of this anime\'s genre , there isn;t really a story in fact the plot was simply random from episode to episode. In most case the story plot will tell you about the anime as a whole, this is an exception , cu\'z behind the seemly random plot was a good action and adventure, where we\'re literally being kept in the seat of our pants, cu\'z of all those dog fights and adventure that them girls does in every episode. In fact there isn\'t an episode where dog fight is involve when the ones doing it are girls that should be taken seriously, so kudos to studio WAO World, GEMBA and to this anime\'s director Mizushima, Tsutomu , they really did a good job, cu\'z in some original anime there were those not good and there were those that rely on certain cliches that make it boring... so without any further adieu:Story- fair 6: The story relies on a daily plot that were simply random.Art- Very Good 8: The graphic and 3D images where awesome. Btw there is a one time Zara fanservice and that is all you\'re gonna get.Sound- Good 7: I have  nothing to say about the characters voice , btw the score is for the sound effect of the machine guns that we hear around here.Character- Good 7: Well girl power is all over the place in this anime, and as we see with the Kotobuki Corp, Chicka, Reona, Kyrie, Zara, and Kate each represent a certain bad ass that what a man has that them girls can also have as well.Enjoyment- Very Good 8: Forget the story just enjoy the dog fight, cu\'z is what this anime is about.Overall- Very Good 8: It is as what my rating says, so should this have a manga version????? Well, it\'s a good anime, but making it a manga, no way Jose, it\'s best to leave it as an anime. thought it was set in some wasteland and them girls were part of a mercenary group under the Ouni Company, whom were the very epitome of girls who can kickass.

The Kotobuki corps sure knows exactly how that kind of life is like. The art of aviation became an essential part of their life. But in such an imperfect world, they can’t be without conflicts.For a story about aviation, I was fully prepared to be cast into a world where aircrafts is much more than just what they are. The first few episodes immediately dives into a world where we witness the technology and importance of aviation. Technology related to aeronautical practices is a common sight. This came to me as no...surprise considering the anime advertised itself with many of its promotional material in such ways. What did catch me off guard and I regret to say is that the show could have been so much more.Anime that takes on aviation as a major theme is also becoming a more popular trend in recent years. It hasn’t taken off quite yet like isekai but from this Winter season alone, we had at least two titles: Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai and Girly Air Force. However, let’s not jump ahead of ourselves. Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai has confidence to be its own show. As an original anime, it doesn’t have to rely on manga material to be faithful or as a continuation from some prequel series. Anime like this isn’t afraid to take risks although it didn’t capitalize on its concepts. Let me just say that the first episodes themselves accomplished little more than becoming a flight simulator. Indeed, I can’t say this enough but when you have a full squad of badass girls as pilots, you know this is going to take off as a sky fueled action show. It doesn’t take long to realize how skilled the main characters are when the first episode shows their abilities to take down hordes of enemy aircrafts. War veteran Zara is the most prominent to notice for her battle experience. However, don’t count out the rest of her squad. Characters like Chika, Kate, Kylie, and Emma are not to be underestimated when they are in their cockpits. Even a little girl like Chika can be described as “dynamite come in little packages”. Throughout the series, they participate in many dogfights that first came as exciting but soon became very predictable. Let’s face it, this anime sells the Kotobuki squad as the aces in the sky. Their feats are easily noticeable for their complex aerial maneuvers. Some episodes even consists of its squad members chasing down their foes in what seems like near impossible scenarios. But if you guessed it, they make it look easy. Now I don’t want to designate the characters as “overpowered” as they certainly do find themselves struggling on occasions. Still, it’s not very fun when the whole show make others look bad after each episode. I’m not going to lie, after watching a good portion of this series convinced me that the Kotobuki squadron is like an end boss video game; only that the they are badass girls.Overlooking the characters, I think perhaps the show holds some value when it comes to its mysterious world and technology. In fact, the aircrafts themselves makes me wonder how much potential it really has. A weapon is only powerful as its user is what I would think. While the aircrafts aren’t very high standard, they are capable of making dogfights look realistic. The pilots ride the sky and gives a feel of being right there with them in their cockpit. When an aircraft is shot and melts down, it gives the impression of life or death. Being able to depict a war-like feeling almost every episode actually makes the show exciting at times. The downside is that the whole idea can get repetitive fast. Trust me, once you’ve seen one dogfight, it feels like you’ve seen them all.One of the more interesing aspects of the show is its economic system. This includes how mercenaries are hired such as the Kotobuki squad. Furthermore, there’s monopoly that can’t be overlooked in such an unstable world. I think for what’s worth, the anime manages to makes its world a breeding ground for conflicts. The Kotobuki squad not only have to deal with enemies in the sky but also corruption among corporations. It adds fuel to the already desolate world that makes surviving all the more difficult. Luckily for the Kotobuki members, they don’t have much trouble living their lives but you can just imagine for some of the poorer folks. The World War like atmosphere often puts less fortunate people in jeopardy when they don’t have the resources to fend for themselves. It’s a sad and grim reality.Making an anime featuring aviation isn’t easy nor is animating aerial dogfights on a consistent basis. The strange combination of 2D and 3D art style can take a bit of time to get used to. In fact, the character models looks like something from a video game in its alpha stage. It reminds me a bit of Apreggio of Blue Steel at times only without the high level technology. When in its 2D form, character designs are pretty normal on most terms although fan service is evident on occasions. Madame Lulu, Zara, and Naomi are a few examples as the show try to make them busty. But on most occasions, the show sells its animation in the sky where the real action takes place. The dynamic quality of the framework and fluid movements (when ignoring the 3D models) makes the action look convincing. It’s just that when you see it so many times, it loses its relevance.Honestly, this show feels like a flight simulator. The story isn’t very well written despite the immense amount of potential. Characters lack development as the show focuses way too much into the action. It almost feels like playing a video game at times like Battlefield or something when every episode just bites into the action and consumes it without stopping. My impression of the whole show didn’t change at all from the first episode to the end. There’s just so much potential in this anime that eventually became a showcase of mediocrity. surprise considering the anime advertised itself with many of its promotional material in such ways.

The artwork is quite good and the animation of the flying/dogfight scenes is really well done and exciting. You can tell the animators have done their homework on how these WW2 planes flew and handled. There are some great sequences of these Hayabusa both in and out of the cockpit...great stuff if you love planes from this era. Really top notch flight sequences! The character designs are also very good and each one has their own look and personality.  Perhaps the roles are a bit the usual slice of life team but it...still works for me.  The story gets slightly lower points just because we are thrown into the middle of a future world without any real explanations about the wherefores and whys of that world or why our main characters are doing the job they are doing. Some details are coming out slowly, but plot is not really the focus. It's more about our characters facing challenges and accomplishing the mission at hand. Hopefully, the series will continue long enough for the larger story to be developed (because there is definitely something larger going on that has not yet been revealed). But for now I am just enjoying getting to know these ladies in their flying machines and going along on the adventure! still works for me.

But for now I am just enjoying getting to know these ladies in their flying machines and going along on the adventure!"", "",,Hey let’s put bunch of girls into japanese WWII plane’s cockpits and make them fight some air pirates!“This is how you can describe the plot in one sentence. But saying just this won’t be really fair, so let’s take a closer look.If you‘re familiar with an old videogame called Crimson Skies, and you like it, then there’s a huge chance, that you will like this as well. Airships used instead of carriers? Air pirates? Dogfights? Yes everything is here, just like in CS. But unlike in CS, this show is not from pirate’s point of view, but from the other side instead. You will follow...a small female mercenary squadron called ,,Kotobuki Squadron“ on their adventures. So much for the plot, most of the screen time is reserved for dogfights anyways. Now let’s move to technical aspects, shall we?Art and VisualsThis is something questionable. We have impressive  CGI plane models and animations, with the same attention to details,that we can find in GuP (no doubt since both shows have the same director). However, and this is probably the biggest problem of the show, unlike GuP, which uses traditional animation for characters, Kotobuki uses CGI not just for the machines, but also for people. Especially for the main characters. And that’s the problem. With this amount of CGI characters used, the show feels more like a cutscene from Bandai Namco game, than anime. They should’ve sticked to use CGI only for vehicles, where it works really great, for example that unforgettable engine starting sequence in the first episode, that was just pleasure to watch.To make it simple, the vehicle visuals and animations are stunning, but the decision to use CGI for characters makes the overall visuals kinda odd.Sounds and MusicOP is great, it resembles the atmosphere of sandy wasteland in alternative 1930s-1940s (which is most likely, when and where the show takes place, judging by the usage of WWII airplanes).In terms of sounds, I like them, especially gunshots and engine sounds.CharactersThere’s not much to say, we have almost no backstory nor character development (but we sometimes get some hints about character's past, andwe also know, that there is a one girl who loves pancakes). The Kotobuki Squadron consists of 6 girls, however the only remarkable one so far is Kirie (the one who loves pancakes). But this show is mostly about planes and dogfights, so let’s overlook the lack of character development.OverallIf you are a fan of doghfights and WWII airplanes, then go for it. If not, well then try it, if you can bare with CGI characters and small/no character development you will be rewarded by amazing air battle scenes. As a someone who has dozens of hours on games like IL-2 Sturmovik or Crimson Skies, and likes WWII stuff in general, I can only say it deserves 9/10, because of the way they presented the dogfights and airplanes, which are the main aspect of the show after all. a small female mercenary squadron called ,,Kotobuki Squadron“ on their adventures.

But this show is mostly about planes and dogfights, so let’s overlook the lack of character development.OverallIf you are a fan of doghfights and WWII airplanes, then go for it. If not, well then try it, if you can bare with CGI characters and small/no character development you will be rewarded by amazing air battle scenes. As a someone who has dozens of hours on games like IL-2 Sturmovik or Crimson Skies, and likes WWII stuff in general, I can only say it deserves 9/10, because of the way they presented the dogfights and airplanes, which are the main aspect of the show after all."", 'When Shirobako had an in-universe anime called ""Third Aerial Girls Squad"" that ended up having a surprisingly decent one-shot OVA, I became hungry for a plane-based anime. Something with adventure, suspense and great world building. I got my wish many years later with Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai.Kotobuki is fast. Before you know it, the episode you\'re watching is already over. The pacing in each episode is ratcheted up to HELL SPEED and each episode just goes through tons of character development, world building and in-universe politics in the span of 10 minutes, before cutting to another 10 minutes of beautifully choreographed dogfights. While this...means the show never gets boring, it does have the issue of delivering plot critical information at an incredible pace, so much so it\'s sometimes easy to miss out on what\'s going on with the plot. There is almost never a moment of peace or quiet. It\'s shot after shot of characters interacting with each other, dogfights, or some combination of the two. And I wouldn\'t have it any other way. The brisk pace does give some charm and identity to Kotobuki that makes it stand out among other anime this season.While the world-building is excellent (in which every event that happens has its purpose and origins) , character building does seem more lacking in comparison. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s fun to see pancake-psycho go through her bouts of insanity, and resident goblin Chika is fun to watch too, but aside from Kylie, none of the other characters go through much character development and stay one-note until the end of the show. Kotobuki is definitely the kind of show that would really benefit from a two-cour structure, a second season, or hell even 1-hour long episodes. The writing is decent enough, so I wanted to see more character spotlight episodes to see each girl shine in their own way. At best maybe each girl gets 3 minutes of spotlight in their ""spotlight episodes"", but it\'s never enough. So much potential is just untapped behind it all.And here is where I have to address the elephant in the room I guess. The 3DCG character models clashing with the 2D characters. For the most part, in action scenes and dogfights, the 3D is beautiful and fluid. With excellent cinematic setpieces that would really give you goosebumps. But what\'s less impressive are the 3D renditions of major characters that really stand out when they\'re interacting with the 2D characters in the story. I\'ve come to ignore it after a few episodes, but it\'s just so jarring to see it happen. Even more baffling is that on occasion they would switch out the 3D models with proper 2D models of the mains which look so much more fluid when animated (the beginning of the 2nd episode is a good example of this contrast). I get they\'re trying to make it more seemless since these characters are always on planes and therefore need to blend in better with the 3D dogfights, but I\'d seriously would have preferred if they used 2D character models for the more peaceful on-the-ground scenes and then switch to 3D models when the characters are in flight.Still, in spite of this very jarring flaw, Kotobuki is a fun romp throughout. Fun characters, thrilling events, and brilliant cinematography all lend to an excellent adventure in the skies. All that remains is, when\'s Season 2 coming out?8/10And where\'s that Project ACES spin-off game? means the show never gets boring, it does have the issue of delivering plot critical information at an incredible pace, so much so it\'s sometimes easy to miss out on what\'s going on with the plot.

As a side effect to both the show don\'t tell as well as less exposition overall, the anime does seem a bit aimless at first let alone the sense of a lull as the episodes goes along as we continue to see the Kotobuki Co. helping with missions, be it if they wanted to or not.As for the characters, well due to the majority of the main character focus mostly going to Kirie voiced by Sayumi Suzuhiro, Reona voiced by Asami Seto, Zara voiced by Hibiku Yamamura and Kate voiced by Sayaka Nakaya, the rest of the characters slightly get afflicted with being satellite characters, for the characters that do get heavy development, we see all sorts of strife coming from their character developments with Kirie getting the most out of it end the end when all the episodes threads converge. Kirie gets backstory as to why she wanted to fly planes has a stake in the bigger narrative and grows as a character of not being so cocky and her naivete getting the best of her, Reona gets a more personal development as well as her judgment as leader of the Corps even when her boss and client does what Reona doesn\'t want to do. Kate gets development thanks to her brother as her brother is integral to the bigger plot at hand and Kate obviously cares for him due to him being wheelchair bound from an incident. LA\'s favorite character is actually Kate as her calm, stoic demeanor, cracking deadpan jokes and having a stake in the plot helps as well. Lastly Zara get an episode to herself where it\'s pretty much ""don\'t judge by appearance"" situation and she\'s a badass on land AND air. The only two main cast members that gets shafted in terms of development are Emma and Chika, both have butt monkey status to them but Emma especially while Chika is the genki but also gets into trouble for running her mouth as well type.The minor cast have great amount of screentime, showing that the plot cares about the main cast as much as the minor cast moves the plot forward and there are some mysteries within some of the minor characters, like a mysterious plane that bugs Kirie, a councilor always seeking the Kotobuki\'s help, a nerve-wrecked and indecisive mayor and a trickster magician going into politics who\'s also renowned as a fighter pilot.LA is going into spoilers, but with the world building given to this anime and the revelations of the ""hole"" sucking up the OCEAN thus the barren wasteland that Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai resides in and later on when we find out that the Yufang are actually Japanese, if the hints are lining up to something and this is just LA\'s speculation so hear LA out, so what with the entire oceans sucked up and planes being sent into Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai world....are Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai and Girls und Panzer linked in a ways?, LA says this as Girls und Panzer\'s world is FILLED with oceans and the means of transportation of their main cast are carriers, so like alternative world theory?, heck we can add in the fact that Tsutomu Mizushima was both the director for this anime AND Girls und Panzer so he might be making a foundation for something bigger later?. LA is throwing speculations out there so take it with a grain of salt.With that being said, the animation done by WAO World and GEMBA did actually a great job integrating the 3D CGI to fit in with the CGI planes, as well the character designs are entirely 3DCGI besides some traditional animation here and there. This works as the planes are completely CGI and the stunts the planes goes through as well as the dogfighting that ensues in this anime, this anime really feels like Arpeggio of Blue Steel but with planes!, heck the dogfighting in Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai  was much more engaging, intense and impressive than Girly Air Force from the same season and that is saying something. One of the few rare 3D CGI animes where the 3DCGI use was utilized and executed extremely well to be perfectly honest.Voice acting wise, the voice cast had ALOT of chemistry with one another, especially Sayumi Suzuhiro and Miyu Tomita as Kirie and Chika respectively. Asami Seto was typecasted but still did a great job and both Sayaka Nakaya and Hibiku Yamamura did great as well. There are LOTS of minor characters but LA is speculating and by chance did Nao Touyama voice the waitress in the bar?...just LA?. Nonetheless decent cast with some great chemistry, great considering the anime has lots of talking making the camaraderie between the girls that much better from their banters.Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai may seem like a ""3DCGI anime with planes"" but it is soo much more than that once the bigger plot arises and it full blown turns into a air warfare for superiority over a tyrannical and somewhat crazy leader out for something of the unknown.......witty writing and direction and subtle character development from the half the cast at that and brilliant world building as well.

From what I read on the description and saw on the cover, I thought this could be one of my favorites. But the anime was nothing like that description.The biggest flaw is that I watch aviation anime for one reason.... the pilots. I think pilots are one of the coolest types of characters there are for an anime. Gundam and mecha pilots are super awesome, but I LOVE seeing actual plane pilots do their thing especially because of the pilot x plane relationship and watching them both work together...to overcome obstacles... its AMAZING. I also love their passion for planes and flying... I love that kind of stuff.Kotobuki does not have this whatsoever. Thats the biggest flaw...The second biggest flaw is that there are 6 main characters, all pilots.... and only one, Reona, really acts like a pilot. Zara had some great moments as well and both of them deserved WAY more screentime. And dont get me wrong, the other characters are fine. They just arent pilots, especially Chika and Kylie. If you watch pilots you know what I mean. If they just had other roles on the airship and let Reona and Zara be the only two pilots, that woulda improved the story 20x. This anime wasnt specifically CGDCT but it definitely had some of the themes, but the serious style of art and story was the main focus.The third flaw was the inconsistant anination. The guys look and move normal, but the girls look like 3d vtube models for some reason and the contrast of these characters really stands out on screen. Normally this isnt something that bugs me a lot, but it definitely didnt help an already failing anime.As for the pros, the plane scenes are AMAZING. Its obvious the studio had a lot of knowledge on WWII planes and it clearly shows in the battles. Sometimes they even show pilot pov which is SUPER cool. If they had studied pilots as much as the planes, this anime coulda been AWESOME!!!! The planes and the fight scenes are definitely the strong point of the anime. Additionally, the anime got a LOT better in the second half (which is good because the first half made me drop it, but then I picked it back up). It still has all the flaws I mentioned earlier, but the story plot got a lot more decisive instead of just random air pirate battles each episode/episodic format, and the battles got better, and the stakes got higher. The last battle was fantastic as well. I think if someone is a WWII plane enthusiast they would probably love this anime, whereas I am more of a pilot enthusiast.But even with all that, it went up from 5.2/10 to 6.2/10.Quick BreakdownStory: 7/10, it gets better in the second halfCharacters: 4/10, Reona and Zara were great, Emma and Kate were ok, Kylie and Chika were fine but should not have been pilot charactersSound: 8/10, it was pretty niceVisuals: 6/10, a little inconsistant and not very pretty but epic animation on the planes is awesome to overcome obstacles... its AMAZING.

Take note,this anime might had a fanservice in one episode but still the director commits to put more action than the latter which what makes the show great than it\'s rival Girly Air Force (which it\'s director put more SoL and fanservice and gave less action scenes in which some of them were weak and lackluster until the last episode of that series).3.SoundThe OP is catchy one to say the least it had a few whistling tones while the ED is also a catchy but a good use to the show4.CharactersWe had the Good and the Bad ones. first, we\'ll start with the main character who\'s addicted to pancakes (yup she like pancakes more than any food) second we had a girl who\'s a badass (more like a Rosie the Riverter who can do it all?),a childhood friend,a girl who often shouts when in combat,a girl with a spoken tone and a girl who\'s more sexy than Eagle of Girly Air Force period and also the most hated character that i hated for was a Traitorous,Dictatorial manipulating magician who wants to take all over the world for himself but too bad he fell down to his doom and i\'m happy for that :P5.EnjoymentMy enjoyment for this show? well it\'s good and the portal thingy might set a few off but still a good show to watch even if ur a fan of old WWII-era aircraft6.OverallKouya no Kotobuki might be a hit or miss for anybody but if u like old aircraft u can watch this.If not then i won\'t argue with you for that.P.S,my final verdict for this show i gave it a rating of 8 and i hope a few would appreciate it :) Why i posted these quotes? well Kouya no Kotobuki is about aviation but with enough action to boot and anyway this my review for it:1.Story:The story is about air pirates who flies to the skies and fight any baddies at any given moment not much to say here :|2.Art:Some like it,Some were not but for the mixture of 2D and 3D animation might be bad at first glance but if it\'s put into good use it will be in good direction even in the scenes of air combat and the aircraft models.And btw this anime was directed by the same dude who directed Girls & Panzer and Shirobako (i\'m taking about Tsutomu Mizushima here).

It has a very unique pacing and cadence to it, and the animation takes some getting used to, but once you\'re locked in it makes entire sense.The entire main cast is pretty stunning.  Each of the KOTOBUKI members are very distinct and, while sometimes displaying common behavior tropes, always seem to own those tropes in ways unique to their rendition.  For instance Kate is a traditional quiet and smart type, but it just feels very genuine with her, and her interpersonal relationships seem to flesh out why...she\'s like that without being made plainly obvious.  Some of the minor characters are less fleshed and could probably have used less screen time, but the main cast was superb.The biggest strength of this anime is the dogfighting scenes.  The effort that went into beautifully choreographing these scenes is astounding.  This is one of the only anime whose sound I\'ve rated a 10, because the effects during these scenes are phenomenal.  I found myself unable to so much as look down at snacks for fear I\'d miss an awesome maneuver.  Especially if you\'re like me and are somewhat of a military aviation fan, you\'re really given treats in the reverence the writers show the planes and their abilities.  It\'s this reason that led me to nickname the anime ""Girls und Planezer"".The dialogue cadence is really, really tough to get used to.  The pacing is just much faster than most anime, which has a lot of established rhythm to it.  You really have to pay attention to catch everything being said, and sometimes it can get a bit confusing.  I think this was both a strength and a weakness of the show, because it was hard to deal with and I\'m sure put some people off, but it allowed them to cram so much information about their deeply-built world into their 12 episodes.  It\'s something I\'d like to see tried more often.If I had to point out weak parts, I\'d say that the secondary characters are often annoying and too present in the plot, and that there were too many fanservice characters.  While I like the idea of having one or maybe two characters who choose to dress provocatively or who have a sexualized aesthetic, the cast was pretty well-populated with fanservice-heavy side characters.  The stick-angle shots weren\'t really my cup of tea.  But all in all, I really liked the cast.I\'d recommend this anime for anyone who likes dogfights, who likes cute girls doing military things, and is cool with the military-without-fatalities style of plot which was previously characterized in Girls und Panzer. she\'s like that without being made plainly obvious.

So in a way, I watched this because I did not like that, and trying if this would end up to my liking. I liked the dogfighting scenes due to it reminding me of games like Ace Combat. That\'s what really got me, it has even some cliff missions, but I won\'t spoil any more than that.Now for each part:Story - I initially liked how each episode is like a mission but as it drove on, I found it lacking in some aspects like explaining why things existed...as they are. They left me questioning even after finishing the anime. And I wanted to know more, but sadly it ended so briefly. A sample question you might have is, ""Where\'s my water?"" (No, I don\'t mean the tablet game with the bathing croc.)

But it might be for YOU, so don\'t be repelled by the low overall ratings.What this show does really, *really* well is the prop-plane dogfighting.  There are some truly breathtaking moments in choreography and sound design (episodes 6 and 12 have some fabulous extended POV shots) which are really quite suspenseful.  And every episode brings at least one protracted fight, which usually has at least a couple fun maneuvers or a gimmick.  It\'s not exactly ""realistic"", while some of the flying comes straight out of period dog-fighting manuals there are many occasions where planes fly...far beyond their capbility, and fuel and ammo are rarely a concern. But it totally sells you on the drama of the encounters and the appeal of flying, like all good action should.I\'ll also give a note to the worldbuilding and plot, which has more going on than you would initially assume and is interesting in it\'s own right, even if it ultimately doesn\'t amount to much.If you want to see some cool but semi-realistic plane flying action and you\'ve exhausted the short list of big anime for that like The Princess and the Pilot, The Sky Crawlers, and what have you, this is the show for you, as it was for me.  Every episode is at least 25% flying and fighting, most of it interesting, and there aren\'t really any glaring issues with the rest of the show that drag it down, unless you just have a CGI allergy.If you\'re just looking for some ""cute girls doing some kind of action"" show to put on and you don\'t think you\'ll get invested in the plane flying this is probably not for you.  The character art is mediocre at best, and the characters are acceptable but nothing you haven\'t seen before with constant quippy dialogue and upbeat manner. The show itself is generally upbeat, and very few characters die, which has a charm but does detract from the drama in the late stage.Addendum: They do(thankfully) stop mixing 2d and 3d characters in such an ugly manner for the most part after the opening episodes, and I would like to put the notion to rest that doing so ""makes no sense"" as some people believe.""CG"" does not necessarily equal ""cheap"" in the way that people seem to assume in the anime community.  While CG animation can be much easier in the long run as models can be easily puppetted around, making models for characters takes a lot of time, and in plenty of cases with characters(or costumes) that appear only briefly or don\'t move around very much it would be much faster or cheaper to draw a handful of 2d frames than give them a whole model, especially in Japan where mediocre 2d animators are readily available for small jobs. So when this show occasionally does 2d animation, it\'s either a sign of them trying to cut costs on characters or costumes that appear on briefly or haven\'t been modeled yet early in the production.

In terms of story and character development there\'s not much given well into episode 8. All you get is that there are air pirates, population centers are few, the girls are mercenaries and although not explicitly said there seems to be no surface water anywhere in the area surrounding the show. But the moment they get into the cockpit the show really takes off...(pun intended), the way the aerial battles are carried out, the movement of the planes, the sound of the wind hitting the rudders and antenna, it\'s enough to give you goosebumps.

If you love plane aesthetics, the artwork will appeal to you even more.(2.) In terms of the genre of the show and what it delivers, Kotobuki is difficult to pin down. The best way I can describe it is ""cute mercenary girls doing aerial battle...things in a Mad Max world"", with a bit of ""slice of life"" mixed in. It is an action show, with swarms of planes getting into massive midair battles about every episode. A good dose of comedy is also mixed into the show, which makes it feel less boring during the non-battle scenes.

Depending on who you are, this ovary ensemble is either exactly what you want in a show or is going to make you bored of it fast. That being said, each of the 6 Kotobuki Corps girls has a unique personality and something to like about them. Kirie is the main girl we follow throughout the series and this was done deliberately, as her cockiness, snarky humor, and almost comedic facial expressions make her an easy favorite.The other women in the series aren\'t nearly as focused on but still manage to make the show feel ""real"" with how much their different personalities can clash or feed off each other. Oh, did I also mention that all of these girls work as mercenaries or at least smugglers? The only thing more excessive than the way these women make money is some of their bust sizes. Overall, the characters are probably the strongest part of this show. While Kirie is given the most screentime compared to the other girls, you will find a moment or two where each one either made you laugh, intrigued, or at least appreciate their air combat skill.Plot & Enjoyment?The plot isn\'t great, but it isn\'t terrible either. It is railroaded and our main girls have plot armor protecting them the whole way through. Every time the plot throws something ""surprising"" or ""bad"" at you, you aren\'t surprised and already know what the outcome will be. If you aren\'t watching the girls have air battles, the show falls back to a typical ""slice of life"" type of story where you watch Kirie eat pancakes and the other girls drink.If you don\'t go into the show too seriously, and are able to let the laws of physics stretch a bit, this is a very enjoyable show for those of us who enjoy women and dogfights in the sky.

I was moving outta my seat like crazy when I saw Pikachu evolve. And then the birthday celebration for Satoshi ""Ash Ketchum"" was perfect. The story was completely immaculate, mind-blowing, and most of all, interesting. The art style cannot be trumped and no art will ever be similar or equal to this. The sound was amazing and I loved the sound when Pikachu evolved. It was absolutely splendid. The character development was actually insane and not comparable to other series. As I have explained earlier above, the enjoyment was immaculate. Overall, I\'d say that this series deserves a season 2. 10/10! I...need more! need more!']"

Clones which go beyond all the things that made SAO an ironic masterpiece. When Death March aired few seasons back, I thought no one would dare to take any more ridiculous self-insert isekai harem route. Apparently, the exact opposite happened, and Isekai Maou to...Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu (How Not to Summon a Demon Lord) was released. Show so ridiculously awesome its English name had to be changed just so people wouldn\'t think it\'s a hentai seriesStory:There is this self-insert dude who has apparently never even spoken with a real person in their life, but he is really good at being isekai Jesus in this video game that everyone plays. A legend, a hero, everything person can achieve in a game and more, that\'s his role. Just so happens to be, these 2 girls do forbidden magic and summon the Jesus behind the game avatar to fill his in-game character. This start an epic adventure focusing around many plot related factors such as kissing, boob fondling and various sexual remarks.It would be easy to mistake the series to have a loosely written story because of its settings. But that\'s just an assumption by those who do not know better! The writer constantly challenges his writing skills by cornering the story with wits never seen before in the animated medium. For one, during this one inn scene, our trio got a room with only one small bed. Isn\'t it impossible for 3 people to sleep on such a small bed? Ikr, but no! Our author found a way to get everyone well-rested, and even had the time to suck neko girl\'s ears, making her happy, followed by a 1,5 minute long boob fondling scene. Every situation that looks beyond hopeless, gets eventually turned positive in ways you would never expect (unless you expect them to be related to lust, in which case you will not be surprised).Characters:The biggest problem with Strike the Blood was the amount of girls it had for the viewer to choose from. Who is the best girl and who the canon pairing. These were questions that made watching it almost stressful due to the meat quantity. Decisions, decisions. Masosoma has fixed these huge problems in two ways. a) there are only 2 girls that matter and all the others are just noncanon pairing hoes b) you don\'t need to choose as you can have them both.Shera is the perfect Elf girl and looks exactly the same as blonde from Sukebe Elf no Mori e. Moreover, she has huge boobs. Rem is where lolicon fetish meets S&M bondage. But really, she has animal ears, so naturally, owning a huge metal collar is just an essential part of her design and not a questionable choice the least. Her eye color is also green which is the only color that really matters. Unfortunately they don\'t seem to have personalities, but I am certain both of them are especially good at sucking... things. .Our Kirito is called Diablo this time. He is also voiced by Ono Saisuke v.2.0, so you know he is awesome. By awesome, I mean a total loser, but still gets to live the ideal life of a lawful wish fulfillment swagnator, and has the most alpha voice imaginable. Other than his hands, which seem to have endless stamina when it comes to harassing women, his other best merit is anything he ever let\'s out of his mouth. When he called that nerdy mage a mega pleb, I removed all characters from my favorite lists just because none of them has as long of an e-penis, and when he gave his monologue praising both: small and big boobs, I had no choice but to make ""Big boobs fill man\'s hand, small boobs fill man\'s heart."" my new favorite philosophical quote.Production:At this point, according to my calculations, the series has offered us around 27 scenes that have moved the plot onward with audiovisual story telling (pantsu shots, bakaboats, pointy nipples etc.). That\'s all really cool. Outside the things that matter, the art and animation are based medium quality. The boob bouncing, especially during walking scenes, is animated in an extremely fluid manner, and goes in perfect harmony with the bouncy sounds, making the series almost hypnotic for that matter.Final judgement.

You can thank me later.Story:Here we go again...yet another ""transported into another world"" (more like self-inserted) fantasy series of some random dude who managed to beat the game, know...its innards, specs and whatnot, and then suddenly finding himself IN the actual game! With a bunch of girls that are reverse-magical slaved and self-locked into our MC with boob touches and physics, follow the Demon King Diablo on his every step of the way, going towns, encountering allies and enemies, showing off his OP skills and ""tactics"" every so often while finding a solution to rid those chains! And who doesn\'t want to watch a perverted MC have his subconscious way with ""hit-and-miss"" intentions of the harem?The only difference in Isekai Maou: there\'s actual progressive story and subversion plot points that are oh-so-predictable yet satisfying to watch. It\'s like you\'re watching an actual playthrough of the game itself! You probably thought that the usual Isekai cliché troupes will work against it, but nope! With decent execution, and the overtime boringness that sets in (your tastes vary, I\'m not gonna judge), at least it manages to keep the investment level of the series high like the Almighty, and best of all? It doesn\'t feel cringeworthy whatsoever, even with the forced humor.Characters:For a cheap knock-off of the most OP character (reference to a certain Death March), Sakamoto Takuma a.k.a Summoning Master and Demon King, Diablo, is both a visual treat and a sight to behold. Other than his OP skills which have the ""woah"" factor, at least he has the audacity to act with the ""sensitivity and righteousness"" behaviour while playing the Demon King act. And for that, he gets a thumbs up for not being the (fill in the blank)-AF character like so many other mediocre series does with the archetype. Anyone who has been burnt out with Diablo\'s character will appreciate that he stands out in the most fitting way possible.On to the girls then:Shera the Elf with giant boobs. What more could you want with her EVERY movement with oh-so-jiggly boobs that always make Diablo cringe at the thought of it? More or less, all the subversive moments of squeezing boobs just makes it more worthwhile to watch this far none.Rem the flat-chested Neko. As if someone with large boobs isn\'t enough, how about one with a flat chest, but also ""smooth to the touch"" that makes you wanna cringe so hard? Not to mention, her lolicon look and the cat-fested ears just made it so that she could orgasm at the sight of sucking and caressing her gentle ears with hot blemishes!Klem, the TRUE Demon Lord of Cross Reverie, looks menacing at first glance, but here comes another loli girl with the love of biscuits (or most likely any satiating food HAHA), kinda liked her character for the most part, even with the eventual full-power release.The other characters are reminiscent of the vibes that are founded by the ironic SAO-ish quirks:Alicia, working for the Imperial Army, she comes off as being an aloof female warrior. At first, her attempts of working with Diablo, Shera and Rem come across as just another insert-yourself-into-the-harem cliché, but once the ""true"" Demon King is unleashed, her ""ignorance is bliss"" attitude starts showing with intensity. So much so that even the OP scenes outlined this (if you looked hard enough).Keera, the evil brother of Shera, the S&M specialist. No words can describe him, as per to a certain mad scientist on the other side. He is truly despicable to the point of no return. ""All I wanted for family is you""? Yea right, you degenerate piece of shit! Every troupe here clearly exemplifies the conglomeracy of it all, with this one character.Art and animation:Ajia-do Animation Works is an obscure studio that has a long history like veterans Toei Animation or Sunrise, but their repertoire of works are subpar, with the only well-received series being Pierrot\'s follow-up of Emma Season 2, and that was back in 2007. So if you\'re an anime studio nut like myself, think of this obscure studio as the equivalent of Pierrot in terms of animation quality, just mildly better.However, with Isekai Maou, there is the Ajia-do trait of limited animation quality (especially with noticeable long-distance/range backgrounds), but it is vastly improved and the 2D artwork doesn\'t disappoint. Along with the action sequences, it doesn\'t give off the feel that the producers cheaped out on both the art and animation. To quote an example, check out the catchy OP sequence where Shera\'s giant ""knockers"" boobs slap each other for an insane 2 second-cut (near the chorus part). Now that is attention to detail. Overall, good art and animation, and props to the production staff.Music:The OST is one of the tolerable ones this season: An all-star female VA casting for the OP and Yuu Serizawa with the help of HoneyWorks\' CHiCO for the ED. Just knowing that the veteran seiyuus all sound so good, you can\'t help but to be immersed in the OST. From the battle scenes that are full or intensity to the action that keeps pumping non-stop, honestly I enjoyed myself with all that is to offer here.Overall, Isekai Maou is a series that at least does the tri-factor (Isekai, LN-harem, ecchi) genres some justice, and with the original source material comes criticisms that many people will pass off as some unnecessary filler. But to be quite honest, while I don\'t love this anime, the enjoyment factor is really where it\'s at to see these characters mingle with a story that\'s so stupid, it\'s entertaining much. To the haters, at least give this a second chance or something, I promise you, it\'s not as taxing as many mediocre isekai series out there. its innards, specs and whatnot, and then suddenly finding himself IN the actual game!

Not to mention, her lolicon look and the cat-fested ears just made it so that she could orgasm at the sight of sucking and caressing her gentle ears with hot blemishes!Klem, the TRUE Demon Lord of Cross Reverie, looks menacing at first glance, but here comes another loli girl with the love of biscuits (or most likely any satiating food HAHA), kinda liked her character for the most part, even with the eventual full-power release.The other characters are reminiscent of the vibes that are founded by the ironic SAO-ish quirks:Alicia, working for the Imperial Army, she comes off as being an aloof female warrior. At first, her attempts of working with Diablo, Shera and Rem come across as just another insert-yourself-into-the-harem cliché, but once the ""true"" Demon King is unleashed, her ""ignorance is bliss"" attitude starts showing with intensity. So much so that even the OP scenes outlined this (if you looked hard enough).Keera, the evil brother of Shera, the S&M specialist. No words can describe him, as per to a certain mad scientist on the other side. He is truly despicable to the point of no return. ""All I wanted for family is you""? Yea right, you degenerate piece of shit! Every troupe here clearly exemplifies the conglomeracy of it all, with this one character.Art and animation:Ajia-do Animation Works is an obscure studio that has a long history like veterans Toei Animation or Sunrise, but their repertoire of works are subpar, with the only well-received series being Pierrot\'s follow-up of Emma Season 2, and that was back in 2007. So if you\'re an anime studio nut like myself, think of this obscure studio as the equivalent of Pierrot in terms of animation quality, just mildly better.However, with Isekai Maou, there is the Ajia-do trait of limited animation quality (especially with noticeable long-distance/range backgrounds), but it is vastly improved and the 2D artwork doesn\'t disappoint. Along with the action sequences, it doesn\'t give off the feel that the producers cheaped out on both the art and animation. To quote an example, check out the catchy OP sequence where Shera\'s giant ""knockers"" boobs slap each other for an insane 2 second-cut (near the chorus part). Now that is attention to detail. Overall, good art and animation, and props to the production staff.Music:The OST is one of the tolerable ones this season: An all-star female VA casting for the OP and Yuu Serizawa with the help of HoneyWorks\' CHiCO for the ED. Just knowing that the veteran seiyuus all sound so good, you can\'t help but to be immersed in the OST. From the battle scenes that are full or intensity to the action that keeps pumping non-stop, honestly I enjoyed myself with all that is to offer here.Overall, Isekai Maou is a series that at least does the tri-factor (Isekai, LN-harem, ecchi) genres some justice, and with the original source material comes criticisms that many people will pass off as some unnecessary filler. But to be quite honest, while I don\'t love this anime, the enjoyment factor is really where it\'s at to see these characters mingle with a story that\'s so stupid, it\'s entertaining much. To the haters, at least give this a second chance or something, I promise you, it\'s not as taxing as many mediocre isekai series out there.', 'Ever wanted to know what it feels like to own someone? I’m not talking about people who you hire or a business partner. I’m talking about if you actually hold ownership of someone like a slave. Taking on the role of a protagonist in a fantasy world is no easy task. Even for a guy like Sakamoto Takuma, he may be an experienced gamer but he’s never been equipped to deal with a life changing event such as being transported into the very game he played. After becoming “Diablo”, he learns that the hard way.Isekai Maou no Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu (otherwise known as...How Not to Summon a Demon Lord) is exactly what it looks like – a show about a demon lord who gets summoned into this fantasy world. The juicy part of the show is that the main protagonist possesses a “slave-turning” skill that allows him to enslave others. True to its form, this anime sets off so many damn red flags that it became of those cases of being so bad, it’s almost good.I’m not going to lie. This show glorifies fan service at any chances it gets so be prepared for a whole feast of them. The first few episodes makes it clear that the two main girls – Shera and Rem serves as Ms. Fanservice. It doesn’t help with the fact that around their neck are collars standing as proof of their enslavement status. As a guy with poor social skills, Diablo have trouble building a connection with his two slaves at first. My early impression of Diablo is that he is a joke of himself. Being a Demon Lord with such power is like an unholy gift but he doesn’t truly know what to do with it. Furthermore, Shera and Rem doesn’t know anything about him and vice versa. However, it does show that Shera adores Diablo and is “impressed” by his skills. Then, there’s Rem who shows little respect to Diablo at first but does warm up to him as they get to know each other more. In a stereotypical manner, they grow closer together and seems the two main girls even develop feelings toward their master. Yet, Diablo still has to hold his urges of lust whenever he gets caught into compromised positions. If you’ve seen any Isekai series of similar nature, you’ll know what I mean.As I watched more and more of this anime, it seems the show does take on a more emotional side once it decided to focus more on the characters. Despite his poor social skills, Diablo shows a genuine caring side towards his two slaves. This is shown in later episodes when he decides to risk everything to save Shera. He even begins to enjoy his new life as a Demon Lord and make the best of it without jeopardizing others. His main goal transform from ruling the world to being a trustworthy master to his slaves. By nature, it’s a peculiar sense to develop a character but somewhat works this way because of Diablo’s personality. He’s a haughty guy with a lot of pride on his side but sometimes drops his guard when it involves his two slaves. On the other hand, I think it’s a cheap ploy by the creators to get the audience to like Diablo. Because let’s face it, Diablo is still a generic character that adheres to wish fulfillment fantasies. So many isekai series pulls this trick from the book and it’s impossible to overlook this show’s pitfalls.Unfortunately, I also have to proclaim that it’s very easy to overlook the other characters outside of the main trio. We got characters like the Fallen (Demonic Being) Edelgard making her debut early on. Does anyone actually care about this character? She speaks broken sentences and plays more of the role of a combatant. Oh and I can’t forget how absurd her personality changes from time to time depending on who she faces with. Other characters like Sylvie and Alicia represents archetypes like the guild master and honorable knight you can find in almost any video game. And of course, they had to add Glebsklem into the show so that the cast would be complete with a half-naked loli. That’s not even the worst part. If we look at the antagonists of the series, they are what really holds the character cast back. Every villain in the show are one dimensional characters with their own self-interest and greed. Some even have other sins that pushes the line of the show’s censorship. I can’t fandom how these antagonists were made except perhaps to tests the limits of Diablo’s powers. The obvious result is that Diablo overcomes his obstacles because how overpowered he is. It’s lack of creativity 101 that hardly takes any effort for anyone to make these type of characters.Ajia-Do worked on a variety of genres before but this is their first full TV anime adaptation based on a light novel. By technical standards, it looks vibrant and matches with what an isekai world should look like. The high fantasy elements of the magical creatures and archaic structures are within expectation. Plus, some of the action scenes carries sufficient details to prove what Diablo is capable of. However, be aware of the show’s fan service. In some episodes, it really pushes the envelope with the “action”. Scenes that includes fingering, sexual power restoration, and tentacles made this anime look like a cartoony porn. It’s also impossible to not take eyes off of Shera’s body. The camera plays around her breasts like they have a life of its own. Clothes are also blown off constantly for specific “reasons” that puts Rem to shame. Character expressions often include their screams of passion in moments of ecstasy. Thanks to the talents of the VA, they make those scenes look more lascivious than they should.There’s an unwritten rule where people drop episodes for a show after three episodes or less. For Isekai Maou, it will most likely take one. It’s a break or take for first impression and if you’re coming in with low expectations, then do yourself a favor and hit that drop button. If you make it beyond those passionate screams of our slave girls, then this may be a sexy rollercoaster. The main trio of Diablo, Shera, and Rem carries this anime so get used to that. Does that still make this anime an enjoyable experience in the end? Hell no.

Out of all the anime genres, the Isekai genre seemed to be the one to annoy me to end due to how poorly written and pandering most of the shows of the Isekai genre are. Say all you want about ecchi + harems but least they are for the most part dump fun shows that respect its own target audience not to mention most of the ecchi + harems anime are self-aware of how cheesy and for the most part bad they are. However, this self-awareness rarely happens in Iseaki as...most of the shows tried to be more epic and seriously than they are actually are and most of the shows end up failed due to poor writing and direction.How to not summon a demon Lord is no different in fact it\'s one of the worse Isekai anime I have seen period. While it isn\'t as offensive as The Master of Ragnarok and Blesser of Einherjar and In a Another World With my Smartphone it\'s still is a pretty awful anime with hardly any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Now with that said let\'s dive in into the Isekai rabbit hole.Story.Just with like with every bad Isekai anime the story of How to Not Summon a Demon Lord is non existent at best mainly because instead of telling a story that has a purpose this crap feast decided to be another crappy isekai story that is filled with fan-service and contrived characters arcs that serve no purpose other to show how overpowered the main character while the females act like damsel in distresses.The story, for the most part, is terribly paced as the fan-service as well the action scenes seemed to drag on way longer than they should. The writing of the show ranges from below average at best to absolutely terrible at worst as the show constantly likes to pander to the lowest common denominator of anime fans.It\'s doesn\'t help that the comedy in this show is pretty damm bad as not only the jokes got annoying as the series progressed but the comedy itself is unfunny and lame for the most part.The final nail of the coffin for the story is that this show at various times took itself way too seriously for it\'s good. This was present in the second half of the series where the show was trying to more epic than it actually is and because of that the show became pretty pretentious at various moments.Overall the story is awful.1/10Characters.The characters aren\'t much better as they all boring and uninspired walking cliches.Diaibo is a typical overpowered protagonist that we all seen before and just like many overpowered protagonist that came before him his is bland and uninteresting. However, I will give Diabio this unlike other overpowered characters he can be a bit funny at times but at the same time he\'s jokes can be pretty repetitive and annoying.The two female characters that follow Diaibo are nothing but fetish husk bait for the viewer. Both are not worth mentioning at all because they do is ride either in the protagonist dick or act like damsel in distress in certain points in the series so that overpowered kun can save them.The same thing can apply for the rest of the female characters in this show.As for the villains they are all SAO levels of bad as all of them are evil for the sake of being evil. Hell one of the villains in the middle of the series looks like a bootleg Sugou from the Althem arc of Sword Art Online.Overall like with the story the characters in How to Not Summon a Demon Lord are awful.2/10Visuals.If there was one thing that I consider to be good about this shit show that it would be the visuals.The show is pretty to look at as it\'s filled with great use of vibrant colours for the character designs as well the background scenery.The actual animation is pretty solid overall that is decently smooth and the fights have pretty decent fight choreography.While the visuals were pretty good I have one complainant with the visuals that certain characters are way too oversexualized. While it\'s as bad not as The Master Of Rock Bottom where the all of the female characters inducing young children are oversexualized for no reason it\'s still just an unpleasant sight to see characters that have young looking bodies doing sexual acts on screen.One more thing I can complain about the visuals is how the show used it\'s fan-service because the fanservice in this show is annoying and dreadful. Not only the fan-service is in all your face all the time but the show simply doesn\'t all out in the uncensored version where they showed uncensored tits...6/10Sound.Like with most Isekai anime before and since the music is very dull fantasy music that we all seen heard and it does nothing to make it special.The opening theme\xa0DeCIDE"" by SUMMONERS 2 sung by the female main characters was a pretty all right opening theme.The ending theme\xa0Saiaku na hi demo Anata ga Suki by Yuu Serizawa is a pretty forgetful ending theme.Now for dub vs sub.The sub is\xa0pretty good overall as you expect however I cannot say the same thing about the dub because it\'s pretty shit and badly acted especially Shera who sounds like she just came out from a hentai production...Overall the if you still want to watch this show stick with the sub.Final Thoughts.How to not summon a Demon Lord is a perfect example of why I despise the Isekai genre as a whole.The story is awful, the pacing is terrible, the comedy is unfunny for the most part, the characters sucked and the fan-service was horrendously annoying. You\'re just better off watching hentai because least you can get something out of this compare to this piece of shit.

It\'s just a matter of what personality they have. And this is one that I like a lot. The MC has been socially disconnected his entire life and has to interact with other NPCs(?) using his game persona. This leads to funny moments and surprisingly cool reactions that aren\'t standard for typical lead male roles (don\'t get me wrong there are moments like those in this).It really is the MC that determines if the show is good or not.On its surface, this is simply another power fantasy...where a socially inept hikikomori ends up in a game world somehow, where he is completely OP.

From the unexpected Season 3 of Overlord, the return of a massive anime Attack On Titan, to the anime where summer is all about the fun as well as isekai shows that needed to be judged alot. This summer, we have plenty of isekai to judge on and one of them is ""How Not To Summon A Demon Lord."" where at first it looks like it is another isekai trash with uncapable of a protagonist, although at least it is not like that. Also, for some reasons, I call this show a lite version...of Overlord. Lets found out why.Story:The anime starts off with your typical MC being so overpowered ingame that I don\'t even know how many times this scene was repeated on other isekai genre shows. Anyways, overpowered MC got transported to a fantasy world which is base on the game he amounted his life on instead of getting a college degree and get a job. Then his eyes caught upon two girls. An Elf and a Beast (cat?) girl. The girls thought that they summon a beast and that beast will be their ""slave"" (pet), but it turns out the magic is reflected to the two girls becoming them the slaves of op protagonists named Diablo. There, it starts all the threesome harem that every audience will expect on this show and the conflicts of having a slave that have internal conflicts.Many people call this anime a lite version of Overlord because unlike many isekai shows, in Overlord and on this anime, the protagonist has an objective and personality, both we can see while we are watching. We get to know their interests as well as their uninterests on certain things. Though, this anime and Overlord share good protagonists, the harem and fanservice is still a nuisance to the story of this anime (although its pretty much ok). Unlike in Overlord where there\'s no fanservice and harem, it focuses more on how the protagonist will conquer the world.Art:Visuals will always be important on a show where harem and fanservice is part of the story. I mean, the whole purpose of fanservice.. is fan.. service... On visual terms, How Not To Summon A Demon Lord is an okay show for it. Its not that bad as well as not that good. The details of the spells are done nicely, as well as the environment, monsters and character outlines. Not to mention, the visuals of the OP and ED matches the show quite a lot.Sound:I, to be honest, not the fan of the OP and ED of the show. I always skip it although it doesn\'t say its really bad for my taste. It is just not my type of music. However, the background music where the anime runs is quite good. It matches scenes where either a battle is going on, or whether the two girls Rem and Shera cling on Diablo naked and Diablo overreacting on his mind.Character:Now here is the interesting part of the anime. Characters. I mentioned earlier how the main protagonist is similar to the Overlord protagonist where both shows personality that pick our interest to watch the show every week. I\'ll now talk about the other characters especially the two girls Rem and Shera. What I like about this two girls is that they are also not your typical harem girls to the protagonist. They also have traits and importance to the story that if they are not present, the story will not progress at all. Shera being a very important person to a nation becoming a slave is already a one big conflict to everyone and Diablo. Then Rem holding one of the most hidden secrets across the world that only Diablo and the high mage named Celestine knows. Then we are provided by supporting characters that not only shows the might of Diablo but his willingness to protect these two girls. The fights shows how he is willing to sacrifice himself to the girls knowing some battles are pretty hard for him but he always win anyways.Enjoyment:Isekai shows are not really that enjoyable as they are repeated always. Fanservice is always irritating and the story lacks elements that a story needs to be. However, this show, having a good protagonist, makes the story progress in the right path for the setting of the story. Making it automatically enjoyable for me to watch and making me wait for a week for an another episode.Overall:In conclusion, ""How Not To Summon A Demon Lord."" is like an upgraded version of your always typical isekai with harem and fanservice cliche that you always want. It\'s a good isekai to watch on unlike many others that have MC that is boring and have a pointless harem. of Overlord.

Shera being a very important person to a nation becoming a slave is already a one big conflict to everyone and Diablo. Then Rem holding one of the most hidden secrets across the world that only Diablo and the high mage named Celestine knows. Then we are provided by supporting characters that not only shows the might of Diablo but his willingness to protect these two girls. The fights shows how he is willing to sacrifice himself to the girls knowing some battles are pretty hard for him but he always win anyways.Enjoyment:Isekai shows are not really that enjoyable as they are repeated always. Fanservice is always irritating and the story lacks elements that a story needs to be. However, this show, having a good protagonist, makes the story progress in the right path for the setting of the story. Making it automatically enjoyable for me to watch and making me wait for a week for an another episode.Overall:In conclusion, ""How Not To Summon A Demon Lord."" is like an upgraded version of your always typical isekai with harem and fanservice cliche that you always want. It\'s a good isekai to watch on unlike many others that have MC that is boring and have a pointless harem.', ""Oh golly, another trashy Isekai anime.I thought we already had enough? Apparently not.After 1 episode you can already recognize it for the trash it is.Story: 1/102 waifu's (1 loli tsundere and 1 braindead elf with big hooters) summon this complete waste of a life loser into a videogame where he is conveniently the highest level of everyone. He enslaves the 2 girls, because screw creating any sort of strong female protagonists. And after he does 1 small little thing for them, they already want his dick. Borderline porn ensues, but even though he is supposed to be a big, overpowered, scary demon lord, he is...the biggest beta male when it comes to the opposite sex.

Its like a better version of Death March, something that I actually enjoy and dont twist my own balls to watch it. It has those fan service moments but I'm really into it for the op mc.

Definitely not for everyone but I'm kinda desperate for hyped animes these days only watching MHA waiting a f**king week every week for one anime episode while...constantly searching for good animes to watch without dropping it after the first episode.

And let me tell you, it’s about freaking time. Call me perverted if you will, but sometimes I just want to sit in a secluded location and listen to 2D girls moan in pleasure as they’re put in ridiculously lewd and comical situations. Of course, I’m not so shallow as to completely disregard all other aspects of an anime and call it “da best evah!” just because it has a few cute babes and sexy scenes. The characters have to be bearable to watch and,...now I know I’m asking a lot here, an ecchi anime with a decent plot wouldn’t hurt, right? Unfortunately, modern ecchi anime just haven’t been cutting it for me for a variety of reasons. I just don’t get that satisfying BOOSTO anymore, if you know what I mean…anyway, Demon Lord on the other hand is actually pretty good for what it is, and I’m here to tell you why.Not only is this show an ecchi, but it’s an isekai anime as well, because we definitely don’t have enough of those! And you can tell that creators are running out of fresh isekai ideas, because this anime’s first episode alone stole so many things from other isekai anime that I’m not actually sure whether it was intentional or not. You got references to KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Overlord, and so many others. I actually found this to be rather ridiculous, yet quite amusing. And we now arrive at one of the primary reasons as to why I like this anime: it’s actually pretty funny! Now I know that taste in comedy varies from person to person, but for me, the lewd humor and Diablo’s plain awkwardness were relatively enjoyable to watch. I found myself laughing during every episode, which for me was just refreshing.Now here comes the question that I’m sure is the most important to you: are the ecchi aspects of this show any good? Well, I can happily tell you that they most certainly are. You got the bouncy boobs, slimes that melt clothes, naked in bed scenes, fondling of breasts, and so much more. In fact, there’s a really memorable scene in episode 10 (If you’ve watched it, you know what I’m talking about ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ), that goes to borderline hentai levels of lewdness.And I really dig that.There are two primary girls in this anime. Shera is a large chested, blonde elf princess with sparkling eyes who likes to rub her breasts up against the protagonist. Yep, we got a winner here! Though she’s actually not a one dimensional character like you might expect her to be, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying her story arc, despite its simplicity. Rem is a flat chested animal girl with long, charcoal hair, fluffy cat ears, and a petite body. Right off the bat viewers are presented with Rem’s tragic secret, and I honestly started feeling an emotional attachment to her from there on out. Also, thanks to this anime and Re:Zero, I discovered that characters named Rem are doomed to unjust torment. I won’t spoil anything, but just know that being named Rem is suffering. The differences between these two characters’ physical traits are like night and day, and they’re each obviously designed to appeal to different fetishes. But you know what? I ended up appreciating both of these girls, and not just for their features, but for their character depth as well.Diablo is your typical overpowered isekai protagonist who crushes all opposition. However, unlike Kirito and his army of clones, the writers gave this guy some personality which made him enjoyable to watch. Diablo’s socially awkward nature combined with his attempts to role play as a demon lord resulted in some pretty comedic moments. And viewers even get a glimpse into his past to see why he is the way he is, which helped increase his relatability for me. But let’s not forget his most important trait: he’s a total chick magnet! All of the girls love him, and he’s wise enough to understand the merits of both large and flat chests. What a prophet.I also loved how this anime handled the Demon Lord Glebsklem. Instead of just making her into a giant final boss monster for Diablo to dispatch of with his hax protagonist powers, after her theatrical summoning, she was revealed to just be a kawaii loli with twintails. And she freaking loves biscuits. Plus she wants to go on a quest to consume all of the world’s biscuits. I can’t express in words how freaking amazing I find this to be. My only problem is that biscuit loli wasn’t introduced earlier in the anime so that she could get more lewd sce- uh, I mean character development.Visuals are generally quite standard, though they do one up similar shows in several regards. For one, they actually have some pretty great monster designs, with the hydra being the standout one for me. Sure, it wasn’t around for long, but it looked great and had fluid movements, which is a stark contrast to the poorly constructed and uninspired monsters from other isekai anime. Also, the visual quality improved dramatically during some of the ecchi scenes, which are OBVIOUSLY the most important moments in the anime. During these sacred moments, the girls got animated in very seductive ways that FIRMLY GRASPED my attention.The instrumental portions of each of the two theme songs played what I thought to be really catchy melodies. The songs’ vocalists had a nice cute sound to them, probably because they were performed by the show’s female seiyuu. The voice acting is about what you would expect. Diablo talks in a deep, menacing voice, but sounds a lot less intimidating when viewers hear his thoughts. Rem has that cute, soft voice that I simply adore, and Shera has a higher pitch, ditsy sort of voice that sounds adorable.While this show isn’t even close to top tier when compared to all other anime, it does manage to be one of the finest isekai anime that I’ve seen, as well as the best ecchi anime that I’ve watched in awhile. Where it excelled at for me was its sheer entertainment value. There was never a dull moment in the anime, and I both laughed at the comedic antics and felt for the characters during the more serious moments. The anime flows quite well, and it’s a perfect concoction of ecchi and story elements. All I can do now is hope that future installments in both the ecchi and isekai genres follow a similar path to How not to Summon a Demon Lord. now I know I’m asking a lot here, an ecchi anime with a decent plot wouldn’t hurt, right?

That is all."", 'Calling this anime ""yet another isekai"" is genuinely an understatement for how criminally bad the show really is. Even among the worst, Isekai Maou stands out, and that speaks volumes.Story: 1/10The story is unoriginal and uninspired. Every single aspect of the plot is a massive cliché. Without giving spoilers I can tell you that the story is exactly what you would expect from an isekai. A self-insert shut-in who has never talked to a girl before is teleported to another world where every girl throws herself at him as he panics and makes silly faces. There\'s a stereotypical demon lord that wants to destroy the...world yada yada the protagonist doesn\'t need any character development because he\'s already overpowered yada yada defeats the demon lord.Even with bad shows I usually find myself intrigued by one thing or another about the story, but not even once did Isekai Maou have me on the edge of my seat. It\'s as predictable as it gets.Art: 1/10It\'s easy to see that the show had absolutely no passion put into it. Most full-body shots have the same level of detail as the classic background characters we often see in anime in general. Unless the camera is really close to a character, the art is genuinely just terrible.My biggest gripe against Isekai Maou\'s art design, however, is the animation. The animation is insulting. I\'m not exaggerating when I say that 90% of the time it honestly looks like I\'m watching a slide show, while the other 10% is a slightly better slide show. I cannot accept that each episode took longer than two days to animate. There is barely any motion at all. Dialogues are literally just the mouth changing its shape with the ocasional head turn. Walking scenes are just the characters bobbing up and down with two or three extra frames at most for the limbs. Every scenario looks dead, previous shots are often reused (literally copy/paste), a lot of screen time is filled with still shots, I could go on all day.The fight scenes aren\'t good either. Animating magic is easier so the protagonist just has a staff that he barely moves when casting magic. Animating melee combat is more difficult since you actually have to put some effort into drawing the body so there\'s really only two melee fight scenes that last more than ten seconds, and even so, most of the scene is filled with reused frames or dialogue, while the different shots are also pretty much motionless. Even the magic lacks imagination. There\'s one big spell that the protagonist casts but actually trying to animate something must be too hard so the spell is just a big white beam. No effects, no colors, nothing. Just a bland solid white beam.This genuinely feels like 90s anime in terms of animation, and even that is still an insult to the shows of that era.Sound: 3/10Nothing special. You can\'t really go wrong with sound, except for the fact that the sound effects lack impact and none of the soundtracks really stuck to me. Now that I think about it, I can\'t even remember if the show had any. That\'s how forgettable the soundtrack is.Character: 1/10The self-insert, the stereotypical big-breasted airhead and the flat kuudere. You can\'t get more cliché than this. The female elf is, as always, a walking fanservice and the flat kuudere cat girl is generally used for breast envy jokes. There\'s really not much to be said about the characters since character development is nonexistent in Isekai Maou. The few side characters barely have any screen time while the main girls serve absolutely no purpose besides providing fanservice.Enjoyment: 1/10Funny and goofy for two episodes, subsequently getting more stale by the second. When you start questioning the characters\' decisions, watching this anime gets utterly revolting. At some point I just wanted to finish all episodes out of sheer spite. I can\'t really explain why the decision-making is so repugnant without giving spoilers, but trust me, it is that bad. One might argue that bad decision-making is just a flaw that makes the characters look more real, but that\'s simply not true. Every bad decision is just a plot device used to push the story forward since the show lacks any form of inspiration to naturally develop itself, and in the end none of the main characters face any consequences for being so dense. That\'s plot armor. Plot armor only makes everything less believable. A spoiler free example would be how the self-righteous protagonist refuses to kill anyone because he\'s a spineless worm, only to then see the character he refused to kill causing issues that could lead to the death of all the girls he loves so much, but it\'s okay since the plot armor will protect them.Overall: 1/10It\'s definitely not for everyone. It\'s one of those shows that you have to turn your brain off to enjoy. Everything about this anime is forgettable and lacks any essence. It is possible to enjoy Isekai Maou if you\'re easily satisfied with cheap entertainment that provides no sense of fulfillment and has no message to convey, consequently becoming nothing short of a low-effort attempt at cashing out on the isekai trend. If you fit the criteria, go right ahead and give it a watch. world yada yada the protagonist doesn\'t need any character development because he\'s already overpowered yada yada defeats the demon lord.Even with bad shows I usually find myself intrigued by one thing or another about the story, but not even once did Isekai Maou have me on the edge of my seat. It\'s as predictable as it gets.Art: 1/10It\'s easy to see that the show had absolutely no passion put into it. Most full-body shots have the same level of detail as the classic background characters we often see in anime in general. Unless the camera is really close to a character, the art is genuinely just terrible.My biggest gripe against Isekai Maou\'s art design, however, is the animation. The animation is insulting. I\'m not exaggerating when I say that 90% of the time it honestly looks like I\'m watching a slide show, while the other 10% is a slightly better slide show. I cannot accept that each episode took longer than two days to animate. There is barely any motion at all. Dialogues are literally just the mouth changing its shape with the ocasional head turn. Walking scenes are just the characters bobbing up and down with two or three extra frames at most for the limbs. Every scenario looks dead, previous shots are often reused (literally copy/paste), a lot of screen time is filled with still shots, I could go on all day.The fight scenes aren\'t good either. Animating magic is easier so the protagonist just has a staff that he barely moves when casting magic. Animating melee combat is more difficult since you actually have to put some effort into drawing the body so there\'s really only two melee fight scenes that last more than ten seconds, and even so, most of the scene is filled with reused frames or dialogue, while the different shots are also pretty much motionless. Even the magic lacks imagination. There\'s one big spell that the protagonist casts but actually trying to animate something must be too hard so the spell is just a big white beam. No effects, no colors, nothing. Just a bland solid white beam.This genuinely feels like 90s anime in terms of animation, and even that is still an insult to the shows of that era.Sound: 3/10Nothing special. You can\'t really go wrong with sound, except for the fact that the sound effects lack impact and none of the soundtracks really stuck to me. Now that I think about it, I can\'t even remember if the show had any. That\'s how forgettable the soundtrack is.Character: 1/10The self-insert, the stereotypical big-breasted airhead and the flat kuudere. You can\'t get more cliché than this.

Everything about this anime is extremely entertaining and fun, and it does what it wants to do extremely well.The story is what you\'d expect in an isekai anime about a video game. World\'s best player gets transported, or in this case ""summoned"", into the game world and is immediately OP just with their knowledge alone. However, the way this is done in this anime is extremely unique. Our MC is a full-on introvert who is forced to play a character that is everything he wants to be. As the episodes go, we get introduced to this...new world and its inhabitants, and we learn how things are done here (of course, our MC is aware of everything due to his badassery). I really enjoyed this anime\'s story and would go to say it\'s one of the best isekai stories in recent years.The characters are all amazing. From their appearances to their personalities and mindsets, all the way to their interactions with one another, it\'s all amazing. Our boy Diablo is probably the best isekai MC ever, and he deserves his harem. Even the side characters have their own little sparks that help them stand out. Shera is best girl btw (I\'m a sucker for elf girls, what can I say), Rem is a close second.The animation was higher quality than I expected, especially in specific scenes (if you know what I mean). The art and animation are good enough to enjoy, in more ways than one. Sometimes, the boob animations and the bounce sounds make it almost hypnotic.Overall, a really good anime (by my standards).

The main character, Diablo, is a guy who teleported to the world from his favorite game. In real life he’s no one but in this world, he’s Demon King. It’s common anime, so what’s wrong with it? Honestly, for me, a lot of things are just bad.But lets start with the good part.From the visual side, it’s not bad anime, it’s just nothing special. Fight scenes are not chaotic, “special spells” don’t look like they were made in Paint. But in ecchi bazoongas are the most important thing. Yeah, bazoongas are...nice, but their consistency is like jelly so that’s kinda weird.Sound is not really important. It’s not that bad or that good to focus on it. Opening probably won’t be your favorite, but it isn’t terrible. The main problem is that all soundtrack is not connected, it’s like the playlist on Spotify on which your friends add random songs. Sometimes it doesn’t fit the vibe too, for example during a dramatic scene plays something close to a pop song.Another good thing is part of Diablo’s story. I appreciate that he’s a nerd that was teleported to the anime world. He must act like Demon King, but inside he’s a shy nerd which never touched a woman. I think it’s a good storyline how he tries to be more confident. But sometimes it’s just overblown even if viewers know it’s just his acting.And that’s all good things. The next part is just rage and pain.Sooo, it’s ecchi there are bazoongas, harem, butts, girls, and sexual allusions, I know about it. But it’s sometimes too much. Especially with characters like Sylvie and Glebsklem, they both look like they were eleven years old. And I think even the fact Glebskem is an ancient Demon Lord, doesn’t change that she has the body of a kid. Her outfit doesn’t even cover the whole bazoongas and that’s just kinda gross to me.So we have a few important characters. Diablo is a nerd, who must act like Demon King. The first girl is Shera, she is a dumb elf with huge bazoongas which eats a lot. And the second girl is Rem who is almost flat, but she has cat ears and a tail. Everything you must remember is that the main character is Diablo, a girl with bazoongas and a girl without bazoongas. Of course, these two argue about bazoongas, because it’s ecchi. All of the characters don’t really change through all season, they’re almost the same as in the beginning, they don’t learn from their mistakes. Only Diablo sometimes has any logical thinking, but only for a moment. Shera and Rem are just dumb through all episodes.When we come to the plot. Two “extremely intelligent” girls decide to summon a demon lord and make him their slave. But oopsie daisy, he has the ring of reflection, and they become his slaves. Diablo become an adventurer and they do all stuff that they do in fantasy anime. I think that could be a more interesting plot if this slave story wasn’t just sexual allusions but it’s only about getting Diablo’s arm between bazoongas. The main storyline is just not interesting. There are so many things that just fill up space. Basically, a lot of episodes are just about Rem or Shera getting in trouble and Diablo trying to save them. That’s why you can easily forget what is the goal of their journey.And here comes the biggest sin of this anime, it's just boring. You watch it and almost constantly forget about it. Characters do what they do just cause of the plot, not because they have any motivation. Things just happen and you don't even know why, because you just don't care. I think in my entire life I never forgot the plot during watching anything, but here it just happened. I was watching it all in one night and after finishing it I couldn’t even tell about its main storyline, because it was so boring that I forgot about it. The only thing that I could remember is that it was like every fantasy anime with an adventurer motive.I think I never used “bazoongas” so much in that short period of time, but it was worth it. So basically, if you want to see something with bazoongas, a good plot and charismatic characters then go watch something else.

The many beautiful views make me eager to continue watching. The main character is also overpowering and wise so it is exemplary. With a brief explanation of the main character, we can see that from beginning to end the character continues to develop. From being lazy to now very industrious and passionate but still awkward. He can also be a great guy and change from himself. The comedy element in this anime is very great and feels very ecchi and harem. I also like the music that is suitable to listen to.

With an MC who was either a NEET, or not overly positive in life. In How not to Summon a Demon lord our MC is summoned into the game he plays where his character ""Diablo"" is severely OP and is one of the strongest characters Level wise in the game. We then find out he is summoned to this world by Cat Girl Rem, and Elven Girl Shera. However due to Diablos reflect Magic spell the enslavement ritual used to Summon Diablo...backfires on Rem and Shera and they become Diablos slaves.Throughout the anime Diablo finds things out about Shera and Rem and does whatever he can to help them achieve their goals in life. Along the way Diablo, Rem, and Shera make various connections with an abundance of likeable characters and the story progresses.I really enjoyed the Art and Animation. With their most recent work being Izetta the Last Witch, I was very impressed with Studio Ajia-Do. The anime was very clean, crisp and enjoyable to watch.The opening and ending songs were some of the best of the season. I thoroughly enjoyed the BGM in the anime as well.The characters were really enjoyable. I usually hate characters like Shera but I really liked her a lot. Diablo is actually an enjoyable MC. Him being overpowered was fantastic and then being shy around girls balanced him out to be a really great MC.I really enjoyed this anime. It had a good balance of comedy, action, fan service, and story spread throughout the series.Overall I thought this was a really good anime.

Although it does have certain elements that are reruns of other animes, it does have some distinct differences that make it a cut above.Story: 9Overall its a great story. of course with the influx of isekai stories this kinda just falls into that category, but there is definitely something different in the writing of it. The story part is different. Unpredictable, un-stereotypical. So, although the main concept is similar to other isekai animes (think overlord), it's story is different, which not only makes it feel fresh, but also comedic. Also, this is the...first isekai anime where the MC is present in both forms, one as the player and two as the character. This inner dialogue only further adds to the comedy of it.Art: 8First off, I watched this entire season on uncensored (which i believe you should to), and have to say, was not disappointed. It is a new anime, so the art is expected to be good. Animation is crisp, light. The action scenes do not disappoint, the directing angles and cuts are good as well. Its definitely not the best animation ive ever seen, but it meets the par for animes of this day and age.As for Character design and color choice, most match their personalities well. None of the colors are out of place, and those also reflect the story's setting and premise. Bright colors match the in-game setting of a MMORPG (or whatever they call it).Sound: 9The opening and ending songs are both good, as in they fit my taste. Fast, EDM style if you want to know. In anime sound, didnt really pick up too much about it its great, but not amazing. But definitely not bad either. The soundtrack is good, it doesn't detract too much from the story. VAs are chosen well, they fit the characters that theyre representing.Enjoyment:10Seeing as this is The Ecchi Anime of this season there was no way i was not going to enjoy it. But even without that aspect, this anime is very enjoyable. The story takes an old concept and refreshes it in some way. the storyttelling is great, unpredictable but not outlandish. The art is above average and the sound is as well. Characters are mostly well done.Overall: 9I wouldn't say this is the best anime ive ever watched, nor is it one of the best. Nor is it one of the best ecchi anime's ive ever watched. Its just a decent well rounded ecchi anime. Nothing is done wrong, but its not really pushing any sort of artistic boundary. its a great anime, but its missing that x-factor, be it story wise, animation-wise, or character wise to really push it to the 10. to break it down, id say 3 for story + 3 for ecchi + 1 for characters +1 for sound +1 for art = 9 overall.peace first isekai anime where the MC is present in both forms, one as the player and two as the character.

It’s not that i hate this genre, but with the amount of them coming out and doing what can only be a somewhat serviceable amount, it starts to get tiring. Isekai maou is no exception either. It follows the basic formula of some unknown protagonist in the “real world” being transported to a fictional land that he has some superficial connection to , in this case a game. He becomes the player character he uses, and is part of a pseudo version of the game that is a bit different, but follows the same mechanics...for some reason. He joins or accidently enslaves two girls who summoned him, and they go on adventures. The plot isn’t that complex and it follows a basic three act structure first with the introduction of the world, second with one of the girls and the elf kingdom, and finally the other girl and the church. Many steps along the way are riddled with plot contrivances and conveniences, but the characters, art/animation, voice acting and soundtrack are serviceable enough that it’s not that much of a bother.This is a show that knows what demographic it’s trying to sell it to and just goes for it. Maybe it’s because i viewed it in that lens that i’m more passive to the show so i don’t find its content that offensive. In the end of the day it’s a stupid show with fun moments, and short enough that it’s not too overbearing. for some reason.

It\'s all quite forced and obnoxious and the show went to the absolute heights of what can be done without making it a hentai. If you compare it to how Overlord approaches similar themes, you can see that it can be done without going overboard and derailing the core story.But, enough of complaining, because there are things to compliment here. First, is the general...characterisation of the protagonist, who is transported to another world as an OP demon mage and quickly establishes himself as ""Diablo, the Demon Lord"", forcing a grim persona that hides his insecurity and lack of social skills - this part is actually quite amusing and once more, reminiscent of some fun aspects of Overlord\'s Momonga (just without the ""evil"" parts). Also, the protagonist quickly finds some serious challenges in this new world and is involved in some really cool fantasy battles - those are usually brief, but really fun to watch. The overall plot is also rather satisfying, even if ultimately predictable.In the end, this is still another trashy, ecchi-oriented isekai, but it\'s a league or two above really crappy shows such as Smartphone or Deathmarch (yeah, that one started cool, but later on...). While not especially memorable, it\'s worth giving a try if you want to relax with something that doesn\'t try to take itself seriously and unapologetically focuses on giving you easy entertainment. After all, is it not exactly the thing we\'re looking for with these shows? characterisation of the protagonist, who is transported to another world as an OP demon mage and quickly establishes himself as ""Diablo, the Demon Lord"", forcing a grim persona that hides his insecurity and lack of social skills - this part is actually quite amusing and once more, reminiscent of some fun aspects of Overlord\'s Momonga (just without the ""evil"" parts).

And one day somehow he was summoned into another world and the laughing matter is the game he uses to play and the world he was summoned is same, in the first time I wasn\'t thinking much about that part...but after that I able to know that he is kind of one of the high-level player in the game he uses to play. Well, this anime has some adventure, magic and besides, I think the main character is cool so many girls fall for him which made a harem, also a slight test of ecchi and romance as well.If this anime comes with the 2nd season I would love to watch that too. but after that I able to know that he is kind of one of the high-level player in the game he uses to play.

But suddenly it decides that it wants to have this big serious story all of a sudden, where it takes a RIDICULOUSLY dark tone. There\'s nothing wrong with sudden changes like this, some of my favorite stories have done this type of sudden tonal shift. But this one, it messes up basically everything in the...span of a single episode by creating massive contradictions and horrid character writing.Early on we\'re very specifically told that it isn\'t possible to use magic to resurrect people, so this puts the stakes somewhat high for a magical isekai world. This doesn\'t really matter for 10 episodes. But episode 11, we end up getting the most ridiculous and painful torture scene I have ever seen. It is to the point where literally anyone would look at the victim, who is in an entire room covered in their own blood with a lot of stakes sticking out of them, and say ""yep, they\'re 100% dead"". But no, this anime decided that they are in fact, not dead. That in fact, a potion is enough to heal them, even though they basically stopped breathing for a very long time. This torture scene happens so suddenly, and it is so grotesque and agonizingly long, that it completely removed all and every enjoyment I had of what should\'ve been a silly isekai harem.BUT, I\'m not done yet with the absolute retardation of the character writing. We get to know this one girl, who seems innocent, but of course is the biggest sadist ever and a mass murderer of civilians, to the point you could call what she does ethnical cleansing. She\'s seemingly some leader in a cult, dead set on summoning something which basically entails the end of everyone, and to summon that, she has tortured and killed THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. So with this in mind, you might wonder, this person is just a terrible villain who\'s probably going to get punished heavily and killed by the end. BUT NO, how can you be so foolish to think that? This absolute unit is going to get a redemption arc! All of the people she tortured and murdered? Yeah, all will be resolved in a grand redemption!... Actually, no, she just says that she regrets what she\'s done and apparently all is fine, even by the person that got tortured nearly to death. And then she\'s also a part of the growing harem in this anime. No joke, the mass torturing villain becomes a part of the harem and episode 12 ends up with literally every girl in the harem taking all their clothes off and smothers the isekai protagonist in lots of oppai. Of course this isn\'t rated R+ so don\'t get your hopes up.It has been a while since I\'ve watched this, but I had to write a review because I have never seen any piece of media going from a solid 8/10 down to a 0/10 in a single episode. And that\'s the only reason my final score isn\'t a 1, it\'s just fine until it\'s not. For the love of god, if you want to watch this anime, skip episode 12 and 11, maybe even 10 for that matter as it does build up to the garbage ending. Or just don\'t watch it at all.

It completely satisfies someone who seeks adventure and fantasy who's still in puberty but at the end of the day it feels like a series I may soon forget after it's completed.In terms of the plot the only redeeming characteristic is that the protagonist is an...awkward idiot, moreso than konosuba.I do appreciate the anime and voicing that went into it, as it does fit the necessary elements and properly caters to what the target audience seeks in these types of anime, but it really has been dull for me, as mentioned before: the general storyline is overdone. awkward idiot, moreso than konosuba.I do appreciate the anime and voicing that went into it, as it does fit the necessary elements and properly caters to what the target audience seeks in these types of anime, but it really has been dull for me, as mentioned before: the general storyline is overdone."", ""Story: 4.5The story itself wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that it's always ruined by fan service and almost every girl is dressed like she is about to get dicked down in the next few seconds.

A stay in neet who somehow gets sent to the world of his game ( Nothing new, honestly ) by accident and is forced to find his way out and back home. Other than that, there's nothing more to stay about the story other than boobs don't make for a decent story. Doesn't help...that the story seems to move pretty fast.It moves so fast that you're honestly a little let down with everything.

There is a difference in almost all the characters, but not much of a difference in how the females look. Almost every single one of them has a chest the size of Mt.

It's pleasing to look at, to say the least.Sound: 6The music is okay, but it's not something that I would listen to on a daily or even a few times a week. I do have to say that for such a show, it does match rather well. The voice acting for the English Dub, however, is sub par. It could use some work, but I'm not a voice actor so I'll leave that be.Character: 5While some of the characters are rather interesting, it seems like instead of focusing on the character as a whole, they only focus on one or two aspects of them. May it be boobs, or her lack therefor of, him being a neet and being so anti-social that he finds it pretty cool to latch onto girls breast and doesn't even know what a nipple is? The characters need a lot of work, a lot, A LOT, of work. I'm also very tired of the idea that a princess is somehow scatterbrained and idiotic; royals are trained in both education and fighting more often than not because they are just that, a royal. The reactions are way too over the top for me.Instead of fixing the problem, they just stand there and look at it like they're in an art gallery. Doesn't help that the moment the guy touches them they act like they're in a hentai.Enjoyment: 6When the Anime wasn't focusing on things that don't progress the plot, the show is pretty good. I can't say the same for when all they seem to think about are boobs and how much they can bounce when someone is either walking or standing still. It was enjoyable enough for me to be able to watch more than one episode, but not enough for me to feel the need to continue watching the whole series.Overall: 5While this Anime was a huge miss for me, that doesn't mean that it will be for someone else. If these are the things you enjoy, if this is the kind of comedy that you find funny, I say go for it. Enjoy what makes you happy. This show just wasn't for me however, and that's the thing. If I want to see large breast, I'll look down my shirt, but all joking aside I just can't stand this kind of Anime.I should have read more about it before watching it but I saw the art and went for it and that was my own mistake. All in all, in my honest opinion this Anime isn't too great. It isn't horrible, but it isn't great either. that the story seems to move pretty fast.It moves so fast that you're honestly a little let down with everything. Such as, you just meet this man and all of a sudden you're telling him a secret that could get you killed while pleading for him not to leave you like he's your long lost lover? You start to dry hump this man who you met less than a week ago because you want him to choose you over the other girl because somehow, someway you're jealous of him wanting her? All this over a man who you haven't even known for a WEEK yet??? No thanks.Art: 7The art isn't bad at all.

Fanservice isn’t a terrible thing in and of itself. But whether the show is any good or not depends on the cast and the story. So far I’m enjoying that aspect of it.

Every sign pointed to it being absolutely awful in every way. It was the perfect storm of awfulness that has plagued seasonal anime for the last five or so years since Sword Art Online popularized the isekai genre, but here we are, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord being actually pretty fun. Not great or even pretty good, but a lot of fun. Fun isn\'t something we think about much when we\'re scoring shows and putting them on our ""completed"" lists, but for some...reason, Demon Lord makes me remember how fun watching anime can and should be. A lot of you may be thinking that I\'m making a mountain out of a molehill, but I can\'t find any other way to describe Demon Lord\'s charm.Aesthetically, Demon Lord doesn\'t do much to stand out from its fellow isekai shows, using the same bright color scheme to emphasize how it takes place in a game world, uses fairly generic fantasy creatures, etc. There\'s really not much to be blown away by visually in Demon Lord, which I can\'t imagine being a big draw for most people anyway. I mean, it\'s yet another isekai power-fantasy, how unique can it be visually? Something impressive is how Demon Lord somehow manages to make impressively skimpy female outfits following it up with an even skimpier outfit the next episode like they\'re having a competition with themselves. Not a complaint, just an observation from an interested viewer.Sound design is a little more impressive. There were moments that I was simply pulled into because of how solid the soundtrack was. The theme song that they use to introduce the paladin character, Saddler, was especially epic in my opinion. However, I wasn\'t really impressed with either the opening or the ending, though they were both fairly mediocre. The magic sound design was also pretty good, but I don\'t know if I can really call anything too bad after watching Fate/Apocrypha.Favorite Character: KrebskulmWhat can I say? The loli demon lord that loves cookies charmed me and my cold, dead heart. How could aybody hate such an adorable face?That\'s kind of a good segway into talking about the characters, which play a huge role in making Demon Lord so enjoyable. Individually, they really aren\'t very unique, but together they have such good chemistry that you have to smile every time they interact, especially the main trio. In fact, Diablo, the main character, is the reason to give Demon Lord a shot. He starts as just another shut-in (where have I seen this story before?) before getting transported into the game that he is an apparent master of. Seeing how socially inept he is on the inside, only able to pull off an arrogant and cocky attitude is a lot of fun. It blows up in his face a lot, putting him in awkward situations, primarily with women, creatures with which he is very uncomfortable.Demon Lord is just a blast. Obviously, if you want to watch a serious story unfold, Demon Lord probably isn\'t for you, despite the story being pretty good actually. There\'s really not a lot more to touch on, obviously it\'s kind of risque, which doesn\'t bother me at all, but some are really turned off by ecchi, which I understand. If you\'re someone in the latter group, you\'re definitely not going to like Demon Lord, since some scenes can be borderline hentai, so there\'s that.

The main protagonist is a gamer that plays the MMORPG Cross Reverie. He finds himself magically turning into his high-level mage character, named Diablo, upon being summoned into the game by Rem and Shera, the two other main protagonists of the show. The rest of the show follows the trio on a journey to release a Demon Lord, trapped inside Rem, from within her without killing her. Thankfully, frequent action, humorous dialogue and visuals, and plot development (which also serves to reveal a decent amount of lore to the viewer) are all balanced well, keeping the showing from...getting too boring too quickly.

However, the show is beautifully animated. Everything is vibrantly colored and crisply outlined.

While the show does have some redeeming qualities - the story is interesting enough, the production quality is on-point, and there are plenty of entertaining action sequences - these qualities are far outweighed by its faults. This series suffers from one major flaw in particular, though, one so fatal that any positive aspects it possesses are rendered essentially meaningless: The characters fucking suck. Especially the MC.Just to get it out of the way, here are the scores for this piece...of shit:Story: 5Art: 8Sound: 7Characters: 1Enjoyment: 4Overall: *3/10*Instead of delving into every aspect of this series, I am going to focus my attention on the character(s) and why they are so horrible that the entire show is ruined as a result. I hope you\'re prepared...Almost every issue with the characters in HNTSADL stems from the fact that the MC is a disgusting loser and a sexual predator, and this appraisal is ignoring the fact that he was a shut-in NEET before he was isekai\'d. Right from the beginning, you get an idea of what an envious & spiteful douchebag this guy is when he gleefully talks about how he gets more enjoyment than usual from killing couples in an MMORPG, because that\'s healthy. His emotional immaturity is made more apparent throughout the series, and reaches a climax of sorts when he reacts to one character ostensibly leaving him by completely shutting down & rolling up into a ball like a toddler. Jesus fucking Christ!After he is transformed into his RPG character, he immediately gets two slaves due to a magical mishap, and it doesn\'t take long for him to exploit that. Throughout the series, he repeatedly molests both of them, even while they are asleep; even worse, he literally tries to rape another female character when he gets drunk, and only fails to do so because he passed out from the intoxication. This behavior is usually accompanied by his exceedingly-gross inner monologue, a significant portion of which is focused on the breasts of the women around him. Do you know how unsettling it is to hear a grown-ass man describe, in great detail, the developing breasts of a teenaged girl as he is molesting her while she sleeps? Unfortunately, I do now. This grossness is further accentuated by the implication that he is somehow not in control of his own body at times, and his hands are molesting the girls of their own volition despite his internal protests. Yeah, you can fuck right off with that bullshit.This brings us to what I feel is the worst aspect of this behavior: Everything I have described is portrayed in a ""comedic"" fashion. That\'s right, the show presents the behavior of a bona fide pedophile as though it were funny, and his crimes are merely goofy antics. Yeah, there is just one problem with this: It was not fucking funny! Now, I come from the ""George Carlin School of Thought,"" if you will, so I believe literally anything can be funny, including sexual assault; however, as Carlin pointed out in the aptly-titled routine ""Rape Can Be Funny,"" it all depends on how the joke is constructed. Comedy relies, in part, on the subversion of one\'s expectations through humorous exaggeration, and that is why the underlying premise of any good rape joke is the fact that rape is, in fact, a horrible crime that can (will) destroy a person\'s life. In other words, if you tell a joke about rape or sexual assault, it better come from the right place or you will just end up looking like a disgusting creep. Example of the latter: HNTSADL. The reason none of these attempts at humor worked is because the only thing goofy about these assaults was the array of faces he was making while half-heartedly telling his hands to stop, which means, in the end, you are just watching some pathetic loser with poor self-control molest a couple sleeping teenagers. Fucking despicable.I am going to compare this shit to a series called \'Green Green\' (GG), which is an objectively awful series in pretty much every way. For all of its flaws, though, GG was still able to pull off ""rapey-ish humor"" just enough to have me chuckling once in a while. Why, you ask? Well, there a few reasons for this: 1) The idiots in GG would concoct plans so ridiculously stupid that you can\'t help but laugh at the absurdity; 2) They always failed spectacularly and embarrassingly; and 3) They usually suffered even more spectacularly as a result of their failures - one of the pedo-fucktards gets a cactus shoved in his face and another gets ass-raped by a bear, to give a couple examples. Seriously, to be outdone by GG in any way is just fucking sad... well, except for that ""bear rape"" scene, which is amaze-ballz. Also, Togemura conquers ALL foes... bitches.My gripes with the rest of the character pool are pretty typical, but don\'t necessarily apply to all of the characters in the show: annoying; one-dimensional; unbelievable; worthless; etc. The biggest issue I have with the other characters, though, is their general acceptance of Douche Lord\'s behavior, which I found to be uncharacteristic of several, um, characters. I may elaborate more on these issues in the future, but I am not sure it is worth my time to do so, considering that pretty much all of the characters are fairly cookie-cutter anyways.IN SUMMATION: HNTSADL is glorified pedo-hentai masquerading as a shounen action series. While there are some pretty cool fight scenes strewn throughout the show, you are also subjected to numerous instances of sexual assault being perpetrated by the childish & pathetic loser of an MC, whose mere presence is the main reason this show is such a piece of shit. Here is my advice: If you like action, then watch the fight scenes on some YouTube alternative and and skip the rest, because you\'re not missing too much that is worthy of note, much less praise. of shit:Story: 5Art: 8Sound: 7Characters: 1Enjoyment: 4Overall: *3/10*Instead of delving into every aspect of this series, I am going to focus my attention on the character(s) and why they are so horrible that the entire show is ruined as a result.

I may elaborate more on these issues in the future, but I am not sure it is worth my time to do so, considering that pretty much all of the characters are fairly cookie-cutter anyways.IN SUMMATION: HNTSADL is glorified pedo-hentai masquerading as a shounen action series.

The anime gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a player of a popular MMORPG that owns an avatar that boasts enough overwhelming magical ability and...combat strength that he’s been given the title demon lord by others were to be summoned to a world that looks remarkably like his game world. But rather than being summoned in his real-life self the player is instead summoned in the form of his avatar the self-proclaimed demon lord Diablo whose overwhelming magic and high-grade items soon turns the tables on the summoners who had wanted to enslave him who in turn is enslaved instead. Now finding himself in a world that looks exactly like that of the game that the player has been playing Diablo must not only come to grips with the fact that his real self was now his game self but also that he now has two beautiful and cute demi-humans as his slave's thanks to their reflected magic.The premise of having a main character be summoned or dragged into another world is not anything that’s rare within the anime world given the number of animes that make use of it. However, I felt that the premise that was used in this case which was the mc being summoned to another world inside the body of his own avatar was one that I felt was a unique take on the premise as it made use of the unique relationship that exists between a player’s avatar and their real-life self. The first episode of the series I felt did an excellent job of not just introducing the main characters of the series but also introduce us to the world in which the mc is summoned too and left a pretty good impression on me enough in that I decided to stick with it till the end of the series.Taking place within a world that greatly resembles medieval Europe is a world that is populated by all sorts of fantasy races where humans are but one race among many and while each race has their own culture and beliefs all aspire to be able to live a life where they can freely choose how they live. While tensions between the races are high and discrimination of races is rampant each side tries their best to maintain the peace that exists between the races and work together to survive in a world that’s rife with demon lords and dangerous fallen that live beyond the city’s borders. The overall story of the series follows the adventures of Diablo a human player who finds himself being transported from his game world to another world that looks remarkably like that of his former world  thanks to the summoning ritual that was enacted by two demi-humans who had intended to use him as their servant by enslaving him with a bounding spell. However, as a result of Diablo’s innate magic reflection ability this spell is instead reflected and results in the tables being turned on the summoners who become his servants instead.  As a result of not just trying to find a way back to his home and also find a way to release the slave collars that bind their necks Diablo is soon forced to embark on a wacky adventure that will see him not just inspire fear in others by acting like his character but also loyalty and respect as he encounters not just friendly individuals but also a host of villains that include rude and dominating elf lords, arrogant paladins and a demon lord that’s more cute than dangerous.But one things for certain there’s never going to be a dull moment for Diablo and his friends as they embark on an adventure that will see them face anything from an elf army to squad of arrogant paladins who won’t know evil even if it hits them in the head. Joining Diablo in this hilarious and wacky adventure is a host of characters that include the intelligent and logical Pantherian Rem, the ditzy but overly cheerful Elf Shera and the polite and caring imperial knight Alicia. As they travel together and bond with each other Diablo realizes that while the world may be different the bonds of friendship and trust that are formed between them is no less real and that by traveling together Diablo may yet be able to overcome his inner nervousness that keeps him from interacting with others in the real world.DiabloDiablo voiced by new voice actor Masaaki Mizunaka is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A human from the real world by the name of Takuma Sakamoto that was summoned to this world in his avatar form Diablo at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was calm, level-headed and intelligent easily able to determine what had happened when he was summoned. While possessing an air of menace about him in his normal form that gave off an impression of both arrogance and pride Diablo was someone that was actually understanding and considerate of the feelings of others while at the same time possessing the foresight to determine when its time to press the issue and when not to. While a quiet person by nature and indeed someone that is not used to dealing with crowds and people in general due to his status as a Hikamori Diablo was someone that can be seen to value his friends and comrades highly and was very loyal to them and would do his utmost to protect them from harm a fact that is seen clearly in his attempts to protect them from the various threats that they encounter in their adventures. Indeed, it can be seen that Diablo values them highly enough that he will not forgive those that have caused them harm by his unleashing of the scary diablo form which is not just scary but also sinister as well. Despite his menacing appearance and the somewhat arrogant way in which he speaks to others, Diablo is someone that treats others fairly and with respect and that his manner of speech is due to the fact that he’s intent on maintaining his image by roleplaying as a demon lord.  In line with this is Diablo’s dislike of using violence as he believes that it should only be used as a choice of last resort.As the series goes on however and Diablo and co overcome trial after trial Diablo’s personality gradually starts to change.  From the onset, it can be seen that due to Diablo’s Hikamori lifestyle that Diablo is someone that has very limited social skills and as a result had an acute fear of communicating with others and especially those with a degree of power in them as seen in his conversation with Faltra’s lord Galford. At the same time, it can be seen that beneath the surface Diablo is also someone that’s mentally fragile and is deeply afraid of revealing his true vulnerable self to others as Diablo is afraid that by doing so he will not only lose his friends and the bonds that he has forged with them but also be hurt emotionally in the process. From this, it can be seen that Diablo’s demon lord persona while a way for him to show a confident and powerful persona to others also serves to act as a shield that protects his vulnerable inner heart from the strong emotional trauma that caused him to become a Hikamori in the first place. While very glad of the demon lord persona that become an integral part of Diablo’s life this as the series goes on begins to change as a result of discovering the kinds of joy that come from not just forming friendships with like-minded people but also adventuring with them which caused within him a curious desire to maybe one day be able to talk to the others normally a desire that showed just how much the friendships that he has formed has affected his personality. Despite Diablo’s fear of speaking with strangers it can be seen that Diablo is someone that can be both prideful and inspirational which is shown in how he tried to convince Alicia to be less uptight and his stand to defend to the last the fortress gates from an attack by the fallen general Edelgard in an attempt to show his power as the demon lord to her. A prominent trait of Diablo that I felt took great advantage of the fact that his real-world self was actually inhabiting the body of his game avatar was the contrast between his two selves within the series that took ,the form of inner arguments between his Hikamori side and his demon lord persona something that I felt was interesting as it showed Diablo’s attempts to overcome his true self’s concerns in a way that’s easily visible to the viewer.The character of Diablo I felt was an interesting one that I felt was both well designed and developed with his gradual evolution from someone that was both scared and reluctant to forge bonds with others and show his true feelings to someone that was not only able to but also developed a determination to protect those that are dear to him being especially well done. I felt that his voice actor Masaaki Mizunaka did a great job in his first main role within the industry and I wish him well in his career.Rem GaleuRem Galeu voiced by new seiyuu Azumi Waki of Toji No Miko fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo’s allies within the series. A female member of the Pantherian demi-human race Rem at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was quiet, intelligent and perceptive and was someone that preferred to make judgments based on facts and knowledge rather than acting on the whim as her friend Shera does. A mage of some ability Rem was someone that can be said to fit the image of an honor student being not just logical but also level-headed and knowledgeable in a wide range of matters. Indeed, it can be seen that Rem was very proud of her abilities as a mage and believed that she will make an excellent adventurer and aspired to prove this to others by joining the guild. While very proud of her abilities Rem was not someone that was arrogant and indeed was someone that was relatively honest and has no problem in praising the ability of others which I felt was a welcome change for a mage type character. While a quiet person by nature Rem was also shown to be someone that was also friendly and kind and will assist her friends and allies readily when needed no matter the odds arrayed against them showing not just her kindness but also her brave and steadfast nature.As the series goes on and Rem’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her rational and calm self Rem is someone that has no shortage of emotional scars within her. At the beginning of the series Rem while noted to have great pride with her ability as a mage was also someone that can be said to be quite stubborn in her determination to always do things her own way and trying the shoulder the burden that comes from it instead of asking for help from her friends. However, this rather than being a result of simple pride is rather a result of a deep-seated fear within her that arises from the unique curse that lies within her. As a result of this unique circumstance it can be seen that Rem’s dislike of a need to ask people for help and her adverse views on friendships and bonds was due to her fear that people would treat her differently if they were to find out her true nature and push her away from them something that Rem has already encountered in the past. Due to this Rem in the beginning was shown to be not just stubborn but also fearful of not just bonding with others but also of forging friendships with others ever conscious of the secret that she’s hiding from the others. Unsurprisingly this meant that in the beginning while having no shortage of people who she can trust Rem was someone that had very few people that she can actually call friends with the notable exceptions being that of Shera. As a result of their inner struggles, it's perhaps unsurprising that Rem and Diablo would not just bond easily but also forge strong friendships with each other due to the fact that both while acting tough on the outside were mentally fragile in the inside. While initially wary of Diablo much like Shera Rem was not just surprised at how caring and perceptive that Diablo was but also how despite the fact that her secret was known to him that Diablo not only accepted this but also treated her no differently than before and staying by her side unlike others who would have left her.As a result of this Rem’s attitude towards Diablo changed considerably becoming one of the few people that she can place her trust in and like Shera causing her to develop feelings for him. As a result of their shared fears of the cast Rem is perhaps one of the few that can perceive Diablo’s inner turmoil and as a result, when she notices this she can be seen to try hard to understand his concerns and try to cheer him up too often amusing results. Apart from Diablo Shera is perhaps Rem’s closest friend and while the two are often seen arguing with each other they are shown to be relatively close and indeed their relationship is so good in that Rem is able to easily determine when something is bothering her and when its time to step in showing that beneath her stand-offish nature Rem is also someone that can care deeply about her friends and the choices that they make in life.The character of Rem I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. The evolution of her character from someone that while proud and confident of her abilities was unexpectedly fragile, lonely and trusts slowly to one that learns to appreciate the advantages that friendships, trust, and honesty brings to her I felt was something that was well done. Seeing the usually quiet and logical Rem try her best to bond with Diablo and the cast I felt was a great indication of just how much Rem has developed in the course of the series. I felt that her seiyuu Azumi Waki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Rem.Shera L GreenwoodShera L Greenwood played by veteran seiyuu singer Yuu Serizawa of 3D Kanojo Girl and Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo’s allies within the series. A member of the Elf demi-human race Shera at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was positive, cheerful and fun-loving and was someone that was carefree by her very nature. True to her fun-loving nature Shera was someone that possessed a joking personality and as a result, was seen to be easily able to forge bonds with others due to her friendly nature. However, despite her excitable nature Shera was also shown to be relatively perceptive and cautious easily able to determine when someone is approaching them with ill intent on account of her race-specific abilities. At the same time while a kind person by nature it can be seen that Shera also has a serious side to her character that’s not just competitive but also tenacious and determined a side that I felt complemented her default personality relatively well.As the series goes on and as Shera’s personality is expanded upon Shera’s personality gradually changes as a result of the events that she and her friends encounter and overcome in their adventures. While a carefree, friendly and teasing person in the beginning that acted as she had not a care in the world it can be seen that beneath this Shera like Rem has no shortage of mental scars that she tries hard to hide from the others. As a result of her unique backstory it can be seen that Shera despite being born into a life that most adventurers could only dream off was one that viewed it with disdain and instead of wanting to return to that life instead aspires to not just become independent off it but also strong enough to stand on her own without having to rely on them which shows not just her strong will to succeed at her chosen task but also her determination to overcome her past trauma an aspect that I felt matched well with both her personality and her inner struggles. At the beginning of the series of the series, Shera like Rem saw Diablo as their summon and as a result was dismayed by the fact that not only did he managed to reflect the spell was supposed to have bounded him but also caused her and Rem to become his slaves instead. While Shera in the beginning only saw Diablo was someone akin to a temporary master that she can easily seduce with her assets this view of hers began to change as she began to see Diablo’s true nature and the fact that despite being his slave Diablo treated both she and Rem with not just respect but also kindness and loyalty something that Shera was not used to experiencing and as a result her attitude towards him began to change. As their adventures continued and Shera began to appreciate not just the powerful magical and combat abilities that Diablo possessed but also of how kind he was as a person Shera gradually realized that she had begun to see Diablo and Rem as her first dear friends and that continuing to hide her true feelings from them would mean that she does not trust them despite the kindness that they have shown her an aspect that is shown well when Shera gets caught up in her brother’s scheme to bring her back to the kingdom.The character of Shera I felt was a character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a positive and cheerful girl that didn’t take things seriously to one that was not just determined to forge her own path in life but also determined to protect her first true friends in her life being especially well done. I felt that her seiyuu Yuu Serizawa did an excellent job at voicing the character of Shera.AliciaAlicia Cristela voiced by veteran seiyuu Yumi Hara of Log Horizon and the Idolmaster fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo’s many acquaintances within the series. A young woman that’s in her late teens and a rare female member of the vaunted imperial knights Alicia at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was polite, confident and kind and was someone that was both considerate to the feelings of others and caring to their needs. In a way, it can be said that Alicia was the ideal image of an imperial knight as she wasn’t just kind but also diligent, level-headed and approached her role with great determination and treated any mistakes that she makes harshly a view that is shared by a great many people within the series including Diablo.As can be expected of an imperial knight Alicia was someone that didn’t just have excellent communication skills that Diablo lacked but was also someone that displayed her feelings openly and as a result, she was someone that can be said to keep Diablo on his toes a task that she excelled at. However, despite her seemingly professional nature it can be seen that Alicia is someone that isn’t too honest with her feelings and needs and indeed is someone that can get embarrassed quite easily in denying them until it becomes too obvious to others such as her feeling hungry and not revealing it till the last minute something that I felt was quite funny and added in a sort of a childish side to her character and made her endearing in my eyes. While holding the role of an imperial knight a role that is not just highly respected within the kingdom but also feared it can be seen that Alicia is not someone that cares a great deal about her status as a knight but more of the fact that she can use that role to defend her friends and innocents from harm. While a cheerful and positive young woman it can be surprising to see that despite these qualities Alicia is someone that has few opportunities to make real friends and as a result bonding with Diablo and the girls was something that was new to both of them something that I felt was both interesting and also funny to see the latter due to the awkwardness that Alicia showed when trying to bond with the cast.As the series goes on and Alicia’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Alicia is someone that has more than one side to her personality a side that I felt was quite surprising. As a result of the training that Alicia was put through in her training to become an imperial knight she was taught that all fallen, demi-humans and demons were enemies or at least beings that were not trustworthy and it was a view that had sustained her and powered her through her career as a knight becoming the prime motivation for her public face. However, despite that this view of hers becomes challenged after she encounters and befriends Diablo and co as part of her duties and even more so when she saw that contrary to her teachings Diablo despite being a demon lord was someone that was not just kind and caring to everyone that he meets but also someone that preferred to use diplomacy to settle matters and only use violence as a last resort. This is further reinforced by the shock that she received when the demon lord Klem was released from her prison as compared to Diablo she was much more radically different.These twin shocks to Alicia’s psych while causing her great confusion also eventually contributed greatly to awakening within Alicia her true persona that she had so far kept suppressed and hidden within her mind one that was radically different to her public face. Alicia’s true face that was revealed due to the twin shocks was one that can be said to be the complete opposite of that her public role as an imperial knight as here rather than viewing demons and fallen with hatred she instead views them with something akin to admiration. At the same time Alicia’s core traits of kindness, politeness and her caring nature towards her friends is replaced by one that is deceitful, malicious and manipulative and showing a fearful determination to get to her goal by any means necessary even if it meant betraying her friends and allies that she so valued in the past. This radical change of her character I felt was something that was both unexpected and interesting as it essentially made her an enemy to not just Diablo and co but also to the very role that she was supposed to be loyal to. The character of Alicia I felt was a well designed and developed character whose evolution from an ideal imperial knight that was both kind, caring and loyal to her friends to someone that was both deceitful and manipulative and willing to betray her friends in order to achieve her goals that were counter to those of her role I felt was really well thought out. I felt that her seiyuu Yumi Hara really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Alicia.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the designs for the main and supporting characters within the series were well designed and remained faithful to their source material. In particular I felt that the clothing that was worn by the main cast did a great job of showcasing not just the races that their characters belong too but also their professions and personalities as well with notable examples being Diablo’s demonic cloak and armor set that was supposed to convey authority, Shera’s outfit which conveyed freedom and Rem’s more subdued outfit that was supposed to convey logic but at the same time allow her to blend in more. The various settings and locale that the cast visit within the series I felt was also well designed with the setting doing a good job of conveying to the viewer and to Diablo that while this world may be similar to the game world it was not that world by having a contrast of a comfortable medieval and fantasy style town with a harsh and unforgiving world of cruelty and harshness that lie beyond its walls. In terms of combat animation, I felt that the many fights within the series whether its small scale duals between Diablo and human opponents and Diablo’s fight against monsters was pretty well done with the fights being not just well designed but also unpredictable in terms of battle events and outcomes something that I felt kept me on my toes throughout the series and making each fight more interesting than I thought with notable examples being Diablo’s defense of the fortress from the fallen and Edelgard, the dual with Galford and the fight against Shera’s brothers summon. This was helped greatly within the series by the large number of spells and magic effects that were present within the series that had the effect of making each fight much more impressive visually.Music wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Decide which was sung by Summoners 2+ a voice unit formed by Yuu Serizawa, Azumi Waki, Yumi Hara, Rumi Ookubo and Emiri Katou who voiced the characters of Shera, Rem, Alicia, Sylvie and Edelgard and Saiaku na hi demo Anata ga Suki which was by Shera’s seiyuu Yuu Serizawa. Both of these songs I felt were strong ones with the former doing a good job of creating a sense of anticipation for the series as we wait to see what Diablo and his friends get up to while the latter conveyed a sense of farewell and a promise to tune in again next episode. The series OST I felt did a great job of providing strong background music to the many different types of scenes within the series. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Masaaki Mizunaka, Yuu Serizawa, Azumi Waki and Yumi Hara all did an excellent job in portraying their assigned characters which were Diablo, Shera, Rem and Alicia respectively. Additionally, while I didn’t cover them within this review I also felt that Rumi Ookubo, Emiri Katou, Sayaka Senbongi, Atsumi Tanezaki, and Akio Ootsuka also did a great job of portraying the supporting cast of Sylvie, Edelgard, Celestine, Klem and Galford respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo, no Dorei Majutsu was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strong points being its interesting premise, well-designed story, well designed and developed characters, interesting fights, strong voice acting and an interesting fusion of comedy, fantasy and ecchi genre’s that actually works.The overall premise of the series which is of a character from the real world being transported to another world is one that’s already well-trodden. However rather than mimicking what other series have already done so by transporting the real person in their real body to the world the series changes this formula and makes use of its own unique take on it by instead transporting the mc into the world as a character that’s he’s most familiar with which is the character that the main character has spent years painstaking creating in another game. This itself I felt was interesting because unlike the outer self that the mc is seen with by the inhabitants of this world the mc’s true self that’s hidden behind the outer shell is one that can be seen to have a totally different personality and indeed is one that is a direct contrast to the outer self. This contrast of the inner demon king that’s indecisive and easily scared with his outer self that's confident and menacing was something that I thought the series used really well as it allowed the main character to not just overcome his own inner weakness of being quiet and unsociable but also mask this development by projecting his confident and menacing self to his friends and to his enemies to both inspire and frighten something that was used effectively when paired with the series story. At the same time, this also lent itself to a number of noteworthy comedy moments that were used to both progress the plot but show this development of Diablo’s character with a good example being Diablo’s mismatch of tones when addressing people. The overall story of the series I felt was surprisingly well thought out as it not just made great use of comedy, fantasy and ecchi moments but also weaved this into a number of story arcs that were not just interesting but populated by some pretty designed villains that were not simply one dimensional and had some surprising traits to them that made them stand out with notable examples being Galford the lord of Faltra, Saddler the most arrogant paladin I ever seen and Klem the demon lord that’s more cute than dangerous.Overall Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu was an anime that I found to be really entertaining and one that made great use of its unique premise, story, well designed and developed characters and rare fusion of various genre’s that’s rarely used together. As a final score, I would say that Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu easily deserves a final score of 10/10. combat strength that he’s been given the title demon lord by others were to be summoned to a world that looks remarkably like his game world. But rather than being summoned in his real-life self the player is instead summoned in the form of his avatar the self-proclaimed demon lord Diablo whose overwhelming magic and high-grade items soon turns the tables on the summoners who had wanted to enslave him who in turn is enslaved instead. Now finding himself in a world that looks exactly like that of the game that the player has been playing Diablo must not only come to grips with the fact that his real self was now his game self but also that he now has two beautiful and cute demi-humans as his slave's thanks to their reflected magic.The premise of having a main character be summoned or dragged into another world is not anything that’s rare within the anime world given the number of animes that make use of it. However, I felt that the premise that was used in this case which was the mc being summoned to another world inside the body of his own avatar was one that I felt was a unique take on the premise as it made use of the unique relationship that exists between a player’s avatar and their real-life self. The first episode of the series I felt did an excellent job of not just introducing the main characters of the series but also introduce us to the world in which the mc is summoned too and left a pretty good impression on me enough in that I decided to stick with it till the end of the series.Taking place within a world that greatly resembles medieval Europe is a world that is populated by all sorts of fantasy races where humans are but one race among many and while each race has their own culture and beliefs all aspire to be able to live a life where they can freely choose how they live. While tensions between the races are high and discrimination of races is rampant each side tries their best to maintain the peace that exists between the races and work together to survive in a world that’s rife with demon lords and dangerous fallen that live beyond the city’s borders. The overall story of the series follows the adventures of Diablo a human player who finds himself being transported from his game world to another world that looks remarkably like that of his former world  thanks to the summoning ritual that was enacted by two demi-humans who had intended to use him as their servant by enslaving him with a bounding spell. However, as a result of Diablo’s innate magic reflection ability this spell is instead reflected and results in the tables being turned on the summoners who become his servants instead.  As a result of not just trying to find a way back to his home and also find a way to release the slave collars that bind their necks Diablo is soon forced to embark on a wacky adventure that will see him not just inspire fear in others by acting like his character but also loyalty and respect as he encounters not just friendly individuals but also a host of villains that include rude and dominating elf lords, arrogant paladins and a demon lord that’s more cute than dangerous.But one things for certain there’s never going to be a dull moment for Diablo and his friends as they embark on an adventure that will see them face anything from an elf army to squad of arrogant paladins who won’t know evil even if it hits them in the head. Joining Diablo in this hilarious and wacky adventure is a host of characters that include the intelligent and logical Pantherian Rem, the ditzy but overly cheerful Elf Shera and the polite and caring imperial knight Alicia. As they travel together and bond with each other Diablo realizes that while the world may be different the bonds of friendship and trust that are formed between them is no less real and that by traveling together Diablo may yet be able to overcome his inner nervousness that keeps him from interacting with others in the real world.DiabloDiablo voiced by new voice actor Masaaki Mizunaka is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A human from the real world by the name of Takuma Sakamoto that was summoned to this world in his avatar form Diablo at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was calm, level-headed and intelligent easily able to determine what had happened when he was summoned. While possessing an air of menace about him in his normal form that gave off an impression of both arrogance and pride Diablo was someone that was actually understanding and considerate of the feelings of others while at the same time possessing the foresight to determine when its time to press the issue and when not to. While a quiet person by nature and indeed someone that is not used to dealing with crowds and people in general due to his status as a Hikamori Diablo was someone that can be seen to value his friends and comrades highly and was very loyal to them and would do his utmost to protect them from harm a fact that is seen clearly in his attempts to protect them from the various threats that they encounter in their adventures. Indeed, it can be seen that Diablo values them highly enough that he will not forgive those that have caused them harm by his unleashing of the scary diablo form which is not just scary but also sinister as well. Despite his menacing appearance and the somewhat arrogant way in which he speaks to others, Diablo is someone that treats others fairly and with respect and that his manner of speech is due to the fact that he’s intent on maintaining his image by roleplaying as a demon lord.  In line with this is Diablo’s dislike of using violence as he believes that it should only be used as a choice of last resort.As the series goes on however and Diablo and co overcome trial after trial Diablo’s personality gradually starts to change.  From the onset, it can be seen that due to Diablo’s Hikamori lifestyle that Diablo is someone that has very limited social skills and as a result had an acute fear of communicating with others and especially those with a degree of power in them as seen in his conversation with Faltra’s lord Galford. At the same time, it can be seen that beneath the surface Diablo is also someone that’s mentally fragile and is deeply afraid of revealing his true vulnerable self to others as Diablo is afraid that by doing so he will not only lose his friends and the bonds that he has forged with them but also be hurt emotionally in the process. From this, it can be seen that Diablo’s demon lord persona while a way for him to show a confident and powerful persona to others also serves to act as a shield that protects his vulnerable inner heart from the strong emotional trauma that caused him to become a Hikamori in the first place. While very glad of the demon lord persona that become an integral part of Diablo’s life this as the series goes on begins to change as a result of discovering the kinds of joy that come from not just forming friendships with like-minded people but also adventuring with them which caused within him a curious desire to maybe one day be able to talk to the others normally a desire that showed just how much the friendships that he has formed has affected his personality. Despite Diablo’s fear of speaking with strangers it can be seen that Diablo is someone that can be both prideful and inspirational which is shown in how he tried to convince Alicia to be less uptight and his stand to defend to the last the fortress gates from an attack by the fallen general Edelgard in an attempt to show his power as the demon lord to her. A prominent trait of Diablo that I felt took great advantage of the fact that his real-world self was actually inhabiting the body of his game avatar was the contrast between his two selves within the series that took ,the form of inner arguments between his Hikamori side and his demon lord persona something that I felt was interesting as it showed Diablo’s attempts to overcome his true self’s concerns in a way that’s easily visible to the viewer.The character of Diablo I felt was an interesting one that I felt was both well designed and developed with his gradual evolution from someone that was both scared and reluctant to forge bonds with others and show his true feelings to someone that was not only able to but also developed a determination to protect those that are dear to him being especially well done. I felt that his voice actor Masaaki Mizunaka did a great job in his first main role within the industry and I wish him well in his career.Rem GaleuRem Galeu voiced by new seiyuu Azumi Waki of Toji No Miko fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo’s allies within the series. A female member of the Pantherian demi-human race Rem at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was quiet, intelligent and perceptive and was someone that preferred to make judgments based on facts and knowledge rather than acting on the whim as her friend Shera does. A mage of some ability Rem was someone that can be said to fit the image of an honor student being not just logical but also level-headed and knowledgeable in a wide range of matters. Indeed, it can be seen that Rem was very proud of her abilities as a mage and believed that she will make an excellent adventurer and aspired to prove this to others by joining the guild. While very proud of her abilities Rem was not someone that was arrogant and indeed was someone that was relatively honest and has no problem in praising the ability of others which I felt was a welcome change for a mage type character. While a quiet person by nature Rem was also shown to be someone that was also friendly and kind and will assist her friends and allies readily when needed no matter the odds arrayed against them showing not just her kindness but also her brave and steadfast nature.As the series goes on and Rem’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her rational and calm self Rem is someone that has no shortage of emotional scars within her. At the beginning of the series Rem while noted to have great pride with her ability as a mage was also someone that can be said to be quite stubborn in her determination to always do things her own way and trying the shoulder the burden that comes from it instead of asking for help from her friends. However, this rather than being a result of simple pride is rather a result of a deep-seated fear within her that arises from the unique curse that lies within her. As a result of this unique circumstance it can be seen that Rem’s dislike of a need to ask people for help and her adverse views on friendships and bonds was due to her fear that people would treat her differently if they were to find out her true nature and push her away from them something that Rem has already encountered in the past. Due to this Rem in the beginning was shown to be not just stubborn but also fearful of not just bonding with others but also of forging friendships with others ever conscious of the secret that she’s hiding from the others. Unsurprisingly this meant that in the beginning while having no shortage of people who she can trust Rem was someone that had very few people that she can actually call friends with the notable exceptions being that of Shera. As a result of their inner struggles, it's perhaps unsurprising that Rem and Diablo would not just bond easily but also forge strong friendships with each other due to the fact that both while acting tough on the outside were mentally fragile in the inside. While initially wary of Diablo much like Shera Rem was not just surprised at how caring and perceptive that Diablo was but also how despite the fact that her secret was known to him that Diablo not only accepted this but also treated her no differently than before and staying by her side unlike others who would have left her.As a result of this Rem’s attitude towards Diablo changed considerably becoming one of the few people that she can place her trust in and like Shera causing her to develop feelings for him. As a result of their shared fears of the cast Rem is perhaps one of the few that can perceive Diablo’s inner turmoil and as a result, when she notices this she can be seen to try hard to understand his concerns and try to cheer him up too often amusing results. Apart from Diablo Shera is perhaps Rem’s closest friend and while the two are often seen arguing with each other they are shown to be relatively close and indeed their relationship is so good in that Rem is able to easily determine when something is bothering her and when its time to step in showing that beneath her stand-offish nature Rem is also someone that can care deeply about her friends and the choices that they make in life.The character of Rem I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. The evolution of her character from someone that while proud and confident of her abilities was unexpectedly fragile, lonely and trusts slowly to one that learns to appreciate the advantages that friendships, trust, and honesty brings to her I felt was something that was well done. Seeing the usually quiet and logical Rem try her best to bond with Diablo and the cast I felt was a great indication of just how much Rem has developed in the course of the series. I felt that her seiyuu Azumi Waki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Rem.Shera L GreenwoodShera L Greenwood played by veteran seiyuu singer Yuu Serizawa of 3D Kanojo Girl and Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo’s allies within the series. A member of the Elf demi-human race Shera at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was positive, cheerful and fun-loving and was someone that was carefree by her very nature. True to her fun-loving nature Shera was someone that possessed a joking personality and as a result, was seen to be easily able to forge bonds with others due to her friendly nature. However, despite her excitable nature Shera was also shown to be relatively perceptive and cautious easily able to determine when someone is approaching them with ill intent on account of her race-specific abilities. At the same time while a kind person by nature it can be seen that Shera also has a serious side to her character that’s not just competitive but also tenacious and determined a side that I felt complemented her default personality relatively well.As the series goes on and as Shera’s personality is expanded upon Shera’s personality gradually changes as a result of the events that she and her friends encounter and overcome in their adventures. While a carefree, friendly and teasing person in the beginning that acted as she had not a care in the world it can be seen that beneath this Shera like Rem has no shortage of mental scars that she tries hard to hide from the others. As a result of her unique backstory it can be seen that Shera despite being born into a life that most adventurers could only dream off was one that viewed it with disdain and instead of wanting to return to that life instead aspires to not just become independent off it but also strong enough to stand on her own without having to rely on them which shows not just her strong will to succeed at her chosen task but also her determination to overcome her past trauma an aspect that I felt matched well with both her personality and her inner struggles. At the beginning of the series of the series, Shera like Rem saw Diablo as their summon and as a result was dismayed by the fact that not only did he managed to reflect the spell was supposed to have bounded him but also caused her and Rem to become his slaves instead. While Shera in the beginning only saw Diablo was someone akin to a temporary master that she can easily seduce with her assets this view of hers began to change as she began to see Diablo’s true nature and the fact that despite being his slave Diablo treated both she and Rem with not just respect but also kindness and loyalty something that Shera was not used to experiencing and as a result her attitude towards him began to change. As their adventures continued and Shera began to appreciate not just the powerful magical and combat abilities that Diablo possessed but also of how kind he was as a person Shera gradually realized that she had begun to see Diablo and Rem as her first dear friends and that continuing to hide her true feelings from them would mean that she does not trust them despite the kindness that they have shown her an aspect that is shown well when Shera gets caught up in her brother’s scheme to bring her back to the kingdom.The character of Shera I felt was a character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a positive and cheerful girl that didn’t take things seriously to one that was not just determined to forge her own path in life but also determined to protect her first true friends in her life being especially well done. I felt that her seiyuu Yuu Serizawa did an excellent job at voicing the character of Shera.AliciaAlicia Cristela voiced by veteran seiyuu Yumi Hara of Log Horizon and the Idolmaster fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo’s many acquaintances within the series. A young woman that’s in her late teens and a rare female member of the vaunted imperial knights Alicia at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was polite, confident and kind and was someone that was both considerate to the feelings of others and caring to their needs. In a way, it can be said that Alicia was the ideal image of an imperial knight as she wasn’t just kind but also diligent, level-headed and approached her role with great determination and treated any mistakes that she makes harshly a view that is shared by a great many people within the series including Diablo.As can be expected of an imperial knight Alicia was someone that didn’t just have excellent communication skills that Diablo lacked but was also someone that displayed her feelings openly and as a result, she was someone that can be said to keep Diablo on his toes a task that she excelled at. However, despite her seemingly professional nature it can be seen that Alicia is someone that isn’t too honest with her feelings and needs and indeed is someone that can get embarrassed quite easily in denying them until it becomes too obvious to others such as her feeling hungry and not revealing it till the last minute something that I felt was quite funny and added in a sort of a childish side to her character and made her endearing in my eyes. While holding the role of an imperial knight a role that is not just highly respected within the kingdom but also feared it can be seen that Alicia is not someone that cares a great deal about her status as a knight but more of the fact that she can use that role to defend her friends and innocents from harm. While a cheerful and positive young woman it can be surprising to see that despite these qualities Alicia is someone that has few opportunities to make real friends and as a result bonding with Diablo and the girls was something that was new to both of them something that I felt was both interesting and also funny to see the latter due to the awkwardness that Alicia showed when trying to bond with the cast.As the series goes on and Alicia’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Alicia is someone that has more than one side to her personality a side that I felt was quite surprising. As a result of the training that Alicia was put through in her training to become an imperial knight she was taught that all fallen, demi-humans and demons were enemies or at least beings that were not trustworthy and it was a view that had sustained her and powered her through her career as a knight becoming the prime motivation for her public face. However, despite that this view of hers becomes challenged after she encounters and befriends Diablo and co as part of her duties and even more so when she saw that contrary to her teachings Diablo despite being a demon lord was someone that was not just kind and caring to everyone that he meets but also someone that preferred to use diplomacy to settle matters and only use violence as a last resort. This is further reinforced by the shock that she received when the demon lord Klem was released from her prison as compared to Diablo she was much more radically different.These twin shocks to Alicia’s psych while causing her great confusion also eventually contributed greatly to awakening within Alicia her true persona that she had so far kept suppressed and hidden within her mind one that was radically different to her public face. Alicia’s true face that was revealed due to the twin shocks was one that can be said to be the complete opposite of that her public role as an imperial knight as here rather than viewing demons and fallen with hatred she instead views them with something akin to admiration. At the same time Alicia’s core traits of kindness, politeness and her caring nature towards her friends is replaced by one that is deceitful, malicious and manipulative and showing a fearful determination to get to her goal by any means necessary even if it meant betraying her friends and allies that she so valued in the past. This radical change of her character I felt was something that was both unexpected and interesting as it essentially made her an enemy to not just Diablo and co but also to the very role that she was supposed to be loyal to. The character of Alicia I felt was a well designed and developed character whose evolution from an ideal imperial knight that was both kind, caring and loyal to her friends to someone that was both deceitful and manipulative and willing to betray her friends in order to achieve her goals that were counter to those of her role I felt was really well thought out. I felt that her seiyuu Yumi Hara really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Alicia.AMVAnimation wise I felt that the designs for the main and supporting characters within the series were well designed and remained faithful to their source material. In particular I felt that the clothing that was worn by the main cast did a great job of showcasing not just the races that their characters belong too but also their professions and personalities as well with notable examples being Diablo’s demonic cloak and armor set that was supposed to convey authority, Shera’s outfit which conveyed freedom and Rem’s more subdued outfit that was supposed to convey logic but at the same time allow her to blend in more. The various settings and locale that the cast visit within the series I felt was also well designed with the setting doing a good job of conveying to the viewer and to Diablo that while this world may be similar to the game world it was not that world by having a contrast of a comfortable medieval and fantasy style town with a harsh and unforgiving world of cruelty and harshness that lie beyond its walls. In terms of combat animation, I felt that the many fights within the series whether its small scale duals between Diablo and human opponents and Diablo’s fight against monsters was pretty well done with the fights being not just well designed but also unpredictable in terms of battle events and outcomes something that I felt kept me on my toes throughout the series and making each fight more interesting than I thought with notable examples being Diablo’s defense of the fortress from the fallen and Edelgard, the dual with Galford and the fight against Shera’s brothers summon. This was helped greatly within the series by the large number of spells and magic effects that were present within the series that had the effect of making each fight much more impressive visually.Music wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Decide which was sung by Summoners 2+ a voice unit formed by Yuu Serizawa, Azumi Waki, Yumi Hara, Rumi Ookubo and Emiri Katou who voiced the characters of Shera, Rem, Alicia, Sylvie and Edelgard and Saiaku na hi demo Anata ga Suki which was by Shera’s seiyuu Yuu Serizawa. Both of these songs I felt were strong ones with the former doing a good job of creating a sense of anticipation for the series as we wait to see what Diablo and his friends get up to while the latter conveyed a sense of farewell and a promise to tune in again next episode. The series OST I felt did a great job of providing strong background music to the many different types of scenes within the series. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Masaaki Mizunaka, Yuu Serizawa, Azumi Waki and Yumi Hara all did an excellent job in portraying their assigned characters which were Diablo, Shera, Rem and Alicia respectively. Additionally, while I didn’t cover them within this review I also felt that Rumi Ookubo, Emiri Katou, Sayaka Senbongi, Atsumi Tanezaki, and Akio Ootsuka also did a great job of portraying the supporting cast of Sylvie, Edelgard, Celestine, Klem and Galford respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo, no Dorei Majutsu was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strong points being its interesting premise, well-designed story, well designed and developed characters, interesting fights, strong voice acting and an interesting fusion of comedy, fantasy and ecchi genre’s that actually works.The overall premise of the series which is of a character from the real world being transported to another world is one that’s already well-trodden. However rather than mimicking what other series have already done so by transporting the real person in their real body to the world the series changes this formula and makes use of its own unique take on it by instead transporting the mc into the world as a character that’s he’s most familiar with which is the character that the main character has spent years painstaking creating in another game. This itself I felt was interesting because unlike the outer self that the mc is seen with by the inhabitants of this world the mc’s true self that’s hidden behind the outer shell is one that can be seen to have a totally different personality and indeed is one that is a direct contrast to the outer self. This contrast of the inner demon king that’s indecisive and easily scared with his outer self that's confident and menacing was something that I thought the series used really well as it allowed the main character to not just overcome his own inner weakness of being quiet and unsociable but also mask this development by projecting his confident and menacing self to his friends and to his enemies to both inspire and frighten something that was used effectively when paired with the series story. At the same time, this also lent itself to a number of noteworthy comedy moments that were used to both progress the plot but show this development of Diablo’s character with a good example being Diablo’s mismatch of tones when addressing people. The overall story of the series I felt was surprisingly well thought out as it not just made great use of comedy, fantasy and ecchi moments but also weaved this into a number of story arcs that were not just interesting but populated by some pretty designed villains that were not simply one dimensional and had some surprising traits to them that made them stand out with notable examples being Galford the lord of Faltra, Saddler the most arrogant paladin I ever seen and Klem the demon lord that’s more cute than dangerous.Overall Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu was an anime that I found to be really entertaining and one that made great use of its unique premise, story, well designed and developed characters and rare fusion of various genre’s that’s rarely used together. As a final score, I would say that Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu easily deserves a final score of 10/10."", 'There\'s not much to say about this show, as I and many others have already repeated the same criticism and made similar reviews for these Isekai shows. Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu, like any other Isekai show, consists of a main character who has been transported, or rather in this occasion, ""summoned"" into a fantasy world.Isekai Maou, like Overlord, SAO, and Log Horizon, takes place in what originally was a gaming world. The main character, who was a powerful gamer at the time, is placed in this world in his game avatar.The story is nothing new, just another ridiculously over powered main...character who claims to be the ""Demon King"" or Maou- Sama. And like any other isekai MC, he has some girls that follow him through his adventures.My greatest criticism to all isekai shows including this one is how little the show has to offer to the audience other than fanservice and some epic moments. No morals, no main theme, just a powerful main character who beats anyone who stands in his way. It\'s a show that once the audience has finished watching, is cast away and forgotten in the box of many other isekai shows. Of course, there are those rare moments when a isekai anime gets extremely popular, as aforementioned, but even they have at least one theme or lesson that can be discussed about. In other words, this show lacks depth in both its characters and story.Isekai Maou, although is overly cliched and lacks much depth in its story, still  retains some of the qualities that still keep it ""entertaining"". As aforementioned, Isekai Maou has an over-powered character and some nice fanservice, which are many people\'s guilty pleasures. So while the story or characters are not so great, it\'s still enjoyable to watch.Overall the art is decent and the sound isn\'t so bad although the OP song is quite forgettable.

That is not to say I dislike the show, I like it, but I still can't understand how people like this and dislike SAO. SAO is not my topic now so I'll just get into the review.The story is not anything mindblowing, but I do not necessarily dislike it. MC gets transferred to another world, battles some monsters, saves some girls, meets a loli demon....It's not exactly linear, but more like divided into arcs. Usually, I rate any story a 7. The more plotholes and fuck ups and stupidity it has, the rating goes down.The more it impresses me, the higher the rating goes. This story didn't fuck itself up and neither did it impress me, so the story wasn't affected and I don't have any issues with it, so it's enjoyable and watchable. There's fanservice nearly at the end of every episode which may or may not appeal to you, but it was just a treat personally.Diablo is your OP isekai MC which everyone hates, but surprisingly everyone likes him here. I have to say he's pretty cool though, with his double personality and all. OP MCs are only a problem if they destroy the point of the show (I'm looking at you Hellsing), but he was the highlight of the show. His voice actor was very reminiscent of Ono Daisuke, but at the same time, he was able to pull off the more realistic persona, which is praiseworthy. His voice was really remarkable and I'm hoping to see him in other shows. I was surprised by the number of supporters Rem has, she was a flat loli neko, and it's easy to fool weebs with nekos. Her personality is as flat as her chest, that is until later episodes when she grows to have a slightly cold, but caring, cute side to her. Shera is the better girl, also cute and all, but she's like the cheerful one, and she has oppai. No complaints. Side lolis and loli demon lord aren't that bad either. The girls don't have striking personalities, but I mean, when did weebs ever hate cute 2D girls?For a studio that I have never heard of, the art was very consistent and visually appealing. Character designs are good, with nice flashy colors, and smoothly animated fights, and all that crap. Soundtracks aren't very memorable but they're fitting of the isekai theme and I really like OST or sound effects that make you feel like you're inside the game yourself.Another isekai anime has descended following the same tropes of its predecessors.

But it\'s a better animated and directed than the most average harem fare like High School DxD so it\'s at least watchable.Now that the obligatory numbers are out of the way lets get to the interesting part so that the people who actually had the patience to read this dumb review get something out of it.The anime, while otherwise being very standard has two themes that...it explores very often. First is the act of using a persona. No not the magical djinn like psychic beings from Shin Megami Tensei, persona as in the fake role people play in society. The main character is an utter wimp in real life. But in another world, he practically roleplays as the cocky ""Demon Lord"". Even though in his head he\'s completely incapable of functional communication. The elf girl is a busty, airhead who\'s cheerful all the time.

In this series slavery is more akin to what it was during the Golden Age in our world. Slaves aren\'t treated badly by most but are still considered a second class citizen. However like it was in real life, multiple characters are shown to be better off as slaves. The series ends with two girls convincing a per-pubecent girl the fun things about being a slave. That really creeped me out. And that\'s the show. Everything else is like every other Isekai anime you\'ve seen. it explores very often. First is the act of using a persona. No not the magical djinn like psychic beings from Shin Megami Tensei, persona as in the fake role people play in society. The main character is an utter wimp in real life. But in another world, he practically roleplays as the cocky ""Demon Lord"". Even though in his head he\'s completely incapable of functional communication.

But ya know even if it is the same shit, they didn\'t ended it with a harem in the helm, rather they end it with the MC with his two bitches. Here we see the other harem member going their own way and the original two ends up with  their own master, though there were...some ecchi moments it was kinda nice that it was limited to a panchira and as much as I find it annoying most of the panchira moment was with Shera, frankly she basically represents the white panty party, while Rem was more for the black panty party, now don\'t be expecting any nipples from Shera here nor anybody else, cu\'z that\'s what the uncensored version wasm. just more on Shera.

I\'ve seen that they have made quite a few new anime in the past few years but none caught my eye until this one. They have always had a bit of a ecchi comedy feel to their shows but no substance....This once caught my attention because of the light novel that the story draws from and the highly appealing animation.The Story:The story starts out  explaining an a world in an MMORPG Cross Reverie, Sakamoto Takuma plays a OP character that is called a ""demon Lord"" named Diablo. We see a little insight that this kid obviously is your typical gamer nerd who has many of hours wacking away (tehe) at the keyboard to become one of the most powerful players int he whole game.He quickly wakes up to find he has woken up in a world that is Exactly like Cross Reverie, where he himself is now Diablo. Summoned by  two girls, the Patherain Rem and the Elf Shera Greenwood who wanted to use him to go on higher level adventures and possibly save Rem from the Demon Lord who is sealed inside her. No biggie. Except the enslavement spell that they used on Diablo was reversed and now they have collars around their necks. That is not even mentioning that Shera is an Elvin princess that has apparently ran away from home and is being chased down by her brother the king.Ok so I\'d like to quickly address what everyone thinks when they see an mmorpg anime lately, and that is that its like Overlord.  Contrary to popular belief .Hack was the first and Sword Art Online is fairly recent as well. I wouldn\'t compare this show to just Overlord because to be frank, they have the similar plot of someone in the real world being thrown into a game and are op as hell. I will say that how not to Summon a Demon Lord is unique int that it has the bit of comedy and ecchi feel to it. I find it kind of refreshing in a way though because lets face it, that would be how most nerd would react in this type of world.Characters:The show of course isn\'t finished yet but with the high amount of comedy and fanservice I highly doubt we will a deep character development as we see in Overlord. I do think we will see the characters grow together but it will always be because something funny or ecchi happened. We already have the clear tropes so far. Diablo being a nerd pretending to be a demon lord so his social anxiety doesn\'t kill him. Rem is an outcasted girl because she has a monster that can kill everyone inside of her. Which has made her typically cold and serious (well that and the small tits). Shera is a stereotypical big boobed air head who is fun loving and sweet. We really haven\'t seen much of any major developments besides the main character so far but we will see. Although I do love the perverted guild master so far.Animation/Sound:The sound and animation so far have been pretty high up with the current level of modern day animation. The magic and fight scenes have so far been appealing to the eye. This doesn\'t even mention the colorful world they have created and unique races.I will finish this review once the season is completed!

The art has a defined feeling to it, and the animations are pretty decent. For what they lack in some scenes with animation they make up for with good comedic timing. Small movements like a tail flick will set the tone for a scene more than any dialogue ever could. Past this, the characters don\'t really fit into cookie cutter...harem roles. You have a lighthearted but naive elf, a serious cat demi-human who is the more competent, and others who make an appearance. That lack of archetypes like ""tsundere"" or similar recurrences allowed me to take the early show a lot more seriously than I thought was possible.The story suffers from being fairly bland, in that the season centers around an issue Rem is going through. Past that, stuff just kinda happens to them without much rhyme or reason. This lack of narrative is probably what brought the show down the most. While I enjoyed the character interaction, there wasn\'t really a reason why they were doing anything but vague promises and ""the plot demands it"". At least Konosuba sets up the ""Demon General"" early on, and they just bumble their way into different Demon Generals they have to face. This one brings up Rem\'s issue, then puts it away for 8 eps until it\'s needed again. Past that, it resolves it pretty quickly.While for me this was a personal 7, I\'ll put it as a six as I know I\'m viewing it through some rose colored glasses. I wasn\'t expecting this show to grab me but it quickly became my most looked forward to show each week other than Overlord III. If you want something quick, dirty, and moderately comedic, give it a shot. I doubt a S2 will ever happen, but I would be pleasantly surprised if it did. harem roles.

Animation and sound is solid industry strandard so there\'s little to complain about there.It really boils down to not quite being up to par with Konosuba when it comes to comedy (though...the show was not shy of taking a jab at Konosuba\'s ""explooosion"" gag right off the bat) and not quite comparable to the serious story and writing of Overlord. But we do get what\'s basically borderline hentai to make up for it, so there\'s that.If you\'re even a little bit interested in fantasy Isekai and love some anime titties and some seriously high quality moaning, give this show a watch.

If you aren\'t okay with that, then you probably shouldn\'t watch this.[Plot]How Not to Summon a Demon Lord is an ecchi-harem show that just kind of exists. The story is there, but it isn\'t memorable. There are two different relationships that a protagonist and a story can share:1) A character driven story. The protagonist takes action to more the plot forward.or...2) A story driven character. The protagonist is reactionary and just sort of goes with the flow.This anime is #2.

I mean literally fingered, down in her fronthole, lmao.Its nothing special, really.But it had good art, good ecchi and was generally just fun to watch, which i guess makes it worth....Im not a fan of Ecchi, except when in really small doeses, but i knew what i expected and it was good for laughs and Wtf moments, especially when watching with a friend.Seriously, its the closes thing a PG13 Anime can get to Hentai.

As craptastic as that may sound as a premise, this is actually much better than you would think it would be going into it.  Yes, once again, a neet/hikikomori is mysteriously dragged into a video game world.  Once again, because this one specific game was more important to him than his real life, he is OP.  Once again, the player attracts a group of adventurers who go about adventuring and such.  It's no different from SAO, Log Horizon, Overlord, etc... in that regard.However, even though the premise is becoming...stale, the execution was well done.  The characters were likable enough, the action was well animated, the comedy usually hit the right note, and there were a couple of surprising and very exciting moments.  Really, this anime is one that clearly wanted to differentiate itself from the rest of the field by using ecchi aspects.  Fortunately, these aspects didn't permeate throughout the entire anime, but just during the crew's rest periods, so it didn't interfere with the main plot or cheapen important events with fan service.I think my only real complaint about the anime is the ending was a little too...meh.  Not really a mind blowing ending, but not a terrible ending, either.Overall, I think is an enjoyable anime.

Its everything you\'ve ever seen in the sense that it\'s the guy that gets brought over to another world with all of the powers that his character had, but on the other hand you can tell that the studio animating it was trying to animate above their skill level. Because a lot of times when a studio is not as skilled they will focus pretty much from the waist up because its hard to animate leg movement, not this studio. The quality of the anime itself (art wise) does drop a little when their is a lot of...action overall but it doesn\'t detract from the overall experience. The MC honestly acts in the same way that I would act, he\'s surprised at first but then he kind of ""tests"" what he is capable of compared to when he was playing the game in front of his computer. I don\'t mind fan service, but holy sh*t please tone it down just a tad. It\'s pretty much with the same character at least right now, but it\'s starting to get irritating. The music...besides the opening I can\'t even remember what other music there is...so there\'s that.

This show was a stinker to put plainly. It seems common to equate it to Overlord but that does Overlord such a disservice. I'm going to rail on this show pretty hard but overall if you want a fantasy story similar to Overlord to scratch that itch then its worth a watch. As a standalone show however it falls short in so many ways.The story starts off with a gamer shut in transported to this new world. He keeps the items he had in the game, one item is a ring of spell reflection. This...earns him the busty elf and small chested cat girl as his slaves. Now he must learn about the world, carefully integrate into society, and earn his place. Or so you would think. He just walks into town, shouting at people that he is the demon lord and internally agonizing over everything for the majority of the show.The world never really gets built we are just told of things as they become important until they are no longer important. It's like its rushed or was written in a bulleted list format then transformed into an anime. We don't get time to know anything which is weird because there are some major events that happen in this anime and none of it is ever discussed or brought up again.I'm not really sure I liked the MC. He is incredibly strong, takes on the role of a demon lord, yet acts like a child the entire time. Admittedly they explain this by saying he never was able to fit into society but after the third kidnapping incident I was becoming a little annoyed with his writing. His spells really only get cast once, leaving the later drama feeling stupid as the viewers know the powers he has.The side characters are only there for the fan service. Occasionally getting naked, or fingered(I'm serious), or simply watching from the sidelines shouting encouragement. I like fan service and ecchi scenes, however it is boring to watch in this show.The art was rather tame, looks like anime from a few years ago. The fight scenes are rather short and overwhelming in color so they didn't need to go all out on those either.Overall I enjoyed the show at first but it became more and more painful to watch as the show went on. I know very little about the characters, their goals, the world, or even the powers. It was highly underwhelming all around. earns him the busty elf and small chested cat girl as his slaves.

After episode 7 the quality drops a bit, there is more drama and the plot lacks direction. Not that it had much plot anyways. The second half of the season is much more ecchi as well. The show would have been better if they drastically reduced the amount of fan service and slutty loli outfits. Just surprised Funimation let something this naughty run.Unlike other anime that try to fluff up the air time with shopping episodes, food porn and ecchi Maou starts off well. Initially I hoped they would cap the harem, which he acquired...for no good reason other than ""hey it\'s anime why not get some loli and oppai slaves"". More girls are introduced because of course it\'s a harem so plot demands it.Some episodes I felt like they were too lazy to animate certain scenes and just cut away and panned back when said animation would have finished. Like transforming with very little animation for half a second, panning away with flashing lights and ta-da transformation over. Just lazy animation and VA could have been better in some scenes.Sometimes the comic relief is funny, sometimes it isn\'t. Fight scenes were decent and done in a creative way. Plot just kind of hops around and is not episodic but more like 1 plot per 2-3 episodes. It doesn\'t really have a real plot which is a downside that it has little potential to carry on as a story. But also an upside that it doesn\'t have to try to entertain you with a half hearted attempt at plot or throwing in something at the end to leave on a cliffhanger.In short expect ecchi loli oppai slave harem. And rejoice that Maou he isn\'t another overpowered Isekai character and he doesn\'t always get an easy win just because he\'s the lv 150 demon lord with hacks.Hope this helps.edit: review trimmed ranting removed for no good reason other than ""hey it\'s anime why not get some loli and oppai slaves"".

I\'m sure many people got turned off by premise itself - even as a fan of ecchi, harems and isekais with OP protagonists I had some distance towards it. Luckily, to my surprise it’s actually a really competent story, despite looking rather cheap and cliche.In a way you get exactly what you see on the cover, but it’s actually better than you expected.Characters are basic, but at the same time it’s easy to...like them, they don’t annoy you with stupid decisions and actually have a reason to be a part of Diablo’s harem.Our self proclaimed Demon Lord is one of the most entertaining main characters I’ve seen in some time. On one side we have the generally-disliked and overused loser shut-in stereotype, and on the other his roleplay of demon lord. Resulting inner monologues and attempts to keep his facade up are great comedy fuel, and at the same time his double character makes scenes of his OPness far less cringy yet still cool.While art and sound aren’t anything exceptional, it’s the story that I consider weakest point of this anime. There is pretty much no world building. Comparisons to the game made by Diablo are really nice, but not enough to make world feel alive and interesting. Villains and all the developments are as predictable as it gets and give this feeling of ""obligatory roadblock"" that just has to be there to don\'t make it SoL anime.On the bright side, our time isn’t wasted by dragged out fights - author made good work cutting such artificial tension in pretty satisfying way, and instead most of challenge for protagonist comes from re-adjusting from his solo playstyle.Another strong point of this title is ecchi. Personally, I don’t like boob-fests and all the cheap fanservice one can usually find in random 12-episodes anime. Isekai Maou doesn’t shy away from tits, but not only does it go way further than just skimpy clothes or pantyshots, it also does great job at making those scenes actually eroitc. And, again, Diablo is perfect character for role of male main in those situations.On the other hand, I’d say that harem aspect could be better. Sure, all girls are nice, but they aren’t special enough to start waifu wars or be used in avatars/signatures (other than few men of culture, that is). It’s hard for me to pinpoint what exactly they lacked.Overall, I think Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu is a really enjoyable anime that won’t get recognition it deserves due to isekai hate. like them, they don’t annoy you with stupid decisions and actually have a reason to be a part of Diablo’s harem.Our self proclaimed Demon Lord is one of the most entertaining main characters I’ve seen in some time.

Well I don\'t know but I\'m having fun!The story starts off an a familiar note. A Shut-in Uber gamer with an OP game character gets teleported to the game world and becomes that OP character.So what sets this apart from other Isekai?Well a few things actually.Our MC is a socially inapt shut in with zero social skills role playing an audacious demon lord. There isn\'t a moment when this doesn\'t come to play as even the smallest of social interactions weighs heavy on our MC. Battling monsters and casting mountain leveling spells? Ptt they\'re nothing!

It\'s bad, it\'s really bad, and I\'m not even talking about the loli aspect either!', ""The Isekai genre is something that has been largely discussed by the anime community, in good and bad ways alike. But in most cases, the genre itself has a notorious reputation for not only rehashing the same concepts over and over again, but somehow have come up with the most ridiculous, pandering, bizarre, and on some occasions the most surprisingly entertaining series I've ever seen in anime.Coming from someone who's watched the entirety of Smartphone, Death March, and is currently tormenting themselves withe the undeniable trash heap that is Master of Ragnarock this season, my expectations for this were fairly low. However, watching Demon...Lord this season had me quite surprised. In my personal opinion, this is probably one of the best Isekai anime we've gotten.-Story: 7/10I will say, the story is similar to most isekai stories. NEET/Otaku/whoever the hell our protagonist is either dies, activates some kind of magical object, or grants some really cheesy wish to be in another world, and boom, there they are. It's the same rehashed plotline, but this time, the main heroine's this time are...get this, it's gonna be revolutionary...slaves to the protagonist!At this point, I expect you to walk away and not even bother touching this anime, but I can assure you that it isn't as bad as it sounds. The tropes and cliches are obviously there, but they're actually managed fairly well, and while to some cliches and tropes degrade a show's overall quality, the execution of said chicles made it a pretty enjoyable watch for me.And touching upon the subject of the show's fanservice (since this IS in the ecchi genre), I don't say this a lot but it was executed...well?I mean, ecchi isn't a genre I particularly enjoy..

(There's one scene near the end of Episode 8...gotta have that good ass fabric.)Art: 6/10The animation in this show is fairly average. It's nothing impressive for the most part, but it's during battle sequences and fanservice scenes where the animators really step up their game.The character designs are also nothing special, but they're still appealing to look at.Sound: 6/10Don't really have much to say about it, other than that it's also fairly average. The OP and ED are nice, but it doesn't really stand out.Characters: 8/10This is where the show really shines. The characters for the most part are fairly likable here, despite a lot of them pretty much being stereotypes. But the true standout here is the main character, Diablo.THIS CHARACTER IS AN OP PROTAGONIST DONE RIGHT!I'm not saying that all OP main charrcters have to be like him, but his character is just done so well. He's one of the main highlights of teh show itself. From him being a NEET, the staff clearly used that to their advantage, as there are so many hilarious moments with his awkward self trying to act as a bonafide 'Demon Lord'. If there's one comparison I can make, imagine a more awkward and comedic version of Ainz from Overlord. Not saying he doesn't have serious moments either, as he is shown to be quite the caring individual in some of the more dramatic scenes of this show. So if you asked me if you should watch it just for Diablo alone, I would absolutely sat yes. Besides Tanya Degurechaff and Kazuma, he without a doubt ranks as one of my favorite Isekai protagonists, PERIOD!Enjoyment: 8/10Whether you're watching this seriously or just watching this as your guilty pleasure anime of the season, this one's a hoot, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected I would.Overall: 7/10It's not a masterpiece, nor is it a huge trash heap. It's honestly a fun and enjoyable series to watch. Whether or not you forget about it as the new anime season arrives, this is an Isekai that you'll surely find some enjoyment in. Lord this season had me quite surprised. In my personal opinion, this is probably one of the best Isekai anime we've gotten.-Story: 7/10I will say, the story is similar to most isekai stories. NEET/Otaku/whoever the hell our protagonist is either dies, activates some kind of magical object, or grants some really cheesy wish to be in another world, and boom, there they are. It's the same rehashed plotline, but this time, the main heroine's this time are...get this, it's gonna be revolutionary...slaves to the protagonist!At this point, I expect you to walk away and not even bother touching this anime, but I can assure you that it isn't as bad as it sounds. The tropes and cliches are obviously there, but they're actually managed fairly well, and while to some cliches and tropes degrade a show's overall quality, the execution of said chicles made it a pretty enjoyable watch for me.And touching upon the subject of the show's fanservice (since this IS in the ecchi genre), I don't say this a lot but it was executed...well?I mean, ecchi isn't a genre I particularly enjoy.. But the way they did it here didn't feel forced like most Ecchi shows do, and to me that's a pretty good thing. And a lot of those scenes were honestly to me, pretty hilarious.

It\'s mainly due to my confusion with the fact that I had given this show an 8 on my first watch, and I thought I had overrated it, and thus, decided a rewatch was in order to give this show a rating it more adequately deserves. Or so I thought, I proceeded to laugh my ass off for the majority of the night, and now I realize that this score was certainly earned.Like always with an ecchi show, before I get into the meat...and potatoes of this review, I feel the need to point out that it is an ecchi show. For some reason, I see other reviews on this ecchi show of people complaining about the fact that there is fan service in an ECCHI show. If you don\'t like fan service, then obviously you won\'t like ecchi, I don\'t see how this is the show\'s problem, when it comes down to the fact that you don\'t like the ecchi genre. It\'s like reviewing something in the action genre and saying, ""this has too much fighting in it"". Don\'t be stupid, know what you like, and if what you like isn\'t what the show is about, blame yourself for deciding to watch something that you know you probably wouldn\'t like. Last bit on this topic, many people out there believe ecchi-style shows to need to be graded on ""different criteria""; I am not one of these people--I believe any series should be graded on the same criteria, how well it does what its meant to do, and in the case of anything created by the entertainment industry, that objective is obviously going to be ""to entertain"". Sorry for the mini-rant, but I just want us all on the same page before I continue.Story: 6, The story is really nothing special, but here\'s a short break-down. Diablo (MC) is the demon lord in a videogame called Cross Reverie, but in actuality he is one of those elitist douchebag players that you deal with in video games who just run around griefing your noob ass, while acting all high-and-mighty. While staying up late one night he randomly gets sucked into another world by a pair of summoners, this world is very similar to his videogame (of course), and even more so to represent this, he is in his avatar\'s body, not his own(similar to series such as Overlord and Log Horizon). Some of the lore in this fantasy world is unique, but the majority of it is generic, and feels pretty over-used by the fantasy/isekai genres. Upon being summoned, the two girls try to enslave their new summon, which is standard practice in this world, but due to Diablo\'s ring of magic reflection, the two girls are the ones who get slave collars put on them. Ive seen many reviews talking about how the two girls, Shera and Rem, are his slaves, but this is clearly a biased take on what happens. It\'s the kind of person who goes, ""I didn\'t like this, so I\'m gonna give a slightly altered retelling of events that make other people go, \'oh the MC enslaves women, ew gross\'."" The enslavement collars are never used to make the girls do something they don\'t want to (beyond shaking hands with each other), and while there are a couple times he refers to them as his property, that is simply Diablo trying to keep up his persona as a demon lord combined with his poor social skills. At this point I\'m starting to bleed into character, and thus, I will pick this topic back up in that category.Art: 8, As I stated before, I do not believe that any genre needs special treatment when grading how well it completes standard criteria, but simply on how well it entertains. However, the difference between a pure comedy show like Cromartie High School, and an ecchi series, is that a pure-comedy show doesn\'t need spectacular art to be successful, in many cases, art that would be considered sub-par serves an adequate job in the comedy genre. In ecchi however, art is increasingly important as the major way it seeks to entertain is through methods such as visual fan-service. I wouldn\'t say there\'s anything spectacular about the art in this series, don\'t be expecting any beautifully animated  scenes like you\'d see in Demon Slayer, and other high-action series. On the positive side, the series keeps the quality of the art very consistent, which is something I always appreciate. A bit more work might\'ve gone into the ecchi/fan-service scenes, after all, Shera\'s jiggly bits are, well, always jiggly.Sound: 7, None of the OSTs really stuck out to me. Honestly can\'t remember anything besides the OP and ED, of which the OP was pretty solid, and I was quick to skip to the next episode the second the ED popped, as I found it rather annoying. Watched the dub, probably watched the sub when it first aired, but I don\'t remember how they sounded back then. The dub is pretty solid all-around. None of the VA annoyed me, and overall I\'d say they did a pretty good job. The only slight annoyance I have was how some of the characters talked, as in word-choice, which I realize tends to boil down more to the writing, but it kinda bothers me when characters set in a medieval fantasy setting use modern slang. Some of it\'s cute and playful, and does alright in comedy, but it feels rather jarring in the way the word choice for dialogue seems to disregard the setting. Ultimately, this doesn\'t really effect my score on sound, but was something I wanted mention nonetheless. Honestly, I might\'ve given an 8 to sound, if the music had been more noteworthy.Character: 7, First off, lets discuss Diablo a bit more--Diablo is very similar to Momonga from Overlord, in the sense that he\'s pretending to be a much bigger badass than he ever was in his real life. Diablo however, is much more used to putting up this facade. As I stated previously, Diablo is a self-proclaimed demon lord, and has been since before being summoned to this new world. Diablo doesn\'t know what it\'s like to have friends, he\'s a shut-in NEET and a solo-player inside and outside of the game. His poor social skills really work to sell this; he never interacts with anyone in the real world, and in the game world the only people he interacts with are other players, and during those interactions he is always ""Diablo the Demon Lord"". Thus when brought into a new world, in which he lives in Diablo\'s in-game avatar, he really doesn\'t know how to interact with others, without maintaining the demon lord persona. Without realizing this, you\'re more than likely going to think he\'s intentionally being a douche, when in actuality he\'s just socially awkward as hell. Ultimately this behavior isn\'t even his fault; he didn\'t turn to a life of solo-play because he didn\'t want friends, it was simply that when he tried to make friends, they only befriended him so he would give them stuff in the games he played with them, thus giving Diablo trust issues.I don\'t want to spend too much time discussing the girls as how their characters develop are quite plot relevant, and it would lead us down a road filled with spoilers. What I will say is most of the girls don\'t really develop that much, but instead their relationships are what we see develop. The two main girls, Rem and Shera, in particular have a less than pleasant relationship to start with, and while how the two girls act independently really doesn\'t change as the season progresses, the relationship the two have certainly does. At the start it\'s very hard to see how these two even ended up being the ones to summon Diablo, and what I mean is, I don\'t understand why they were spending any measure of time together, how they met, or anything along those lines because they don\'t get along, and this first season doesn\'t give us any reason for them to be together. Regardless, the two end up growing into genuine friends as they learn about the hardships the other is dealing with. Excluding one other girl, who if I discussed would be spoiler central (thus, I won\'t), the other girls are pretty one-dimensional, but none of the characters annoyed me. Heck, even some of the lesser recognized characters like the douche that claims to be the defender of all women, actually ends up being a rather likable character before all is said and done.Enjoyment: 9, I was quite pleasantly surprised to say the very least when I decided to rewatch this. I\'m not an exceptional fan of the ecchi genre, personally I usually find it rather cringe-inducing to see some otaku whose never even spoken to a woman getting into awkward boob-grabs and the other cliches we expect from this genre, but because of Diablo\'s character everything about it feels so much more acceptable. This work is by no means a masterpiece, but an anime doesn\'t have to be a masterpiece to be enjoyable. It brings to the table a solid combination of comedy and fan-service, with a little bit of OP badassery for flare.Overall: 8, I\'ve sung this shows praises enough, the ultimate breakdown is:The characters are a decently enjoyable cast, but you\'re probably not going to fall in love with any of them. The plot is enough to keep things mildly interesting, but it\'s certainly not why you\'re going to watch this.

It features an overpowered protagonist getting transported into the world of a game that they were previously an expert at and using the skills from that game they deal with various issues and have various women fall in love with them. However, while it's certainly not all that original really, this feels like an exceptionally good execution of the concept. Firstly, the main character is hilarious. He's very much the embodiment of...fake it till you make it, which is similar to other characters such as Ainz in Overlord. What makes him different is that he has to put in effort both into maintaining his persona of a Demon King, and actually has to put in effort to make sure he seems as strong as one. The persona part is obvious enough, in that it takes effort to act how you would act in a game considering that situations are much more real and emotional impacts from the situations have a lot more of an effect. This is a core part of the comedy which overall results in the series being quite hilarious. The power part is interesting as well though, in that though the protagonist is clearly overpowered compared to pretty much everyone, the anime has him go up against foes that are similarly greatly overpowered and hence that he has to put effort into achieving victory over them in such a way that it doesn't look like it was difficult for him in order to keep up his undefeatable Demon Kind persona. This latter aspect works quite well in that it allows having all the amusing and interesting situations that arise from a vastly overpowered protagonist while still allowing there to be a good amount of battles that are actually well done and don't simply rely on the overpowered aspect.The plot is also very character oriented as the plot almost entirely revolves around the background and character arcs of the two main heroines, Shera and Rem, and does a good job of creating good character development in both of them which also ends up causing some character growth in Diablo which results in solid relationship development among the three. These stories are pretty generic as much of the anime is sure, but they're pretty well told with moments that have a solid amount of impact and overall result in the series having great pacing and the characters themselves being very likable. The antagonists were a mixed bag, in that the antagonists that were just supposed to be villains and nothing more were incredibly simplistic cartoon villains from that got killed pretty quickly. In addition to that there were a number of characters that were antagonists at least for a time, though they were a bit more complicated and it was pretty clear for most of them just from the way things were focused on that they would ultimately end up not being antagonists forever, with there even being a number of simple but solid character arcs surrounding that. These were also okay in terms of the portion of their stories that were told, but it very much felt like their stories needed to continue well to warrant the amount of focus it felt was being put towards them. The ending to the series is a decent enough ending, in that it properly wraps up an arc, though it doesn't try to make the ending feel like any more of an ending than that, which overall I'd have to say is satisfying enough.The art and animation were solid with a good art style and really good character designs. The soundtrack had a couple great tracks but was mostly decent. The OP was pretty good in terms of audio and visuals, and the ED was incredible in terms of both audio and visuals even if it was pretty simple. fake it till you make it, which is similar to other characters such as Ainz in Overlord. What makes him different is that he has to put in effort both into maintaining his persona of a Demon King, and actually has to put in effort to make sure he seems as strong as one. The persona part is obvious enough, in that it takes effort to act how you would act in a game considering that situations are much more real and emotional impacts from the situations have a lot more of an effect. This is a core part of the comedy which overall results in the series being quite hilarious.

Used to be one of my favorite genre\'s but unfortuneately what used to be an easy form of world building for someone who doesn\'t have the ability, time or want to start from complete and utter scratch like Full Metal Alchemist, Naruto, Steins; Gate, and/or Evangelion. Isekais are now fan service, cheap world building filmworks. You look at films like Konosuba, re;zero, or even Overlord even though im not a fan and see their clear destinctions.Character driven plot vs story building plot? Two types of plots. I can\'t even fathom a third. One, derived off of backstory, setting and the great character...building of off panels characters. Like Alfonso\'s mom, someone who mattered and pushed the plot despite almost never encountering her. Or Madara. Of the guy sending the text messages in Steins; Gate.However, this...this is somehow neither. The plot itself isn\'t there. It\'s almost like an OVA where character setting and rules are what guide it. A lot of Isekai\'s are like this...in the beginning. Everytime we end a somewhat plot ""take off point,"" we lewd it.Like Marvel does with intense scenes to make jokes I think it\'s called Mathos? Or something like that. But they use sex....unfortuneately that\'s very hard to do and usually depends on a character having an entire personality, background and off panel characters of his own to contrast with others to nail the ""mathos"" home.Side characters make anime, anime. Who are our favorite characters? Side characters. No one actually cares about the main character..he\'s just, ya know, there to make everything else look good. It\'s what makes Japanese anime GOOD. We\'re side tracked with animation, waifu\'s, best gals, weapons, and cool fighting techniques/quirks/jutsu\'s. We stan different villages, gangs or off panel members we\'d love to finally encounter. This anime isn\'t bad at all; it just depends on ""mathos."" too much without actually nailing it. building of off panels characters.

At first glance, you think this is going to be some isekia, ecchi, trash show. Which in the end it does defy those expectations in that it is ecchi by the loosest of terms and that there is a reasonably decent storyline in there, nothing surprising but not the utter trash I was expecting.DL's story consists of the all too common these days loner who is summoned to another world. Of course, he is invoked as the all-powerful game character that he spent most of his time playing before being...summoned. The world is, of course, similar to his game so he does not have too much difficulty adjusting to it.Of course, we need to talk about the whole slavery thing. See the main guy was summoned to be one of the main girl's summons? Pet? I honestly can't remember but due to some powerful game item that allows him to reflects all magic the enslavement magic reflects into both of the main girls and they, in turn, become his slaves.Besides the fact of how nonplussed most of these isekia protagonists seem to feel toward slavery, the show kind of handles this decently. In the way, the Japanese Government handles past war crimes by simply ignoring it happened. Not to say it doesn't come up in the show but it rare for it to be mentioned as the girls always have their autonomy and he never compulses them to do anything.Oh, and while we at it, let's talk about the ecchi portion of this show because, in the end, this amounts to baby's first ecchi. Now I understand if your not into that kind of thing, but in that case, I am not sure what you were expecting from this show. For all intents and purposes, this was supposed to be a main selling point of the show.  But let me tell you the steamiest part of this show is when they cuddle in bed together or him kissing the demon lord.....real steamy I tell ya (he says super sarcastically)What perplexed me most is I was watching the uncensored version too. The only thing I can think of is the studio was trying to market this at children as well which is a whole other can of worms.Diablo character development is what saves this show for me from falling into the total stinkers category. Its nothing too surprising but throughout the show, he gets to overcome his social anxieties that are somewhat compelling to watch.Oh should mention I watched this dubbed, and it was good nothing so bad to make me switch to the sub. It does have that kind of campiness you get with ecchi dubs, but I instead enjoy that as I'm not too serious about these kinds of shows.The show is by no means utter garbage, but at the end of the day ends up meh with even the attempted fan service falling flat on its face.

So the plot is an 8 because the ending made me feel like it was worth the boring time I spent watching through the meaningless ecchi scenes which I can find more explicit ones of to touch myself by accessing a more explicit site. In respect to ecchi scenes, this anime has quite a lot of it and expects its viewers to enjoy them a lot. It goes on the basis that the viewer is a virgin loser easily excited by almost-explicit scenes...because the MC is so, and I didn't like this premise. But, the art of those scenes is not at all worthless; they are good and some scenes at the end did successfully make me feel like going gachi-gachi even though I'm not a boob fan. I knew from the beginning by the drawings that this anime would be worth my time; usually I can tell how amusing the animation will be by judging from the art style - good art usually carries good content. It gets the score 8, because while the plot feels quite beta and cliche at times and the characters don't feel like your friends in the beginning, the art, sound, enjoyment, and conclusion makes up for those two disappointments. So I took only two points off of 10. I also warmed up to the characters by the end. because the MC is so, and I didn't like this premise.

All the general classics of the genre exist in this series, overpowered protagonist, harem, fan service, NEET main character and more, however they\'re not all included in obnoxious ways.The story is somewhat standard, the world being a very basic ""Humans and demihumans struggling to coexist"", though it doesn\'t go as hard into the theme as it could\'ve done by only making one of the main chararacters human. The level system that\'s weakly explored doesn\'t really have any merits and it\'s not used enough for us to actually understand it and how powerful different characters are...supposed to be through it. Fanservice takes a bit too big of a front in the story for my own tastes and I would\'ve prefered if it had taken up a smaller part of the actual story, a few plot points actually coming down to direct fan service. A few plot points were dropped on the floor after being explored for a little but. That being said, the story is competently enough executed to not warrant a bad score, though I think the last act could\'ve benefited from an extra episode as some of the scenes are taken through kind of fast.The artstyle has no real problems. Only once did I ever notice the fact that CGI was used to create a single shot. At times there were some nice effects and I never felt confused about what was happening on screen. Character designs were at least somewhat interesting and even a good amount of background characters got more than a minute\'s thought put into how they were designed.I never had a ""This is amazing!"" moment with the sound design, though once again, I never had any problems with it either. I sadly found myself skipping the intro and outro after the first time as I honestly weren\'t interested in them.The characters weren\'t really bad, but some secondary characters had one aspect that could describe their entire personality, which at times was a little tiring. The main character was interestingly carried by ""in-game"" statistics at times, his charisma being entirely carried by the fact that his character back when it was a game had a few points in it and at one point allowing him to do alchemy while specifically not focusing, which was a funny quirk. The two main female leads sadly don\'t have many characteristics to explain them and they could\'ve been explored a bit better.I enjoyed the first half of the show decently. The ending of the second act as well as a good part of the third act weren\'t all as enjoyable, but I still had fun watching it. Overall, I think it\'s a fine show. If people want a competent Isekai show, this would be my 3rd choice to send them to, overshadowed by ""Overlord"" and ""That time I got Reincarnated as a Slime"". supposed to be through it.

I\'d pass on it as it doesn\'t offer anything to make it worth watching and if it ever gets a season 2 it will probably be an atrocity.Spoilers: Man does this show start out really surprisingly good for the genre (Isekai Echie). The main character is an antisocial mmorpg expert and he gets sent to a game world. That has been done a million times now but the way he covers up his inability to deal with people by putting on a demon lord persona is very funny at...times so that offers a new twist. The reason he gets called to another world is because of a synchronized summoning spell gone wrong by the two female leads: A silent and more reserved loli cat girl (who dresses way more revealingly than fits with her character type) and a bubbly happy go lucky elf character with a very curvy body and no sense of personal space.The characters compliment each other well and the friendship they form is very enjoyable and their antics are genuinely funny because the show takes a worn out out genre in a few new directions. Hell even the backstories for the female leads are well done and make you feel genuine emotion for their positions.Holy hell does this show get hype quickly when an army attacks and one of the female leads is almost assassinated. It is very satisfying to see a ""Demon Lord"" go beast mode and wreck an army before saving his girl. At this point I would have given the show an 8/10 overall but the rest of the show is entirely downhill.There were several warning signs that this could happen from the start, such as the main character despite being a regular mmo player clearly has abilities that are way beyond anything a player character should have in a game. Things like the ability to reflect all magic thanks to an enchanted ring that was given only to the first player to beat a difficult boss. No mmorpg would ever give out such a stupidly op ability because it completely breaks the game and makes that character impossible to be damaged by anyone in the game that plays a mage. Stupidly unbalanced. And his dps (damage per second) is so stupidly over the top there is no way a game would allow a character to level up to the point where they could kill 100 boss monsters with a single spell. That\'s just dumb. It would have been way more satisfying (and better written) if the main character simply had an ability that would reflect the first magic spell cast at him after he cast his reflect ability and it had a cooldown after it was activated so that way mages wouldn\'t instantly lose against him and he would have a reasonable advantage that he worked hard to obtain. And it would have been way more incredible to show him actually fight against 100 boss monsters and beat them with skill as opposed to just using a single spell so stupidly powerful no game would ever allow players to use.I could overlook the not overly obnoxious flaws from the first few episodes however the show has to put the main character in crisis to add suspense and they wrote him to be as powerful as God so they can only do this in two ways: 1 -  making him incredibly retarded, and 2 - sloppy writing.1 - He is clearly aware how powerful he is and yet he repeatedly lets his two female companions that both have people hunting them go around on their own without him and every time they almost get killed or get abducted. His only weakness is that there are two girls and he can\'t be in two places at the same time so for fucks sake just ask them both to stay together when you go on quests or out around town. Instead he goes on quests with one of them and the other in a town miles away will almost get her head ripped off or he\'ll hear bounties have been placed on one and let her wander around in the shopping district and be surprised when someone tries to kidnap her. Absolutely retarded.2 - At one point all of the characters are walking together and one of them gets kidnapped because she literally, with the main character directly in front of her decides to follow a different person and wonder where the main character went and he has no idea where she went because she followed someone else in a different direction despite being easily able to have called out to him and at least let him know she was following this other character. She literally just followed her kidnapper away without a word to anyone or wondering why they were walking in a different direction.After stuff like that starts happening the show becomes a wreck. A low level mage (compared to the main character) casts a spell on one of the girls suffocating her directly in front of the main character that can kill 100 boss level monsters with a single spell and he just starts angrily talking to the guy before getting into a fight with him and letting it take way longer than required to stop his girl from choking. He could have immediately cast a single spell that would have either killed the enemy mage or cause him incredible pain/to pass out if he didn\'t want to kill him and instead he let some random assclown choke his girl with magic right in front of him for a bit. If you care for these girls and have the power of a god why the hell don\'t you protect them more?!? Where is the fury and indignation that some shit mage just started choking a girl you care for?!? Why aren\'t you casting a spell that will turn him into a crater so big it shakes the city or frying him to near death with a lightning bolt like the divine judgement of an enraged god?!?By the time it gets to the episode where the only way to save one of the girls is to give her ""the shocker"" (yes the two in the pink one in the stink fingering gesture people used to think was funny in second grade) the show had become such a trainwreck it was borderline unwatchable imo and I tend to have a higher tolerance for garbage than most people.The show just really drops the ball after a decent enough setup and it really bothers me because in the first few episodes the characters were so good together and the jokes were funny.

It tries to be like Overlord, but back peddles into the comedic route because of its Harem tag. Although there are some elements towards a unique narrative despite taking on the Isekai route it isn't very impressive.The art is good and the character designs are aesthetically pleasing, the music is well incorporated to create a light and carefree mood that is suitable for the Isekai genre. But it lacks the emotional aspect to match the drama that it tries to narrate. Although the ecchi scenes are pretty...much fan service and eye-candy for the audience it is hard to stomach a narrative that suffers from DID.The characters are not properly fleshed and even at moments suffer from an identity crisis. Also, the side characters and antagonists that spawn along the way does it no favours as they tend to be pretty psychotic. Which makes sense because they are the antagonists but they leave such a bad taste in your mouth you wonder why the author created them in the first place. To create drama I suppose, but the unnecessary drama does not elevate the narrative instead it hinders the progression of it. The voice acting isn't really impressive so nothing to shout home about.However, there are moments that are quite funny I suppose but with Comedy as one of its main tags, it isn't enough. With ecchi and harem, you can expect the romance to be pretty basic. But it is there if you really are looking for it.I didn't really enjoy this title very much, that being said I rarely enjoy Isekais.

It is not outright horrible, but it is surely disappointing.Story isn\'t much to write home about (if you saw a lot of other anime, that is), it just just that it barely moves and feels lifeless.

The events go in turns one after another, following the story from them manga fairly faithfully, but everything is simply dull. Even the fight. Something is amiss.

The awkward small talk, the moral judgments about having 2 slave girls that happens to become yours for pretty much no reason and that for pretty much no reason want to stay this way with the MC.I am not as awkward as him but I really can relate on how to interact with people when having to show your vulnerable side and I enjoy how he tortures himself trying to be his best self not to show he isn't what he wants people...to think he is. He's just a normal dude trying to fit in the role he is given.

If you're hesitant, give it a shot!

I do think they could've fit more of a story in if they hadn't focused on the whole harem aspect of it but, it is what it is. Overall I'd give it a 7 out of ten. It was fairly good. I just have a personal belief that relying on the whole sexiness factor is a bit lazy. It's still a good show though, hope they continue this story.What I enjoyed about this anime is the whole RPG factor. I've been a fan of RPG's as long as I can remember. The storyline is really good, I just...wish they would've dedicated more effort to it.Like I said before, not a fan of the whole harem thing but, I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me laugh at certain points during the show. wish they would've dedicated more effort to it.Like I said before, not a fan of the whole harem thing but, I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me laugh at certain points during the show."", 'My overall impression of this from the first episode was that it would be shameless pandering to people who just want to see a catgirl and an elf with big titties in lingerie and a slave collar.

It\'s competently done for the most part, the animation looks good, the VA work is fine if unmemorable, but the characters have little personality beyond being girls in distress clinging to the main character, the main character\'s main trait is being a cringeworthy loser, and there is very little depth to the plot.

I didn\'t like its opening episode and I sat and rolled my eyes as I prepared for ANOTHER *sigh* light novel isekai in a video game fantasy world with a level system which is rendered meaningless because the main character is overpowered anyway. However, a few episodes in and I started to realise that I was enjoying the show. It understands what it is, it doesn\'t take itself too seriously and the characters were all enjoying the soft debauchery so I...found myself enjoying it too.I think Diablo is a fantastic harem protagonist. He\'s overpowered yet still struggles with some opponents, but his biggest flaw is his dorkiness and social anxiety which he covers up by tapping into his Demon Lord persona which is rude, brash and authoritative. This makes him funny and charming to watch and sets up suspenseful moments to see whether or not he breaks kayfabe.I also enjoyed Shera (for certain reasons) and Rem. Their designs are cute and their personalities complement each other and Diablo making it enjoyable to watch them interact and fool around with him consensually.\'Consensual\' is an important word when talking about this show. Unlike other ecchi shows where lucky pervert tropes are used to skirt around harassment and sexual assault is framed/directed in a way that would make it seem desirable instead of what it is which is a terrifying and detestable act, Demon Lords ecchi moments are all consensual between two or more adults and it\'s very clear that the author and the animators had fun writing and creating these scenes which made them fun for me to watch.Shera and Rem might have accidentally become Diablo\'s slaves, but they don\'t mind it and actively try to seduce him. Meanwhile Diablo doesn\'t use the slave collars to make them do things they don\'t want to and him calling them ""his property"" is more a term of affection through his awkward Demon Lord persona.Any time something nonconsensual did happen it was by a character who is framed as a bad guy which added to their detestableness and made it more satisfying to watch when they\'re put in their place.That said Demon Lord isn\'t perfect. There are still the use of lolicon characters and there\'s a particular scene between Diablo and his boss Sylvie which takes things too far for me. The plot isn\'t exactly amazing either and there aren\'t enough male side characters who aren\'t either evil rapists or rich assholes to balance out the male-to-female cast ratio though, I do enjoy it when Emile gets screen time and his relationship with Diablo is amusing.Overall How Not to Summon a Demon Lord is a pretty fun and sexy ecchi series. It knows when to put the anime titties away for when the story gets serious and it knows when to get them out for the fun stuff.

Well, ok, that\'s not too long of a titlefor an isekai anime.  Good job there.  I want to start off by saying thatthis is a harem ending that doesn\'t end with hard feelings of leaving one...or more girls out.  It doesn\'t feel too forced (a lot of the girls are idiotsanyway) so the resolution felt well-done.The story is pretty generic, similar enough to KonoSuba but with theisekaification (method of transportation to the world) similar to that of NoGame No Life minus the formal invitation.  However, the protagonist isinsanely powerful, far outranking most people in the world, literally ableto beat anybody else without help.I really liked this story because it ends on a happy ending with no loose endsthat I can remember.  I don\'t really watch shows for the drama, I muchprefer a happy story with a calm resolution.  This show fits that perfectly.(hold up, I\'m gonna go raise the ""Enjoyment"" number from 9 to 10...)The art and sound were yet again, hard to judge, but nothing terriblehappened so here are two 8s.The main girls - in this case, the two of them - are a light tsundere and abakadere.  Not a bad combo, each of them has a personal problem thatthe protagonist, Diablo, has to deal with.  Funnily enough, each problemescalates into a world-threatening situation.The character tropes aren\'t too unique, but I love that the protagonist,Diablo, tries to maintain his social interaction ability by imitating his ideal,""Diablo"" self from the time he spent gaming.I really enjoyed this show for reasons stated above, it is a lighthearted funstory where the characters actions have no massive consequences.

The  start of the first episode gives off an Overlord vibe, and the MC (Diablo) definitely has the same personality with Ains (Overlord). The plot is not really unique and the background stories of other characters are not new either. However, the show emphasizes the lack of communication skills of Diablo and that becomes his struggle along the journey. Because of the personality of Diablo, you cannot immediately say that the fights are one-sided, but his powers would still turned out to be overpowered. The...title makes sense since Diablo is just a self-proclaimed Demon Lord from another world. The animation is fine, not really jaw-dropping.  Fan service are way too much at some point but you can\'t really blaim a series with an ""ecchi"" and ""harem"" tag. title makes sense since Diablo is just a self-proclaimed Demon Lord from another world.

Fan service are way too much at some point but you can\'t really blaim a series with an ""ecchi"" and ""harem"" tag.', ""Ever heard of animes which make u hate anime?....well this is one of them!!!...This show is pretty much pathetic....the show could have been sooo much better...afterall the MC is the demon lord...and i love anime with demon lords as the mc...but this show is pathetic...and all the characters (except a few of them) are pathetic.....Its sooo bad...its so full of cringe and ugly...uhghhhhh...i dont even wanna talk about it...i wanna die!!!The MC is fine btw...no problem with him...he is a demon lord afterall...but all the girls are pretty much useless and pathetic and stupid(except the leaders of mage and adventurers' guild )...there is also the...matter of the second demon lord who is a girl and pretty much powerful but wastes her and my time eating cookies!!!...ahhh and the story ...its pretty much garbage....Its a huge pile of garbage ....uhhh thats it...dont watch it ...its not Demon Lord Diamao...nor it is a good isekai anime...so dont waste your time on garbage characters and storyline... matter of the second demon lord who is a girl and pretty much powerful but wastes her and my time eating cookies!!!...ahhh and the story ...its pretty much garbage....Its a huge pile of garbage ....uhhh thats it...dont watch it ...its not Demon Lord Diamao...nor it is a good isekai anime...so dont waste your time on garbage characters and storyline..."", 'I can\'t believe my first review for an anime is for this show but I just have to get out my frustrations, be wary this is not going to be an organized review, but more of a rant in a single paragraph.First off, anyone seeing this will probably think this review is just me complaining about generic shit like the ecchiness or the very simple premise, but that\'s not it at all. I actually enjoy the ecchiness, the harem, the op mc that all the girls like, the all-so-common aspect of guy who\'s really good at game goes into that game-like world with all...the levels are powers and shit that he had before, I think all of this is fine. No, it\'s not anything amazing, but I think this anime does it all pretty well actually, and I think it\'s one of the more enjoyable isekai anime that rely on tropes like these. So you may be asking yourself, ok then, what\'s wrong with it? Oh boy do I have something to tell you. What\'s wrong with this show is probably some of the most bafflingly stupid character writing and decisions I have seen in an anime in quite a while, SPOILER warning from here on out. So we have our badass demon lord mc right? Well, kind of. you see the whole idea of him putting on the act of being a badass but actually being a pussy is fine with me, but what\'s not fine is how unbelievably stupid he is and the illogical writing when it comes to his powers. Rem and Shera are abducted and put in danger multiple times in the early episodes of the show, so you\'d think, damn this guy is op right? he\'ll realize he has to be careful and keep his guard up so they won\'t be in danger right? Wrong. One of them is suddenly in danger? *surprised Pikachu face* while he stands there looking like an idiot. This keeps up through the 11 episodes of the show I watched before I couldn\'t keep watching. And it\'s not like when I say danger I mean silly monsters, I\'m talking psychotic religious organizations that want to torture the girls and a brother who tries to rape his sister, that\'s the kind of danger I\'m talking about. It\'s not just the main character who\'s an idiot either, the other characters make some pretty questionable decisions as well, but at least they\'re not fucking demon lords and can be excused for being an idiot to a certain extent. One other thing is the main character\'s lack of resolve to kill people who are clearly a danger to his friends with the idiotic excuse ""ah they\'re simply too weak to be worth killing, if they come at me again I will show no mercy"" which of course doesn\'t mean shit when they go after your weak friends instead of you who you don\'t give a shit to protect. Oh yeah there\'s also the inconsistency with his powers, one second he\'s throwing out a fucking super nova explosion to eviscerate an entire army and the next he\'s running around town like a normal fucking person when one of his allies (who he doesn\'t care to protect) gets abducted. You\'re telling me he doesn\'t have or care to use a single fucking power to help him look? at all? You\'re probably wondering why I care this much about a silly harem isekai anime, and I\'d agree with you if it was silly, but god damn are the intense scenes fucked up, they actually show to a scary degree the rape and torture moments as if they were in a anime that took itself seriously, but they\'re in a show where the main characters just like ""ah shit, lost em again, guess Ill run around town at this slow ass pace while I barely put in any effort to look"" and this contrast is really irritating.Summary: not mad cause of isekai or harem or ecchiness or anything like that, upset cause of stupid writing for characters and inconsistently for mc\'s powers, if you don\'t care about the story at all and just want something to laugh at or want a big titty elf girl and cute loli cat-girl then you\'ll enjoy this, but I feel there are better options that don\'t contain scenes that make you legitimately feel for the characters, and an anime that switches between really dark and really light like a light switch. the levels are powers and shit that he had before, I think all of this is fine.

Besides Harem anime Isekai anime was what I first started watching and that\'s how I became an anime fan. I\'ve branched off from those two genres lately but I always enjoy watching these genre of anime especially when I just want to just enjoy watching anime and not have to think too much about the plot. Although in the past few years there has been some decent Isekai like Mushoku Tensei, Harem anime on the other hand hasn\'t strayed much...from its path and most follow a fairly strict plotline. Review Time!Story: 7.5/10 - the story was ok, it\'s an Isekai where the MC is transferred into his gaming avatar instead of being reincarnated. I\'m not positive whether it\'s the game world or a world that\'s similar. The MCs character name is Diablo and he was summoned by the Elf named Shera L. Greenwood and a Pantherian (girl with cat ears and tail) named Rem Galleu but because of an item Diablo was wearing the spell was directed back at the two girls which caused them to be enslaved to Diablo. The three of them go on a journey together to get the slave collars off along with other events that occur. They all become adventurers and take on small jobs to gain the funds for their journey. This anime is more of a comedy and makes fun of itself and at times it reminds me of Konosuba. It doesn\'t take itself too seriously but when a serious moments occurs, it\'s not unbelievable or out of place.Art: 7.5/10 - the animation was good for the most part and when it had some ""closeups"" it was very good lol. The ecchi moments get played up and get animated better, so sometimes I wished they would use that budget in other places but most times I just watched and enjoyed lol. The backgrounds were done well and were legible, not to mention the viewer could actually tell what was in the background. The colors used were done well and I didn\'t find it too bright and unnerving or too dark and muddled which is great. Also I thought that the animations for the magic used was good and helped enhance the scene.Sound: 8.5/10 - the music and SFX in this anime were pretty good and I actually enjoyed the OP & ED when I actually listened to them. The OP & ED both have vocals which most anime don\'t unless it\'s generic. The music went good with the visuals for the OP, there was a lot of ecchi but it wasn\'t out of place. The background music was great and helped enhance the scenes and the SFX were believable and well placed. The ED was done in a way that it matched the OP and had the same vocal artist which I liked.Characters: 8.5/10 - I really like the characters in this anime and I thought they were all well designed. There was a variety of character species like Elves, Demons and Beastmen along with the bad guys called The Fallen. The voice acting was really good, especially the Diablos voice actor and Shera\'s voice actor, they were my favorite lol I laughed almost every time Shera opened her mouth or when she was shoving food into it. And both versions are worth watching so it doesn\'t matter if you watch the dub or subbed version.Enjoyment: 9/10 - I really enjoyed this anime when I first watched it and when I watched it before this review. It\'s funny and has some decent action moments. The story is decent for being a Harem, Isekai anime which tend to be similar to one another and can sometimes be very repetitive. This anime has some originality in the way it does it\'s storytelling but does things that other anime of the same genre, only better in my opinion.Overall: 8/10 - I thought it was a very good anime and depending on your taste in anime I would recommend it. If you\'re into anime that\'s more serious or you just don\'t like ecchi then I would probably recommend watching something else. If you\'re into Comedy, Isekai, Harem or Ecchi anime then I would recommend it. As long as you\'re open to different genres of anime and don\'t mind ecchi then I\'m sure you will find some enjoyment in this anime. I liked that this anime wasn\'t super serious and it was good to watch when I just wanted to relax and not think super hard about what was goin on. from its path and most follow a fairly strict plotline.

However, for me who wants ecchi alongside with decent story it will be disappointment.Story(4) starts constructively and it is quite enjoyable until MC decides to become merciful and tolerates literally everything that will turn back disastrously. And you are getting an idea what will gonna happen cause everything is quite predictive and intuitive. OKAY, I'm not asking Harem anime to be realistic of course but c'mon its not Naruto where strongest...jutsu is Power of Friendship. I don't understand, the core idea of concept of 'letting them go', if some creature are perished because of their evil deeds, why humans are forgiven for much more loathsome actions. but fine its not right place to ask existential questions about human behavior, however, it still left me unsatisfied.Comedy part was fine and animation was decent(7) as well unfortunately it is not 1080p but it will not disappoint you.Overall, I give 6, it was still fun to watch and great way to enjoy at free time jutsu is Power of Friendship.

Based on the light novel series by Yukiya Murasaki, this show takes the isekai genre and adds a mischievous twist that sets it apart from the crowd.The story follows Takuma Sakamoto, an avid gamer who gets transported into the world of his favorite game, Cross Reverie, as his in-game character, the mighty Demon Lord Diablo. With his immense power and overwhelming abilities, Takuma becomes the center of attention, as two female characters, Rem and Shera, mistakenly summon him...as their servant.One of the highlights of How Not to Summon a Demon Lord is its well-executed humor. Takuma, despite his imposing appearance, is socially awkward and struggles to interact with others, often leading to comedic situations. His attempts to hide his nervousness behind a facade of arrogance and dominance provide ample laughter throughout the series. The banter between Takuma, Rem, and Shera is particularly enjoyable, as their personalities clash in humorous ways.The world-building in this anime is also commendable. While the story initially starts within the game world of Cross Reverie, it expands into a complex and fascinating fantasy realm with political intrigue, magical creatures, and a looming threat that poses a challenge to our protagonists. The progression of the plot keeps viewers engaged, with a good mix of lighthearted moments and high-stakes action.Visually, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord delivers on multiple fronts. The animation quality is crisp and vibrant, showcasing the vivid and colorful landscapes of the fantasy world. The character designs are appealing and distinctive, with each main character possessing a unique charm that adds depth to the story.However, it's worth mentioning that the series does include some fan service and ecchi elements, which may not be to everyone's taste. While these moments do not overshadow the overall story, they are a recurring aspect of the show. If you are uncomfortable with such content, it's worth considering before diving in.In conclusion, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord is a captivating anime that combines fantasy adventure, comedy, and a sprinkle of ecchi into an enjoyable package.

Ecchi scene not very vulgar.', 'I watched this right after ""Demon Lord, Retry!"", and I have to say unfortunately that this one is slightly better because it sticks to the harem-isekai formula. However, that prevents this anime from going any further than a 6. It\'s quite basic. The art, music, plot, and characters are all very simple. Just something fun to watch to pass the time, that\'s all.I also wanted to clear up that the ""two waifus"" didn\'t hold this anime back at all, as they were actually worthwhile and balanced the entire time and didn\'t fade out and become decorations like other harem anime. And even though the...MC is OP, he does have some obvious irl weaknesses (like social anxiety etc.), and it\'s presented fairly, albeit surface level.The voice acting wasn\'t bad, I especially liked Shera\'s japanese voice. I saw a bit of the first episode in English, and Rem seemed very good, but I switched back to Japanese because the Demon Lord sounded better there. One voice that annoyed me though was Alicia\'s, as it was too stiff (in JP, I didn\'t get that far inENG). Probably because she is a knight, but it just didn\'t really match her look all that well. Edelgard was really cute in her design and dialogue.This anime did help me understand the Isekai genre a bit more. It\'s so popular because the target audience is usually big gamers, so they enjoy the concept because it gives them an opportunity to be rewarded for the one actual skill they have in real life, which is gaming. That said, a lot of the connection between irl and the fantasy world is lost in this one, as most of the comparisons are made between the fantasy world and the MMO the MC comes from, so it\'s too layered to actual reveal anything substantial about the MC outside of the game. However, getting too psychological might be outside of the formula of course. I did watch this anime to completion, so it did it\'s job. MC is OP, he does have some obvious irl weaknesses (like social anxiety etc.), and it\'s presented fairly, albeit surface level.The voice acting wasn\'t bad, I especially liked Shera\'s japanese voice. I saw a bit of the first episode in English, and Rem seemed very good, but I switched back to Japanese because the Demon Lord sounded better there. One voice that annoyed me though was Alicia\'s, as it was too stiff (in JP, I didn\'t get that far inENG). Probably because she is a knight, but it just didn\'t really match her look all that well. Edelgard was really cute in her design and dialogue.This anime did help me understand the Isekai genre a bit more. It\'s so popular because the target audience is usually big gamers, so they enjoy the concept because it gives them an opportunity to be rewarded for the one actual skill they have in real life, which is gaming.

There were a few funny moments, and a couple of minor twists.Cons: The story is pretty much a rehash of other isekai\'s, but with even less explanation about how the ""hero"" winds up in the new world. The plot is incredibly thin. At the same time, the story seems to take place over a fairly short period of time, yet the characters supposedly developed meaningful and lasting ""bonds"".Overall, it is an okay time-killer anime, but nothing that you would likely ending...recommending to friends. recommending to friends.', 'So, just finsihed ""How not to summon a Demon lord"" and boy was it a let down for me. I\'m glad I finally got around to seeing this anime as it looked like it had interesting artwork and seemed like it had an Overlord theme to it (which I love) however it failed to come across as a unique enough story for me. So I\'ll mention potentail spoilers for later on, but for now I\'ll focus on the over anime and what it did and didn\'t bring when watching it. The artwork was good, nothing special or unqie but not...bad or horrible to look at; just your standard good looking designs to appease the veiwers. The ecchi was pretty heavy in this series too, which I don\'t mind depending if the story allows it to make sense or if its brought up in the perfect moment or portions but it seemed like the anime had to rely a pon it to stay relivent. The story for the series for me was interesting, it had decent character plots for the stories but failed to excuted them properly which had me hanging my head in disappointment(Spoiler: One of the biggest examples I could think of was when Rem was telling Krebskulm not use her powers to save her even when she was about to be torurted since she didn\'t want Krebskulm to change into the demon lord. Really!!! You thought thats a great way of making a dramatic scene? Why could it show krebskulm and rem fleeing and maybe Rem got maned or injured trying to save krebskulm to trigger her to change for the story. It would have been a more predictable cleche of a anime scene, but a lot better than that horrible poorly thought out event. Unfortunetly there were alot of other points of the series where the possiblity of a good episode that could have risen, only for the dialogue and bad story direction to ruin it.) Putting aside the forced ecchi and lazy wrapping up to each arch of the story, the character development was also pretty bad. I know in theses types of animes the focus is on the main protaganist and how we should think he\'s so awesome, but substance around him make a huge factor into believeing this. With a very weak introduction on how he arrived to the world, a typical background with no accutally drama and no intentions or goals other than just to start questing, the only appeal I can see anyone getting anything out of this anime is that its something new and you should be watching it. I cant say this was one of the worst animes I\'ve seen and strange as it may sound I did what to see how each episode would end (evening knowing the answer) but maybe that was the point of the anime; not to be anything fancy or well thought out, just a new series to get people to watch once only never view again.  I finished the series hoping for some sort of developement but all I got was the knowledge I won\'t be watching a second season if this anime gets one. I never readed the manga (As I know it would spoil my enjoyment to watch the anime, due to manga being superior most to all the time) but maybe it was a better read then this. Also, I watched the Dub version (Rems lines were very annoying and out of place it seemed); not sure if the Sub would have helped me enjoy this series a little bit more, but I\'m not about to find out. They\'re a bunch of other types of isekai animes out there that should be considered (like overlord, reZero or konosuba) before diving into this series, but the choice is up to you. bad or horrible to look at; just your standard good looking designs to appease the veiwers.

There has to be one at least one every year it seems. The plot is pretty much the same - A regular, boring guy is sucked into another world, where he happens to be ridiculously overpowered compared to everything around and ends up in a harem with at least 5 girls without even seeking that. ""Isekai Maou"" does not deviate from that traditional plot even one bit.The ""other world"" in this case is based on an MMO (not even an extremely important plot detail), so I\'d describe this as ""Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni"" x ""Overlord"",...but unfortunately not in a good sense. Amusingly I actually liked ""Isekai wa Smartphone"" because it never took itself seriously and pretty much aimed for the ""it\'s so bad it\'s good"" genre. Unfortunately this is not the case here.Most shows of this kind have a lot of fan service but this one trumps them all. Some scenes are borderline soft porn. Guess there are quite a few people who\'re looking for that though, otherwise we wouldn\'t be getting virtually the same plot again and again.Art and sound are great, which is pretty much expected for a fan service based anime.Bottom line: Watch it if you\'re just looking for moe.

I should’ve specified because this won’t be.I like the isekai genre. I’ve always been a fan of OP MC’s or ones that defy all the rules. This show had the potential to be great. I got vibes from all different kinds of shows. I really wanted to like the MC too because he’s got OP powers but is an introvert and has to actively try to fit in the role he’s created for himself. It leads to some pretty funny moments.But holy heck Batman! The fan...service ruins EVERYTHING. I tried to suffer through it. I made it to episode 7. Without going into much detail, there’s a scene in which fan service reaches consensual activities. I didn’t sign up for that. I can do a lot of things, but I can’t do non-consensual in my anime. It’s just not worth it. Especially when the anime isn’t set up to be hentai or ecchi.I get it, fan service is practically unavoidable. But it should NOT be a consistent PLOT element. If you don’t know how to advance the plot decently, surely there are better things to do in an isekai than go for gold in the lewd Olympics.I’m disappointed, but it surprised. This is an anime that you’ll have to watch with a grain of salt. It’s not an isekai with a serious factor in it. Which is again, disappointing, because I like isekai. Overly cautious hero, SAO, All routes lead to doom, all had goofy elements to make the story fun. But there was still a central serious factor that tied the story together as a whole.

Its totally funny and stuff.Its frankly nothing too deep or amazing but it was a fun watch."", 'I’ve been thinking as of late that it’s about time I figured out how to properly handle ecchi shows. This genre has always been a massive stumbling block for me; I’m not opposed to the presence of raunchy, sexual, and erotic material in media, but the way anime handles that kind of stuff, especially in shows explicitly focused around it, always feels so grossly condescending, insultingly cheap, and awash in moronic contrivance for the sake of shoving skin on screen (not to mention often misogynistic as hell, but that’s a rant for another day). As a straight guy with at least a modicum of self-respect,...I don’t see the appeal in shows that pander to *my* demographic this explicitly and shamelessly unless they’re just straight up hentai. Masturbation is one thing, but I expect at least a little better from a show that’s actually trying. Still, I will always maintain that no genre or trope is inherently broken or irredeemable, so you gotta figure there’s at least some ecchi stuff out there that’s worth more than an idle midnight wank. And at first, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord seems like it might actually manage that impossible feat. For the first few episodes, I was, if not swept away, at least invested in the proceedings and having a decent time. Could this be the ecchi anime that finally makes me embrace my degeneracy?Well, no, as it turns out. In fact, How Not to- ah fuck it, I’ll just call it Demon Lord from now on- is pretty much a textbook example of why this genre gives me so much pause, how its codified tropes and conventions end up undermining its ability to connect with me. As is so often the case with ecchi shows, I feel like I would have enjoyed it so much more without the ecchi elements. So let’s see if we can’t figure out why.First, the story: in typical isekai fashion, our protagonist is sucked into the world of his favorite video game, a fantasy mmorpg in which he is by far one of the most powerful players. In his case, he ends up inhabiting the body of his in-game avatar: Diablo, a demon lord with an extensive mastery of the game’s mechanics who enjoys playing the part of the manical, tyrannical overlord. His summoners, an elf girl named Shera and a cat girl named Rem (no, not that one), were attempting to cast an enslavement ritual on him, obtaining a powerful servant to go on adventures with. But thanks to magical fuckery, the spell ends up rebounding, and Shera and Rem both become Diablo’s slaves, complete with heavy collars around their next. None of them, least of all Diablo, are happy with that arrangement, so it’s off to the races as this wacky band of misfits do the typical isekai explore-the-world-and-go-on-adventures shenanigans, all while looking for a way to remove the collars and running into a cast of middlingly interesting waifu bait/side characters. Oh, and there are boob physics. Lots and lots of boob physics.On the surface, that description sounds like just another pedestrian, run-of-the-mill power fantasy that’s become so depressingly common in the isekai genre, positioning the audience surrogate as the most Special, Awesome Person Alive(tm) who kicks all the ass and gets all the girls. And yet, what ends up turning Demon Lord into such a colossal disappointment is that at first, it actually does a halfway-decent job justifying its tropes and telling an actual story with them. Diablo, Shera, and Rem all have fun chemistry with each other, and the goofiness of their interactions makes spending time with them actually fun. Diablo himself has a welcome streak of crippling social anxiety that helps make him feel far more human than many of his self-insert contemporaries (Sure, No Game No Life did it better, but it still works here). Hell, the whole slavery thing alone could so easily tread into really creepy territory, but the show makes a very wise decision early and often in not positioning the central threesome (heh) as a master and his servants. None of the main trio see their relationship in those terms at all; they’re companions first and foremost, developing into closer and closer friends as the story progresses. It even leads to a couple of touching moments, where the subtleties of their interactions really sell how much they’re coming to trust each other and their unusual living situation.In short, my initial impression of Demon Lord was a show that could make smart, justified choices in service of the dumb, silly story it was trying to tell. Beyond the ridiculous boob jiggles and panty shots, there was genuine craft on display, a sense that we weren’t just trying to coast by on the flash of fanservice with nothing of substance underneath. Sure, it wasn’t anything special, but it was managing to hit that sweet spot of good storytelling that made it easier to stomach some of its more aggravating aspects. And I was genuinely enjoying my time with it. Sadly, once the first arc ended and that initial glow wore off, my frustrations with the show just started piling up more and more until they buried all my investment under a mountain of bullshit. The further the story drags on, the weaker and more mindless it becomes. The welcome subtlety of those early episodes is replaced by maudlin, unearned melodrama that’s too childish and grating to land. The plotting gets bogged down in too much stuff going on, expanding outward like a puke puddle without ever deepening to watch that expansion. And while the production values are consistently solid, full of stylish colors and strong animation, I found myself more and more annoyed at the thought that such a good production was being wasted on such a nothing of a story. Demon Lord manages an impressive degree of finesse early on, but it can’t maintain it for a full twelve episodes. Not when there are more g-strings we can be sticking the big-tittied elf girl in.Which bring me, at last, to the reason this ecchi show ended up falling so flat for me: the ecchi itself. This was one aspect that just never worked for me, even in the early episodes. And in reflecting upon it, I think it speaks to my wider problem with fanservice in general: it so rarely actually matters. The story may have its occasional flashes of nuance and originality, but the sexy stuff is never more creative than just doing the same shit literally every anime has done with it. There’s nothing here that I haven’t seen mindlessly repeated countless times before. It doesn’t serve the show in any fashion other than to just... exist. It’s a distraction, a joke, a meaningless addition that doesn’t actually add anything. It’s not here because the specific requirements of the story benefit from an abundance of barely-concealed nipples; it’s here because it’s hot, and therefore, sad virgin nerds will maybe buy enough figures to keep the studio running. And speaking as a sad virgin nerd myself, I take offense to that ethos. I am not so easily swayed that molesting a cat girl to orgasm in the first episode will suddenly blind me to all the flaws you’re trying to hide behind that moaning face of release. Sex deserves better from anime. It deserves more creativity, more originality, more thought, more justification, and more purpose. Or barring that, at least just don’t stoop so low as to literally rip off the infamous Oberon Rape scene from Sword Art Online. Seriously, of all the fucking ideas to pilfer from SAO, you go with its single most commonly hated scene by far? How wrong-headed can you get?And really, it was that scene in particular that finally shattered the spell for me. No show that can so mindlessly copy one of the most universally reviled moments in anime history could ever be worth that much. Perhaps one day I’ll find an ecchi anime that genuinely works for me, that uses sex to its benefit and not its detriment, that succeeds because of, not in spite of, its baser instincts. Until then, though, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord should serve as a reminder of how easily this kind of story can go wrong, how easily the supposed draw of sexy girls can overwhelm and poison the actual merits of the world you’ve created. I didn’t hate it, but for what those first couple episodes hinted at could have been, I am interminably frustrated with what we actually got.

It's designed to be playful and funny.What ruins this anime is it's abrupt and rushed show of sympathy and vengeance. No build-up, no emotion. To reaffirm, like hentai anime with no sex but more pointless plot. No depth in characters, straight to the point. As the story goes, plot becomes predictable.Not much to complain about animation except the plot and dialogue are average and that played a huge role in deciding if...this is exciting or not. It is not an exciting feeling. this is exciting or not. It is not an exciting feeling."", ""Not gonna lie the anime is meh. The character development is meh. Animation is meh. A lot of moments in this anime are very cringe. If knowing that you still wanna watch it then go on ahead.To elaborate more , this isekai's main character seems too natural at using his powers. he doesn't have to learn anything so he never really struggles. Most isekai tend to make characters at least have some sort of weakness when they get transferred into another world. not in this one. The other characters following the MC are extremely boring and cringe, making character development almost non-existent. Only a single...character in this anime managed to please my interest but the very last episode took it all away.The battles are all one-sided making the animations extremely short and disappointing. I can't really make a comment about the fan service as being part of art. I recommend watching other animes specified more towards that goal than this one.None of the music we're memorable to me. hence why I gave it a mediocre score.Overall I disagree a lot with the overall score of the anime. But perhaps some people reviewed it and it was one of their first isekai anime. I will not be watching the second season , I rather find a series with better character development and story context than this one. character in this anime managed to please my interest but the very last episode took it all away.The battles are all one-sided making the animations extremely short and disappointing.

It’s about a socially awkward and shut-in NEET who is summoned into his favorite MMORPG as his character, an overpowered self-proclaimed demon lord known as Diablo. The only thing that’s “new” here is that the protagonist doesn’t die at the start of the series, but is instead summoned into the game’s world without any explanation by a cat-girl named Rem and a female elf with huge jiggly boobs named Shera.--- The...technical aspectsLandscapes and buildings in this anime are generic, they’re the kind of stuff you can find in any garbage isekai or crypto-isekai. Though they don’t look ugly, they aren’t that well drawn, except maybe in the first episode. The character designs are… very meh. Some are decent, like Shera and Rem, as they fulfill their purpose of being cute, but most of them (Celestine, Emile, Galford and others) are extremely lazy. Take the protagonist Diablo for example: he has the generic video game demon character design, meaning he’s just a normal human with small horns on his head (in his case, they are fake) and some weird tattoo on his face, much like the demons in Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken and the demon lord in Hataraku Maou-sama! At least he look somewhat like a demon lord, contrary to some series where the “demon lord” is just a regular-looking human with overpowered abilities. There’s also the usual bullshit where males of the evil race are monsters and the females are human females but they have horns and pointy ears – they wouldn’t be fuckable if they were monsters, huh? As usual, magic in this anime is mostly just cheap and ugly magic circles. The animation is okay most of the time, though there are some moments with very little actual animation, and there can be inconsistencies in the characters’ faces.Sound-wise, the background music isn’t good, sometimes even bad. Same for the generic opening. I’d say that the voice-acting is mostly good, except from Shera’s irritating voice.--- It’s an ecchiSo our protagonist is summoned into his favorite game Cross Reverie (light novel writers stop using random foreign words challenge) by a cat-girl and an elf, who both cast an enslavement spell on him to make him their summon, but the spell is reflected by one of Diablo’s skills, and the two girls are turned into his slaves. You can see where this is going. This anime is a ecchi of the harem type, with the usual stuff like the protagonist sharing a bed with his two slaves, ear nibbling, boob fondling, skimpy clothing for almost all female characters (Rem, Shera, the guild master, the slave trader, Edelgard, Klem), jokes about boobs’ size, suspicious camera angles, and bath scenes with the girls groping each other.Is the ecchi well done? Since it is very predictable and makes the female characters uninteresting, ecchi is always bad. But in this anime, the ecchi elements are surprisingly decent, at least for the first half of the series. After that it gets more and more stupid, as the series attempts to justify the ecchi elements with the plot: touching the girls’ breasts replenishes magic, staring at Shera’s boobs allows Diablo to makes potions, and to resurrect the demon lord Krebskulm who is kept inside Rem, Diablo has to finger her – yeah!--- There are rare moments where the comedy is decent… with Emile Bichelberger’s appearances, for example, but only in the few early episodes, as the series gets more serious after that – serious meaning cheesy and boring stuff about friendship and the like. One thing that is quite funny to see in the few early episodes is that, being a socially awkward incel, the protagonist has to role-play his demon lord character to be able to talk to people.--- Sadly, this gets repetitive quicklyNot only this, but as the series progresses, Diablo speaks less and less like a demon lord, and more and more like your average otaku protagonist, saying sappy lines about friendship, making your own choices and so on. In short, Diablo is as much of a demon lord as Maou Sadao in Hataraku Maou-sama!, meaning he’s not a demon lord at all. In the entire series there is not a single time where he acts like an actual demon lord, except maybe from one particular moment in ep.4. Most of the time he helps people, saves his friends, fights bad guys, is idealist, and spares his enemies – even if they tried to rape and kill his friends!--- The protagonist’s actions are incoherentIn ep.4 Diablo fights a Fallen (the Fallen being the bad guys of the series) who tried to kill Rem, since he is overpowered he has no trouble defeating him, and then he kills him in a really painful manner to punish him for harming his friend. But later in the series, when he defeats the Elven king who tried to rape Shera, Shera makes Diablo spare him because “he’s family”… Seriously? Same thing for Galford who attempted a goddamn genocide. Same thing for Edelgard and Alicia who tried to bring back Krebskulm, the true demon lord of Cross Reverie. Same thing for the demon lord Krebskulm, who is forgiven for her past crimes since she is actually just a normal loli. Yeah let’s keep a half-resurrected demon lord around, there’s no way that could go wrong – spoiler: it went wrong!This is not the only thing that’s inconsistent in Diablo’s actions. Coming back to the moment where Shera’s brother, the Elven king, tries to rape her, he first brings her back to the Elven kingdom by hypnotizing her. When this happens, Diablo, who knows that she’s being hypnotized, goes to bed and cries like a little bitch instead of doing something to stop her brother. He is overpowered and knows what’s happening, he could easily beat him up and force him to release her, but he doesn’t. Why? Because the night before he had a dream about how lonely he was in his childhood. Ridiculous! I mean, if Diablo just starts acting like the average friendless otaku, there’s no point in watching the series anymore.--- Another annoying thing in this series is the namesI already mentioned earlier that the name of the game was completely random: “Cross Reverie” –  why not “Square Cauchemar” while we’re at it! A random english world and a random french that the author put one after another, probably because he thought that it would sound cool… it doesn’t you dumb fucking cretin. The names in general are random. Some sound German, like Krebskulm, some are Anglo-American like Chester Ray Galford and Greenwood, and some are french, like Celestine Baudelaire (you know, like the poet) and Emile Bichelberger. As a french person I can tell you that these names sound ridiculous, and that hearing them made by ears bleed.--- The world-building is plain genericThere’s little development. There’s only two countries, and everything happens either in Faltra (basically the starting town of the game) and its surroundings or in the Elven kingdom. It’s a MMORPG world, so you have the usual stuff that you find in any isekai or crypto-isekai, with video game mechanics like classes, adventurer’s guild, quests, summons, levels, skills, MP and so on. Nothing new or interesting.--- Yet again, pedophiliaComing back to Krebskulm / Klem, she’s added to Diablo’s harem right after her resurrection, and Shera invites her to join her and Diablo in the bed, because you know, having sexual intercourse with children is cute and wholesome, apparently. And when Diablo enslaves her with a spell, he has to kiss her. She’s always nearly naked, by the way. I don’t care that she is 3000-year old or some other bullcrap, it doesn’t change the fact that she looks and acts like a child.--- The protagonistI won’t talk about Diablo’s personality much, as he is just your usual isekai male protagonist. It is established from the beginning of the series that he is overpowered, as his level is super high, he has overpowered equipment and skills like magic reflection, and so you know that he is going to win any fight with little to no trouble, whether it be against an army of Fallen, the ruler of the town, or the actual demon lord. He defeats most of his enemies in a matter of a dozens of seconds, one or two minutes at most, except from Krebskulm, whom he defeats with the power of friendship (gah!).--- The other characters aren’t much betterAs in any ecchi, female characters exist purely to be cute, sexy, or just a walking fetish, and as a result they are bad characters. This is the case for Shera, the elf that has huge jiggly boobs (in anime, female elf equals huge boobs if you weren’t aware), that’s her only personality trait. Ah, no, actually she’s also childish and has an irritating high-pitched voice… ugh. Her background is also pretty shit. She’s a princess who wants to be an adventurer because “blah blah blah freedom blah blah blah follow your dreams”… you get the idea. Even her dream is ridiculous: she wants to open a café with Rem and Diablo!Then you have the cat-girl, Rem. A slightly less shit character because she has an actual objective and a  better background, but she’s still mostly here to be Diablo’s plaything.Both of these girls are too weak to fight by themselves, but thankfully for them Diablo is always here to save them.The demon lord Krebskulm / Klem is just your average loli, she even has the moe face expressions and the chibi face at some moments. Because of her incomplete resurrection she forgot her memories and how to use her demon lord powers, and so instead of acting like an actual demon lord and killing people, she just wants to eat biscuits with Shera, with whom she sings a “biscuit song”… This is just stupid and unfunny.The bad guys are even worse. Shera’s brother is cartoonishly evil. He is just your typical garbage anime villain that is easy to hate because he is a rapist with the generic anime psycho face and the generic evil laugh. Same thing for Saddler, the paladin of the church (or something like that, I didn’t pay much attention to the lore of this generic MMORPG world), who is also an evil psychopath with an evil smile who loves to torture and kill, but this one thinks he acts for good and claims he is god, constantly spouting nonsense about salvation and whatnot.--- VerdictThis is a very generic series with nothing remotely good or new in the setting, the story, the characters, the animation or the music. There are only three things that aren’t completely garbage, namely: the protagonist role-playing a demon lord, the very rare comedy elements, and the ecchi elements, which are decently done, but are not good enough to make the series worth watching. While it is an easily watchable show, it belongs to the trash can. technical aspectsLandscapes and buildings in this anime are generic, they’re the kind of stuff you can find in any garbage isekai or crypto-isekai.

Wimps upon wimps upon wimps, is there any japanese author that has the balls to do anything significant?This serie would have been a 7, if not for the plot of the last 3 episodes. In reality just one bitch, the red haired girl ruined the whole experience. Lets examine other stuff.Anime is decent, classic op isekai protagonist with the classic anime harem, with a fantasy setting. Even if the trope is the same, if the story is good, you can enjoy it. And the story was good till the red haired bitch made an entrance and the author decided it was...time to fuck up.Lets check what happened: Red haired girl literally left one of the main girl protagonist to be tortured and die in front of the Demon King. She knew she would have died, or for the torture or for the Demon King. So she should be punished in some way, like the lizard that pleaded sorry for his life but was mercilessly killed by the Demon Lord, right? Sorry, the author is a bitch. Could massacre entire male population but everything is forgiven for the female one. They could literally poison and kill the MC, but what do you know, she had a past where people told her different opinions than what she had and thus she wanted to exterminate everything, so all is forgiven.Literally ball sack level of forgiveness for that character. She didn't have any sad past or violent one, just that adults told her to do something in a different way but she didn't want and thus decided to kill everyone.Drawing too many boobs must have fried the authors brain. First episodes were really enjoyable, now i don't want to have anything to do with this anime that still has that bitch free to do whatever harm she likes with no consequences.Not only that, but to move the plot, the author rewrites character personality in the moment. Panther Girl was willing to die than to harm the torturer that were torturing her. Can the demon king only kill? Can she not harm them only? Because that's what the MC has been doing this whole time and she had no poblem with it till that moment.I was going to give it  a 4, but the more i write about the bitch and the dumbification of the character, angrier i get...

Sakura Taisen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/561/Sakura_Taisen,"['One of the problems with visual media like anime, TV and movies, is that they are all extremely competitive businesses, with numerous production companies and studios all vying for a share of the viewing audience. The upshot of this is that more and more often the audience is subjected to a remake, a formulaic cash cow, or an adaptation of a successful game. That\'s not to say there isn\'t anything original in anime from one season to the next, however the fact that anime is a business means that the shows that are more likely to be produced will be of the type that are...almost guaranteed to make money.It\'s unfortunate then, that money seems to have been the driving force behind this series of Sakura Taisen.Based on the long running and highly successful game series, the original Sakura Taisen OVA was a well thought out addition to the franchise that sought to enhance the game\'s storyline. However, as with any famous franchise, Sakura Taisen became a victim of it\'s own success when, in 2000, the decision was made to remake the original OVA into a 25 episode TV series.The story, as with the game and original OVA, follows the exploits of the Teikoku Kagekidan - Hanagumi (Imperial Assault Force - Flower Division), a team of female ""mecha"" pilots who protect Tokyo from various supernatural assaults. By day, however, the team work in productions for the Imperial Grand Theater, with several members achieving a degree of fame because of their acting ability.One day, a new member of the ""theater"" arrives. She is Shinguji Sakura, the daughter of Shinguji Kazuma (the hero of the previous Demon War), and the master of Hokushin Itto Ryu Kenjutsu. However life in the big city takes some getting used to...Now, the one thing that really stands out about the plot is how different the first and second halves of the series are. The first half is a tedious, drawn out trawl through mediocrity that lacked the punchiness of the OVA, and to make matters worse director Nakamura Ryutaro (Ghost Hound, Kino no Tabi, Serial Experiments Lain, REC), saw fit to add several filler episodes. The story takes an almost unbearable amount of time to begin explaining exactly what is going on, however, once the viewer reaches the second half of the series, the plot becomes far more active, tense, and flowing.The unfortunate side effect of the tedious first half though, is that many people may find themselves dropping the series within a few episodes, and even I will admit that I was sorely tempted to do just that. However, if you\'re able to stick it out, then the second half of the series is well worth watching.As far as animation goes, the TV series is a good deal better than the OVA, and this shows in many of the action sequences in the second half of the series. However, in terms of character and mecha design, the TV series is simply equal, which is a little disappointing. The designers have done nothing more than copy what has gone before, with no real effort made to improve the look or feel of the characters, settings or mechas. Granted this lends the show the feeling that it truly is part of the Sakura Taisen franchise, but personally I would have preferred a more dynamic approach to the design, especially as this is supposed to be an alternative version rather than a simple remake of the OVA (which means there was scope for some creativity).One of the high points in terms of production is the quality of the voice acting, as the seiyuu are the same as the ones from the original OVA. Because of this, the acting throughout the series is actually better than the OVA, however this is also due to the fact that the TV series runs for 25 episodes rather than 4. The music used throughout the series is also of a higher standard, however some of the tracks can become a little repetitive over the course of the show.Given the length of the series, one would expect the characters to have undergone a degree of improvement, however the stolid first half of the series lacks any real effort to develop them in any substantial manner. Given that many of the characters are stereotypes in anime, especially when compared to what\'s around nowadays, one can only regard this as a lack of planning during the development stages. As a rule, stereotypical characters are the ones that need the most development in order to separate them from the pack.One of the problems with the characters is that there is an assumption that the viewer is already familiar with either the games or the OVAs, and it\'s unfortunate that this lack of foresight was prevalent during production as the latter half of the series really does make all the difference. If the same effort to develop the plot and characters had been made in the first half, then this could have been a very good showThat said, I found that once I got over the hurdle of the first half, Sakura Taisen TV turned out to be a rather enjoyable series. The fact that the series remains one of the few steampunk shows available earns the series a degree of kudos, especially as the genre is a rarity in anime. The initially dull, filler strewn episodes may be a huge turn off for anyone who isn\'t already a fan of the franchise though, however fans of steampunk may find the show, especially the latter half, to be worth watching. On the whole, the show is worth a try if you\'re willing to get past the first half as while it really is slow to start, there are some entertaining moments along the way, and the second half really makes up for a lot.In all honesty, I\'m not sure how to compare this to any other series. The combination of steampunk and samurais, ""romance"" and mechas, theater troupes and the supernatural, makes for a very interesting mix, and one that works very well with the right sort of effort and planning. It\'s just unfortunate that, given the fact that this is not simply a remake, but more of a re-envisioning, the opportunity to improve the series was wasted in favour of retaining the the authenticity of the original games and OVA, a decision that I can only assume was spawned from a desire to cash in on the franchise once more.Ultimately, Sakura Taisen TV is a bit of a mixed bag. The original OVA had a certain charm that lifted it from mediocrity, and the fact that it wasn\'t simply retelling a story, but was instead adding to it, made all the difference for me. While the TV series does have its plus points, the fact that it takes so long to get started is a big let down.Chalk this one up to another wasted opportunity. almost guaranteed to make money.It\'s unfortunate then, that money seems to have been the driving force behind this series of Sakura Taisen.Based on the long running and highly successful game series, the original Sakura Taisen OVA was a well thought out addition to the franchise that sought to enhance the game\'s storyline. However, as with any famous franchise, Sakura Taisen became a victim of it\'s own success when, in 2000, the decision was made to remake the original OVA into a 25 episode TV series.The story, as with the game and original OVA, follows the exploits of the Teikoku Kagekidan - Hanagumi (Imperial Assault Force - Flower Division), a team of female ""mecha"" pilots who protect Tokyo from various supernatural assaults. By day, however, the team work in productions for the Imperial Grand Theater, with several members achieving a degree of fame because of their acting ability.One day, a new member of the ""theater"" arrives. She is Shinguji Sakura, the daughter of Shinguji Kazuma (the hero of the previous Demon War), and the master of Hokushin Itto Ryu Kenjutsu. However life in the big city takes some getting used to...Now, the one thing that really stands out about the plot is how different the first and second halves of the series are. The first half is a tedious, drawn out trawl through mediocrity that lacked the punchiness of the OVA, and to make matters worse director Nakamura Ryutaro (Ghost Hound, Kino no Tabi, Serial Experiments Lain, REC), saw fit to add several filler episodes. The story takes an almost unbearable amount of time to begin explaining exactly what is going on, however, once the viewer reaches the second half of the series, the plot becomes far more active, tense, and flowing.The unfortunate side effect of the tedious first half though, is that many people may find themselves dropping the series within a few episodes, and even I will admit that I was sorely tempted to do just that. However, if you\'re able to stick it out, then the second half of the series is well worth watching.As far as animation goes, the TV series is a good deal better than the OVA, and this shows in many of the action sequences in the second half of the series. However, in terms of character and mecha design, the TV series is simply equal, which is a little disappointing. The designers have done nothing more than copy what has gone before, with no real effort made to improve the look or feel of the characters, settings or mechas. Granted this lends the show the feeling that it truly is part of the Sakura Taisen franchise, but personally I would have preferred a more dynamic approach to the design, especially as this is supposed to be an alternative version rather than a simple remake of the OVA (which means there was scope for some creativity).One of the high points in terms of production is the quality of the voice acting, as the seiyuu are the same as the ones from the original OVA. Because of this, the acting throughout the series is actually better than the OVA, however this is also due to the fact that the TV series runs for 25 episodes rather than 4. The music used throughout the series is also of a higher standard, however some of the tracks can become a little repetitive over the course of the show.Given the length of the series, one would expect the characters to have undergone a degree of improvement, however the stolid first half of the series lacks any real effort to develop them in any substantial manner.

It appears part of the anime\'s influence comes from a popular all-girl theatrical group in Japan called the Takarazuka Revue, considering the girls occasionally perform drama performances in theatrical plays as a means to hone their spiritual powers. The series offers enough depth on all the girls to explore their personalities and backgrounds, devoting episodes to focus on aspects of each character. While their characters are somewhat cliched, they are still a likeable...bunch and undergo differing degrees of growth throughout the show\'s run such as Sakura learning to gain confidence in her skills, Sumire learning to value Sakura as a teammate and Iris learning to trust use of piloting the mecha.However, the battle with Aoisatan and his group are too cliched and shallow to get attached to and is the major weakness I found with the series as a whole. The whole thing plays out as a traditional ""good vs evil"" battle with Aoisatan desiring the destruction of Tokyo for rather shallow reasons when more of his past is revealed and his allies don\'t get much in the way of fleshing out as their only roles are to serve as obstacles in Sakura and her group\'s efforts. The series plays out the typical cliches you can expect of this storytelling approach where the team get random power-ups and get conveniently saved in the nick of time in situations where the odds seem dire in their efforts.In terms of presentation, Sakura Wars is somewhat standard for a early 2000s TV anime, but has its high points. It sports beautifully drawn scenery shots of 1920s Tokyo with character designs looking well designed and pleasing on the eyes with subdued color tones. The series employs a steampunk-like style in depicting the technology and mecha used by Sakura\'s group which work well with the anime and is a unique style that sticks out from many anime titles of the mecha genre. Animation is a bit subpar with some use of CG animation that is poorly rendered and sticks out like a sore thumb, with action sequences not being too engaging since the choreography plays out in a typical style and occasionally employ shortcuts.The soundtrack to this series certainly sticks out enough, consisting of musical-style lyrical tracks and traditional insert music playing along to the time period of the series. It works nicely with the historical setting of the series and the theatrical theme that gets employed in some episodes, but there were no particular tracks that stuck out for me to make the series memorable.Overall, my reception to Sakura Wars is rather mixed. While having some nice fleshing out of characters and the Takarazuka-like premise being a rather unique one for an anime title, it still sticks to conventional territory to a good extent with the mecha anime approach it takes and the good vs evil approach it does with its storytelling. I think I would have liked this anime more if it was more focused on the Takarazuka-like performances and character developments/ bonding than trying to mix it up with the mecha genre. bunch and undergo differing degrees of growth throughout the show\'s run such as Sakura learning to gain confidence in her skills, Sumire learning to value Sakura as a teammate and Iris learning to trust use of piloting the mecha.However, the battle with Aoisatan and his group are too cliched and shallow to get attached to and is the major weakness I found with the series as a whole.

I accidentally found this anime when I was playing the game called Project X Zone. This was the first time I was introduced to these characters and I did some research. I didn't really quite expect for the characters to be fighting inside a robot, honest. Ironically enough, the main character of this anime is Sakura and Oogami (which he was for the games).I understand why Sakura is the mc here because of her inheritance of the sword and of course how huge her spiritual powers...are. This is why she is more important that Oogami. (Sakura Wars games can be seen like a Otome game for boys, because you can date the girls there). The anime side is more focused on defeating the Wakiji and the development of the mc.As of the characters side, it started off me hating one of the characters how cringeworthy she is and of course the famous noble woman laugh.

Good show but maybe thats all it needed to be"", ""This review is written in 2 parts, the first being my review as someone who didn't know anything about the Sakura Taisen series, and the second being my review as newly made fan of the series.This review is honestly pretty hard to write, because the Sakura Taisen anime is a pretty decent show all things considered, but it's the first anime I ever watched that made me feel like I had to do homework in order to get the full enjoyment it deserves. Being a spinoff loosely based on the games, they take advantage of this and assume that the viewer has already played...at least the first 2 games in the series (Sakura Taisen & Sakura Taisen 2). If you watch the show with no prior knowledge of anything about the series (like I did), characters are only half introduced, or sometimes not given an introduction at all. That's not to say that the characters are bad, but there's just this major feeling that the show is assuming that you already know about these characters and the setting, etc. The first half of the show is spent trying to give some depth to the main characters but unfortunately I wouldn't consider it sufficient in any way. It just comes off as filler-y, which is such a waste and is really what kills this anime. If the show just spent the time to properly flesh out characters to an audience that knew nothing about the series this show would be an easy recommend. That feeling of needing prior knowledge nagged at me so much that I decided to sit down and play the first Sakura Taisen game to acquire some of that knowledge the show wanted me to have. But as you might imagine, it's hard to recommend a show that makes you do homework to enjoy it, especially when that homework is playing 2 entire video games. For that reason, unless you're willing to commit to becoming obsessed with a series you've never heard of before, or willing to watch what will turn out to be a hugely mediocre show, or you seriously just have nothing better to watch, it's probably best to skip this one.With that being said however, as a newly made fan of the Sakura Taisen series I actually enjoyed the show quite a bit. It's simply a very fun spinoff of the games that was enjoyable to watch. The main story, despite being only loosely based on the game's story, is still fairly good. Unfortunately there's no ignoring the mediocrity of the first half though. Even if you played the games already, they don't introduce any new information about the characters, so it is still is very filler-y, and at best it comes off as just playing in service to the fans, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The whole show definitely plays in service to the fans and it's part of what made it so enjoyable to watch. The music is all rearranged and rerecorded versions of music from the game, including the opening theme which is just the main theme of the whole series, and there's quite a few easter egg moments but they don't beat it over your head and it doesn't feel overdone. The first 3 episodes even act as a short prequel to the first game even if the show technically isn't cannon with the games. The show as a whole definitely could have been better, especially if it was more streamlined, cutting out all the filler, making the ending feel less rushed, and of course doing a good job of introducing the characters to a new audience. Even still, I think it's better to see the show for what it really is, which is just a spinoff show of an anime game series. It was never going to be a 10/10 masterpiece because it wasn't made to be one. This show was purpose made for fans of Sakura Taisen, which is why I felt like it needed the two separate reviews.

The same could be said for its alternative; that there are things you\'ve missed about something you didn\'t give a hoot as a kid and that maturity would have surely allowed you to see things in a different light and now appreciate it. In case of Sakura Wars however, none of it was true.In short, Sakura Wars the Animated Series was as disappointingly, harrowingly lackluster for me as both a...kid and an adult. It should\'ve had it all for me: the 90\'s aesthetics, dieselpunk, and kickass motiff music. All I got was a mixed salad of overdramatic storytelling, ridiculous pilot system, and janky pacing. As a kid, I\'ve come across this show in a regular time but found myself unable to sit through an episode and unable to be hooked on either its action nor plot. While my friends and I would discuss shows like Dragonball and Yuyu Hakusho frenetically and giddily, Sakura Wars, which was airing at the same time was never brought out. It was universally ignored and basically had no appeal whatsoever to our group. ""There was something amiss"", I\'ve thought when I recalled the show while I was lazily browsing on the net one day for shows to watch, ""I remember distinctly the character designs and its theme song but why can\'t I remember anything else about it?"". So I have it a chance. Boy do I regret it.Sakura Wars is about a theatre troupe who goes moonlighting as military pilots defending Imperial Japan against all sorts of monsters and threats from the otherworld, or atleast that what the plot implies. Within that generic plot were some slice of life episodes featuring the characters in their day to day woes, trainings, and just... existing. Sakura Wars has a very interesting world set up, ya know... theatre + mecha in an industrial period sounds very compelling yet the direction the show had made it so dull. The mood was way too grim even when a scene is supposed to be lighthearted, the inner workings of the mecha was... spiritual energy?? It\'s frankly quite infuriating how lazy that was, especially when it\'s supposed to be dieselpunk. It feels shonen yet with the dressing of a mecha, hence it\'s like eating a sandwich filled with sushi. It just did not mix well. Most of all, the pacing was way too slow for what it is and likewise glancing over details that could have given us insights on the characters and skipping scenes that could have been good. The villains are cookie-cutter cardboards, with weak motivation, and none of them are memorable at all.Some characters are well-designed, notably Sakura, Kanna, and Sumire with their simple but pleasing traditional appeal. The others however are interchangeable with other shows of that era. The characterization was notably dull, either they are generic or that they feel way too overdramatic. It was a shame though, as the characters could have been atleast given attention that the mechas were closer to Evangelion mechs that the gritty, weighty exosuits I\'ve thought they would be.Music-wise, the main theme was still as kickass, memorable, and in my opinion, one of the most beautiful songs ever made melodic-wise. It\'s lyrics are cheesy as heck but I cared not. It\'s ed are not slouches either. The ost within the show are quite meh though.To sum it up, Sakura Wars could have used a better director and editing, better character work and a better explanation. The plot was serviceable, if not something you\'ve seen better executed in other shows. The villains suck, most characters are nothing special except for Sumire who was probably the reason why I didn\'t bring my score lower.

Shirobako Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28105/Shirobako_Specials,"['It’s not very often you come across a bonus episode or two that are so unique and refreshing that you have to take a deep breath after each one and reflect on how well it suits the series it is based upon and how much entertainment value it adds to the whole package. It\'s even rarer to think that a special episode can leave you craving lots more of something you didn\'t even know you desired until now! Shirobako’s pair of specials do just that and offer a truly one-of-a kind experience that you don’t get from your usual OVA extras.First of all, you should...know that Shirobako’s special episodes are not exactly “Shirobako” episodes, but rather each episode is a standalone introductory episode to each of the fictional anime created by the characters of Shirobako during the series. Because of this, anyone can pick up these extras with little-to-no knowledge of Shirobako and have an enjoyable time. The plots simply don\'t relate. Fans who’ve already seen the anime series will likely be even more entertained by the numerous allusions and references to the original series made throughout each of these episodes. The only major downfall here is that each extra episode does not directly represent Shirobako in any way, so outsiders might not get an accurate taste of what they’re in for if they are judging whether or not to watch Shirobako.The first special is an introductory episode of “Exodus,” the parody idol group action comedy that the animated cast of Shirobako spent the first half of the series working hard to produce at “Musashino Animation.” During the early episodes of Shirobako, we’re led to believe that Exodus is kind of a misguided and generic anime series as well as a parody of the industry itself, but in the 24 minute time frame of the special episode, it goes well above those expectations. Exodus presents itself as a very cleverly-written and self-aware genre-breaking comedy and does so with the same humorous charm and quality found in Shirobako. As the idol girls discover someone close to them has been murdered, they begin a pointless, yet hilarious journey to wherever they run off to next. This episode was certainly more enjoyable than I ever would\'ve expected.Second batter up is “Aerial Girls Squad” which is the second false anime to be featured during Shirobako’s latter half. It is an adaptation project that in itself is somewhat parodying the likes of Strike Witches or Girls und Panzer with its military theme and forced vehicle trivia to satisfy the studious type of otaku. Again, despite being a parody of a genre, Aerial Girls somehow finds a way to distinguish itself among other anime and really hooks the viewer from the start with thrilling action, well animated CGI, and interesting characters. P.A. Works really went the extra mile to make Aerial girls feel authentic and feasible – even moreso than Exodus in my opinion. The only knock I can give Aerial Girls is that it feels slightly more detached from Shirobako than the Exodus special.So really what does that mean for these specials?  Well, if I’m honest, I wouldn’t so much called them specials as I would actual ""pilot episodes"" of future anime. There’s no joking in that statement. Each one of these episodes feel like a real-world anime first episode that you could tune into at the turn of a new season. It’s really astounding how far P.A. Works leaped to accomplish this feat. There is an equal amount of passion and care crammed into each of these OVAs that can also be found in the critically acclaimed Shirobako series. P.A. Works always shines through it\'s original stories and their talent continues to flourish in these little exhibitions. Not to mention the studio had to write these original stories, create new color palettes and character designs, and assemble an entirely new cast for each of the shorts. That\'s a lot of dedication for something that can only be found on the BD/DVD release.On their own, if I were to rate these as individual episodes of their own respective titles, both would top at around 8/10 for being incomplete, but still having great entertainment value. In fact, I think it’s a shame that most people will overlook these specials because I truly, strongly believe that each of these fictional shows could stand their ground on real television as a full-fledged series, despite their parodic nature. I would love to watch both of these if they were real. As a whole though, this adds immense closure and satisfaction for Shirobako fans and opens new doors  for people who might be interested in any of the 3 stories presented. These specials are definitely worth your time and maybe if they are popular enough, the studio may consider extending these spin-offs! After all, they put a ton of work into making these! Don’t let the efforts of P.A. Works or “Musashino” go to waste!! know that Shirobako’s special episodes are not exactly “Shirobako” episodes, but rather each episode is a standalone introductory episode to each of the fictional anime created by the characters of Shirobako during the series. Because of this, anyone can pick up these extras with little-to-no knowledge of Shirobako and have an enjoyable time. The plots simply don\'t relate. Fans who’ve already seen the anime series will likely be even more entertained by the numerous allusions and references to the original series made throughout each of these episodes. The only major downfall here is that each extra episode does not directly represent Shirobako in any way, so outsiders might not get an accurate taste of what they’re in for if they are judging whether or not to watch Shirobako.The first special is an introductory episode of “Exodus,” the parody idol group action comedy that the animated cast of Shirobako spent the first half of the series working hard to produce at “Musashino Animation.” During the early episodes of Shirobako, we’re led to believe that Exodus is kind of a misguided and generic anime series as well as a parody of the industry itself, but in the 24 minute time frame of the special episode, it goes well above those expectations. Exodus presents itself as a very cleverly-written and self-aware genre-breaking comedy and does so with the same humorous charm and quality found in Shirobako. As the idol girls discover someone close to them has been murdered, they begin a pointless, yet hilarious journey to wherever they run off to next.

It is incredibly unique among OVAs due to it not being a side story or a sequel to the parent story. Rather, these are the first episodes of the fictional anime shows whose creation progress is the plot of Shirobako.These two anime shows created in Shirobako are completely different in genre so naturally these two episodes are also completely unique and different from each other. Each one would have actually deserved its own review.The first OVA is the first episode of ""Exodus"", the anime produced in...the first half of Shirobako. It\'s a story of a group of 3 idol-wannabe girls who get framed and have to run away from the police while still trying to realize their dream. It\'s a light, comic anime. I won\'t give any further details because since this is only a single episode, every further detail will basically be a spoiler. If this were a real anime I\'d probably give it a 7.The second OVA is the first episode of ""Dai 3 Hikou Shoujotai"", the anime produced in the second half of Shirobako. Completely different in genre from Exodus, this one is basically a thriller. It\'s about a group of five combat pilot girls from five different countries (Japan, USA, Russia, Israel and Sweden) who join forces with basically the entire world\'s air force (or rather what\'s left of it) to fight-back against a mysterious enemy of the human race, referred to as the ""builders"". Again, this is only a single episode so every further detail would be a spoiler. If this were a real anime I\'d probably give it a 9.If you plan on watching these I will point out that the biggest drawback is that these are anime which could have easily been real shows, but unfortunately they aren\'t - only these first episodes were ever made. While ""Exodus"" is just your average idol-parody anime, not too interesting and its end is presented in Shirobako, ""Dai 3"" is amazing and it is very unfortunate that this episode will leave you waiting for a continuation that will probably never come. Even with the parts of the story told in Shirobako, the plot is not nearly complete. I\'m writing this review after watching Shirobako a second time - the first time I had hopes that this will be picked up as a real anime but 4 years later that doesn\'t seem to be the case, which is a real shame because it could have easily been a huge success.Bottom line - If you\'re OK with a good story that begins but never ends then these are definitely worth watching, however I probably guess that at least some people will decide to avoid these due to that very fact.Sound and art are OK, could have been better. the first half of Shirobako.

The show revolves around an anime studio making anime so it’s a bold meta move to make your two OVA episodes literally just the first episode of each of the shows the characters in the show were making in-universe. They were fun, well made, and honestly, I was pretty entranced the whole time with the audacity of it all, but at the end of the day I would have probably liked something a little more traditional.

Count me sold I thought at the time. But no, alas, it\'s yet another case of ""interesting premise, bad execution"".Actually no, it\'s worse than that. Bad execution can sometimes lead to amusing trainwrecks, this is just overly bland. I had just finished watching the last episode a few hours ago and already I\'m forgetting plot details.One of the main issues with this is how it lacks any sort of...focus. Even within the Isekai stuff which takes up like half of the season, it jumps between slow life, business management, (boring) political intrigue, and there are some battles in there too. I could not give less of a shit for most of these, and Marc-san\'s Mild Ride taking up the bulk of the Isekai segments made me wonder why Sasaki is involved with any of this at all.It\'s not like the other segments fare any better either. The Real World segments are even more messy. You have the show juggling between many plot threads with his supernatural spy agency and evil espers, then suddenly they throw in Mahou Shoujos who use a different magic system altogether. I wouldn\'t have minded any of this if the show have given proper buildup, development, and payoff to these sudden shifts in the narrative, but the original author seemingly just dumped them whenever he got bored of a particular plot thread.But the biggest crime in all of this is how boring everything just ended up being. Even Sugita and Yuuki Aoi sound like they\'re phoning it in most of the time. But even if the voice acting was good it still wouldn\'t save the show from siphoning away your life energy the more you look at it. There is just way too much boring expository dialogue that don\'t contribute much to the mess of a plot and just serves to bore you even more.In short, if this was like your very first show after watching nothing but Netflix, then yeah, maybe you\'d find some kind of enjoyment from how different it is, but just don\'t bother with the show.I guess the one saving grace is that the OP is unintentionally funny.

Sadly, it never really matched those highs again. Still, I enjoyed it for what it was and would recommend it. There’s definitely more than enough to separate it from your run of the mill fantasy seasonal. It does have a fun cast of characters and an interesting world, it just felt underutilised at times and chaotic.Sasapi doesn’t really do anything new. Just recently, we’ve had shows like Roukin8 that featured working age...MCs going back and forth between worlds to make money selling goods. But, Sasapi is the first show to have that element mixed with magical girls, a secret government organisation and science fiction. While it sounds crazy, all of this stuff just really works in the confines of the story. The problem is the show introduces so many concepts that it has trouble balancing them all. Some cool characters like Hoshizaki or the neighbour girl get introduced and then kind of fade away as the show goes on, which is a shame because they were the best parts for me. That’s done in favour of a political negotiation arc in the isekai world, which I personally could not care less for. I’m not sure if this was just how it was in the books or an issue with the adaptation, but it felt like it needed 3-5 more episodes to really do justice to everything, either that or reduce the time spent in that arc. The story is at its best when it focuses more on Sasaki and Pii taking on magic users on earth with the government agency and selling stuff to the other world on the side.Sasaki himself is a cool character. He’s not a generic degenerate otaku, but just a regular salaryman who’s standing still in life. Not able to advance up the ranks in his company or get a raise, he’s stuck in a cycle of overwork and exhaustion until he finds magical talking bird , Pii in a pet store. Their relationship is the cornerstone of the series and I liked seeing them come to understand one another and support the other’s weaknesses. Despite coming from different worlds they’re able to form an unbreakable bond over mutual pain and good old chateaubriand steak. The slice of life moments with them are authentic and tender. It reminded me a lot of a buddy cop dynamic which I’m a big fan of.The production values also took a step back after the premiere episode. It was an hour long premiere and you could tell a ton of time went into it. But the action scenes after that felt half baked and even character models didn’t look as good.  It’s not horrible, but definitely a noticeable downgrade. Luckily, this isn’t an action heavy series so it’s not always apparent and you can still enjoy the show.I enjoyed Sasapi despite its flaws. The characters were fun and Sasaki and Pi’s banter was a great way to end my week on Fridays. I went out and bought the Light Novel as well so I’ll be reading that too. I’d recommend this anime for fans of urban fantasy, Japanese toxic work culture, or just working adults who want someone you can relate with as a protagonist for once.Sasapi gets 7, out of 10.

This anime tries to be so many things all at once: a supernatural, a fantasy, a slice of life, a gourmet, etc. To be brutually honest, I don't think this show knows what it wants to be. The main selling point behind Saski and Peeps is the fact that the MC, Sasaki, travels between his world and the fantasy one, thanks to his Peeps, his magical pet. This anime is at its best when the two worlds actually have some benefit to one another, whether that be Sasaki taking his business expertise from the real world into the fantasy...one, or when he uses the magic he learns in the fantasy one to fight other magicians in the real one. Outside of that, Sasaki and Peeps struggles to balance the plotlines that happen in the two worlds. There's very little cohesion in this show, which leads to awful pacing since the writing has to just pull stuff out of its ass in order to move things along. Sasaki and Peeps really feels like if someone took two completely different anime and clogged them together without putting in the effort to justify the contrasting themes.

Among the many characters introduced (with polarizing traits), not a single one left a lasting impression on me; the connections between the characters were also very weak. Perhaps this was intended with much ambitions yet to be fully showcased; but for the audience, it was annoyingly chaotic.The story's progression mainly revolved around the male protagonist Sasaki getting entangled in various issues in two different worlds and smoothly resolving them by navigating between various factions. The anime tried hard to portray Sasaki as a mature problem-solver, but the lack of persuasive problem-solving...methods makes it difficult for the viewers to resonate, especially those with years of experience in the workplace.

It's hard to predict where the story will end with current pacing.Ep.1 took viewers on quite a ride. The first few minutes seemed like a healing slice-of-life story, but all of sudden the main character Sasaki was teleported to isekai by a talking bird. Then Sasaki got into trading for a while, but somehow he learnt magic and was forced into some secret government agency dealing with supernatural power IN REAL WORLD (?!). Not to mention the mysterious teenage girl living next door, who showed toxic love towards this 40 y/o man (wtf?), but seemed to have nothing to do with either isekai and secret agent…There were a lot going on, but they were all parallel with no clear connection points. It felt like a dish with too many ingredients.Up until ep.3, the storytelling had been straightforward and lacked a clear focus. Sasaki was a typical salaryman, and to be honest there wasn't much fun watching him doing corporate things in isekai.

Why is the rating so low? I feel compelled to make a review..I appreciate anime like this where the MC is calm, collected, and mature.There is a certain charm to it. I don’t need to be stressed about stupid actions, decisions, and words~ which escalates simple plot..MC’s actions are witty, cunning but professional, and mature but at the same time not too overly complicated since the events/plot itself is not too convoluted. The MC’s typical sales person character is quite appealing to me as well since 1. It’s realistic 2. its a breath of fresh air from the usual bullish type MCs.One of...the comedy aspects of the anime dwells around mahou shoujos… well… weird but it’s not overly dwelled on so it doesn’t bother me that much.Anime’s title is Sasaki and Pii-chan, so it’s mainly about these two… so dw about the mahou shoujos lolFirst season is really more on their life in Pii-chan’s world.. love the pacing here.. it’s not overly stretchedI’m thinking with how season 1 ended, we might see more of the Sasaki’s-world in season 2I enjoyed the not so complicated sub plots and the business-like handling of events by MC..Give it a try and judge for yourselves:) the comedy aspects of the anime dwells around mahou shoujos… well… weird but it’s not overly dwelled on so it doesn’t bother me that much.Anime’s title is Sasaki and Pii-chan, so it’s mainly about these two… so dw about the mahou shoujos lolFirst season is really more on their life in Pii-chan’s world.. love the pacing here.. it’s not overly stretchedI’m thinking with how season 1 ended, we might see more of the Sasaki’s-world in season 2I enjoyed the not so complicated sub plots and the business-like handling of events by MC..Give it a try and judge for yourselves:)', 'Sasaki and Peeps - Is this show an Isekai, Reverse-Isekai, Fantasy, Adventure, Comedy, all wrapped into one? This feels like an over-convoluted and a fictional existential mistake...Let\'s all be true to ourselves: Isekai, in the traditional sense, can be easy to write. It\'s the creativity portion that is the hardest to keep the entire story consistent and interesting and can even send authors scrambling for the next plot device that no matter how orthodox the story can go; it must remain entertaining. And this is what happens when you encounter a work like novelist Buncololi\'s Sasaki to Pii-chan a.k.a Sasaki and Peeps, the LN series...where the mundaneness of one leads him to find new entertainment, and that entertainment spans worlds and characters of many proportions alike, with the work winning the first place in the Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! a.k.a This LN is Amazing! 2022 rankings in the tankobon (i.e. independent/standalone) and novel categories.Sasaki to Pii-chan is the result of plot devices like treasure boxes opened after one another to reveal surprises of gifts that never stops giving. And this journey starts with the middle-aged blue collar worker Sasaki, who finds his corporate work rather mundane (and who doesn\'t feel drained after work?). To fill the empty void in his life, he visits a pet shop on a whim to find a pet companion who could keep him company. What he does not realize that the pet that he eventually bought, a small gray Java Sparrow who has an affinity for Kobe chateaubriand beef from learning of humans in the pet shop, is actually a renowned sage from another world who is using the bird\'s body as a vessel for its exploits. With Sasaki more or less coming into terms with the bird he names Pii-chan a.k.a Peeps, the Star Sage grants him access to its world, revealing the other world where Sasaki can commit to interesting things, like making a trade business and most importantly, a restaurant as a source of income for Peeps\'s obsession for chateaubriand beef.But one of those benefits of the otherworldly things, is that Sasaki is granted magic powers as a sort of medium if danger comes towards at his corner, which back in his world, is picked up by a secretive government-independent Bureau who handles all matters pertaining to psychics residing on Earth. Sasaki being forced and tested to join the Bureau to apprehend any rogue psychics going loose, from criminals...to even Mahou Shoujos or other entities who are seeking refuge to the Bureau? Hell, Sasaki earning his powers for the purpose of peace and comfort, but with all of the colourful characters popping one after another, the salaryman\'s life is becoming more taxed than his mundane life would allow him to live and breathe life anew.So first out of the docket, the character relations bracket:- Peeps\'s world: the Otherworld faction, where Sasaki and Peeps mainly do business with at the start. His business trade of bringing over modern items to the otherworld to be sold for exact in profit, it involves Marc, who reports to Viscount Mueller as the overseer of the city\'s trades.

Sasaki\'s role in the Bureau is quite the extension: from random Mahou Shoujos like Magical Pink, to even the high school girl Otonari living next door to Sasaki, but someone who seems to also keep said salaryman on close toes, even to the point of overhearing Peeps being able to speak human terms.

But back to Sasaki and Peeps, the push for Mirai Minato to train up new directors while spanning his own project, he may have been in the major directorial role since Winter 2017\'s Masamune-kun no Revenge, so he has the expertise to still sufficiently allocate resources within their sizable staff in order to keep the final product consistent, and it\'s decently produced as a whole.Sound-wise, it\'s as decent as the whole show can make its psuedo-Disney-like fantasy to play out with many gears clicking together like clockwork.

It\'s definitely an interesting LN to pick up and read if you have the time, though the anime\'s in a very tough spot of pacing issues and coherence to keep its interest running.If you\'re keen on trying the anime, even if it\'s just for the sake of know-how, go ahead, it\'ll show you a world of infinite proportions. where the mundaneness of one leads him to find new entertainment, and that entertainment spans worlds and characters of many proportions alike, with the work winning the first place in the Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! a.k.a This LN is Amazing! 2022 rankings in the tankobon (i.e. independent/standalone) and novel categories.Sasaki to Pii-chan is the result of plot devices like treasure boxes opened after one another to reveal surprises of gifts that never stops giving. And this journey starts with the middle-aged blue collar worker Sasaki, who finds his corporate work rather mundane (and who doesn\'t feel drained after work?). To fill the empty void in his life, he visits a pet shop on a whim to find a pet companion who could keep him company. What he does not realize that the pet that he eventually bought, a small gray Java Sparrow who has an affinity for Kobe chateaubriand beef from learning of humans in the pet shop, is actually a renowned sage from another world who is using the bird\'s body as a vessel for its exploits. With Sasaki more or less coming into terms with the bird he names Pii-chan a.k.a Peeps, the Star Sage grants him access to its world, revealing the other world where Sasaki can commit to interesting things, like making a trade business and most importantly, a restaurant as a source of income for Peeps\'s obsession for chateaubriand beef.But one of those benefits of the otherworldly things, is that Sasaki is granted magic powers as a sort of medium if danger comes towards at his corner, which back in his world, is picked up by a secretive government-independent Bureau who handles all matters pertaining to psychics residing on Earth. Sasaki being forced and tested to join the Bureau to apprehend any rogue psychics going loose, from criminals...to even Mahou Shoujos or other entities who are seeking refuge to the Bureau? Hell, Sasaki earning his powers for the purpose of peace and comfort, but with all of the colourful characters popping one after another, the salaryman\'s life is becoming more taxed than his mundane life would allow him to live and breathe life anew.So first out of the docket, the character relations bracket:- Peeps\'s world: the Otherworld faction, where Sasaki and Peeps mainly do business with at the start. His business trade of bringing over modern items to the otherworld to be sold for exact in profit, it involves Marc, who reports to Viscount Mueller as the overseer of the city\'s trades.

The first double-episode painted a simple but charming premise. But the style of storytelling is perhaps even worse than your typical Shonen series. Instead of new information and episodes helping to build and enrich a developing plot, it muddies any cohesiveness the series attempts to create.Sasaki to pii-chan writes you a letter within the first episode. Instead of just redrafting the letter to form a more consistent tone, each new episode is the equivalent of a postscript (p.s.) note. Revelation and progression genuinely feels like an afterthought.The series may as well be episodic...because the subplots do absolutely nothing for the bigger picture.Every character besides Sasaki and Pii-chan are plot devices, nothing more. One such plot device gets themselves into some trouble. It's pretty difficult to care given the superficiality.The major flaw of Sasaki to Pii-chan lies within its storytelling.

While in the middle seat between an egregiously overweight couple who are spilling over into your personal space, covering you in their tricep sweat, you can snuggle up comfortably in your warm moist cocoon as you place your phone on your laptable next to your peanuts and coke to immerse...yourself in the wacky and wonderful world of Sasaki and Peeps.Why is it the perfect show for such an oddly specific and mildly nauseating situation? This is because neither you nor the couple sandwhich you find yourself between will be able decide whether funny bird cartoon is more interesting and attention-grabbing than the latest news article about another critical mechanical failure on a Boeing airplane.With the trauma dump over, let\'s cover the show.To start, the first episode is a double length feature which covers all of the basic world and character building you need to begin understanding what is happening in Sasaki and Peeps\' lives. While this might be a turn off for some,  the length is necessary and actually very well-paced as it perfectly lowers you into what is a chaotic mess of a universe. Imagine having to explain a fever dream to a friend where you have a magical talking bird from another world take you under their wing to live a dual life in said other world while teaching you magic, only to come back to the your own world to be recruited by a secret psychic organization that polices other psychics, all while being hunted by magical girls with a vendetta against psychics. That\'s not an easy task and the production team somehow managed to do all of that while sneaking in nuanced bits of future story and character developments to keep you coming back for more.However, from Episode 1 on the pacing never really changes and the emotional Rollercoaster of trying to figure out where the hell all of this is going mellows out into a comfy isekai-but-also-not-isekai show. It is mildly disappointing since now there\'s a fairly large disconnect between the two main worlds of the series, Isekai and Not Isekai, since it\'s not realistically possible to tell a cohesive story or plotline in either without devoting several episodes, making it all feel like an appeal point than a crucial plot device. That\'s not to say it isn\'t well-written and interesting, it\'s just that there\'s so much density to the information and story that I think even the Light Novel, having not read it yet, probably struggles to contain and organize it all.But given all of this it is a breath of fresh air that the characters are written fairly competently and make rational decisions in such an unrational setting. Everyone has a goal and role that they play with different tools to achieve them, and a lot of their scheming and machinations when revealed show no major illogical leaps purely for the sake of progressing the plot. My only complaints are that the limited screen time make a lot of them feel one-note in personality and desire, and everyone is written like how a middle-aged man sees them and hopes they act.There are no major deviations from expectations which while grounding the story does take away slightly from the excitement.Now as for recommending the show, I do.

I really want to know more about some characters and stuff !"", ""When I watched the first episode I was very interested in how an employee got into isekai because of his pet bird, and he started learning magic, doing business, and participating in noble politics there.But I started to feel 'less like' when there was the concept of superpowers in the 'first world' especially with the government superpower organization, I think it just messed up my interest.I started to get interested again during Marc's rescue mission, where it was shown how Sasaki could solve big problems on his own without Pi-chan's help. However, again and again even at the end of this anime I was disappointed...with the story in the first world which was boring to watch.Yes maybe this is just my selfishness, I'm just telling my impression of watching this series without knowing where the real story of this anime is going. with the story in the first world which was boring to watch.Yes maybe this is just my selfishness, I'm just telling my impression of watching this series without knowing where the real story of this anime is going."", 'The main story is about an office worker and a pet bird he bought.Imagine if you took all fantasy tropes, put them in a blender and let it blend.What you will get is Sasaki to Pii-Chan.It involves multiple elements of fantasy anime.Somehow they managed to keep it coherent and interesting and enjoyable.If they did not take it seriously, this would have been the ultimate parody anime.But since they do, it is a good fantasy anime.The MC nature and back story are developed.But there are many side characters to keep track of who will be underdeveloped....Writing - 8/10Character development - 7/10Direction - 7/10Editing - 6/10Overall an enjoyable unique fantasy anime.

The tamagoyaki dulls the umeboshi flavour a little and makes it less dominant, and when you mix it with mayonnaise, the umeboshi flavour combines with the mayonaise REALLY WELL. I swear, as of writing this, it's been the best tamagoyaki that I've ever had (although I must admit that all the tamagoyakis I've had have been home-made by me and even so I haven't had that many), and in my opinion, this anime is good just for giving me free...cooking knowledge.The anime is also pretty good. The story is pretty good aswell. I like the fact that there are two coexisting storylines that might intertwine in the future. Both storylines are pretty good, and the anime doesn't stick to the classical isekai structure, since it's not the protagonist being forced into going to another world. It's sort of a reverse-isekai, but since Sasaki gets to go to another world, it's not fully reverse-isekai. I also like how Sasaki is somewhat opportunistic, as he transfers goods from both worlds for monetary gain, which most people in his position would also do. But he does it with respect to both worlds and purposefully avoids harming them, and infact helps both.The animation overall is okay. It could be better, but also much worse. The combat scenes leave a little to be desired, and there are some oddly animated scenes, but it isn't too bad if you focus on the storyline.In my opinion, the show is worth watching (especially because of the tamagoyaki tip), and I'm liking it so far. So if you like isekai and anime like One Punch Man, and especially if you're interested in learning how to make your tamagoyaki better, I would recomment you give it a try.Also door girl is best girl. cooking knowledge.The anime is also pretty good.

This is actually pretty interesting, all my favorite episodes were centered around this plot. Peeps and all his friends are likeable characters. Then, there's the psychic plot in the real world. These episodes were always boring. Then, they introduced magical girls. Any plot points around the magical girls were pretty pointless and again, boring. Some fight scenes felt really slow and drawn out, and especially in the last couple of episodes the music did not fit at all. And in the last episode, instead of wrapping up any of the...plot points they introduced, they added 2 new ones in the last 2 minutes of the episode. The anime really just didn't know what plot to follow and overall felt messy and disconnected.My biggest complaint about this series is how every character except like 4 are teenage girls. One very obviously has a crush on our 40-something main character. Nothing inappropriate happens, but it still makes me roll my eyes.

The main difference is that Sasaki is not only more matured but also smarter - which is realistic for an old guy with some more experience. However, that doesn\'t mean it\'s better.basically we have like 3 different story plots which are mixed while also feeling more like just a slice of life show:- Sasakis travel to another world thanks to his new...""pet"" Pii-chan- Sasakis work for an organization which keeps an eye on (and also fight against) users of special powers to protect the people- something about Magical Girls who hunt down those users of special powers- ther is also an other story but I don\'t want to spoil you - even though it\'s introduced literally in the last seconds...So, is this Anime good? ... Well, yes and no.The stories aren\'t bad per se but the mix is kinda as bad as in Isekai Cheat Skill - but at least Sasaki acts careful to hide his true abilities as good as possible. Also, there are cute Gilrs who don\'t just fall in Love with him instantly, even though I\'m not 100% sure if the neighbor girl sees him as a potential lover or as a father figure. But unfortunately she never gets really fleshed out.However, the biggest weakness in my eyes is, that there is little to no tension at all. You almost never get the feeling that Sasaki is in danger. The only danger is his secret to come out but that\'s everything. That counts for both main story lines. Therefore, I think it would have been better to either seperate them in form of different Anime or put more effort in the mixing. And if not that, than maybe do it the other way around, give a f*ck about logic and a good mix, to create a guilty pleasure to enjoy. Maybe you think that Isekai, special ability Users, Magicians, Magical Girls and so on are too much to fit in together, but Re:Creators already showed in a masterful manner how to achieve that goal.Last but not least, the music/sound. Well, it\'s nothing special but it\'s also not bad. The OP sounds Shounen like but doesn\'t fit so good for Sasaki. The ED however... OMG! It doens\'t sound bad... BUT the visuals are just POTTENHÄSSLICH! (I had to pu it in german since englisch words can\'t describe my eyecancer from this). To put it simply, if I wouldn\'t know the Anime and someone would show me the ending, I wouldn\'t build any interest in it.

This parts has more fights we see Sasaki in he’s work and how he try to keep he’s second life in secret. While the Peep’s world is more about politics and I guess business? We see Sasaki helping the kingdom,make money and mostly have a more relax atmosphere. But with some political issues and how Sasaki solves them.This anime has good and bad parts.Which some of bad -arts came in later episodes.Good parts: Sasaki and Pii-Chan. Good and interesting main characters Sasaki is not your typical middle age loser. He is a smart businessman and can use he’s head. While Peeps is the cutest little bird who is not annoying and not useless. Some of the supporting casts are pretty interesting too especially Futari and Mueller. When the story contains Futunari it’s mostly gonna be interesting.The other good part in this anime is Peeps world I really love that world more because it was not ruined for me. It did stay interesting while give a change in development in the story without making it to complicated.Bad parts: Sasaki’s world. I really think that this world was more interesting in the start but in the later episodes the writer put too much and it’s just started to be unnecessary complicated and not explained enough.Magical girl I really think this part of the story is unnecessary and we can live without it happily.Overall: This anime has great potential but because of unnecessary characters and too much things happening just in 12 episodes it loses a lot of appealing it has in the start . And As I understand the second season gonna be bring even more plot twist which is definitely not gonna help us. This anime needs more focus and stop giving situations which gonna be solved in like 10-15 minute and after that directly give us another problemOther things: The animation did get worse to the end but was not critical and still stayed on a good note. I didn’t have any problem with voice acting too.

Sasaki's just a good dude that you enjoy getting ahead in life for once. Good on you Sasaki, now what's that thing you did saving a person's life? You have powers? You've been recruited by the state as a field agent.The story's progression and mix of themes is ludicrous, you have him traveling between worlds, exploiting modern technology in a medieval world, taking people back with him, a powerful magical mascot pet, magical girls, espers and many more things. It sounds like a mess but the story takes its time and doesn't just jumble it all up.Hopefully this all sounds great to you, so here's why it's a 'mixed feelings' recommendation.It's one of those 'they don't have the budget/skill but they try hard' kind of shows, where the visuals are choppy and often bad, but what they do with them looks fine. They're just barely scraping by, making important visual/action scenes just good enough.Audio's fine (nothing special) and the music is bland, which is a real shame because if the music is on point it can elevate a show more than most animation can.Where the show drops the ball, is that some of the developments just aren't interesting and especially how long one particular story drags out (saving a friend who just hasn't been set up well enough). The way it's resolved is fine, but it's a true missed opportunity where you could've had some real character development and have had Sasaki loosen up and get emotional over someone, rather than 'I must do the right thing'.Finally, you have to take all of this with the fact that I'm biased in favor of it. The isekai portion is... okay, it's not as sloppy as it could've been, it actually plays a decent role throughout the season, but it's also not great and that's the feeling I get when reflecting on the show that I really like it, but it's just not great, in any way, and that might leave you wishing you hadn't seen it.Personally? I want another season of this over stuff like the Classroom of the Elite S3 that we just had, because at least Sasaki and Peeps has some heart. him when he does something, he doesn't come off as some sort of genius, he just does his best.Meaning...

They're just barely scraping by, making important visual/action scenes just good enough.Audio's fine (nothing special) and the music is bland, which is a real shame because if the music is on point it can elevate a show more than most animation can.Where the show drops the ball, is that some of the developments just aren't interesting and especially how long one particular story drags out (saving a friend who just hasn't been set up well enough). The way it's resolved is fine, but it's a true missed opportunity where you could've had some real character development and have had Sasaki loosen up and get emotional over someone, rather than 'I must do the right thing'.Finally, you have to take all of this with the fact that I'm biased in favor of it. The isekai portion is... okay, it's not as sloppy as it could've been, it actually plays a decent role throughout the season, but it's also not great and that's the feeling I get when reflecting on the show that I really like it, but it's just not great, in any way, and that might leave you wishing you hadn't seen it.Personally? I want another season of this over stuff like the Classroom of the Elite S3 that we just had, because at least Sasaki and Peeps has some heart."", ""Sasaki to Pii-chan has a good begining like a decent isekai anime where the MC is the one who obtain a superpower, but the poor execution of the story were disappointing. This anime failed to entertain me even though it started with something interesting.Here is the only thing I like about this show is the main character Sasaki and his pet Pii-chan, other than that is not in my interest. I'm losing interest at the first 3 episode, the world building is weird, the pacing is messed up like they didn't really care about the progress and skip it to the aftermath, too many plot...hole and questionable things. If you wanted to watch some light and enjoyable slice of life anime, this one is not recommended because the plot contain a weird political stuff and a lot of weird characters which has no background that I think 12 episode is not enough to make an explanation about all that and the ending was terribly questionable.

It follows the adventure of a little kitten that wants to be human and the family that takes her in.  Even though the viewers see her as a little girl, she is an average cat.

I don\'t know what it is, but she\'s deathly afraid of this kitten.StoryThe story seemed like one that you would see in an old cartoon from the 90\'s or 80\'s.  It\'s not a riveting plot.

To give more context to that statement, Ōshima’s body of work is very similar in affluence to Moto Hagio’s manga. In fact, Wata no Kuni Hoshi is said to be the genesis of the cat girl fad, that is still an on-going phenomena in anime. This film is similar to Angel’s Egg, in its surreality and ambiguous message… furthermore, it explores the psyche of a prepubescent girl.—Characters/StoryThe story begins with an abandoned humanoid kitten, Chibi-Nekko, who is subsequently scooped up on a...rainy day by an 18-year-old rōnin, Tokio, who has fallen on hard times because of his inability to pass the entrance exams, in order to get into university. His mother has a phobia of cats, which she refers to as an allergy, but it is apparent throughout the film it is more of a deathly fear. Despite that, she allows Tokio to keep Chibi-Nekko because she is worried about his mental health and taking care of Chibi-Nekko brightens his mood.*A rōnin refers to a student in Japan that has failed to enter a school at the next level. Rōnin was originally derived from the Meiji era term that means a ‘masterless samurai.’ Rōnin became reinterpreted in modern day Japan as a term for wandering students because they have no leader to serve. It’s seen as somewhat of a shameful or derogatory term because wandering samurai in the Meiji era were required to commit seppuku, suicide by disembowelment, upon the loss of their master. That, in and of itself, adds a bleak connotation to the title. Other examples of rōnin in anime are: Keitarō Urashima from Love Hina, Hideki Motosuwa from Chobits, and Yūsaku Godai from Maison Ikkoku.It is never clearly stated whether humans see the cats as actual cats or anthropomorphized cat people. Tokio’s family treats Chibi-Nekko like a normal domesticated cat, but the Cat Maniac appears to have a homoerotic attraction for Raphael, a white-haired bishōnen cat. This makes it confusing on what stance to take when Chibi-Nekko falls in love with Tokio. It seems like they can’t verbally communicate but maybe this whole film is a metaphor for adolescent men and women, who are so socially divided that they have difficulty communicating with each other.Chibi-Nekko believes that all cats grow up to become humans. Tokio falls in love with a beautiful young woman, named Mitsuko, and after that, Chibi-Nekko is desperate to become a human girl. Raphael informs her that it is impossible for a cat to become human and proceeds to tell her of a mystical paradise, called Cottonland, where dreams can come true.Chibi-Nekko runs away from home in search of Cottonland but cannot find Raphael. Instead, she runs into a scruffy cat named Buchi-Nekko Suzuki and they drift around in search of the ever elusive Cottonland. After a fruitless pursuit, Chibi-Nekko ends up near Tokio’s house and his mother is finally able to overcome her fear of cats.The emotional catharsis of this film was feeble and the journey with Chibi and Buchi-Nekko was the weakest part of the whole movie! And ultimately, an unsatisfying conclusion! It’s sad because I was initially invested in the these characters… that may be in part because of the unique concept but the delivery just didn’t drive it home for me.I read a few complaints online about the age difference between Tokio and Chibi-Nekko, but I don’t think it was creepy at all because Chibi-Nekko’s feelings for Tokio are unrequited. Younger women get crushes on older guys all the time, it’s a normal part of growing up for many women in their adolescence. While it doesn’t necessarily cast a favorable light on shōjo manga, there’s a large sub-genre that consists of a certain female fantasy—younger girls being comforted by older men.This comes in all varieties, from a woman in her ‘20s being attracted to a man in his ‘50s or ‘60s: an example of this is Ristorante Paradiso. Or there are a few female mangaka that have written stories like Usagi Drop or Kodomo no Jikan, relatively more controversial and risqué. I don’t believe that the vantage points of these stories are told to promote pedophilia or child grooming, more so, it is easier to convey a characters’ trauma and selfishness through a child’s eyes because the audience is less likely to harshly criticize the character. Many people are often so mentally regressed through childhood trauma that they are unable to see themselves as anything other than a ‘child.’This is mirrored in Usagi Drop with the scene involving Rin’s mother, Masako Yoshii, an adult that is incapable of responsibility outside of her artistic career and must be constantly nurtured by her boyfriend to stay afloat. Despite being written as a 5-year-old at the beginning of the series, Rin Kaga is obviously meant to represent someone who is much older. The same can be said about Rin Kokonoe in Kodomo no Jikan, if you ignore the gross fanservice, she is written to act like a broken woman rather than a child.Another example of the nurturing fantasy, is in Moyoco Anno’s Kantoku Fuyuki Todoki (EN: Insufficient Direction). This manga is a biographical gag manga about Moyoco’s life being married to Hideaki Anno and, in it, she refers to [Hideaki] as the ‘Director’ and herself as the ‘Baby.’ Even going so far as to portray herself as an infant with a pacifier. This isn’t because she’s promoting pedophilia but, more so, showing a need to be babied by her husband.There definitely are instances where young children in anime are fetishized but there are other examples in which child-like characters is meant to convey a sense of vulnerability to the audience.
