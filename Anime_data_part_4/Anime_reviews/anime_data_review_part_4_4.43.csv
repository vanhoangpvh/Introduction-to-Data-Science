Haou Taikei Ryuu Knight,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1848/Haou_Taikei_Ryuu_Knight,"[""Lord of lords Ryu Knight.It's a show I just happened to bump into while browsing the web and started out of sheer boredom. But I soon came to love it and consider it an all time favorite.Story:The plot is a fairly common one.Evil creatures trying to take over the world and the heroes who try to stop them.Something I liked very much about it was the combination of mechs with swords, old style guns, and even magic, for fighting.At the time I had never before seen a mech show that used magic and swords, all the animes I had seen with mechs were sci-fi.And I...thought/think it was very cool, and that it was pulled off well.A 10 from me for story. ^^Art:(Style)The art style is very similar to Slayers and other series made around the early nineties.Triangular eyes, pointy(ish)feet, etc etc.I use the same art style when I draw, so I obviously like it very much.(Animation)I personally, am a huge fan of all early nineties shows because of the animation.Before computer generated animation became so big, and more importantly, so accessible.(cheap)A 9 for animation from me.Sound/music:The sound effects I'm sure were very good for their time.Though now, over ten years after the show was made, they aren't as impressive.Though I wouldn't say their bad.The music I remember liking while I watched it. After I watched it I bought as much merchandise from the show as I could find, most of which was CDs. And after listening to the music separately from the show I totally fell for it. The music is great! Awesome listening!A 6 on sound and 10 on music, so 8 overall.Character(s):I love all the characters in Ryu Knight.From the dramatic Sarutobi, to the greedy Katze.From the sweet and naive princess, to the evil, misguided Galden.Every character is very different and there are several characters.So no matter what type of person you are, or what type of character you like, you are bound to find a character to love in this series.A 10 for the characters.Enjoyment:I loved this series to death. As I said at the beginning of this review, I started watching the series, which gets off to a...rather slow start, out of boredom.But now it's one of my all time favorites.With it's skillful balance between comedy and drama,I looked forward to the episodes as much as I looked forward to the episodes of Slayers I watched with my sisters when I first started watching anime 7 years ago.A feeling I didn't think I'd get again.So for me personally, it was a hugely enjoyable experience.A 10 for enjoyment. ^^Overall:I will leave you all with this.I remember very few animes I have enjoyed so thoroughly.From the art, to the characters.I enjoyed it all.It is a wonderful mix of all the different aspects of anime.My overall score for it is 10.I would highly recommend it to any anime fan, be they young or old,well watched or new to anime.This is not a series anyone can afford to miss. thought/think it was very cool, and that it was pulled off well.A 10 from me for story. ^^Art:(Style)The art style is very similar to Slayers and other series made around the early nineties.Triangular eyes, pointy(ish)feet, etc etc.I use the same art style when I draw, so I obviously like it very much.(Animation)I personally, am a huge fan of all early nineties shows because of the animation.Before computer generated animation became so big, and more importantly, so accessible.(cheap)A 9 for animation from me.Sound/music:The sound effects I'm sure were very good for their time.Though now, over ten years after the show was made, they aren't as impressive.Though I wouldn't say their bad.The music I remember liking while I watched it.

Hiyokoi (2012),https://myanimelist.net/anime/15895/Hiyokoi_2012,"['I absolutely loved Hiyokoi, so when I had heard that more were soon (or later) to follow I was excited.  I found these today and started to watch.  First of all they are extremely short running at only 1-2 minutes per episode and there are only three.So the story basically follows after Hiyokoi the first special.  The short girl nicknamed chick and the tall boy in an incredibly short amount of time bond and overcome an obstacle.ART:  It almost felt as though they took colorful pictures and flashed them in the screen to show movement.CHARACTER: I really liked...the characters, but if you haven\'t seen the first special you won\'t really know who they are and what they are about.  These three shorts do not give you much insight.  They only give you a slight overview of what you already know about the characters.ENJOYMENT: For as short as they were, I have to say my enjoyment was more than I thought it would be.  It did tend to be a bit cute.  I would say watch it if only for a teaser.OVERALL: My overall experience for this left me questioning, ""why cruel world couldn\'t these be longer!"" I wanted more, and it left me wanting more.  I really don\'t think I could say anymore about these because they are so short.  I look forward to them continuing the show into a full series.  Unfortunately if I gave the scores I did because I was hoping for more, and looking for more. the characters, but if you haven\'t seen the first special you won\'t really know who they are and what they are about.

I hope this gets another go, the 2nd and 3rd episode was disappointing.This would have been an 8...if  the other episodes followed the first. if  the other episodes followed the first.""]"
Joker Game: Kuroneko Yoru no Bouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33129/Joker_Game__Kuroneko_Yoru_no_Bouken,"[""After a thrilling episodic anime, Kuroneko Yoru no Bouken comes like a dessert, keeping the same flavors the previous meals had.The story is meant to be both funny and serious. Given the fact that the MC is a cat, we get to see the 'human' side of the spies from the outside, when they’re not squeezing out their 396.5 IQ solving Enigma's secrets, memorising maps in two seconds or hiding their identity. That’s not all the story has to offer in two short episodes of 4 minutes each. I was pleasantly surprised to feel the same vibes of mystery I felt watching the anime.The...action in Kuroneko Yoru no Bouken happens before Joker Game, during the training of the eight spies.The OP is a shortened version of the original opening; same background music was used to intensify the atmosphere.I enjoyed watching this as much as Joker Game’s best episodes.Overall8/10--Thank you-- action in Kuroneko Yoru no Bouken happens before Joker Game, during the training of the eight spies.The OP is a shortened version of the original opening; same background music was used to intensify the atmosphere.I enjoyed watching this as much as Joker Game’s best episodes.Overall8/10--Thank you--""]"
Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10079/Hoshizora_e_Kakaru_Hashi,"['""INCESTUOUS HOMOSEXUALS!""T\'Was my first impression on this anime but fortunately it has none of that.Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi or in English, A Bridge to the Starry Skies, or in the French, Un pont vers le ciel étoilé (everything sound sexier in French) is based on a visual novel made by Feng whom I\'m not familiar with any other works. (Known for making the visual novel Akane Iro, which was then adapted into an anime, that was a disaster) Having finished this galge using a lousy translator program that killed every emotional scene that the eroge had to offer (Yes, you know I\'m talking about you...ATLAS and AGTH!) I\'ve decided to watch the anime to displace that horrible, horrible visual novel translations with better subs.So if you\'re a hardcore follower of ""Way of the Harem"" you should know by now that every typical Harem lead must somehow ""dispose"" of his parents. This statement stands true for Hoshino Kazuma, our Harem lead. But unlike other harem animes, his parents absence is actually feasible. They\'re not on a world tour or fighting aliens or working overseas... Kazuma and his younger brother were sent to the countryside because of his younger brother\'s health condition and it was mention in the anime that his parents ""will join them eventually.."" Sounds plausible.In this new town, he met a girl, fell on top of a girl, kissed a girl, called a pervert, caught naked, got teased for a small d*ck  and the list goes on. A cliche harem story you say? NOT SO FAST! (Feng apparently have a fetish for accidental kiss. Nothing wrong about it. That\'s as close as you can get to non-jail-able sexual harassment)I\'ve decided not to review this anime based on the visual novel. In defense of harem animes being critized by it\'s cliche-ness and never ending quest to satisfy our ""fan-service"" needs, I shall judge a harem anime as a class of it\'s own, not to be compared with other types of genres. Thus I present to you, ""The Harem Deviation Calculator""Using the following formulaH= 3/(n-2) x (N!/n) x (Y)^1/2 - TKρWhere..H represents the Harem Scoren represents the number of girls in the haremN represents the number of different type of girlsY represents the dependency of the male harem leadK represents the magnitude of “cockblockers”Ρ represents the dense-ness of the male harem leadT represents the cohesion of the fellow female membersLet\'s begin shall we?Number of girls in the harem:A total of six main girls and two subs. And one little brother.Types of girls: [This will be a simplified version]Nakatsugawa UiAirhead[✓], Big Appetite[✓], Older brother complexity[✓], First Kiss[✓]First Girl Rule[✓]Hinata IbukiArcher girl[✓], Possessive[✓], Anti-Pervert[✓], Tsundere[✓]Koumoto MadokaMiko[✓], Androphobic[✓], Shy[✓], Childhood friend[✓], BOING![✓]Friendzoned[✓]Sakai HinaYuri-able[✓], Elegent[✓], Soft toy fetish[✓], Enjoys talking to in-animated objects[✓], self-conscious[✓]Toudou TsumugiOlder Sister[✓], School Idol[✓], Clumsy[✓] , hard working[✓]Toudou KoyoriStrong will[✓], energetic[✓], kind[✓], tomboy[✓], Innocent[✓]Hoshino AyumuWait hold it... Oh thank god. I almost mistaken his younger brother into his harem..Well as you can see the characters are greatly varied however I am shocked that a glasses girl isn\'t present. It\'s a great loss for glasses fan everywhere...Dependency:Well Kazuma is reliable enough to take care of his younger brother, thus gives him a significant amount of credit for this. Although he does not have any super power or super human abilities, he is athletic so I guess that counts in a way towards his dependency score.Cockblockers: LowYorozu Senka, the lady in charge of the inn where the Hoshi brothers are staying. Probably the first non-blood relative to have saw Kazuma\'s other little brother (You know what I\'m talking about) Although she supports Kazuma having healthy relationships with other girls, her positive attitude might just instill more awkwardness between the Kazuma and his ""choosen"" girl. Other than that, he does not have a younger sister which would mean less ""caught in the act"" events. (Though I rarely see a younger brother in harem genre before)Dense-ness: ModerateModerately dense. He is aware of some of the girls\' feelings for him. (But not all of them)Cohesion: HighAll the girls are on friendly terms with each other. Well yeah, this is quite common in a harem. But the plus point is that if one of them got into a relationship with the main harem lead, I can assure you, yanderes won\'t be present. (Which means no severed heads and boat rides) nor would he have to cut ties with any of them.So overall, what is the verdict?[HAREM EXPECTATION INDEX METER]-HOSHINO KAZUMA- HAPPY HAPPY FUN TIMEPositive but still a cliched harem (low deviation score)So there you have it. Fairly nothing exceptionally interesting ever happened in the anime. Art and sound wise is just slightly above the average line. Characters do not really have a noticeable impact on the audience. There\'s also a lacking amount of fan-service thus reducing the enjoyment score for those who actually was hoping for it. But if you find yourself wanting to contribute to the research of harem genres, then go ahead and watch this.Thanks for reading,Haremu Kingu,Signing off! ATLAS and AGTH!)

I haven\'t played that visual novel, more specifically I don\'t play visual novels at all, so I cannot comment on the coherence of the adaptation. Instead, I am going to analyze and critique this anime as a standalone work.Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi tells the story of two brothers who are in the process of moving homes. As they\'re looking for a place to stay, the older brother (Kazuma) gets lost in a forest. He meets a girl, and of course, he ends up ""accidentally"" kissing her. This is the...beginning of the girl, Ui, and Kazuma\'s romantic relationship. They also happen to go to the same school; good lord, the coincidences. And that\'s about it. The entire story is about how Ui and Kazuma will manage to confess their love for each other; exactly why I give the story a ""5"". Not surprising, though, as this is a visual novel adaptation after all.This isn\'t to say that the story is completely smooth as I made it out to be; there are a few edges in this anime\'s romance, it isn\'t just a straight line. In the end, you could see where the story was going, and the characters were fairly easy to read. To be honest, Hoshizora could\'ve been something great if it weren\'t so linear. It has beautiful art, an amazing opening, and a likeable set of characters. It\'s just a shame that its story is so bland; don\'t expect too much when you\'re watching this anime. There is also never any sort of major conflict. Despite that, it is still a refreshing anime that you can unwind and relax while watching. Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is not a bad anime in the slightest, and there are some bright moments within it. Overall, an enjoyable watch that is unfortunately shallow. beginning of the girl, Ui, and Kazuma\'s romantic relationship. They also happen to go to the same school; good lord, the coincidences.

And he accidentaly kisses Ui and Ibuki saw them and so Kazuma's new life begins in the school where he transferred and make matters worse Ibuki and Ui is his classmate ....Art: 9Art. Some people don't love the design of the arts in other anime but Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is one of the best art i have ever seen the background is nice it's well detailed and because it's a small town there's not much building you will see in this anime.Sound: 9Really love the sound.

HOSHIZORA E KAKARU HASHI IS REALLY ENJOYABLE!"", ""Let me get this straight, the main reason I started watching this is because that picture reminded me of Shuffle!Hate it or love it, Shuffle! is among the best harem shows I've ever seen.But that's not all, when I saw that it's a Seinen, I imediately thought that I'd see something even more mature that Shuffle! (and more down to Earth - not that the angel/demon thing bugged me too much).The first episode was astounding, the art was the first thing I noticed and let's be honest, it desevers a 10.More importantly, the art is similar to Studio Key so my hopes increased tenfold(Think Kanon...2006, Clannad, Air...See what I did there?)High hopes heh?Well let me tell you that my sweet little dream about a more realistic and mature Shuffle! was crushed to smithereens and thrown into the deepest pit of Tartarus.No plot, no character development, not a seinen (FAR from being a seinen), no nothing except free fan service. If you're denying this fact, you're just lying to yourself.I honestly gave it a 3 just because of the art, otherwise this show can be labeled as an epic failure or a big pile of rotten shit.Am I mad? Oh yeah I'm mad, wasting a potentially kick ass anime just for this? Definitely the worst let down I ever experienced. 2006, Clannad, Air...See what I did there?)High hopes heh?Well let me tell you that my sweet little dream about a more realistic and mature Shuffle! was crushed to smithereens and thrown into the deepest pit of Tartarus.No plot, no character development, not a seinen (FAR from being a seinen), no nothing except free fan service.

Definitely the worst let down I ever experienced."", '""Dont judge anime if you havent watching all the episode"" LESSON LEARNED~Why would i say that? First, like the other reviewer said, the first impression that you will get was ""Incestous Homosexual"" but praise to the lord and the creator of this anime, the anime wasnt about that.Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi or A Bridge to the Starry Skies (kinda weird name) is like your usual generic harem anime which we have a bunch of cute girls and one boy that being liked by many girls. what means ""like your usual generic harem anime""? USUALLY or we can said ALWAYS, harem anime didnt have any romantic...ending or get laid (based on all harem anime that i have watched). and not just that, USUALLY my perspective about harem anime was :- Have a little sister that have brother complex- Being liked by ALL of the girls in anime itself (sometimes they liked without any logical reasons)- Surrounded by beautiful girls- The girls usually have their own uniqueness (tsundere, dandere, and kuudere) (if you\'re looking for yandere, then it wouldnt be a harem anime, it would be a horror  anime) LOL- The MC usually at the end didnt get laid or girlfriends (For all the harem lover will know what i mean)And why i am saying all that meaningless words? FYI, HoKaHa (since the title is so long) is really crossing my perspective about harem anime. its something unique yet its not so amazing too. Why? for the first i have a problem with the story itself, while watching this anime episode after episode, many question clinging into my mind ""What is the actual story/main story?""  ""Did this anime focus on the LUCKY BASTARD kiss incident or about the MC\'s little brother sick?"" and until the last episode i still dont get what this story about, what i know is the last episode is really surprise me. A LOT.""Oh so this anime didnt have any main plot, so whats so good about this anime since you rated it 7?""Calm down, yeah it doesnt have any strong plot or main plot, and just what we know is when we\'re watching this anime was the MC moving to that village because of  the little brother (he is have some MYSTERIOUS disease that until now i dont know what disease that he have) and then he got a kiss incident with a stranger girl. Ok you can imagine that.... i give you a time for imagining it.Done? lets process to the reason why i think this anime was good, for the first HoKaHa really suprise me in many ways, it crossess all of my expectation about what harem anime was (see all the list that what my perspective about harem anime in beginning of this review). then HoKaHa was surprising and sometimes it have a touchy and some moments that will make us smile or maybe jiggle a bit. i must say it was amusing and really worth of my 300 Minutes or 5 hours (12 episode x 25 minutes).After we talk about the story, lets talk about the other aspects, Art. I can\'t say to much about this one, but for sure, the quality of art in this anime was so amazing, On the first episode we can see a beautiful drawing in the forest, amazing scenery and even the water flows was like the real one. Well, its not the best, but atleast it will not make your eyes bored.Moving on to the sound section, well it was so - so. since i dont find any amazing sound that happen in this anime, from the OP, the ED or in the voice actors it was like any other harem anime, it was not really good and it wasnt really bad either, so we can said ""normal"". LOLAnd for the closing, i must said it was very amusing harem anime, what else do you need?- Harem,check ; romance, check; comedy, check; dere girls, check; GET LAID; check!if you\'re looking for an unusual harem anime, this maybe the right anime for you, cheers! ending or get laid (based on all harem anime that i have watched). and not just that, USUALLY my perspective about harem anime was :- Have a little sister that have brother complex- Being liked by ALL of the girls in anime itself (sometimes they liked without any logical reasons)- Surrounded by beautiful girls- The girls usually have their own uniqueness (tsundere, dandere, and kuudere) (if you\'re looking for yandere, then it wouldnt be a harem anime, it would be a horror  anime) LOL- The MC usually at the end didnt get laid or girlfriends (For all the harem lover will know what i mean)And why i am saying all that meaningless words?

Ok you can imagine that.... i give you a time for imagining it.Done? lets process to the reason why i think this anime was good, for the first HoKaHa really suprise me in many ways, it crossess all of my expectation about what harem anime was (see all the list that what my perspective about harem anime in beginning of this review). then HoKaHa was surprising and sometimes it have a touchy and some moments that will make us smile or maybe jiggle a bit. i must say it was amusing and really worth of my 300 Minutes or 5 hours (12 episode x 25 minutes).After we talk about the story, lets talk about the other aspects, Art. I can\'t say to much about this one, but for sure, the quality of art in this anime was so amazing, On the first episode we can see a beautiful drawing in the forest, amazing scenery and even the water flows was like the real one. Well, its not the best, but atleast it will not make your eyes bored.Moving on to the sound section, well it was so - so. since i dont find any amazing sound that happen in this anime, from the OP, the ED or in the voice actors it was like any other harem anime, it was not really good and it wasnt really bad either, so we can said ""normal"". LOLAnd for the closing, i must said it was very amusing harem anime, what else do you need?- Harem,check ; romance, check; comedy, check; dere girls, check; GET LAID; check!if you\'re looking for an unusual harem anime, this maybe the right anime for you, cheers!', 'Even though people haven\'t given this anime very good reviews, I still liked it a lot.

But I was amazingly satisfied with the ending, so watch it, you\'ll know what I mean.Art: 10I loved the art, in fact, this anime had the best artwork I\'ve ever seen in an...anime.

Both really good songs.Character: 10There are almost always characters in animes that I can\'t stand, such as Renge from ""Ouran HighSchool Host Club"", but this anime had no characters that I wanted to beat up. I loved every single character, and I\'m a huge fan of Ui and Ibuki. The characters are all fun to watch in action, and I love their personalities.Enjoyment: 10Easy 10. I didn\'t hate any of the episodes at all, and I\'ve rewatched the series numerous times. It never gets old.Overall: 9The story could have been the slightest bit better, and that\'s pretty much the only reason it doesn\'t get a 10 from me. Don\'t get me wrong, this anime is in my top 10.

On his arrival to the town, his little brothers hat gets stolen by a forest monkey and Kazuma then chases it far into the forest. Finally, getting the hat he stumbles upon a girl name Ui,...who was out gathering vegetables in the forest. On the way back to the bus station, they had to cross a small stream and the only way across is to hop on some stones, but when Kazuma tried to cross the stream, he slips and lands on top of Ui effectively stealing her first kiss.And that's how it all starts.At first, I thought it was kind of lame, but I guess the beginning could've been worse.Story ~6/10~Overall, the story isn't unique, but it has it's good points to it. A boy going around proving his worth to several girls in his school and to turn around and not realize any of their feelings... sounds quite familiar.But I still cried like a baby and laughed occasionally.Art~7/10~The art isn't something worth jumping off a cliff for, it has flaws here and there, but overall I would give it 7/10. The backgrounds were well drawn and I didn't get blurry vision (like I do watching some animes), so that's a plus. I guess the art is like the music, easily forgettable. The art has its own tone and gets the story across quite well.Character ~5/10~This is where the originality completely disappears. The characters you'll see in this anime are the same characters you've seen a million times. 2 stubborn athletic girls, one who is extremely shy, one who is shy because of her height and another shy girl who (happened to be the girl Kazuma met 10 years ago).So, the characters are either the two extremes, shy or in-your-face. If you can find some originality in that... I'll cook you dinner.Overall, I give this a 9/10. I enjoyed this show and I do recommend it. My review cannot simply tell you the experience I had watching this show. I just hope others find it as good as I did.

And I\'ve seen many Romance Series..It\'s another romance with some Comedy. I\'m starting to see less and less unique ones.KEEP IN MIND Only 2 episodes have been released which this review is based on.(For a quicker review, check Overall)Story: 7He accidentally trips and falls over her and gives her a good sweet accidental kiss while Ui\'s best friend Hinata sees this....HENTAI!Comment: This was not very original at all, but the story gets more interesting. And many might thinks prob ""Ui is gonna be the love of his life in the end, BOORING"" but no, as you watch, he meets a lot of girls that gives impressions and you are never sure, trust me.It\'s not bad. I\'m always interested in seeing if the Writer will end it with the first most obvious (the kiss), or totally blow my mind when perhaps a guy get feelings for the one you did not expect.And I love the conflicts and the humor from these.It does not have Comedy added to the Genre in Info, but there is full of Comedy in here.Art: 8This art is similar to Clannad, or Kanon 2006. Bigger eyes and huge hair.It\'s nicely done with many colours. I think the school suits are pretty cute and nicely formed. And the characters look good and matches personality with the art.Sound: 8I mean wow. This Opening theme sounds better then most i\'ve heard. Love the flute. Its not totally original but its a lot better then some series out there that sound exactly the same.The voices on girls are OFC typical high pitch. Witch I have nothing against, i think its cute if its just not overused. Which this series doesnt :) Thumbs Up.Whats funny is Ayumu has the same voice and is supposed to be an onormally cute little brother that does not seem to be Kazumas brother at all.Character: 8Even tho you might have seen this type of Romance Comedy Harem before, it\'s actually hard to compare it. All the characters have unique sides which surprises me because it wasn\'t expected.I like the little super cute brother thing he got going on, and Hinata is one special girl being best friends with Ui.Enjoyment: 9I enjoy it a lot. I\'m very interested in Romance Comedies and have seen a lot.So far, the beginning was just great with the kiss. It usally stopps before he reaches all the way. But not here! It WANTS you to keep watching and you prob will at least for a while since cmon, something more gotta happan! Is what you would think..Overall: 7 or 87 or 8, depending on how it continues.I\'m enjoying it and this series is good. It\'s short and prob wont have a sequal. So it\'s just one more nice little series to be watching.If you like Romance, Harem, Comedy with added Romance, you will love this.If you have High Anime Compatibility with me you will probably like this.*The story is typical for RomCom but surprisingly have unique sides. (Story does have comedy)*The art is very well done and gives a feeling of Clannad or Kanon 2006.*The Opening was surprisingly better and more original then most ones. Cute and fitting voices.*Characters have personal and unique sides. If you have seen RomHarem before you prob will not like it as much. But give it a shot.*I enjoyed it.

This is one of the more compelling ones.', ""Even though almost all harem anime are very similar (in terms of plot and characters), at least most of them have a little unique element to help separate themselves from others. This is not the case with Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, this anime is probably one of the most generic series out there. There is just nothing about this series that pops out.Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi starts out like most harems, the protagonist has just moved into a new town and then has the accidental kiss with the main heroine of the story. After getting introduced to all the characters, the protagonist gets one on...one time with each girl and helps solve each of their problems. Finally, the main characters  realize their true feelings for each other and that's pretty much the whole series. This series is pretty cliche after cliche after cliche, nothing special ever happens (a problem that many harem series suffer from). Another problem is that the feelings that the main characters have for each other seem to come out of nowhere .The reason for this is that there is very little development between the two main characters because most of the time is spent on the other girls. At least the ending offers closure instead of leaving the ending up in the air. There really isn't anything else to say, everything about this anime has been used in many other harem series already.The characters are also very one dimensional and generic. The main hero of the series, Kazuma, is very kind and always helps others with their problems, and this turns into the quality that makes others fall for him, very much like many other protagonists in other harem series. A positive about the main character is that he is not extremely dense making him more likable. The main female in this anime, Ui, is actually the most unique character of the bunch because she has more traits than the rest of the cast, but that really isn't saying much. Her character is still very generic and not that interesting at all. Also some of her features may turn some people off.The other characters pretty much have the same personality as the characters in many other harems, give or take some minor features. They are all likeable in their own way but again nothing stands out.The art and sound are fairly good, everything is certainly colorful and backgrounds are pretty nice. The sound is what you could expect from other harems, an upbeat and catchy opening and ending.Enjoyment all depends on the viewer, if you don't mind watching a harem then this would be another one to check off the list. It is still mildly enjoyable as long as you aren't looking for too much.Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi is the very definition of a generic harem series. Has nothing unique about it and if you have seen even one harem, there is really no point in watching this.Thanks for reading. one time with each girl and helps solve each of their problems.

It's some sort of harem that indulges in dreams, hopes and of course, the element an anime never misses- romance.The anime talks about the main lead Kazuma Hoshino who had always cared for his (overly cute) little brother. It talked about his experience when situated in a rural environment.The story in general was good. You might feel familiarize if you're a bookworm or a movie mania, but it's still good. It's not the 'OH THIS IS ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE' type of anime, it's just your another...'OH THEY'LL END UP TOGETHER OMG CAN'T BREATH OTP IS HERE' anime, but still, it'll make you scream, laugh and cry nonetheless.The art style is great. I'll tell you that the visuals is so exquisite. Starting from Kazuma's cute and boy-next-door style all the way to Madoka's style is amazing. The visuals was just so pretty that it made the anime more enjoyable. I just had the thing against the style of their uniform (well, you'll realize that when you see how it looks on Madoka). I mean, no offense, it looks simple and absolutely adorable, but the tie, meh.The sound is great! I love all the songs and the starting theme! It gives us this exciting vibes and stuff. I usually skip anime intros because God knows how long they take, but I didn't skip the intro in this particular anime. The sound was just so great and it fitted with the video that I cannot help myself but watch it fully. The sound was able to relate with the mood and help the viewers indulge with the atmosphere more.The characters were good, I guess. I would appreciate it though if it showed more about how Kazuma's feelings developed, since I really shipped him with someone else. Ui's characterization was really clever, she was a bright and cheery character that always has an eye for food (especially cheese) (OMG EP 2's cheese still in my head). Madoka's characterization was rather strong and detailed- which resulted her to become my favorite character in the manga. Overall, the characters were nice.I enjoyed the overall story and had only a few critics regarding it. I really love it, honest. I'll probably recommend it to my friends. I also recommend it for those who are reading this review now. This anime is good, the 12 episodes is probably short for you but I assure you that you'll endure an episode of laughter, tears, and probably cringing at a whole lot of exchange of dialogues!

Now upon arrival they sort of get lost and Kazuma somehow accidentally kiss Ui when he slips and fell on her. Kind of the typical harem thing anyways, and his life in the small town of Yambiko soon starts as he makes friends and help out the other girls. Another typical thing in a harem genre anime. However the story does have a sort of romance to it and with...a tad bit of comedy. Though the plot is almost not there again, but it does have it sweet moments and funny moments.Art: The character design again really similar to many harem genre where the girls are cute and the guy is like dense. There is however a lot of scenery because the setting is in the countryside so you can expect scenes of beautiful sunsets, star filled skies, clear rivers, etc.Sound: The sound track is really suited for the anime. The character voices are pretty well suited for each character though some were not so well suited.Character: Since this anime is another harem genre type, the male protagonist is of course dense, though they do tweak the genre up a bit by adding a younger brother figure. This makes Kazuma seems like an even more caring person because he constantly cares about his younger brother due to his bad health. The other characters in the harem are like the generic ones, like the childhood friend, the female protagonist's best friend, the cool girl, the caring and sweet senpai, etc. So the character variation is not that creative.Enjoyment: Overall I thought it was a pretty good anime. It was like a short romance/comedy type in my opinion and I thought that it was pretty cute how Kazuma really wanted to take care of his younger brother. Though it was really short and you might feel that it went by pretty quick. There were some funny parts and some cute parts, however it does create the feeling that the anime was kind of slow. So if you are looking for a serious romance anime this is not for you. It is mainly a short funny and sweet story about a city boy slowly falling in love with a countryside girl and making new friends in his new hometown. Well hope you enjoy! a tad bit of comedy.

The other characters in the harem are like the generic ones, like the childhood friend, the female protagonist's best friend, the cool girl, the caring and sweet senpai, etc. So the character variation is not that creative.Enjoyment: Overall I thought it was a pretty good anime. It was like a short romance/comedy type in my opinion and I thought that it was pretty cute how Kazuma really wanted to take care of his younger brother. Though it was really short and you might feel that it went by pretty quick. There were some funny parts and some cute parts, however it does create the feeling that the anime was kind of slow. So if you are looking for a serious romance anime this is not for you. It is mainly a short funny and sweet story about a city boy slowly falling in love with a countryside girl and making new friends in his new hometown.

The anime centers around 2 brothers, moving from the city to the country side due to the poor health of the younger sibling.The anime is a cliche of romance and harems, as this is an adaptation from a game, therefore should be expected. Even with this, the anime does well, as the beautiful visuals is very appealing and quite outstanding in any standard of anime. The characters are different and varied enough that the heroines don\'t seem dull, therefore bodes well for a romance anime. I must...however say, that as expected from a game adaption, it isnt the greatest or the most outstanding romance anime, however it does well as a harem, and EXTREMELY well as an adaptation, compared to other game-to-anime adaptations.All in all this anime is worth a watch if you like romance and comedy, it is quite cliched in many parts, however it works well with this. If you really like this anime, i recommend you try the game, as the stories of the other heroines are quite interesting. however say, that as expected from a game adaption, it isnt the greatest or the most outstanding romance anime, however it does well as a harem, and EXTREMELY well as an adaptation, compared to other game-to-anime adaptations.All in all this anime is worth a watch if you like romance and comedy, it is quite cliched in many parts, however it works well with this.

Thankfully recently the genre has evolved with the use of omnibus format, and a higher frequency of couples. Of course, these are some general things that have made the genre more bearable and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there is nothing that makes Hoshizora stick out among the dozens of harems, but overall not a horrible watch.Our lead Kazuma is pretty standard. He returns the countryside after a long time due to his sickly little brother. Kazuma is not horribly dense which is a relief, but he doesn't have any redeeming qualities other than the typical kindness towards others. As...usual it is up to other parts to pick up the slack. Thankfully the story is well done, incorporating three town events. The rest are everyday stuff which leaves it up to the characters to make it interesting.Nakatsugawa Ui is even worst than Kazuma. Of course, the show starts off with a accidental falling kiss and you have two reactions. One is that it is incredibly cliché and stupid, but two you are horrified that she is going to be one of the main girls. While at least Kazuma is strong and kind, Ui acts like a five year old, treating Kazuma as a onii-chan, and all of her scenes consist of her being hungry or eating.A bit better we have Madoka who is androphobic. She the local shrine maiden and does make you want to root for her as she actually tries to get Kazuma's attention. There is also the senpai Hina whom for some reason is horrible at communicating. While there are a few stupid moments her arc is rather funny and enjoyable. Finally we have Ibuki whom is Ui's best friend and an archer. A bit tsundere at first personally I found her the smartest and most worthy in the entire show.The comedy isn't half bad in Hoshizora, and when the focus was on others like Koyori, self proclaimed ninja, it improved my impression of the show greatly. His little brother gets as much fanservice time as any of the girls as he is 'so cute' that he even cross dresses for us.Hoshizora will stay in my mind as an enjoyable show. As I write this review I can't help but realize that it was rather average, and it was rather disappointing in the end. There are better harems out there so I don't think I would recommend it unless you are looking for 'just another.'Questions and input on my review is welcome and accepted! usual it is up to other parts to pick up the slack.

But then again this one does have some nice animation and an attractive cast. Again, nothing special but still worth a watch if you just want to take a break from some of the srsbusiness animes out there.Storyline is pretty your textbook harem plot; guy has visted/lived in the town in the past, returns for some reason but manages to leave behind any memories of previous encounters he may have had. He bumps into a girl and later...meets them in the school he has newly transferred to. From there he meets more and more girls and a pile of fanservice and suggestive jokes later, the end. Of course, he does make one male friend who is loud, funny and perverted who tries so hard, but ultimately fails to bag himself a girl.

She fills this emotional void by getting closer to the protagonist, as he reminds her of her brother, and would get increasingly jealous when her best friend showed signs of getting closer to him.

Not necessarily because it was bad but because it was dull and nothing caught my interest.Like most men I enjoy watching harem animes because, even though I know a harem scenario would not happen to me in real life, I like to pretend that I\'m the male lead in a harem anime. Virtually all straight men will tell you the same. One guy, dozens of girls, what more do you want?Well, I\'ll have to disappoint you because Hoshizora is not exacly a harem anime, despite the tag telling...us it is. Okey first then, the story - medicore at best. An extremely handsome guy called Kazuma with a brother who looks like his exact yet younger copy, decides to move into a small village. Once there a Japanese macaque grabs his brother\'s hat and runs off into the forest. Our heroic Kazuma runs after the monkey to retreive the hat. To our suprise he gets lost in the forest and doesn\'t know what to do. Miraciously, he happens to come across a good looking, pinked haired girl, around his age. Right. That\'s not all, read on. They start walking together and engage in a casual conversation, and then decide to cross a river(?). To cross it they have to jump on stones and the girl, predictably, makes it to the other side without a problem. The guy though, even though he\'s evidently stronger somehow manages to ""trip"" upon landing, pushes the girl over and... ""accidentaly"" kisses her. Apart from the fact that accidental kisses are cliche in anime, I\'ve seen hudreds of them, the whole scene just seems so nauseatingly unbelievable, that you want to beat yourself on the head with a wrench until the memory of it goes away.After that little incident, or shall I just say - the next day, the male lead is introduced to the town and the dozens of good looking girls that inhabit it. I thought that this was the moment where the story was going to take off. I couldn\'t have been more wrong. Literally nothing happens. In most animes, we\'d have some sort of development involving other girls and the male lead but for the larger part of this series, Kazuma is fixated on just one girl - the one he accidentaly kissed. I mean yeah some girls like him, some more than others but there\'s no harem feeling to it. There\'s no passion, like in Yosuga No Sora.  There\'s no drama, like in School Days. Girls don\'t fight over him, like in Nagasarete Airantou. The male lead is not forced to make any decisions whatsoever. It\'s just dull. I daresay even, that watching this anime is like watching the bold and the beautiful. Dull, boring... not interesting and it\'s going to be like that right to the very end.I really wanted to give this anime a way lower rating, 4 or 5 perhaps but one good thing about this anime is the art. It\'s extremely good. I also watched the 1080p version which was, breathtaking. Yes, the art is definitely something the studio worked on and to see movie-grade graphics in a TV series is rare. Also the sounds were very authentic and the voice acting was good and it was thanks to a combination of those two that I was able to endure the horrendous story to the end.With all that in mind and wanting to be fair, I added 2 extra points to the score and that bumped it up a bit. Summing things up, if you\'re looking for a harem anime with a decent story I guarantee you that you\'re not going to find anything remotely interesting in here. This is more of a vanilla romantic story involving two characters only. However, if you enjoy good voice acting and brilliant graphics, well give it a shot. us it is.

Does it have an interesting story? No, not really. It has sort of a sweet, adorable story but nothing that hasn't been done before.

When I first started watching this anime I had very high hopes for it.  Up until episode 5 I was actually thinking that it may have been good enough to be in my top five.  But, as is usually the case with the harem genre, it fell flat of my expectations.  Now that i\'ve got all of my complaining out of the way, I would like to focus on the good points of this anime, which despite my complaints, were quite abundant.Story:A typical harem genre story: Boy who lives without his parents moves to a new city,...where a large group of attractive females fall in love with him.  However, Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi goes a little beyond that.  The viewer is actually presented with a legitimate reason for Kazuma Hoshino (our protagonist) to have moved to his new home.  On his first day he meets Ui Nakatsugawa in a most unusual way, and this is when the story truly begins.  The story is not completely predictable, but you won\'t be utterly shocked by most of the events.  There wasn\'t as much ""romance"" as I usually prefer in an anime like this, but there was enough to keep me interested.Art:This is where the anime truly excels.  It may just be my personal preference, but the bright, colorful, and lively art style used in this anime is one of the best I have seen.  Characters, as well as the environments, are represented quite well in this style.  Every main character stands out from one another and their environment, but not so much so that they are the only thing you can focus on.  The ""sharpness"" of the images makes it seem like your watching it in great quality every time, even if it isn\'t in HD.Sound:The opening and ending themes were quite fitting for the type of anime this is.  The opening is light and enjoyable, with just a hint of seriousness.  I actually found myself going back to listen to it a few times purely because I enjoyed it so much.Character:Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi has a large list of character types including: A loli, a tsundere, an incredibly shy girl, and an airhead.  These different character types actually work well to complement each other.  My problem with the characters was the lack of development.  Each character only had a few episodes in which to develop.  Some characters don\'t even get a chance to be developed either.  Also, at some points it seemed like some of the characters were forgotten and simply put in later episodes to let us know they are still there.Enjoyment:Despite my complaints, I actually enjoyed watching Hoshizora e kakaru Hashi.  There was an episode or two I didn\'t care for, but for the most part I really had fun watching this anime.  It doesn\'t need to get a 10/10 to be enjoyable.Overall:Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi wasn;t the greatest thing I have ever seen, but it was actually pretty good.  These are just my opinions though.  This anime may end up being your favorite of all time.  I recommend that you at least give it a chance. where a large group of attractive females fall in love with him.

There wasn\'t as much ""romance"" as I usually prefer in an anime like this, but there was enough to keep me interested.Art:This is where the anime truly excels.  It may just be my personal preference, but the bright, colorful, and lively art style used in this anime is one of the best I have seen.  Characters, as well as the environments, are represented quite well in this style.  Every main character stands out from one another and their environment, but not so much so that they are the only thing you can focus on.  The ""sharpness"" of the images makes it seem like your watching it in great quality every time, even if it isn\'t in HD.Sound:The opening and ending themes were quite fitting for the type of anime this is.  The opening is light and enjoyable, with just a hint of seriousness.  I actually found myself going back to listen to it a few times purely because I enjoyed it so much.Character:Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi has a large list of character types including: A loli, a tsundere, an incredibly shy girl, and an airhead.  These different character types actually work well to complement each other.  My problem with the characters was the lack of development.  Each character only had a few episodes in which to develop.  Some characters don\'t even get a chance to be developed either.  Also, at some points it seemed like some of the characters were forgotten and simply put in later episodes to let us know they are still there.Enjoyment:Despite my complaints, I actually enjoyed watching Hoshizora e kakaru Hashi.  There was an episode or two I didn\'t care for, but for the most part I really had fun watching this anime.  It doesn\'t need to get a 10/10 to be enjoyable.Overall:Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi wasn;t the greatest thing I have ever seen, but it was actually pretty good.  These are just my opinions though.  This anime may end up being your favorite of all time.  I recommend that you at least give it a chance.', 'To me, this is about as close to a perfect comedy/harem anime as you can get.  It wasn\'t just a bunch of jumbled episodes dedicated solely to fan service, which I appreciate.  Fan service is nice and all, but there is a thing called too much fan service, and many harem animes are guilty of it.  Here, it\'s more, how should I put it... ""fitting"" ""tasteful""?  You get the point.  Above that, there isn\'t some ambiguous ending.  That\'s right, a harem lead that actually picks a girl at the end!  He\'s not such an indecisive dunce as many...other harem protagonists.  Another thing I appreciated greatly was the fact that there was actually kissing in the show (and not just the first episode).  In many harem AND straight up romance anime, a confession happens and the characters are never even see touching, or are showed holding hands at the most.  It made it feel more real and gave more of an impact, especially with the beautiful art and scenery that comes along with the moment ;).  My only qualm was Madoka\'s backstory.  It\'s not a spoiler, because you learn it very early, but it seems like there was very little reason to have had Madoka and Kazuma meet when they were young.  It makes sense to have it in; it very much helped Madoka develop feelings for Kazuma, but with the show only being 12 episodes, it feels like they didn\'t get a chance to fully explore it.Overall, I enjoyed this show immensly and will definitely watch it again at some point.  Would recommend to fans of romance! other harem protagonists.  Another thing I appreciated greatly was the fact that there was actually kissing in the show (and not just the first episode).

Would recommend to fans of romance!', ""This anime is exactly what it says on the tin, although based on a gal game it’s surprisingly well behaved.This show is one of those simple harem style anime, where you have that standard plot based around standard characters. Nothing exciting particularly happens but you do get that massive feel good sensation when the inevitable conclusion to the plot occurs. In regards to what’s bad about this anime it’s hard to say, because nothing really stands out, the whole anime is rather average so there aren't really any high expiations to start off with. It’s the kind of thing you would watch whilst waiting for...the next episode of (in my immediate case) Shingeki no Kyojin to come out. It’s a bit of fun, but it’s nothing special.I suppose the main problem with this anime is the characters and plot, because everything else is actually quite good. The plot is that basic “A handsome guy moves out the country side and suddenly Girls! Girls everywhere!” I mean seeing as the anime is based on a gal game you can’t really expect more, but I digress. Although the plot is basic and relatively boring you do find yourself getting attached to the characters somewhat. This is probably because the anime does a fantastic job of centering the large chunks of the episodes on the feelings of the girls involved. The same girls that happen to be going after the previously mentioned lucky b*****d that somehow managed to move in to “hot single girl central” oh Japan we love you. Aside from this, however, the characterization is lacking a tad also. The girls presented are the usual line up of fetish, the quiet one, the strong one etc… The anime had been made well enough for it to want more but it has been bent rigidly around the harem, gal game, genre resulting in some of the characters coming across as forced. I’m aware, by the way, that that’s kind of what it’s supposed to be but the anime, at points seems to want to be more than just a tacky standard harem anime, and it could have been.Now regardless of the fact that there is no way this anime could even be compared with the giants like Gurren Lagann, or Cowboy Bebop, in terms of my personal enjoyment, and to some affect production quality, it’s done pretty good for itself. To this extent I mean the animation is actually pretty good, it’s not Guilty Crown blow your face off good, but it’s not bad. The music of the entire thing fits quite well too, so it makes you feel the right things at the right time. Overall I rather enjoyed this short little piece, it may be a standard one of a thousand anime that are all basically the same, but it’s a bit of fun you know?On a final note because of the spectacular averageness this anime has managed to achieve it’s difficult to say much more about it, so I apologise for the short review. This anime is by no stretch of the imagination a really good anime, but neither is it really bad.Premise: 5/10The idea this anime is based around is incredibly mundane and has been done a thousand times before, but it manages to pull it off in its own way.Plot Development: 6/10The plot development is okay, but not brilliant. It’s slow going and you only start to feel that the anime is progressing in the final few episodes. But those final few are very entertaining indeed.Animation: 7/10The animation for this anime is surprisingly good considering its roots, however because of a lacking of any times where the animation could be put to the test there is no real proof of it’s worth.Characters: 7/10The characters in this anime is one of its strong points because it manages to fit in the usual line up of boring harem figures and then puts a slightly different spin them and even explores their personality allowing you to become somewhat attached to them at times.Character Development: 6/10The character development in this anime is surprisingly good, because the anime manages to start off with the staple line up of characters in the beginning and end up with a group of characters you’re emotionally attached to; having said that it’s incredibly slow going and only seems to work on one character at a time.Fluidity: 7/10This show flows quite well; there are no dodgy jumps in the story line, and you’re never really left feeling like you’ve missed something.Music: 8/10The music is very good but not very diverse. The correct thing always seems to be playing at the right time, setting the scene perfectly. But at times you feel like it’s the same few tracks being played over and over again.Intro: 8/10The intro for this anime is fantastically done and it possibly one of the best features of this anime. Everything from the music to the animation seems to fit very well and puts you in the perfect mood for watching the episode.Outro: 6/10The outro is quite disappointing compared to the intro because nothing really happens; it’s just a series of credits and pictures, having said that the music is upbeat and very nice to listen to.Personal Enjoyment: 7.5/10I enjoyed watching this anime rather a lot, and the ending is quite nice. I only wish it was a bit longer and had a more in-depth story-line seeing as it has a lot of potential.Total: 6.8/10 (Fine)Stuart Macdonald(Note: This blog is not the main blog and origin of these posts, the main blog can be found at: http://theanimelistreview.blogspot.co.uk/) the next episode of (in my immediate case) Shingeki no Kyojin to come out.

It isn\'t a particularly innovative series but still manages to entertain through decent character interactions and late-building tension. Despite giving very early signs of which harem girl will win Kazuma\'s hand, the series still puts forth a decently plausible plot line, especially compared to some of the other flops of 2012. If you\'re looking for a simple harem devoid of senseless action or magical elements to spend six hours on, look no further.Animation:Hoshizora is a fair looking series with minimal CGI elements and some...pretty good looking water effects. It uses a pleasing color palette ranging from a slightly under-saturated base appearance to heavily-oversaturated scenes (such as sunsets). The backgrounds are also quite good; in fact they are so detailed at times that the less-detailed characters look comical when superimposed in front of the background. While lacking in details occasionally, the character styling is fairly good. All important characters are easily distinguishable, including siblings with impossibly different hair colors. My only major critique is Ui; the real world is not so forgiving to those who gorge on monster parfaits and snacks on a daily basis. The series could have also done with a better QA as there were instances of mysteriously, instantaneous costume changes.This is a relatively calm series where the highlight in terms of action is a school race. There\'s no hint of magic (other than Ui\'s metabolism) in this series as well. What you will find, instead, is a fairly generous portion of ecchi panty shots and naked scenes full of god rays and mystic mist. The series\' overall approach is a bit more conservative than 30-sai in terms of sexual references and the characters are (thankfully) a bit more mature in feel than those in R-15.Sound:Each episode starts with a progressive but melodically challenged OP. It starts as a calm lullaby but then evolves into a frantic-paced jpop song. I can\'t put my finger on it but I didn\'t particularly like the singer\'s voice. The main ED is a fast and playful work that sounds as if it served as the baseline inspiration for Nichijou\'s OPs. It heavily relies on synthesized sounds, which makes it blend with the BGM quite well. The 10th episode is special in that Madoka gets her own fitting ED, you can probably guess why. The BGM is unusually limited in variation so be prepared to hear the same playful synthetic songs over and over.At the time of its release, the voice cast for this show isn\'t what I\'d consider an all star team. While the VAs gave an adequate performance, I think the script severely limited them at times. Consider the following example from the first episode:Kazuma (with an incredulous tone): ""Hey... you\'re a girl?""Ui: ""Yes, I\'m a girl.""I still can\'t quite grasp what the scriptwriter was thinking at some points. Script aside, I was also a bit annoyed at how girlish Ayumu sounded. Overall, don\'t expect this to match the level of drama in other shows such as Ano Hana.Story:Kazuma and his weak brother, Ayumu, move in with a family friend in a quiet, rural town, where the residents gloat about their convenience store that closes at 8PM. Soon, Kazuma starts bumping into girls (literally) left and right and before you know it a harem has developed.The story is told in a slice-of-life, episodic manner with only minimal connectivity. It\'s a bit strange in that episodes sometimes end abruptly, not at cliffhangers but just as if the director decided to chop up one long movie into chunks. The overall pacing is a bit slow and, with the random episode transition points, the series doesn\'t really push you forwards.There are a handful of episodes where the ending isn\'t so arbitrary, specifically episodes that focus on a particular harem candidate. The story doesn\'t really have any rising action until the last two episodes, which builds to a predictable but satisfying climax and conclusion.Overall, the plot is extremely predictable and closely follows established harem patterns. The majority of the involvement comes as a big lump towards the end of the show so pace accordingly. Compared to other shows in its season, the story is a bit boring and overly conservative. Luckily the characters bring a bit of life to the series.Character:Kazuma is your typical harem lead, a nice dude who is oblivious to girls\' feelings and who blushes at anything ecchi. He somehow miraculously adapts to the slow pacing of rural life after having living the majority of his life in ""the big city"" and is shortly somehow surrounded by all the school\'s idols. The series makes use of a lot of established character patterns (useless comic-relief guy friend, a bunch of tsunderes to spice up the mix, etc.) but successfully presents them in a mostly plausible manner. Though, honestly, the bulk of the juicy, drama-filled interactions occur very late towards the end of the show. This is where you\'ll find some decent character development and some hard choices. If not for this last glimmer of inspired presentation (similar in feel to the better parts of Mashiro-iro Symphony), I would have called this series a flop as well.Value:Overall, the series had some decent comedic scenes as well as some solid development late in the season. If you can deal with some minor inconsistencies and some shamelessly haphazard episode transitions, this series is a fair watch. It treads on very safe grounds using existing cliches and harem patterns but is brave enough to at least forces a conclusion that may disappoint some fans. This is by no means an outstanding harem, but seeing how bad some of the other 2012 harems have been, it seems directors ought to be looking back in time for some much needed inspiration. pretty good looking water effects.

Majokko Megu-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3388/Majokko_Megu-chan,"['Majokko Megu-chan was a groundbreaking anime when it came out in 1974.Magical girl shows up to that point had mostly consisted of basic plots and stories which, although sometimes would hint at more mature themes, rarely went out of their comfort zone and remained very child-friendly.Majokko Megu-chan, on the other hand, dealt with mature themes such as suicide, infidelity, depression, child abandoment, and even irreversible death. But these themes alone would have not been enough to make this series as enjoyable as it is, if it weren\'t for most of the characters, who have very distinct personalities and complement the story very well. The titular...character, Meg, is a tomboyish teenage girl who at many times will act out of spite or mischief, but who\'s also a very kind and caring girl who does her best to help people around her. Her rival Non, on the other hand, begins as a no-nonsense girl who has no interest in dealing with humans and who acts hostily towards Meg any time she can; as the story progresses, however, Meg will learn to calm her temper and be more reasonable, whereas Non begins to put aside her cold facade and ends up envying Meg\'s good relationship with the humans. The only character who doesn\'t really contribute much to the series is, undoubtedly, Chousan, the ""inspector"" sent from the Witch World. Chousan is, at best, a lousy and disloyal inspector, and at worst, a pervert who tries to ruin Meg anytime he can.The soundtrack for this series is fenomenal. Both the opening and ending themes, sung by Yoko Maekawa, are very catchy and well done. The incidental music is also very nice and memorable.The only weak point of this series is its animation. It is very inconsistent, and while many episodes have very good and impressive animation, others are filled with errors and characters that go out of design. It is truly a shame, because this series deserved a constant, quality animation.Even if anime as a whole has come a long way since 1974, Majokko Megu-chan is still a very interesting series to watch in 2020. The stories are entertaining, the characters (except Chousan) are fun and interesting, the character designs are very colorful and nice, and the soundtrack is amazing. If you can overlook the at-times-mediocre animation, you\'ll love this anime. character, Meg, is a tomboyish teenage girl who at many times will act out of spite or mischief, but who\'s also a very kind and caring girl who does her best to help people around her.

This show felt like a response to Honey, acknowledging the metaphorical can of worms it opened in the mahou shoujo space while simultaneously choosing the status quo.  This show looked into the face of greatness and chose mediocrity.Majokko Megu has a wonderful first half, with consistently interesting episode up to episode 40, peaking with episode 32: A tense 25...minutes of horror and suspense at the hands of the villain Joker lurking in the shadows at every turn.  There are episodes that acknowledge the darkness inherent to the human condition, where Megu confronts topics from suicide, abandoned children, living with survivor\'s guilt, and more, and all this plays into the show\'s theme of affirming the soul of humanity at large.  The unfortunate reality is that this thematic density is almost unilaterally dropped by the show\'s mid point, never to be seen again; left in the dirt in favor of easier, less intrusive, and by extension more dull episode plots.  With that said, its not as if there are no episodes with caring about in the second half, with episode 49 and 63 both standing out amidst mediocrity.  The final 2 episodes are also decent, focusing on the true villain Sataan.Megu and her nominal rival Non stand as apparent antithesis of one another: Where Megu cherishes humanity, Non scoffs at their importance, but just when it seemed the show was embarking on a journey to remember with Non\'s character, the entire arc is abandoned.  Non increasingly sees the flaws in her world view through episode 45 until suddenly she doesnt, and returns to her starting point to remain an antagonist to Megu\'s ideals.  I think this is a massive miss step for the show, and Non\'s appearance in episode 48 is the point of no return for a character with so much potential.Visually, the show certainly has highlights worthy of seeing, but generally exists in a space of ""its okay"".  Perhaps this is a bias of falling out of love with the show but i found less visual frames to glee over in the back half of the show.  Occationally there are hints of color experimentation but largely the show plays it safe, visually.In the end, I find it hard to consider Megu as more than an attempt to return Mahou Shoujo to its thematic roots established by earlier titles.  Perhaps this was for the best back in 1974 when it seemed that Honey could have taken the genre in a different direction. minutes of horror and suspense at the hands of the villain Joker lurking in the shadows at every turn.

The message is that human society is better than the matriarchal witch society because human society is based on ""love,"" something that witches don\'t value, but frankly, it\'s hard to see why anyone would value ""love"" as it is portrayed here.The primary purpose of this show, although it is supposedly aimed at young...girls, seems to be pleasing male viewers with the objectified image of a young teenage girl who is opinionated but not TOO opinionated, who not only allows herself to be sexualized but actually invites it in the opening song. The secondary purpose seems to be convincing young girls not to put up any resistance to being objectified, that its a compliment and is actually empowering. girls, seems to be pleasing male viewers with the objectified image of a young teenage girl who is opinionated but not TOO opinionated, who not only allows herself to be sexualized but actually invites it in the opening song.

It's also a recap, however, it is narrated by the main characters of this show, which makes it really entertaining. The overall recap of the previous events is done quite well and using the main characters as narrators clearly adds to the charisma and pleasant feel of this episode. In general, this is a great example of how a recap should be done.This episode is the resemblance of a typical commentary episode you would find on any anime Blu-ray/DVD, and it does a good job of re-telling the overall story from the past few episodes.However,...this seems like a lazy move from the creators. Usually, a recap episode recaps the first half of the show (6 to 7 episodes). As this recaps episode 1 to 9, the recap slightly doesn't make sense at this point. Yeah sure it does give a decent impression when it comes to comparing it to other recap shows of other anime series, but at the time of airing, it does seem like a strange thing to do considering the anime is slowly coming to an end. It's like the creators are forcefully trying to keep this anime alive for a little longer.In conclusion, this is a good recap episode and it you want to fully remember what happened previously before watching the later episodes, give this a try. Also, if you are new to this anime and you want to start watching it, but you are feeling sort of lazy, this is an episode you may want to start with (if you are not willing to sit through 9 episodes). this seems like a lazy move from the creators.

Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament,https://myanimelist.net/anime/942/Nishi_no_Yoki_Majo__Astraea_Testament,"[""Title: Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea TestamentManga/Anime/Novel: Nishi no Yoki Majo's original incarnation was an eight-volume, three side-story novel series done by Noriko Ogiwara.  The manga incarnation, which keeps Ogiwara on the story and puts Haruhiko Momokawa on the art, is currently running in Japan, began being serialized in Comic Blade on July 9th, 2006, and currently has five volumes released. Tokyopop has picked it up, and will release it under the title Good Witch of the West ' Nishi no Yoki Majo's literal translation ' this October (2006).  The anime itself ran from April 7th to June 30th of this year...(2006), and is thirteen episodes long.Story: Nishi no Yoki Majo follows Firiel Dee, a young, fifteen year-old girl living with foster parents, even though her real father (who's just a little neglectful) lives not a few feet away from her front door, out in rural Sellafield.The whole story gets thrust into motion when, on the holiday of the Queen's Birthday, Firiel's father, through a proxy (Roux), gives her a necklace that used to be her mother's.  What Firiel doesn't know is that her mother was a queen's daughter, and that the necklace is a royal heirloom, which shows whether or not a girl has royal blood and, consequently, is eligible as a candidate for the Queen's throne.  Needless to say, this causes some issues when she goes to a ball at the local Count's castle.From here on, Firiel gets dragged into various conspiracies, political intrigue, and the occasional bit of action, by virtue of her bloodline.Nishi no Yoki Majo's story rawqs my socks.  It's very heavy on and driven by characters and story, which are the two things I look for and value most in an anime.  It has a good balance between action, political intrigue, drama, romance, and the occasional, well-placed bit of humor.The only place where the story suffers is in its pacing.  But more on that a bit later.And, in one arc, it starts to look like a blatant Utena rip-off, but it quickly puts that behind it, luckily.Art Style: Beautiful.  The character designs are changed up constantly, in terms of hair and outfit, which shows a lot of effort on the part of the studio (Hal Film Maker).  The overly large eyes can get annoying, though.  Backgrounds are CG for the most part, but are done in such a way that the characters and other 2D elements don't seem out of place at all.  This seamless integration of your traditional 2D animation and CG makes for great interaction between characters and their environments.Music: I love the OP for this anime; unfortunately, I can't seem to find it anywhere.  &lt;_&lt; So if anyone happens to come upon a MP3 for 'Starry Waltz' by kukui, please let me know.  The ED makes me want to fall asleep, and, as I've been lacking sleep as of late, I really wouldn't mind listening to this before going to bed; once again, I'm having a hard time finding this, so if you come upon 'Kanata' or 'Ochikata' by Mariana, let me know.As for the rest of the music in this series... it's nice background music, but nothing that particularly stands out in my mind, like Gankutsuou's OST did.  If I could find it anywhere, though, I'd probably end up burning a CD of it.Voice Seiyuus: Nothing I really can or want to natter on about; for the most part, I'm happy with the seiyu choices.  A few odd ones, but nothing particularly grating.  And OMG, Joji Nakata's in it, only for a few episodes, but still, PHWEE!Voice Actors: N/ADub: N/ALength: This is where most of Nishi no Yoki Majo's flaws lie: whoever thought that trying to cram an eight-volume, three-side-story novel series into thirteen episodes was a good idea was dead wrong.The pacing of this show is incredibly fast, as they have to cram eight volumes and three side stories' worth of story into thirteen episodes; if you so much as blink, odds are that you'll miss something.  Now, I don't mind this, but other viewers might.  However, this pacing catches up with the show in the last episode or so; in the aforementioned episode, things crash and burn spectacularly, souring what is otherwise a good series.  Most major issues, which have been piling up until this point, are resolved by an all-too-convenient deux ex machina, and the rest are dealt with rather sloppily.  And a few points that have been hammered on in earlier episodes are left unresolved, leaving a rather bitter aftertaste.This could've been easily avoided by adding just two or three more episodes; it would've given the show some time to breathe.Overall: Excellent story and art, but the experience is soured by break-neck pacing, cramming and sloppiness towards the end of the series.Story: 7/10Art Style: 8/10Music: 7/10Voice Seiyuu: 9/10Length: 6/10Overall: 37/50; 74% (C) (2006), and is thirteen episodes long.Story: Nishi no Yoki Majo follows Firiel Dee, a young, fifteen year-old girl living with foster parents, even though her real father (who's just a little neglectful) lives not a few feet away from her front door, out in rural Sellafield.The whole story gets thrust into motion when, on the holiday of the Queen's Birthday, Firiel's father, through a proxy (Roux), gives her a necklace that used to be her mother's.

Don't get me wrong, the plot itself was well-written with lots of twists and turns.  However, this show was poorly paced, which is what happens when you put either some or all of 9 light novels into a 13 episode series.  The first half of the show was a whirlwind, and while this is understandable considering how the main character is swept up into a world she doesn't...understand, there were a lot of questions at least in the back of my mind regarding the underlying political and social situation that was mentioned over and over but never explained, at least early on.As I said, however, things really came together down the stretch, redeeming this anime plot-wise.  The situation is clarified (even though more mysteries start arising) and while some things aren't explained by the end, it's still okay.  It has an ending that makes sense and brings some closure even though it makes you yearn for more, as if this has to be the animated version of only a part of the entire original story.The world itself, while not holding anything new, was still very intriguing.  It focuses not on fantasy or action, but on the politics and society of the world, which is like a breath of fresh air for a tired genre.  This is like the Crest/Banner of the Stars of the fantasy genre.  (I'll have to make a suggestion about that...)The art and sound were solid, not too much to say here.  The only complaint I had was that some of the girls really, REALLY looked like guys.The characters in this were excellent.  Everyone was appropriate for their situation and they all related to each other very realistically.All-in-all, I enjoyed this series.  Action, comedy, drama, romance - Good Witch has it all, and it also carries it all very nicely without being contrived. understand, there were a lot of questions at least in the back of my mind regarding the underlying political and social situation that was mentioned over and over but never explained, at least early on.As I said, however, things really came together down the stretch, redeeming this anime plot-wise.

"Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen",https://myanimelist.net/anime/40595/Kimi_to_Boku_no_Saigo_no_Senjou_Aruiwa_Sekai_ga_Hajimaru_Seisen,"['The power of coincidences is very interesting, but what if it was powered up to the point that it strengthens bonds between two people?I\'m sure that almost everyone knows what Romeo and Juliet is. It\'s one of the most recognizable and popular works of literature known to mankind. As what people would already know, it\'s about a boy named Romeo and a girl named Juliet whose families are in conflict with each other, and after their deaths, the Montague and Capulet families stopped their feud. That premise is basically what happens in Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen. We...have two factions: the Empire and the Nebulis Sovereignty. The Empire and the Nebulis Sovereignty have been at war for more than a century. In those factions, we have our protagonist for each side. For the Empire, we have the swordsman Iska who looks like Kazuto Kirigaya, and for the Sovereignty, we have the ice princess Aliceliese ""Alice"" Lou Nebulis IX. Both of our protagonists desire to end this pointless war, meeting each other by fate, and as time passes by, their relationship seems to develop. Similar to Romeo and Juliet? Of course, but it has magic. A total rip-off? Debatable. Boring? Absolutely not.You see, I have been dreaming about this kind of premise for a while now. One might call it cliched, and I\'m not going to deny that. I have been looking for the kind of anime: rivals and enemies becoming acquaintances and possibly budding into romance. As the story gets developed, we have the power of coincidences that seem to link Iska and Alice together wherever they may go. Cheesy? Maybe. Interesting? Absolutely. I noticed that the story development is kind of slow, with the series picking up about halfway where we finally see things happen. Of course, I understand this. After all, ending a war does not happen overnight. I think that the story is on the right track and is developing itself properly, but it\'s still not enough, considering that there are still many things that need to be answered. Twelve episodes are too few to give a satisfactory conclusion. Nevertheless, I still want to see more.The first thing that I noticed immediately after watching the first episode is that the characters seem to have their eyes drawn with a similar fashion to a Geass from Code Geass, although it\'s black. I don\'t mind the similarity, in fact, I actually like it. I kept thinking, what would happen if someone actually used a Geass there and controlled someone\'s mind? I actually wouldn\'t mind if Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen actually ripped off that concept, although I would probably be worried if it gets used too often.Eyes aside, the magic used by astral mages, especially the ice magic (got it?) by Alice was as beautiful as she is. The freezing chill that permeates the screen made me feel cold, although I think that only happened to me. One more, by Alice\'s maid Rin, and her earth magic was also spot-on. The action scenes weren\'t something to be scoffed at either, the animation was pretty fluid. If I am allowed to be more selfish, I would want more of the series\' magical display.When we\'re talking about Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen\'s music, especially its opening and ending themes, I really remember that beat that gave me a very good first impression about the anime, especially Kaori Ishihara\'s ""Against."" which was the OP (although I kind of admit I missed this when I was playing animemusicquiz once). Moreover, Sora Amamiya\'s performance of the ending song ""Koori no Torikago"" was spectacular as well, especially that refrain that really hits you in the chest on how relatable the lyrics are to the theme of the show.Itsuka oozora he hanatsu sono hi made (Until the day I let it go to the sky)kanarazu tadoritsuku hi made (Until the day that it surely arrives)tsuyoku arou dakara dou ka (Please be strong)anata mo akiramezu ni ite (Don\'t give up)That song really hits the spot. And of course, until our protagonists really do achieve their goal of world peace, they should remain strong and never give up. And yes, I also missed this once in AMQ. Am I a fake fan now?Maybe one point that you can take to remember the characters is that the anime is similar to Romeo and Juliet. Personally, however, I do not like thinking that way. Iska and Alice are great characters especially that the plot of the power of coincidences revolve around them. One goes here, and they meet the other. I will never get tired of a premise like that. Their character development is lacking, yes, and I cannot deny that, because there are still more things to explore about their relationship and like what I have said earlier, I am looking forward to seeing their characters develop more... if we actually get to.In Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen, I have two notable favorite characters. First would be Alice\'s maid, Rin. Her personality is so uptight like what you see in many anime, but that\'s exactly why I like her. A pulchritudinous maid who wants to abide by the rules that she gets so pragmatic when it comes to violations… I mean, who doesn\'t want that? Pardon that deep word, if you please, something like ""beautiful"" couldn\'t possibly describe Rin. Second would be Sisbell Lou Nebulis IX, Alice\'s sister. Her being the underdog in what could possibly be a love triangle is something that makes me want to root for her. I\'m on team Sisbell on this one.Like what I have been saying earlier, I hope that my enjoyment is already palpable. Yes, I truly enjoyed the show, while at times I was frustrated because I was wanting to say something like ""why don\'t Iska\'s friends already know that he and Alice are acquaintances? Like please, let them all be allies already! I want to see the combined forces of Alice and Iska as they bring about world peace!"" I get more frustrated as I continue to realize that things do not happen that fast. Because of this, I still enjoyed Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou, Aruiwa Sekai ga Hajimaru Seisen.In conclusion to this review, overall, the anime has a cliched premise but it still managed to make me interested. Not just any kind of interest, however. I want to know more. I want to know what happens between the Empire and the Sovereignty as their war continues. I want to know whether Iska and Alice\'s last crusade will change the world. I want to know if the main enemy would just be the two warring nations. I want to see more of Rin and Sisbell.

Judging by the premise, this show sounded like your typical, generic light novel adaptation. And you’d be right. It isn’t masking its potential in any way or form. Sadly, that means it’s exactly you’d expect: a military fantasy of mediocrity.Our Last Crusade or The Rise of a New World tells the story of a young man named Iska, caught in between a conflict involving the Heavenly Empire and the Nebulis Sovereignty. To put it simply, they are two sides with different ideologies and even utilizes different tactics as part of its culture. The Heavenly...Empire relies on its advanced technology while the Nebulis Sovereignty utilizes its magic users. It’s a conflict of science vs magic, a common trend in military fiction. What makes this anime mediocrity relies the ultimate execution of the show’s ideas.I remember the first time when the trailers and promotional material debuted. It became obvious why the anime is designed with such a way to pit two important characters together. Iska and Alicelise (Alice) represents the opposite spectrum of an ongoing war. Peace is a far cry from being achieved although it appears that both characters desires the war to end. Fate designates their encounter and from the first episode, the two unlikely characters builds a peculiar relationship throughout the rest of the show.It would appear based on narratives and plot elements that the war has been lasting for a very long time. In the present timeline, the show sell itself as a military fantasy story. The nations have their factions, politics, and ongoing plans to achieve their goals. Iska is the powerful swordsman with near unrivaled skills from the Heavenly Empire. Meanwhile, there’s Alice, the Ice Calamity Witch with powerful ice magic at her disposal, serving the Nebulis Sovereignty. After their first encounter, we see the two continuously bumping into each other. This later turns their relationship into a complicated angle due to their conflicting ideals and alliances. However, this show does little to actually build their relationship. There’s a lack of character development as the two personalities are too contrasting to be compatible. Furthermore, it’s hard to get invested into either character when their roles are so blend. Both Iska and Alice has an honorable personality but can be deadly on the battlefield. It appears throughout the show, neither of their personality really change except when interacting between each other. Even then, it’s poorly executed especially from Alice’s point of view. In later episodes, she shows more vulnerable sides of herself that melts some of her Ice Queen persona. Meanwhile, Iska follows his moral code like a good little soldier although he isn’t afraid to take risks when needed. This includes taking on fights on the fly or trying to outsmart a battle maid like Rin, Alice’s personal bodyguard.Are you hopeful for a memorable supporting cast? If so, I got some depressing news to deliver. The supporting cast is made up of some of the most generic and poorly written characters I’ve seen this year. Rin, Nene, Mismis, and Jhin are a few examples that absolutely lacks any sort of decent characterization or development. To be honest, if you remove most of these characters, you wouldn’t feel too much impact from the anime’s storytelling altogether. It’s mostly rely on Iska and Alice to carry this anime on their back but unfortunately, they couldn’t live up to the expectations. The antagonists are even more forgettable such as Salinger, who is introduced with little buildup. In fact, it’s hard for me to say there’s any important antagonists besides the show being an enemy of itself. Yes, this anime’s weakness is itself, being that it’s so poorly designed that it’s nearly damn unwatchable.Perhaps the only saving grace is the artistic visuals. I’m not going to lie, Alice can be an eye candy to look at with her beautiful red dress, graceful blonde hair, and alluring eyes. Iska on the other hand looks like your average Kirito-clone you can find in any light novel. The world setting opens up some chances for redemption but overall still remains lackluster with the war being the main emphasis.No, this isn’t a solid show or even close. It can’t hold itself together when the plot is so lackluster with a poorly constructed main cast. I wonder when the anime adaptation was announced, it was an attempt to get the audience to drop money for the light novels. Keeping my fingers crossed, I hoped to be proven wrong but after these dreadful 12 episodes, my hope was lost. This anime is a lost cause and has no redemption.

This anime is a lost cause and has no redemption.', 'From silver link, the studio which is already notorious to me as the one which releases the most generic, cliche animes comes Our last Crusade or the rising of a new world.To put it simply, our last crusade is a collection of bits and pieces from other animes ( be them good or awful ), mashed together in the most disgusting way possible and vomited on an already dirty plate. In other words, an omlette made out of leftovers from fate powers, rent-a-girlfriend trash tropes, SAO main characters, *insert any silver link isekai* worldbuilding and so on.We have :- a tsundere female gilgamesh,...which can apparently use unlimited blade works and rho aias.- your average kirito.- a fully-fledged mary sue set of protagonists.- fantasy setting, but not because there\'s any creativity involved, but simply because having swords, magic and random words in an non-existent language might be catchy for some people.- a long list of cliche tropes, such as ( but not limited to ) :A. Female and male MC randomly stumbling upon each other numerous times;B. Righteous, morally correct, black haired dual wielder male MC;C. Airhead loli who\'s only purpose is to bounce her breasts ( namely, the captain of the team who *quote* is a mediocre strategist and solider, but helps the team in other ways. Because that\'s what you need from a war squad captain. Gogo main character ! ^_^ );D. Female and male char. Saying the same thing, at the same time, over and over and over again, to demonstrate that it’s not a coincidence, but a strong connection.E. Random cheerful girl who\'s all over the male MC;F. Serious guy who\'s only there to create a contrast for the male MC, in case there wasn\'t enough emphasis on his qualities;G. Both male / female MCs being, ofc, the most prodigy of prodigies the world has ever seen.H. Both male and female MC have the exact same tastes, since the plot demands that they get along SO WELL.You get the idea.Now that we got past the introduction, let\'s begin with the actual thing. Note that there are spoilers ahead.1. Plot - 1/10.The story of our last crusade takes place in a fantasy universe where two factions, namely, the empire ( consisting of humans ) and the witches are at war. Why? Because the show needed an intrigue. The shows beings roughly 100 years after the outbreak of war, and the action revolves around 2 characters, Iska, the strongest solider in the human empire - except he\'s not. He just has 2 beyond over powered swords. One which can apparently nullify any magic. Imagine being a witch and fighting against that with magic. The second main character is Alice, a direct descendant of Nebulis, the most powerful witch in the world. As both of them represent the ""the chosen one"" of each faction, it was only natural of them to meet on the battlefield. After a flashy display of unnecessary skills and spells ( since male mc, which we will address as player 1 from now on, could simply cut through her spells if he wanted to ) Alice simply happens to slip on the ice SHE created, directly into player 1\'s arms, but not before each of them shouts that they want to stop the war. Of course, fate intervenes and the two meet again, this time in neutral city, a city where both factions, although at war and aloof towards each other, simply decided not to fight. And the main characters just so happen to stumble over each other not just once. But again. And again. And again. And again. As they get to know each other, the two realise that the main difference between them as characters is that one of them is female and the other one is male. As they have the exact same tastes, ideals, choice of words etc. A romantic sparks is lit between them. Because we can\'t have your average wanna be everything anime without romance, right? The plot just goes on, circling around the exact same tropes : random meetings between the two, adding a bit of tinder to their romance, approving of each other\'s ideas and tastes as much as possible, with a bit of action sprinkled around. As the story moves on, every character which is not directly relevant to the development ( kek ) between the main characters becomes irrelevant.Art : 6/10.Art is fine. I mean, it\'s 2020 standards. It\'s not trash, but it\'s not even half of stuff like ufotable quality.Sound : 5/10.No matter how pathetic an anime, good sound effects and soundtracks can do wonders. Yuki Kajiura\'s pieces in SAO will forever be proof to that. But this doesn\'t happen here.Characters : 1/10.The characters in this show are dreadful. Boring. Generic. Cliche.Iska : player 1. For the sake of trying to make him likeable, both by the audience and the female mc, the author makes him free a young witch ( his enemy ) from prison, which in turn has him imprisoned and stripped of his rank. He\'s nothing more than the worst version of your average black haired protagonist. Absolutely righteous, willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good, devoid of emotion, not believeable as an actual person in the slightest, with a worthless attempt for a sad backstory in order to stay true to the shonen formula.Alice Nebulis IX: a powerful, flawless blondie gilgamesh with big breasts. That\'s pretty much all you need to know about her, other than her being a full copy of iska. One other detail which is actually worth noting is the IX (9) in her name. Seeing as the war was started 100 years ago by Nebulis I, 9 generation of nebulis spawnlings appeared over the course of a decade. Do witches have kids at the age of 10 in this anime?Missmiss : the captain. Her character is there only for fan service and those poorly executed comedic relief moments, which is either falling on the ground, breast bounce or random loli screams. She is incompetent in every single aspect, including her role as a character in this anime. She can also survive the most powerful spells in the universe unscathed, since player 1 would be sad if she died.Random ashen haired guy : sacrastic, mean guy, who\'s only purpose is to be in contrast with player 1. Looks more like a young archer emiya shirou than emiya shirou does.Redhead girl : the generic cheerful girl that works hard and hints that she might be somewhat useful, if only she was a main character, that is.Alice\'s handmaiden : the one and only character in this show which is remotely believeable. She does not have enough relevance to the plot to receive any trope service. If anything, she\'s a voice of reason who\'s only purpose is to be ignored by Alice.Nebulis 1 : One of the strongest witches ever alive, which awakens only to be banhammered into oblivion and forlorn in silence by MC\'s OP 1 shot. She was also the one who attacked the empire 100 years ago.Iska\'s mentor : also the brother of nebulis 1. He managed to survive for 100 years in order to train Iska. Which makes perfect sense for a human.Enjoyment : 1/10.This anime was literally a pain to watch. During the 3rd episode, i constantly felt like screaming or punching something. If you don\'t like generic, poorly written stories with the most variated assortment of overly used tropes, this anime has every single thing that you might hate.Overall : 1/10.Watching 4 episodes of Our Last Crusade was, for sure, one of the worst experiences of my life. This anime has absolutely nothing to offer. It is so bad that you can\'t even make fun of it while watching. If i could give a 0 to one anime, it would be this one for sure. So, why did I watch 4 episodes? Only to be able to leave this review. which can apparently use unlimited blade works and rho aias.- your average kirito.- a fully-fledged mary sue set of protagonists.- fantasy setting, but not because there\'s any creativity involved, but simply because having swords, magic and random words in an non-existent language might be catchy for some people.- a long list of cliche tropes, such as ( but not limited to ) :A.

It\'s not trash, but it\'s not even half of stuff like ufotable quality.Sound : 5/10.No matter how pathetic an anime, good sound effects and soundtracks can do wonders. Yuki Kajiura\'s pieces in SAO will forever be proof to that. But this doesn\'t happen here.Characters : 1/10.The characters in this show are dreadful. Boring. Generic. Cliche.Iska : player 1. For the sake of trying to make him likeable, both by the audience and the female mc, the author makes him free a young witch ( his enemy ) from prison, which in turn has him imprisoned and stripped of his rank. He\'s nothing more than the worst version of your average black haired protagonist. Absolutely righteous, willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good, devoid of emotion, not believeable as an actual person in the slightest, with a worthless attempt for a sad backstory in order to stay true to the shonen formula.Alice Nebulis IX: a powerful, flawless blondie gilgamesh with big breasts. That\'s pretty much all you need to know about her, other than her being a full copy of iska. One other detail which is actually worth noting is the IX (9) in her name. Seeing as the war was started 100 years ago by Nebulis I, 9 generation of nebulis spawnlings appeared over the course of a decade. Do witches have kids at the age of 10 in this anime?Missmiss : the captain. Her character is there only for fan service and those poorly executed comedic relief moments, which is either falling on the ground, breast bounce or random loli screams. She is incompetent in every single aspect, including her role as a character in this anime. She can also survive the most powerful spells in the universe unscathed, since player 1 would be sad if she died.Random ashen haired guy : sacrastic, mean guy, who\'s only purpose is to be in contrast with player 1. Looks more like a young archer emiya shirou than emiya shirou does.Redhead girl : the generic cheerful girl that works hard and hints that she might be somewhat useful, if only she was a main character, that is.Alice\'s handmaiden : the one and only character in this show which is remotely believeable. She does not have enough relevance to the plot to receive any trope service. If anything, she\'s a voice of reason who\'s only purpose is to be ignored by Alice.Nebulis 1 : One of the strongest witches ever alive, which awakens only to be banhammered into oblivion and forlorn in silence by MC\'s OP 1 shot. She was also the one who attacked the empire 100 years ago.Iska\'s mentor : also the brother of nebulis 1. He managed to survive for 100 years in order to train Iska. Which makes perfect sense for a human.Enjoyment : 1/10.This anime was literally a pain to watch. During the 3rd episode, i constantly felt like screaming or punching something. If you don\'t like generic, poorly written stories with the most variated assortment of overly used tropes, this anime has every single thing that you might hate.Overall : 1/10.Watching 4 episodes of Our Last Crusade was, for sure, one of the worst experiences of my life. This anime has absolutely nothing to offer. It is so bad that you can\'t even make fun of it while watching. If i could give a 0 to one anime, it would be this one for sure. So, why did I watch 4 episodes? Only to be able to leave this review.', ""This is a real fun Romeo and Juliet kind of tale, but more magical, let me explain.The story is as I've described. A real different kind of tale of Romeo and Juliet, with a big more context thrown in of course. With each side's higher ups seeming like there is something fishy going on in both camps. Almost making it out as if by the end of the show, both the two MCs are going to come together to put a stop to something. Which just peeks interest.Speaking of which, they're two interesting characters, they do come off as a bit generic however in some...stretch. But are fairly decent characters overall. From their backstories, to how they act in general. Though my personal favorite is the captain of the Male MC's side. She's just a treat, and is a super sweetie who you should protect.The art of this show is top notch far as I am concerned, from how the backgrounds look, how the characters look, to the magic fights in general. You can really tell there was a lot of effort put into it, and it really shows. Good work there.

SO...why not let me top that with a 1 (for the start, because why not) + 1 (for the ending, because I\'m seriously gimped out) = 2! That\'s a way better (enjoyment) score if I say so myself, HUR HUR.The classic novel tale of Shakespeare\'s Romeo and Juliet needs no introduction, and there has been only a couple of shows that are based on the ""forbidden love"" structure: Gonzo\'s take of the classic tale (released in 2007), and more recently, the loose inspiration...that is Boarding School Juliet just 2 years prior (and your boy\'s review is DAMN SPOT-ON, because he\'s a manga reader of a confidence man).But what about KimiSen, you ask? It\'s an action-packed military, sci-fi version of the classic novel, honouring the ""forbidden love"" setting justice, while doing a disservice cramming the story plot full of never-ending tropes and clichés that just makes you want to endlessly vomit blood. Need I mention that for the majority of you who like this, flame me all you want, you are missing out on similar shows that does everything better (hell, just go and watch Boarding School Juliet or Gonzo\'s 2007 adaptation, I can promise that you\'ll have a better overall experience). Throwing shade, and nailed it!All of these, under a flailing mangaka and novelist by the name of Kei Sazane, who\'s been experimenting with the ""same but different"" concepts since 2012, of which KimiSen is his latest LN work. That should give you an indication of how his ""work ethos"" is: a consistently bad track record. How the hell he got this far is beyond my wildest dreams, there\'s just no light bulb of originality at all (that continues to rake in his income, at least that is his livelihood now. And please don\'t go attack him).Story? An expected pass (because it is): Two nations of different empires at war, war\'s over (but not, because setting) but not for 2 characters: a boy and a girl who desire for peace upon the world, has to contend with background factions causing extra conflicts, and blah blah blah. Very standard ""Romeo X Juliet"" style story.Plot? A BIG FAT FAIL:- Your average quiet boy Iska: A Kirito rip-off of a mute, and a by-the-book-abiding ""righteous"" dark knight for a unique and special reason: the disastrous mistakes he\'s caused by releasing the opposing faction\'s captive <something>.- Your average tsundere girl Alice: A big-breasted femme fatale nicknamed the ""Ice Calamity <something>"", and simultaneously a Gilgamesh ""Deus Ex Machina"" called to oppose her ""lover\'s"" faction.The only thing they have in common: achieving peace (DUH), the <something> called witches (and girls at that), being prodigies with similar tastes (because they sure as hell do match for SOME reason), and most importantly: flirt with one another openly (at least for Alice)! Get a magical walkie-talkie or something to continue your lovey-dovey conversation.Characters? Conspicuously laughable at best:- Iska\'s Empire faction of self-righteous boy Jhin, ""fortune-telling fate"" Nene, ""Razzie Award for most useless character"" Mismis (and a CAPTAIN at that), double-edged mediocre ""defector""-cum-strategist Risya, and the serious assassin Nameless, strong in-name only and a stark contrast to the MC.- Alice\'s Nebulis Sovereignity faction of her personal maid Rin (whom she ignores almost all the time), the younger 3rd (sister) wheel pink-haired Sisbell, the older ""like mother, like (1st) daughter"" Elletear with the conventional ""villain"" faction Masked Lord (you know they HAD to) and the faction\'s purebre(a)d girlish weapon Kissing (because names are so overrated).*mimics Mickey Mouse* OH BOY, those are wonderful qualities of Mary Sue archetypes!Art/Animation? ERM...one pass and one fail?As is with every Silver Link-produced show in 2020 alone: Winter\'s Bofuri, Spring\'s Otome Game, and Summer\'s Maou Gakuin, all these 3 shows pale in great comparison to the studio\'s ""generic-ness"" signature, and this Fall, it doesn\'t get much better than KimiSen. (Sidenote: Those 3 shows are FAR better than this, don\'t flame me for that, please and thanks!) Directors Shin Oonuma and Mirai Minato are back from Bofuri, and they at least honoured Kei Sazane\'s work in the visual front of ""breathtaking"" military pompous shown throughout the anime. At least that would be the case...if the story matches the action in terms of a victory-sized glorious match-cum-rivalry made in Heaven.Sound/Music? Averagely respectable at best.I wholeheartedly agree with @evLRise that no matter how lamentable anime can be, a good OST will be its saving grace (heck, that\'s the same case for Gibiate as well). Even with some big names like Yuusuke Kobayashi, Sora Amamiya, Azumi Waki and Kaori Ishikawa for an above-average VA cast, this show just makes their talents feel completely wasted, as if there\'s little to no life given to their characters. The OST is fine though, both Kaori Ishikawa\'s OP and Sora Amamiya\'s ED sound fairly good in spots, but I\'d probably just listen to the pairing once (in full) and dismiss it altogether, forever.Enjoyment? A dull, ludicrous ""expedition of fate""/10The ""Romeo X Juliet"" story of pedestal deserves much better than this turd. I feel NOTHING for the double-sided world-building, the awfully written bland characters, the lackluster visuals and animation, and the forgettable sound and music. Even on a ""grand stage"" like this, it is a total ""incompleteness of cringe overload"" content, all wrapped up in a ""nice"" package.Overall, sometimes I want to make fun of ""so bad it\'s hilariously good"" shows (like Gibiate), but KimiSen by all accounts, lies at the other end of the ""so bad it\'s (un)hilariously bad"" spectrum.

Vámonos.', 'Our last crusade or the rise of a new world is a joke. I don\'t know why the light novel got an adaptation since it would of been best just as a LN since it\'s a cliché romeo and juliet inspired plot that wasn\'t cut out for an adaptation from the beginning.Story:Like mentioned above, last crusade is a romeo and juliet type character story with the main character Iska being a disciple of the Empire, while big jugged Alice is a witch for the Sovereignty. Basically everyone from the Sovereignty have these elemental/magical powers while everyone in the Empire don\'t and instead have technology....Not only was every encounter predictable, but the story itself was difficult to follow because of how many things were initially going on. Though our 2 MC\'s were a main focus, the anime never actually explains key components that would of explained situations a lot better and just goes off the rails for the majority of anime. Most of the time it\'s just the classic, ""Oh no here\'s another unexpected enemy that causes us to fight together!"" And don\'t even get me started on how much plot armor the characters had.Art:I believe that if this anime didn\'t get adapted with good art/animation, no one would be praising it. The colors were vibrant, backgrounds were neat, and fights were quite colorful. Reminded me of SAO art at times.Sound:The OP sounded like a goat being strangled and the ED was nothing special.Characters:After the story, the characters come next in order of worst things about last crusade. The MC, Iska, is a generic, emotionless, brainless tard. He is the obvious can\'t get a clue protagonist who get\'s all the chicks because of all the saving he does. Then comes Alice. To be honest, Alice\'s enormous melons, jugs, bean bags, whatever, you know what I\'m talking about; were the only 2 things that kept me awake during the episodes. However I must say that just slapping enormous volcanoes on her doesn\'t make her an interesting character. She is the same old Tsundere copied and pasted onto another romance. Not only that, but they had to give her the most cliché tsundere VA as well. Besides those two, every enemy they encountered seemed like a child written final boss created in third grade. Everything from their character designs to talk was so cringe that I couldn\'t stand watching any other character except Alice and her sister.Overall:The only parts of last crusade that I actually enjoyed were the butler and Alice sister conflict part. Since it actually added some flavor into the emotionless mc\'s encounters. So do I suggest watching our last crusade? No. Our last crusade or the rise of the new world or whatever it\'s called has no element of surprise, no actual romance progression, and no actual climax. The few main fights we get aren\'t even seen as crucial to the characters themselves so why should it be to us as the watchers?If it wasn\'t for Alice\'s double quarter pounders, I probably would have fell asleep during each of the 12 episodes. In conclusion, don\'t waste your time on this unless you\'re looking for a mess of an anime with 2 very large redeeming qualities.

I'm still new to anime, but I do already know what I like and what I don't. I've seen most of the well known ones, and I have a solid idea of how the whole mechanism works.2. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! SPOILEEEEEEEERS!Now on with the review. I started this anime with no expectations, only because I do that with every single thing. I like a good fantasy setting, and I never mind a proper fight between two strong characters. What I got here instead is an unfinished premise, a war between the science driven human under...the banner of the Empire, and  magic users, properly named mages.Let's say that won't be a problem, as long as we have the characters of the show, whose story, while unveiled, will reveal certain facts about the world around them. That, of course, is not the case. What we are presented with fails to build anything, and instead destroys my faith in anyone being able to create a good story in 2020, under the leadership of Silver Link Studios.Enter the male protagonist, the discount Kirito of SAO fame (another crap anime btw), who is so powerful, so strong, so mysterious! Yet I have no desire to ever decipher his mystery, because the poor guy was cursed with some of the most bland, generic writing I've ever encountered on screen.His weapons are two utterly overpowered swords, with which he can effortlessly negate any sort of magic. And I didn't even mention how he is a young flawless prodigy of his craft, because that is so unique and no one ever thought about that, right guise? Those combined make him an allpowerful, indestructible enemy from the very first episodes, and now I come to wonder, why do I even watch this shit? The guy has a built in invincibility code. What chances do the mages stand?Speaking of mages, enter the 'Ice Calamity Witch', one of the most feared enemy of the Empire. I really wonder why the hell are they so afraid of? She is your standard emotional, faux pacifist blonde with big tits, clumsy moves and useless powers. She cannot even hope to land a hit on anyone, not just your overpowered male protagonist.The two MCs have a cringe worthy encounter. Both factions are assisted by their useless peers, and the fight, just like this anime, goes nowhere really.Following some brief dialogue, they conclude they both wish for peace. Overcome by emotions, our dreaded Ice Calamity Witch SLIPS on her OWN ICE and lands straight into the arms of the male MC, prompting her to wish to land on his penis instead.And this is where your fight scene ends. There we go. Following this is the most vile slice of life crap I've yet to see (and I love slice of life). The two main characters fall in love, and we are treated with an insane barrage of cock blocking failure regarded by the writers as romance. God help us all. The most undesired tropes are there, and they made me so frustrated, I'm not even going to mention them. Imagine everything you wish to not see if your standard shoujo anime, and you have it.The frustrating romance we are constantly bombarded with reaches its disturbing climax in episode 3, when together, the two love enhanced protagonists manage to defeat THE MAIN VILLAIN. You read that right. In episodes 3, the main villain, the mother of all mages is defeated in the most retarded, anticlimactic fight to ever exist anywhere. After pointlessly firing nukes at the main pair, only for them to fail to reach their target (I guess this where the ICW got her skills from), she gets her one shot.ONE. SHOT. and dies. Is this the meaning of life?  Is this what Jesus Christ died for?And then some other shit happens, don't care to write about it anymore. If a show pulls such a bastard trick on the viewer, make sure its authors do not deserve the attention of anyone who is capable of breating and blinking at them same time. To hell with this. I will not watch more episodes.Time to conclude this long review, and congratulate myself for being able to write this in such a calm manner.1. Plot: 1/10, see above.2. Characters: 1/10. Besides the two protagonists, the other characters do absolutely nothing to advance the story. Dragged from the generic pool of crap, they seem to be unable to exist on their own.We have your edgy silver haired friend of the male MC, who barely gets any screen time. We have the Empire's squad captain, a loli with massive tits, who is supposed to be their emotional pylon, but all she does is trip on her shoe laces. She EVEN ADMITS her worthlessness as a captain, hahaha.  And we have the Ice Calamity Witch's assistant, who got in this anime by mistake, and now has to live with it. A speck of light in an oppressive ocean of shadow, poor woman.3. Art: 5/10, it was ok.4. Sound: 5/10, not bad, but unremarkable5. Enjoyment: I'd rather be that guy who took 200 foreskins off of dead Philistine soldiers for King David, than ever have to watch this mountain of filth again.6. Overall: Please kill me. 1/10. the banner of the Empire, and  magic users, properly named mages.Let's say that won't be a problem, as long as we have the characters of the show, whose story, while unveiled, will reveal certain facts about the world around them.

And I didn't even mention how he is a young flawless prodigy of his craft, because that is so unique and no one ever thought about that, right guise? Those combined make him an allpowerful, indestructible enemy from the very first episodes, and now I come to wonder, why do I even watch this shit? The guy has a built in invincibility code. What chances do the mages stand?Speaking of mages, enter the 'Ice Calamity Witch', one of the most feared enemy of the Empire. I really wonder why the hell are they so afraid of? She is your standard emotional, faux pacifist blonde with big tits, clumsy moves and useless powers. She cannot even hope to land a hit on anyone, not just your overpowered male protagonist.The two MCs have a cringe worthy encounter. Both factions are assisted by their useless peers, and the fight, just like this anime, goes nowhere really.Following some brief dialogue, they conclude they both wish for peace. Overcome by emotions, our dreaded Ice Calamity Witch SLIPS on her OWN ICE and lands straight into the arms of the male MC, prompting her to wish to land on his penis instead.And this is where your fight scene ends. There we go. Following this is the most vile slice of life crap I've yet to see (and I love slice of life). The two main characters fall in love, and we are treated with an insane barrage of cock blocking failure regarded by the writers as romance. God help us all. The most undesired tropes are there, and they made me so frustrated, I'm not even going to mention them. Imagine everything you wish to not see if your standard shoujo anime, and you have it.The frustrating romance we are constantly bombarded with reaches its disturbing climax in episode 3, when together, the two love enhanced protagonists manage to defeat THE MAIN VILLAIN. You read that right. In episodes 3, the main villain, the mother of all mages is defeated in the most retarded, anticlimactic fight to ever exist anywhere. After pointlessly firing nukes at the main pair, only for them to fail to reach their target (I guess this where the ICW got her skills from), she gets her one shot.ONE. SHOT. and dies. Is this the meaning of life?  Is this what Jesus Christ died for?And then some other shit happens, don't care to write about it anymore. If a show pulls such a bastard trick on the viewer, make sure its authors do not deserve the attention of anyone who is capable of breating and blinking at them same time. To hell with this. I will not watch more episodes.Time to conclude this long review, and congratulate myself for being able to write this in such a calm manner.1. Plot: 1/10, see above.2. Characters: 1/10. Besides the two protagonists, the other characters do absolutely nothing to advance the story. Dragged from the generic pool of crap, they seem to be unable to exist on their own.We have your edgy silver haired friend of the male MC, who barely gets any screen time. We have the Empire's squad captain, a loli with massive tits, who is supposed to be their emotional pylon, but all she does is trip on her shoe laces. She EVEN ADMITS her worthlessness as a captain, hahaha.  And we have the Ice Calamity Witch's assistant, who got in this anime by mistake, and now has to live with it. A speck of light in an oppressive ocean of shadow, poor woman.3. Art: 5/10, it was ok.4. Sound: 5/10, not bad, but unremarkable5. Enjoyment: I'd rather be that guy who took 200 foreskins off of dead Philistine soldiers for King David, than ever have to watch this mountain of filth again.6. Overall: Please kill me. 1/10."", 'I will preface my review by letting you know that this is the first review I\'ve ever written on this website so i am sorry if i won\'t be following the proper reviewing format or if any mistakes by slip through but i am glad to be able to have my first be Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World.PLOT - 1The plot is a pretty basic concept where you take two warring factions and add the main protagonists on both sides mixed up with some mutual interest between the two. Similar to the story of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. On one side...we have the Mage Hunters avid users of science whilst the other side has of course the mages avid users of ... well, magic. The 2 faction are also split by a neutral control ground where you\'ll also find the very fittingly and originally name ""Neutral City"", a place where all wars is prohibited. By whom exactly is this prohibited or enforce is a question you might ask yourselves since the world is controlled by 2 factions that are at each other teeth ? Well we don\'t know, they just don\'t fight and we\'ll roll with it for the sake of the story.Moving to our two protagonists Iska the Swordsman and Alice the Witch who are dictated by the world around them to be sworn enemies. The two meet quite rapidly in the series and realize by a fortunate chain of events that they\'re maybe not as bad as they thought each other to be since after a grandiose display of power from each they come to terms by Alice slipping on her own Ice into the arms of our hero ; a superb mix of comedy and epic battle, i really enjoyed it ; that was sarcasm, i did not and hated every single frame of the closing moments of the first episode. The story thereafter continues with them getting closer and closer to one another and even become allies on the battlefield, hurrah for non-clicheic moments.SOUND - 1For the sound, i did not really find any piece to really move me or influence the anime, it\'s pretty much generic and adds nothing to the events developing on screen.CHARACTERS - 1For the Characters I\'ll try to comment a bit on the people presented so far.Iska : Our main man Mary Sue protagonist himself. As far as I\'ve come to know from the episodes I\'ve watched Iska has an unbreakable moral compass and can never do any wrong, all he wants to do is bring forth peace between the 2 kingdoms and does not harbor any hatred for the nice witch girls next door, he even saves them tossing away all the training and prep invested in him but does anyone care ? Not really the powers that be release him for the sake of him being really strong anyway. Did i get to tell you about his strength ? No ? Well Iska is strong, like really strong, strong to the level where we\'re introduced to him randomly beating everyone without breaking a sweat due to the artifacts he\'s been giving, as to why he\'s gotten to be so strong and Almighty, the explanation is as good as the one you get for the existence of Neutral City. He also seems to be pretty much unbeatable at least from a Mage\'s point of view since the random swords he\'s gifted with are the strongest artifacts on the Science Geek\'s side, which of course the ruling council decides to give out to an under aged felon convicted for helping the enemy, that\'s some Neon Genesis Magi logic level there. The squad he\'s part off are in black hole of darkness cast by his shadow since all 3 other members seem just utterly useless compared to him on the battlefield. All in all he\'s a generic bland uninspired protagonist with no real trait to differentiate him form your borderline main hero.Alice : Our other protagonist and the Witch side\'s version and counterpart of Iska who just as him wishes for world peace and is pretty much a copy paste of 90% of what Iska thinks and does just copy pasted into a tall huge boobed blonde. The emphasis on their bond and similarities is superbly written by showing how quirky and unique they are during some very random and unexpected meetings where they enjoy the same hipster food, cold pasta, Art and even chug a Beer, how fun and unique is she fellas?Nene Alkastone : The bubbly redhead, doesn\'t really do much since Iska pretty much can 1 v World ; the cheery colleague added to fill some screen time with bouncing boobs.Miamis Klass : The squad captain. Clumsy, air headed, no physical skills, no combat skills, no real knowledge as most of the things are explained to her by her team as she\'s pretty much there as the lackluster newbie who had all the Pokemon\'s moves explained by Brock. Knowing all that the question I\'d humbly ask is .... how the hell does someone like this even come close to being part of a combat squad let alone a captain ... like all other female characters she also rocks an impressive buss om slapped onto the body of a Loli.Jhin : The wing man and bud of Iska, he\'s around their two i guess rocking the I\'m really cool calm and calculated attitude, pretty much the random dude in your class that randomly idolized Sasuke a bit too much, probably runs bent at 90 degrees with his arms spread like the wings of a plane.Rin Vispose : The only character I\'ve felt some empathy or emotion for. Rin is the servant/maid of Alice who seems to be the only normal nonscoring person in the series. She\'s kinda there i guess, even summons some golems only for the to get obliterated and one-shot to show case Iska\'s powers a bit. Fairly similar to Ai Hayasak from Kaguya-Sama love is War,who funnily enough is voiced by the same actress, I\'d like to mention this is also the only fun thing I\'ve found in the anime.For Character Development i really do not know what to say as pretty much the only thing that kept developing over the time I\'ve watched this was my sense of bore, dread and repulsion. Every generic trope is used in order to further the relationship between Iska and Alice, from her falling to his arms, to them randomly meeting up randomly multiple times in Neutral City, to liking the same stuff, having the same morally just goals and even speaking in sync. As far as we know we don\'t really get any explanation from either of them as two why golden prodigal chosen children / teens would want to deviate from the means of their society and ally with the enemy they\'ve known to have killed thousands of their comrades just because they kinda clicked, this goes back to the point of both of them being two Mary Sue characters who can never really do any wrong and won\'t stray from the path of righteousness and moral equity which does not really appeal to my taste since i find it to completely minimize the impact of their Alliance. The lack of struggle, conflict or justification for their random truce just makes it come of as the randomly inserted trope that it is, remake #46373 of Romeo &amp; Juliette but without any of the build up.ENJOYMENT - 1As far as my overall enjoyment for this anime, i\'ve thought you can pretty much guess it was aiming towards the abyssal depths of a bottomless pit, every second of it felt and eternity only to wait and watch trope after trope intertwined in one of the most cringey and awkward ways possible. Borrowing elements from other anime\'s such as Fate for Alice\'s design and power usage, Kirito v0.03 for iska, Science Dude\'s council being SEELE from Neon Genesis etc. etc. will not magically make an anime be good. In my opinion this is the worst anime I\'ve ever seen due to the sheer amount of elements that i for one find distasteful, meaningless or downright nonsensical that it employs and i have rated it accordingly and will not waste anymore time with watching further episodes.ART - 6For starters let\'s begin with what I\'ve found likable about the anime. The graphics/animation were fairly good although i am the first to admit i am not exactly enamoured by the graphics part of an anime and find the Story, Characters and Sound to be of a far greater importance, but that is just me.Moving on to what I\'ve disliked about the anime and it\'s a pretty long list and i am not exactly sure what i should start off with so let\'s begin with the story.OVERALL - 1 we have the Mage Hunters avid users of science whilst the other side has of course the mages avid users of ... well, magic.

Producing in my opinion, 4 of the best shows of the year.Kimisen, by far the most underrated of the 4, is a rather unique twist on the traditional Romeo and Juliet forbidden love type story. It’s got many of the same motifs you’d associate with that sort of story, but presents them in an original way with a really interesting world and characters. As someone who loves that type of romance, this was a great experience.On one hand, some may argue kimisen is “generic”, as if that inherently makes something bad. I personally don’t find that to...be the case and really thought Iska and Alice’s relationship and the conflict between their countries was enjoyable. Silverlink have a reputation for taking rather “generic” stories and turning them into enjoyable watches with good direction, voice acting and choreography. This was no exception.I feel at times the pacing was slightly off and there were some leaps in logic, but that’s to be expected from LN adaptations, so I won’t be too harsh on Silverlink for that. This definitely feels like an example of the studio promoting the source material and it did just the job for me. I’m a sucker for good romance, comedy and drama, and I think Kimisen has that in abundance. I’ll definitely be checking out the Light Novels to get the rest of the story.Kimisen gets 9 astral crests out of 10. be the case and really thought Iska and Alice’s relationship and the conflict between their countries was enjoyable.

Why? Because the show needed an intrigue. The shows beings roughly 100 years after the outbreak of war, and the action revolves around 2 characters, Iska, the strongest solider in the human empire - except he\'s not. He just has...2 beyond over powered swords. One which can apparently nullify any magic. Imagine being a witch and fighting against that with magic. The second main character is Alice, a direct descendant of Nebulis, the most powerful witch in the world.

Our goal is to watch this little ""mini-war"", but I honestly found myself enjoying the lighter moments, story wise.

These episodes were decent, but anything outside were horrible from a story standpoint.  It ends on an okay note, but the story just feels all over the place. (4/10)Characters: The obvious attractions are Iska and the princess of the Astral mages, Alice.  Iska is a skilled swordsman who is determined to follow through on what he believes in, regardless of the consequences.  Alice\'s personality isn\'t complex, so much as it is confusing.  Iska and Alice meet in battle pretty early on, but after that, their interactions are mostly in neutral territory and they\'re actually pretty sweet.  This overshadows the main story and even if you consider their interactions as part of the main story, the series stalls it once we get to the end.  I found myself simply not caring about most any character in this story as they just weren\'t interesting.  Mismis and Risya in particular were unbearable to watch.  About halfway through, we learn of some more ""enemies"", but the story ended before they did much of anything and their goal seemed rather generic.  (5/10)Art: If there is one area Our Last Crusade did succeed, it was the art.  The entire show, particularly the action scenes looked amazing.  It\'s a horrible shame that this art direction was wasted on this anime though.  The fighting scenes were animated mostly well - there were few hiccups in certain character movements.  The encampments weren\'t much to look at either as they were pretty generic, as did the neutral city. (8/10)Sound: It\'s really hard for me to rate sound too much here as it never really stood out to me one way or the other.  Which, in this case, might\'ve been okay.  The OP was nice, but not much else stuck out - for better or for worse.  (7/10)Overall enjoyment: I cannot really recommend this one.  There\'s just not enough here that you haven\'t seen attempted in other anime, but done better.  The interactions between Iska and Alice were touching, but outside of those, the characters and story alike were both forgettable.

If that wasn\'t enough there\'s also an 11th hour love triangle, an 11th hour ""betrayal,"" an 11th hour introduction of a major character, and did I mention an ending that concludes nothing?For positives, Kimi to Boku Blah Blah looks fantastic. A lot of the special effects have beautifully contrasting colors...and loads of particles to go along with really solid and crunchy sounds. The created world is super interesting too in that it takes the ""techno empire vs witches\' kingdom"" into the future where there are cars, guns, cell phones, highrises, and so on for both sides. It\'s science fantasy which in my opinion is a dying subgenre (is it even that anymore? sigh I\'m old).Negatives are everything else including most of what I just wrote above. Yeah the created world is interesting but it\'s so much in the background that\'s it\'s like the background\'s grandchild\'s neighbor\'s dog trainer\'s milk delivery man. In the first episode there\'s all this importance placed on a reactor, which makes it seem the Kimi Sekai Who Cares will actually live up to that ""military"" tag, but no. It\'s never mentioned again. The world geography is shown also, but besides the fact there is the ""le science empire"" and the ""witch kingdomerino"" alongside various neutral cities it\'s never displayed or mentioned after the first episode. Any semblance of the aforementioned ""military"" tag is tossed right out the window as well outside of literally two scenes in a FOB that last about a minute.Antagonists are poorly written megalomaniacs with subversive agents so comically ""fore"" ""shadowed"" that even the dog trainer\'s bookie\'s strongarm\'s accountant\'s blind elderly cat could figure them out. All the characters in all factions are like 0.01-dimensional too.Well whatever, there\'s no point wasting more time explaining what a misfire Hajimaru Seisen Miss Me With That Shit is. I highly doubt there will be a season two, so maybe the only enjoyment here would be skipping through all the boring diatribes just to experience the setting, then stop around maybe episode nine. and loads of particles to go along with really solid and crunchy sounds.

But, here I am writing a review of it after finishing it, so it can’t be that bad right?STORY: 7If I had to describe the plot of this anime with one word, I could, and that word would be: coincidence. The plot is so heavy on the coincidental meetings of our two main characters that it really becomes the only plot device that advances it. It’s pretty ridiculous, and in my opinion pretty...poor writing. Too predictable, and too contrived. Definitely negative remarks there. Moving on though, the rest of the story...is not too bad. It’s not entirely new, more of a repackaging of stories in this sort of fantasy/magic/harem genre. So nothing especially new here. I was going to give it a 6, but I’m going to bump it up a point because of the potential. As an anime-only watcher, I am excited to see where (if) this anime goes. The build up in season so far is great as a build up instead of a story. If taken in the right direction this could be a story that I would greatly like to see, and would be something that not many stories can successfully pull off. But until then.ART: 8Basically it’s the highest I can give it. A 9 would have to be exceptionally above the norm, and I don’t give 10’s anymore. The colors and the sharpness are great, the art style is rather appealing as well given that it does have a uniqueness about it. Nothing particularly garish, and the designs of the characters are good.SOUND: 7Again, not something that I watch or listen to on the norm, but I guess its ok. Nothing special to write home about. OP/ED are forgettable, and the in-anime sound complements the action as it should.CHARACTER: 7Characters are slightly one dimensional, there is some development, but not much. As I pointed out earlier in the Story part, this has a lot of potential to be a gorgeous story with some exciting character development, but as far as this anime goes as a season, not seeing it yet. The characters themselves are again, middle of the pack, nothing special about them, and nothing that really sets them apart. But again, the potential is there.ENJOYMENT: 8Overall enjoyment of this anime... well, I did enjoy it somewhat, but honestly not that much. I wouldn’t really recommend this as a top-of-my-list type of anime, but its good enough to pass the time. There isn’t much more to say here, its definitely not compelling enough in my opinion to warrant enjoying it.OVERALL: 7Overall, this anime is a 7 for me. Yea, I’m still reviewing it even though I usually only review anime’s that are exceptionally good or horrendously bad. But, its a seasonal anime, and I’m down for reviewing those. So, in sum, not that great to be honest. Definitely a very average anime, with a very coincidence-heavy plot. A lot of my praise does come from seeing this anime’s potential though, I think that the story so far is great as a setup, and it could lead to greater things in the future. Hoping for a season 2, but not really sure that it will get one. If they had paced things a bit quicker at the expense of weaker character development, it could have worked. Anyways, breakdown of the 7 score is 1 for story + 3 for potential + 2 for art + 1 for enjoyment= 7 overall. Yes my score is heavily reliant on the potential future avenues this anime could take, but hey, the possibilities are there and they excite me, even if this anime as a standalone season did not.Peace. poor writing.

I am not reviewing the sound. This review contains minor spoilers.This is my final edit until I create a new review when the anime finishes:A new season, a new long titled LN anime to enjoy! This seasons entry is ""Our last crusade or the rise of a new world"". If you dont know yet this is a Romeo...and Juliet styled anime. I actually thought I was going to enjoy this anime since romance animes usually get me hooked quick even if the storyline is below average, and as you can tell by my rating, it did not. Ok so with that out of the way, on to the review!Story: 2/10This story is basically your typical Romeo and Juliet story done wrong... like really wrong. Im not gonna pretend like I\'ve seen a ton of romance anime or anime in general. For starters the main character (Iska) starts off arrested for breaking a ""witch"" out of the empires jail (if your wondering what the hell is going on, its because this is out of context, just watch the damn show). obviously he gets arrested for it, when he gets sent out to capture this witch called alice(the love interest) he lets her go for some reason. I\'ll go more into depth with this in the character page. They basically keep meeting up for some reason(which is incredibly corny) and eventually start liking eachother just because they see eachothers faces a lot. No joke, two enemies like eachother just because they see eachother a lot. When you make love at first sight exist in a story (which might of happened here) you need to write the dialogue well, and we all know most LN writers aren\'t capable of that.Art: 6/10The art looks pretty decent. The art is the one thing thats above a 5 with this show.Characters: 1/10Ok so did you think the story was bad? Im just gonna say if it was possible to rate characters a 0 I would\'ve. Lets go over all of them!1/10 Iska: Basicially one of the worst LN anime MC\'S out there. Overpowered? Check. Way too good of a person? Check. Honestly, hes even worse than Kirito from Sword art online.3/10 Alice: A tsundare blonde haired girl sounds like a 10/10 waifu design doesn\'t she? Well design doesn\'t mean anything when they aren\'t written well. Alice basically likes her own enemy because... well thats just it no one knows why. Oh did I mention she even HELPS Iska sometimes? Other than those bad ones no other personality traits.Then we have my biggest problem. The most useless character in the show is the captain(Mismis Klassz). Why the hell is this even a thing?Enjoyment: 2/10Although I literally Have to force myself to watch this every week, the coincidences of Iska and Alice meeting practically everywhere is hilarious. I also can\'t rate it a 1 because im still watching it.Overall: 1/10As you can see, I changed my rating from a 2/10 to a 1/10. If your wondering why its because after episode 9. To be specific the Demon Sallinger vs Iska fight. Sallinger is basically just a poor mans Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh being one of my favorite characters in anime made me like it pretty fast, and nearly got me to change my character rating... Until Iska somehow beat him. Im kinda confused on how the hell a MC can be this bad that they can beat a fricking demon in the 9th episode. It seems they took every power fantasy MC trope, combined them, and created a dumpster fire of a anime. and Juliet styled anime.

That\'s not to say that it isn\'t worth watching, however, if it meets your tastes. The aim of this review will be to inform people what they\'re signing up for.If you\'re simply looking to enjoy some cool fights in a fantasy setting with overpowered protagonists and don\'t mind overlooking critical story elements while doing so, this anime was probably made with you in mind. SAO fans will feel right at home here.Let\'s get the show\'s glaring weaknesses out of the way...first - the story (2/10) and characters (3/10). These things being well-written might be the most important aspects of an anime for a lot of people, and if so I wouldn\'t recommend even starting this one.The premise itself is fairly standard and even promising, but what has been romanticized as an ""anime version of Romeo and Juliet"" is far from deserving of such a comparison. The exposition was okay at best, but past episode 4 plot holes abound and the story is beyond saving. There are more characters than there need to be, and as a result most of them end up feeling bland and pointless. The entirety of Iska\'s squad are the main transgressors, particularly Captain Mismis. Villains either disappear or are defeated immediately after their introduction, and there are no objectives other than the overly general statement that characters want to ""end the war,"" which seemingly has no reason to be happening in the first place. Romance is driven mostly by coincidence, which is lazily chalked up to ""fate,"" with no real chemistry between the two main characters other than the occasional blush when they look at each other as an awkward attempt to signify interest in one another. In short, there is no character or event thus far that comes even close to compelling.The sound (5/10) has no glaring weaknesses or mentionable strengths, and is basically a non-factor in the show\'s quality. The art (6/10) may be the show\'s one redeeming quality, though, and even then it\'s nothing to commend on at length. Character designs aren\'t bad (Alice\'s is actually quite good, she draws attention whenever she\'s on screen), and animation in fights is the kind that would be difficult to tolerate without sound effects but isn\'t grating to the point of unwatchability. It more or less gets the job done.If you\'re not looking for a though-provoking masterpiece and are just trying to turn  your brain off and consume something, this junk food of an anime might actually prove enjoyable for you. Personally, most of my enjoyment (6/10) here comes from the anticipation of the ship being built up for the entirety of the story thus far finally sailing, and despite my observance of the show\'s many flaws it\'s this eventuality that has allowed me a modicum of investment.Overall, it\'s a 4/10. first - the story (2/10) and characters (3/10).

The ever present director of Silver Link, Oonuma Shin, was indeed involved in three ouf the four I mentioned, as well as some of my favourites like Baka to Test and e.f. series, so that does kind of support my expectation in a way.Story 5/10It's nothing special, although I would give some credit for not being an isekai alone. The story feels as if Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet was in a fantasy setting, with a (lot) more generic male lead. It's a standard LN adaptation for the purpose of advertising and boosting LN sales, so the story was guaranteed to be either rushed or incomplete and indeed, it's inconclusive with no hints of a season 2 (yet). The setting was nice (fantasy vs modern warfare) but that was it.Art 4/10The factor I care about the most usually, and it was sub-par most of the times. The previous three this year had better character designs. But does this have better action or animation quality in general? Not quite. Silver Link does not even have a reuputation of having good action scenes but I found it even more underwhelming than Maou Gakuin, which was not great either.Character 6/10The 907th unit was uninteresting most of the time; arguably Nene could have not been there for the entirety of anime and it would not have affected the storyline so much. Male MC is just another Kirito-kun (even the design) and while the female lead is a lot more attractive, I still prefer the character with the same VA from last season (yes Cheezuru is best girl of 2020, fite me). Her younger sister Sisbell is actually the best girl from this anime despite not having so much screen time, and she single-handedly increased the score by one in this criteria. good girl. Maid girl(Rin) seemed interesting at first due to her resemblance of Hayasaka but she quickly fell off after constantly attacking our MC-kun unfoundedly.Enjoyment 4/10I had to half-force myself to watch this every week, and that's a minus. While some parts of the stroy kept me slightly interested, most arcs simply ended up with MC-kun's OP-ness (it's worrying that I can't even remember his name while typing this). I would say it was only marginally better than the likes of Asterisk Wars and Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut.Overall 5/10It was close to being a 4 but I thought that would be too harsh in my standards given I did enjoy some bits. It's really not different from the common LN adaptations we see nowadays apart from the fact that it is not an isekai, and the MC is not even remotely OP as Maou Gakuin's Anos (wow, I still remember his name) so it wasn't as enjoyable.If you love those incompleted LN adaptations with some OP-ness and fancy Amamiya Sora, you should check this out.

Otherwise, don't."", ""Wow that was bad, wasted potential, zero plot progression, little to nothing romantic build up, imagine having a title like that but with a story that has nothing to do with it in it's 12 episodes, the plot clashes with iska's motivation so he won't take neither Alice or Sisbell's offers, which is dumb, coz basically there's no progress in this 12 episodes, what a complete waste of time smhHonestly the maid is best girl, if only she were a desirable route, hate-love romance is always the bestRegardless, it doesn't really matter who's better with an MC like that, his motivation clashes with the plot,...so he won't take neither Alice or Sisbell's offers, hence zero plot progression, little to nothing romantic build up, this garbage passive MC can't unlocked the potential of any heroineGeez why do they keep making a harem with an MC with zero romantic motivation and dense at the same time, not saying that those with extreme motivation are any better but at least completely get it rid off the dense character trope, zero romantic motivation in a harem is such a weak excuse and just an absolute waste and the ultimate delay button to prolong their already non progressive lazy generic cheap writingboring episodic show 1/10 so he won't take neither Alice or Sisbell's offers, hence zero plot progression, little to nothing romantic build up, this garbage passive MC can't unlocked the potential of any heroineGeez why do they keep making a harem with an MC with zero romantic motivation and dense at the same time, not saying that those with extreme motivation are any better but at least completely get it rid off the dense character trope, zero romantic motivation in a harem is such a weak excuse and just an absolute waste and the ultimate delay button to prolong their already non progressive lazy generic cheap writingboring episodic show 1/10"", 'tl;dr: An anime that has obvious hints of Romeo and Juliet, but that is actually quite different and much more overarching plot oriented, though so far said plot is entirely in the build up stage.This anime is often described as a Romeo and Juliet story, but I don’t think it quite fits into that mold. True, the main guy, Iska, is on one side of a long standing feud, and the main girl, Alice, is on the other. However, when I think of Romeo and Juliet type stories, I think of two people actually being in a relationship or at least properly in love and...the issues that arise from that occurring in the context of being on opposite sides of a conflict. This very much isn’t that. There are definite signs that they are falling in love, mostly from Alice’s side to be honest, but it’s nowhere near in the realm of what I would consider a proper relationship. Rather, I would say at least as far as this season gets, it’s just slow and steady build up to a relationship in the future. It’s pretty clear it’s going to happen at some point, sure, but it’s definitely not there yet.The problem with that is that the slow and steady build up starts getting somewhat repetitive due to how it seems to keep repeating the same motions with a negligible impact. There was definitely progress in the fist arc, but after that any further advancement was negligible. The two main leads also lack any sort of concrete character arc, and thus in the absence of a strong relationship arc either, they don’t feel like they have particularly strong stories. The various side characters don’t fare any better. There are bits and pieces of background and character traits that make them seem somewhat interesting at times, but they’re just hints essentially and overall the cast is pretty flat. Largely, it just feels like it’s going through the motions of showing everyone, giving some brief info on their circumstances, and setting up where their stories might go.And that’s where things get interesting and why this doesn’t really feel like a Romeo and Juliet story at all, despite it seeming like it will be at first glance. This really doesn’t seem to be a character focused story, but a plot focused one. The world building is really solid with the central basis being a science oriented nation, the Empire, at war with a magic oriented nation, The Monarchy, both of which are developed pretty well such that each nation feels like they have a distinct identity. The exact state of the war is left somewhat ambiguous, wherein at times it feels like a hot war and at times it feels like a cold war, but it manages to write around that reasonably well through heavy use of third party neutral nations as the setting. Each nation also seems to have their own internal affairs going on that the two main leads have to deal with respectively, with Iska in the Empire having to deal with protecting one of his friends from ended up a victim of a witch hunt and Alice in the Monarchy dealing with political intrigue due to infighting over who’ll succeed the current queen. And on top of all that, it seems like in the background it’s building up to there being an even bigger issue centered around the foundation of the magic system.There’s a lot going on that’s very interesting and feels like worth getting invested in the continuation of. Still, while this season is clearly just setting up various elements, and though what ultimately gets set up is quite interesting, the set up is paced somewhat slowly to the point that it still feels somewhat dull at times. If the writing centered around characters had been better that could have picked up the slack, but as mentioned, they really don’t. If the action was better that too would definitely have helped, but outside a few key scenes during key battles, there wasn’t much there either. Rather, the key battles were also somewhat weird with things like characters explaining their abilities in a shounen battle like way but with nowhere near as much or good action to warrant it. Like with everything else, there is definite potential to the battle system, but as of yet it’s kind of lacking. And thus overall, I think the series has definite potential and I’m looking forward to the next season and reading the light novels, but this season in and of itself does feel somewhat lacking.The animation and production values were decent enough but not exceptional. I really did like the character designs and general aesthetic to the world though. The OP and ED were both pretty good in terms of audio and visuals. The soundtrack can definitely be good when it tries and there were definitely some really good tracks, but I don’t think they were used all well. For example, there’s a really good piano rendition of the OP, but it was only used once briefly as far as I can remember. the issues that arise from that occurring in the context of being on opposite sides of a conflict.

Romeo Juliet this, Romeo Juliet that... it\'s getting annoying, now I\'m not sure if we were watching a different anime or whatnot, but I haven\'t noticed it being similar to Romeo and Juliet all that badly as some other viewers did. Both Iska and Alice are making decisions in the name of their goal, not in the name of their love, in fact they don\'t even love each other yet... their feelings are still in development. And nowhere do I see them curse the stars, that their kingdoms fight each other and that everyone...is against their love.

You have been warned.Based on a popular light novel of the same name Kimi to Boku no saigo no Senjou Aruiwa Senkai ga Hajimaru Seisen which is better known by its English title Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World to its western fans is an action, military, romance, and fantasy genre anime that gives us the...unique opportunity to see what will happen if in the midst of a devastating war between two powerful countries that have been raging for years that two of the countries most powerful combatants in the form of the most powerful witch and heir to the throne of the Nebulis and a formerly renowned saints disciple whose only crime was an act of mercy was to one day encounter one another on the battlefield and in the process of their fight discover to their eternal surprise that both desire to find a solution that will help bring an end to this fearsome war that has been raging for hundreds of years.Taking place within a world that’s beautiful and united on the surface but yet rife with internal division, discrimination, and outright hostility towards others on the basis of not just their bloodline but of the powers that manifest as a result of the unique power that was native to this world in the form of the energy source the Astral power the world in which the series makes use of as its main setting is certainly one of extreme contrast. On the surface the people of both the Heavenly Empire and the Nebulis sovereignty both live in beautiful and highly technological advanced societies that have been borne out of the eternal hatred that exists between them and yet away from the frontlines the two are relatively alike whether physically or mentally they all want to enjoy a life that’s free from harm and one that’s spent meeting and interacting with others of similar mind and in the process befriending them, bonding with them and maybe find one whose feelings for you are just as strong as your own. But yet this sense of normal life was one that was never meant to be in this world for the eternal hatred between the empire and the sovereignty was one that served to motivate every able-bodied men and woman to take to the field and prosecute a war that serves no real purpose other than creating an endless circle of hatred between the two that served to prolong the war for decades.That is until the fortunate meeting of a formally disgraced Saints Disciple and the famed Ice Calamity Witch whose views on the tragedy that this war was and whose determination to put an end to it and save the people of both sides soon caused an unlikely bond to form between two people whose countrymen had been killing each other for decades. While the idea of a war being fought between two major powers over topics ranging from simple territorial control, religion, and resource grabbing is one that is not uncommon within the world of anime in my eyes what served to draw me to this series was the fact that in the midst of this ever-escalating conflict were two of the most powerful members of both countries encounter each other but instead of trying to spread more hatred by killing each other violently that both were to discover that they both share a common desire and aspiration of trying to finally put an end to this war. This fresh desire to find a way to secure a sense of peace between two powers who had been killing each other for decades I felt was a shining light that served to shine through the dark storm clouds of war that had long enveloped the world and proved to the people of both sides through their actions that cooperation between a man of the empire and a witch of the sovereignty was something that was very much possible once the sense of distrust and hostility was replaced by a sense of civility and politeness borne out of genuine respect of each other was used instead. While the first episode of the series I felt did an excellent job at showing how much the war had affected the society of both the Empire and the Nebulis as well as show the inherent differences between the fighting capabilities of both sides I felt that it also served to allow us to witness the almost destined meeting of Iska and Aliceliese and their shared common goal of wanting to find a way to end this dreadful war that has been consuming their countries for decades. Indeed this episode I felt resonated well within my heart and was the primary reason that I elected to watch this series to the end not just because I want to see the inevitable romance between the two but also see whether can they finally put an end to a war that has been raging for so long via their shared actions and wishes.Aliceliese Lou Nebulis IVAliceliese Lou Nebulis IV portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Killing Bites fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the primary heroine within the series. The second princess of the Nebulis Sovereignty and a powerful astral witch with the famed title of the Ice calamity witch Aliceliese who prefers to be called simply as Alice by her allies and friends from her initial appearance was shown to be someone that was quiet, confident, and kind and was one that had an almost majestic presence that radiated both grace and a commanding presence that only comes from being a member of royalty. As a member of the Nebulis’s ruling family, Alice was noted to be a composed, elegant and perceptive person by nature that when combined with her intelligence and skill at anticipating an enemy's moves made her not just an excellent fighter but an able strategist as well.  However, despite being a member of the royal family Alice was shown to display very little of the kind of snobby attitude that royals usually display being neither arrogant nor rude instead when Alice was in princess mode she was shown to be dignified and determined in nature always willing to protect her charges by taking to the field herself and always planning her moves to maximize chances of success while minimizing the potential of injuries to others a fact that I felt resonated well with her core aim of finding a way to end the war and unite and create a world that was free of prejudice.As the series progresses and we get to see more of Alice’s personality it can be seen curiously that Alice actually possesses two different personalities that are quite different from each other. While in princess mode Alice was noted to be while relatively young was also someone that was elegant and dignified in equal measure being able to act with the best interests of both her kingdom and her own values effectively without compromising on either even when presented with unexpected developments. However, beneath this strong surface self of hers, it can be seen that Alice also has a rather surprisingly soft side to her as well that’s more fitting for a girl of her age. In this persona that’s more akin to her default personality Alice while still maintaining her sense of self-confidence was seen to be far more willing to show her true emotions rather than simply conceal them as she did in princess node. While still maintaining an element of grace Alice was shown to be someone that was carefree in nature and one that preferred to enjoy each moment slowly taking in every second of an event as if carefully remembering it. While maintaining her polite nature Alice was also shown in this persona to display less emotional control than in her princess self being liable to let her hot-headed nature stoke her temper an aspect that was also complemented by her proud and stubborn nature that often serves to make her act on impulse rather than think things through logically especially when Iska is within the equation as well. However, this proud and stubborn nature of hers while certainly something that’s not benefitting of a princess was also contrasted by Alice’s belief in honor both in dealing with enemies on the frontline as well as in repaying people for any debts that they feel owe them. This sense of honourable conduct which while matching well with Iska’s own was one that I felt reflected well on Alice’s own views about the war as she believes that small acts of kindness while small in nature will also be able to accumulate in people’s hearts and perhaps one day serve to change the world a view that’s also supported by her nature when away from the frontline and in default Alice mode.When not engaged in critical war efforts on the frontline Alice was shown to be someone that wasn’t too concerned with the war efforts of either side preferring instead to wander across the land to take in both the sights and try to encounter new experiences in the process as shown in her trip to the theatre in the neutral city to watch a play despite the war. When paired with the kind of interactions that she exhibits when meeting with people that share her passion and views on subjects that interest her Alice was liable to get lost in such conversations and forget her position as a princess as shown in the series second episode where she and Iska shared a rather long talk on food. While a good indication on her desire to explore the land and enjoy herself to the fullest before the war escalates any further this belief of hers I felt also shows well her core belief that despite being mortal enemies that there are still many things that both the Empire and the Sovereignty can stand to learn from each other especially in terms of culture and history a fact that is reinforced by her belief that art has no borders that constrain it and neither should the wishes and desires of both countries itself an excellent allusion to her own goals of uniting the world.Within the series, though Alice was shown to have deep bonds with her retainer and dear friend Rin who served well as both a retainer and an effective adviser for her that largely kept her desire to explore the world firmly in check arguably the best prominent bond that she forms within the series was with that of her opposite number within the war which is that of Iska one of the empires famed Saints Disciple. While nominally the hated enemy of astral witches and one that would have ended with the painful death of the other in brutal combat the relationship that blossomed between them was instead one that started off with a fortunate draw after a fierce exchange of both attacks and ideas that served to make both realize that even in this war-torn world there are still people that share her distaste for the war and are willing to find a way to end it no matter how remote it was. While the relationship between them was one that started off as one that was borne out of mutual respect towards each other regarding their respective skillsets and their shared desire to find a way to end the war this as the series went on this soon transformed into one of genuine admiration and later affection towards him a fact that while cute and heartwarming in nature also showed well her desire to find a rival that was able to offer her both combat support when needed and an emotional and logical counterpart for her plan once that she enacts it.Overall as a character, Alice I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between her princess self and her default airhead Alice self-being especially so. While the relationship between her and Iska for the duration of the series was seen to be a largely one-sided affair on her part I felt that the amount of chemistry that exists between them was one that worked well in combination with their shared desire to end the war by changing the world through their actions that served to make each of their interactions that much more heartfelt and amusing to see.IskaIska portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero and Darwins Game fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the primary protagonist of the series serving as the main male lead of the series. A 16-year-old member of the Empire’s military and a recently reinstated Saints Disciple and the successor of the famed black steel that he inherited from his master the famed head Saints Disciple Crosswell Nes Lubigate Iska from his initial appearances was shown to be a calm, composed, and quiet person by nature that was seen to be someone that approached each day with both determination and a degree of optimism. While a quiet person Iska was also someone that was friendly, kind, confident, and was someone that was very loyal to his friends and comrades and though a soldier that was expected to engage in brutal combat on the frontlines was someone that possessed both honor and a surprisingly cultured side to him as well a side that I felt resonated well with his core motivation of wanting to find a way to end this increasingly brutal and pointless war that has been raging for decades on end. While nominally a soldier that was expected to show no mercy to enemy combatants Iska true to his core beliefs was someone that preferred to make use of incapacitation tactics as his primary means of offense an MO that went well with his combat style as a swordsman due to the myriad ways in which speed and minimum force can be used in combination to knock out enemy combatants without causing lasting damage a fact that is shown well in both Iska’s first fight with Rin and his fight with Kissing a tactic and belief that soon lead him to a chance encounter with his opposite number within the war the famed Ice Calamity witch of the sovereignty Alice.As the series progresses and Iska’s personality is gradually expanded it can be seen that Iska is also someone that’s got his fair share of struggles within him that he wrestles with as well as beliefs that if found out would have caused him to be marked as a heretic and summarily executed by the empire. Due largely to past actions where he freed a young astral mage that had been captured by the empire Iska had been stripped of his title and marked as a criminal in the eyes of both the people of the empire as well as the higher-ups of the military. As a result after his reinstatement as a saints disciple and being reunited with his friends Iska’s determination rather than being lacking on account of being sent to the frontlines once more was instead replaced by a fierce desire to find a way to end the war no matter how far fetched the plans that command creates is. However, while his core determination remains one that acts as one of the primary motivations for his actions another source of motivation that serves to provide another was the fact that he can see and fight alongside his friends and squadmates again. Thanks largely to his conviction as a criminal in the past Iska had as a result lost much of his friends and connections that he had made since joining the military which for most people would have been devastating as humans by nature were social creatures. However, unlike the majority of those past friends, the members of squad N07 of the 907th unit that he served with had instead of running away as the others did instead stayed true to both to their shared beliefs as well as maintaining their hope that one day Iska would be freed and reunited with them again a belief that Mismis, Jhin, and Nene retained until the day of their reunion finally arrived. Thanks to this strong connection that had been forged between them Iska after his release and subsequent reinstatement was not only able to easily step back into the folds of the squad but also repay the trust and wishes that they had maintained in him by devoting both his eternal gratitude to them but also use it as a potent source of motivation for his own plans in finding a way to protect them by finding a way to change the world. However, while knowing that finding a way to stop a war that had been waging for decades will be an almost impossible task never in his wildest dreams that he had hoped to not only encounter his opposite number within the Nebulis in the form of the Ice calamity witch Alice but also form a unique bond with her that was built on their surprisingly similar goal of ending the war by uniting and changing the world.While the relations between the two was not as fast-paced or as affectionate as Alice had hoped on her part the bond between the two served well to allow Iska to not only see the kind of hatred and discrimination that existed across the land but also allow him to form a unique perspective that wasn’t constrained by the propaganda and hatred that was generated by the respective factions. In this, it can be seen that while Iska was similar to Alice in that he sees the soldiers and mages that fight for their respective countries as equal victims of the empire’s greed as a result of their discovery of the astral powers that had laid dormant within the land Iska also rather surprisingly didn’t view the astral crests that signify a person as an astral mage as something that was inherently evil but rather Iska sees the two different cultures and the ideas that they promote among them as the main reasons for the war a fact that was seen to bring him great sadness as Iska was someone that being cultured as he is was someone that appreciated and admired the cultures of other countries if allowed to see them. While allowing him to sync well with Alice’s line of thinking in trying to create a situation that will allow them to end the hatred and unite the world via shared understanding of each other this also allowed Iska to realize that Alice while not a romantic partner as she had hoped that he become yet was also not a hated enemy either but rather was both a dear friend and a rival that served to not only keep him focused on his core goal of finding a way to end the war but also serve as a rival that will keep him motivated whether mentally or in combat strength a strength that needs to be strong enough to both effect change but also be strong enough to allow them to fight against the many harbingers of evil that desire to prolong the war in order to effect their own machinations on the world.Overall the character of Iska I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. While Iska’s base nature of being quiet and reserved was one that served to contrast him from Alice’s vibrant display of both her emotions and earnest determination to change the world his grounded nature, ability to adapt on the fly, open-mindedness and realistic view on battle scenarios I felt served to complement Alice not just physically but emotionally as well as while the odds arrayed against both are high and the shadows impeding them are many both are determined to change the world in order to save the people that’s dearest to them in both countries no matter who stands in their way.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series were pretty well done and designed with the designs for the members of the Nebulis faction being especially so especially the design for Alice whose design was both pretty and featured a great coordination of colors that served to highlight her role as a member of royalty being complemented in this regard by her dignified aura. While Iska’s design did not have the same level of impact as Alice did, I felt that his design while matching well with the empire’s preference for a unified military that’s equipped with gear that’s standardized also had a notable psychological impact as well when taking in consideration with Iska’s unique views on the war. Though as a singular entity Iska whether in temperament or design was one that was easily forgotten and easily hidden behind the crowds however it is when his unique views and aspirations are brought to the surface and when he is paired with Alice that the character of Iska can be said to be finally taking flight. In this, while the two have many physical interactions within the series the designs of the two characters I felt were highlighted by their shared aspirations to create a new world that’s filled with peace and hope and in a way symbolizing the core theme of the series story in uniting two unlikely combatants together in a quest to change the world for the better. Location variety wise while the locations that the series featured were few the ones that were visited by the cast, I felt were ones that served to expand the series lore in meaningful ways when used in conjunction with the unique circumstances that lead them to visit it. The neutral city for instance being the few areas within the war-torn world that was free of conflict was a venue that I felt served as an excellent area for the cast to decompress and let their worries of the war be put on hold as they went and enjoyed themselves while also giving both them and us an excellent opportunity to see how they will react when seeing their opposite numbers do the same. In contrast to the neutral city, the prison city of Alcatroz which was the darkly famed prison city that the Nebulis created to house their worst criminals was the opposite in that it showed that even in a highly civilized and developed country like the Nebulis Sovereignty that there still exist, criminals, that they had captured for their crimes but couldn’t kill with the character of Salinger as an excellent example of this aspect.In terms of combat animation, I felt that the war between the Empire and the Nebulis provided an excellent canvas for the battles in which Iska and Alice had to engage in their shared path to find a way to end this terrifying war. While the combat featured within the series isn’t on par with those of dedicated combat theme anime like the currently airing Jujutsu Kaisen I felt that the combat scenarios that were featured within the series was still pretty good and featured a good blend of impressive magical effects that came from the various magic that was used by the astral mages with the tension that came from engaging powerful combatants who had both the skill and the bravery to break through them in order to gain an advantage in close range combat. Through the astral magic, elements were limited to a maximum of four elements which was ice, earth, and the unique thorns that were used by Kissing and Salingers own unique powers these I felt served well to showcase the kind of powers that the astral mages made use of as their primary means of offense in the war. With regards to fights within the series I would say that my favourite ones were Iska and Alice’s stand against the recently unsealed Nebulis I a battle that while showing some impressive teamwork between the two also showed well their determination to change the world, Alice and Rins battle against the nameless in ep5, Iska’s battle with Kissing in the same episode, Iska’s battle with Salinger in ep9.Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Against which was performed by Nene’s assigned seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Kaori Ishihara and Koori no Torikago (Ice Bird Cage) that was performed by Alice’s assigned seiyuu veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya. Both of these songs while excellent in their own right I felt had somewhat contrasting feelings and emotions when taken in concert with the visuals that accompanied them with the former invoking a sense of tension, joy, revelation, and determination while the ending theme had a much more softer feel to it that resonated well with the sense of peace that comes from finding a way forward that will benefit both countries successfully. With regards to the first theme, I was honestly quite surprised that Kaori Ishihara was the singer as I didn’t know until then that she was also a singer as well but alas it was a nice intro to her voice.Voice acting-wise I felt that overall the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I felt that Sora Amamiya and Yuusuke Kobayashi both did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters with Sora, in particular, doing especially well in showing the kind of emotions that goes through Alice’s heart as a result of her ever-increasing feelings for Iska as well as the ever-increasing threats that she discovers throughout the series. While I didn’t cover their characters within the review, I also felt that Kaori Ishihara, Yumiri Hanamori, Nao Shiraki, Ayana Taketatsu and Azumi Waki also did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Nene, Rin, Mismis , Risya and Sisbell respectively.Overall ConclusionIn overall I felt that Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a new world was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points a unique premise, an excellent story, characters, battle scenarios, voice acting and an interesting look at the hardest path that one can take when pressed into a war that to them is not only pointless but one that wastes valuable lives when their differences can be solved via dialogue and meetings between diplomats which is the path to achieve peace when everyone else is trying to kill each other. While the concept of a war between rival countries is a common enough topic within the world of anime in this case I felt the series managed to introduce elements that are rarely seen within that genre in the form of not just romance but a shared understanding on the futility of what war was and a desire to work together with ones formerly their enemy but now a trusted friend and ally in order to find a path that will allow both countries to begin their journey of achieving peace an idea that I felt was a relatively fresh one and one that kept me interested in the series right to the end.Overall I would say that Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World was an excellent anime that managed to inject some pretty fresh ideas into the world of fantasy wars via the inclusion of romance, working with ones formerly hated enemy, and a desire to change the fate of the world by working together to create a path for peace. While the emotional connection between the cast was one that was rightly felt thanks to the excellent performances of the main leads of Sora Amamiya and Yuusuke Kobayashi I do feel that the number of locations that the cast visited could have been expanded upon as I would have liked to learn more about the empire and the Nebulis and see how the common people viewed the almost endless war that had been raging between their respective countries. As a final score, I would say that it deserves a final score of 8/10. unique opportunity to see what will happen if in the midst of a devastating war between two powerful countries that have been raging for years that two of the countries most powerful combatants in the form of the most powerful witch and heir to the throne of the Nebulis and a formerly renowned saints disciple whose only crime was an act of mercy was to one day encounter one another on the battlefield and in the process of their fight discover to their eternal surprise that both desire to find a solution that will help bring an end to this fearsome war that has been raging for hundreds of years.Taking place within a world that’s beautiful and united on the surface but yet rife with internal division, discrimination, and outright hostility towards others on the basis of not just their bloodline but of the powers that manifest as a result of the unique power that was native to this world in the form of the energy source the Astral power the world in which the series makes use of as its main setting is certainly one of extreme contrast. On the surface the people of both the Heavenly Empire and the Nebulis sovereignty both live in beautiful and highly technological advanced societies that have been borne out of the eternal hatred that exists between them and yet away from the frontlines the two are relatively alike whether physically or mentally they all want to enjoy a life that’s free from harm and one that’s spent meeting and interacting with others of similar mind and in the process befriending them, bonding with them and maybe find one whose feelings for you are just as strong as your own. But yet this sense of normal life was one that was never meant to be in this world for the eternal hatred between the empire and the sovereignty was one that served to motivate every able-bodied men and woman to take to the field and prosecute a war that serves no real purpose other than creating an endless circle of hatred between the two that served to prolong the war for decades.That is until the fortunate meeting of a formally disgraced Saints Disciple and the famed Ice Calamity Witch whose views on the tragedy that this war was and whose determination to put an end to it and save the people of both sides soon caused an unlikely bond to form between two people whose countrymen had been killing each other for decades. While the idea of a war being fought between two major powers over topics ranging from simple territorial control, religion, and resource grabbing is one that is not uncommon within the world of anime in my eyes what served to draw me to this series was the fact that in the midst of this ever-escalating conflict were two of the most powerful members of both countries encounter each other but instead of trying to spread more hatred by killing each other violently that both were to discover that they both share a common desire and aspiration of trying to finally put an end to this war. This fresh desire to find a way to secure a sense of peace between two powers who had been killing each other for decades I felt was a shining light that served to shine through the dark storm clouds of war that had long enveloped the world and proved to the people of both sides through their actions that cooperation between a man of the empire and a witch of the sovereignty was something that was very much possible once the sense of distrust and hostility was replaced by a sense of civility and politeness borne out of genuine respect of each other was used instead. While the first episode of the series I felt did an excellent job at showing how much the war had affected the society of both the Empire and the Nebulis as well as show the inherent differences between the fighting capabilities of both sides I felt that it also served to allow us to witness the almost destined meeting of Iska and Aliceliese and their shared common goal of wanting to find a way to end this dreadful war that has been consuming their countries for decades. Indeed this episode I felt resonated well within my heart and was the primary reason that I elected to watch this series to the end not just because I want to see the inevitable romance between the two but also see whether can they finally put an end to a war that has been raging for so long via their shared actions and wishes.Aliceliese Lou Nebulis IVAliceliese Lou Nebulis IV portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Sora Amamiya of Aldnoah Zero and Killing Bites fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the primary heroine within the series. The second princess of the Nebulis Sovereignty and a powerful astral witch with the famed title of the Ice calamity witch Aliceliese who prefers to be called simply as Alice by her allies and friends from her initial appearance was shown to be someone that was quiet, confident, and kind and was one that had an almost majestic presence that radiated both grace and a commanding presence that only comes from being a member of royalty. As a member of the Nebulis’s ruling family, Alice was noted to be a composed, elegant and perceptive person by nature that when combined with her intelligence and skill at anticipating an enemy's moves made her not just an excellent fighter but an able strategist as well.  However, despite being a member of the royal family Alice was shown to display very little of the kind of snobby attitude that royals usually display being neither arrogant nor rude instead when Alice was in princess mode she was shown to be dignified and determined in nature always willing to protect her charges by taking to the field herself and always planning her moves to maximize chances of success while minimizing the potential of injuries to others a fact that I felt resonated well with her core aim of finding a way to end the war and unite and create a world that was free of prejudice.As the series progresses and we get to see more of Alice’s personality it can be seen curiously that Alice actually possesses two different personalities that are quite different from each other. While in princess mode Alice was noted to be while relatively young was also someone that was elegant and dignified in equal measure being able to act with the best interests of both her kingdom and her own values effectively without compromising on either even when presented with unexpected developments. However, beneath this strong surface self of hers, it can be seen that Alice also has a rather surprisingly soft side to her as well that’s more fitting for a girl of her age. In this persona that’s more akin to her default personality Alice while still maintaining her sense of self-confidence was seen to be far more willing to show her true emotions rather than simply conceal them as she did in princess node. While still maintaining an element of grace Alice was shown to be someone that was carefree in nature and one that preferred to enjoy each moment slowly taking in every second of an event as if carefully remembering it. While maintaining her polite nature Alice was also shown in this persona to display less emotional control than in her princess self being liable to let her hot-headed nature stoke her temper an aspect that was also complemented by her proud and stubborn nature that often serves to make her act on impulse rather than think things through logically especially when Iska is within the equation as well. However, this proud and stubborn nature of hers while certainly something that’s not benefitting of a princess was also contrasted by Alice’s belief in honor both in dealing with enemies on the frontline as well as in repaying people for any debts that they feel owe them. This sense of honourable conduct which while matching well with Iska’s own was one that I felt reflected well on Alice’s own views about the war as she believes that small acts of kindness while small in nature will also be able to accumulate in people’s hearts and perhaps one day serve to change the world a view that’s also supported by her nature when away from the frontline and in default Alice mode.When not engaged in critical war efforts on the frontline Alice was shown to be someone that wasn’t too concerned with the war efforts of either side preferring instead to wander across the land to take in both the sights and try to encounter new experiences in the process as shown in her trip to the theatre in the neutral city to watch a play despite the war. When paired with the kind of interactions that she exhibits when meeting with people that share her passion and views on subjects that interest her Alice was liable to get lost in such conversations and forget her position as a princess as shown in the series second episode where she and Iska shared a rather long talk on food. While a good indication on her desire to explore the land and enjoy herself to the fullest before the war escalates any further this belief of hers I felt also shows well her core belief that despite being mortal enemies that there are still many things that both the Empire and the Sovereignty can stand to learn from each other especially in terms of culture and history a fact that is reinforced by her belief that art has no borders that constrain it and neither should the wishes and desires of both countries itself an excellent allusion to her own goals of uniting the world.Within the series, though Alice was shown to have deep bonds with her retainer and dear friend Rin who served well as both a retainer and an effective adviser for her that largely kept her desire to explore the world firmly in check arguably the best prominent bond that she forms within the series was with that of her opposite number within the war which is that of Iska one of the empires famed Saints Disciple. While nominally the hated enemy of astral witches and one that would have ended with the painful death of the other in brutal combat the relationship that blossomed between them was instead one that started off with a fortunate draw after a fierce exchange of both attacks and ideas that served to make both realize that even in this war-torn world there are still people that share her distaste for the war and are willing to find a way to end it no matter how remote it was. While the relationship between them was one that started off as one that was borne out of mutual respect towards each other regarding their respective skillsets and their shared desire to find a way to end the war this as the series went on this soon transformed into one of genuine admiration and later affection towards him a fact that while cute and heartwarming in nature also showed well her desire to find a rival that was able to offer her both combat support when needed and an emotional and logical counterpart for her plan once that she enacts it.Overall as a character, Alice I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed with the contrast between her princess self and her default airhead Alice self-being especially so. While the relationship between her and Iska for the duration of the series was seen to be a largely one-sided affair on her part I felt that the amount of chemistry that exists between them was one that worked well in combination with their shared desire to end the war by changing the world through their actions that served to make each of their interactions that much more heartfelt and amusing to see.IskaIska portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero and Darwins Game fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the primary protagonist of the series serving as the main male lead of the series. A 16-year-old member of the Empire’s military and a recently reinstated Saints Disciple and the successor of the famed black steel that he inherited from his master the famed head Saints Disciple Crosswell Nes Lubigate Iska from his initial appearances was shown to be a calm, composed, and quiet person by nature that was seen to be someone that approached each day with both determination and a degree of optimism.

Mismis always almost makes me rage quit!The rest of the chars are OK, nothing that bad but nothing impressive either. Male MC has a Kirito vibe, fairly common nowadays. Female MC I can't put my finger on it, but I'm quite sure I saw it before.Anymay,...Romeo and Juliet cliche with magic. Tech v. Magic where the OP MC from each side fall in love with each other.

My overall opinion is that the anime is enjoyable, though inferior to the light novel.)First, this isn't a show that's meant to be taken super seriously. There's obvious coincidences to set up the Romeo and Juliet esque romance, but if you suspend your disbelief over how they meet so much (which, honestly, a lot of anime use coincidences as driving points; this one's just more overt about it), it's actually a pretty enjoyable enemy to lovers romance.Alice has really cute antics with a touch of tsundere in her attitude, and her moments with...Iska are really fun and even adorable. I'd say Iska's personality is flatter though (standard justice-hearted main hero in my opinion), and I do wish he were more emotive.The main story of two countries at war is reasonably interesting with good potential for conflict and development, and I'm curious the identity of the other elite soldiers of their forces. I like the abilities of the two mains - ice can be used in cool ways for a fight and Iska's swords have a fun ability to watch too.Sound-wise, I do enjoy the OP, and I don't think I have any major problems with the voice acting either. Animation wise, I think it's fine, though I'm not the type to care a great deal about animation quality (story and characters is paramount for me).Anyway, overall, I think it's a solid show so far, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy romances and wants to see a fun enemy to lovers tale.

I don't understand how the anime focus on Iska's goal here because this anime is just the mc doing nothing but protect the female characters and they fall for him?? the captain is annoying and useless as fuck lol why is she the captain in the first...place, I also hate high pitched voice characters I just want to ran over them with a car. but with that aside i think the idea is not bad?? could be so much better but what do you expect from a fan service anime place, I also hate high pitched voice characters I just want to ran over them with a car. but with that aside i think the idea is not bad?? could be so much better but what do you expect from a fan service anime"", ""It's so sad to see a workable plot thrown away like this.

The most remarkable one of them is without a doubt is the potentiel wasted especially on the romance; I do realize the anime is an adaptation of a novel and 12 eps isn't much to progress the romance between the leads, but at the end of the show it's like they're only one step closer, like their relationship would need another 3 seasons for it to develop completely at this pace xD, other than that there was the not...so real war plot where both countries just hate each other without much of the fighting. So yeah for me, the first episodes showcased a huge potentiel for the romantic realationship between the mc and fmc with their interactions and thoughts about each other, but in the end we see that this relationship was static in the end and showed very little progress.Overall if you're hesistating whether to start this anime or not I'd say to totally go for it, I enjoyed it a lot and even with all I said the romance is still a bit there. so real war plot where both countries just hate each other without much of the fighting.

I am super stoked to get to see more of this world, for iska to interact with the characters from Sovereignty. To finally see alice meeting iska\'s entire team together in the same scene. To see our dear Mismis taicho having a safe place for herself after the ""spoiler"" thing.On the contrary to what expert pro reviewers think cliche of the finely executed classic anime tropes, i for one refound the inner berserk anime fangirl in me crying, laughing, screaming  with blissful joy [ I\'m a dude but hey some things are best expressed in their ultimate way of expression].Judging this show as another Romeo X Juliet trope is unfair, this is common human love when two people on different factions find love, it was there before Shakespeare wrote it and it will be there for eternity, we should be glad and enjoy such amazing heartfelt moments each time we see them than to compare and argue who did it better.I am an absolute nut for romances in my action anime servings, and with joyous tears in my eyes and with a heavy pounding heart i can\'t wait for a season 2, so guys please watch the show with a blank mind and experience the tropes for the first time again, you\'ll know why you feel in love with such anime the first place.There might be some small and big things i forgot to mention but I\'m really happy that you got that and more to experience from this fine creation.A solid Infinity/10 from me, must watch show for all ages. it is just the way of showing how the tropes work within another world, it\'s inhabitants and for people who enjoy things like unmei no deai or whatever, putting Iska and Alice together time and again in variety of scenarios and then seeing alice\'s face glow up blushing, seeing alice fall in love with iska, it\'s freakin priceless.This is also where the plot balances things out, while alice being the young lovestruck maiden, iska is a unfazed chivalrous, kind soldier bound to his duties and dream of uniting the world, this also helps alice to remain in check of her duties.There is a tightly weaved story and carefully kept secrets that will reveal the entirety of the world not with some short backstory or flashback but with more well timed and well written character encounters and unfolding story events.After years and i mean years, i got to fully enjoy a action anime with chance encounters, fated love, mild harem coupled with strong voice actors, you know who the leads are and who else do they play, they know this gig was awesome to work with and boy did it deliver.The series packs plenty of action as well, this being a introductory season to the world, setting and characters, you may think that some fights ended abruptly but the thing is the show took it\'s time to build your excitement for what will be great things to come.

That would be my first point on why I loved this anime.The story is somewhat generic, but original animes are awfully complicated to find nowadays, but this really felt like I was watching Asuna & Kirito in an Isekai and I found that hilarious.The story pacing in the first few episodes is perfect and they did really well to fit such action into only 12...episodes,  but in the last episodes they introduced new characters & new intriguing events for s2 that just can\'t be missed.Certain characters they created for the anime are all really interesting, but whats even more interesting is probably going to be all the new characters added in the episodes to come.As you can see, I am writing a lot about what we will see in the future, but that\'s because s1 was more a basis to support for whats to come.

Apparently, quite much.The story lacks the depth and realism it needs to stand out. Instead of intricate plot lines, the story simply revolves around Iska and Alice constantly bumping into each other in unexpected and sometimes awkward situations. The concept of Neutral Cities was dumb to begin with. When an imperial soldier and an Astral mage (who have been enemies for decades)...can bump into each other and stay chill, your logic is being insulted at.The action in *Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World* could barely be called action. There were only one or two major battles. The rest were simply small conflicts not worth watching. Only Iska's overpowered weapons seem to be of interest to me.The characters... Where do I start? Practically speaking, Iska's teammates are useless to the core. The team captain Mismis is the worst of all. She has no ability whatsoever and only exists solely to be used as hostages by the enemy.Nene's only ability is to launch short-to-medium-range missiles while requiring a cooldown of a few minutes. Talk about being helpful. Might as well read a book, stay still, and wait for the enemy to quickly strike you down.Jhin is probably the only teammate who actually deserves to be called teammate. He is a sharpshooter who acts as a good backup for Iska, but his abilities can only go so far.The art doesn't look high quality to me. In certain frames, Alice's hair can look like a black strand covering your screen and it's kinda annoying. The character designs are so-so. The animation is pretty standard, but still somewhat lacking for a modern 2020 anime.Alright, I guess I'll stop ranting. There are plenty of problems with the show but pointing them all out will require more time than actually watching the show. Now, the big question is: Did I enjoy it?Heck yeah! I'd be lying if I didn't enjoy this sort of Romeo-and-Juliet story unfold piece by piece, as childish as the show may be. The best part of the series is also the part I hated the most: Iska and Alice meeting one another. Yes, Neutral Cities seemed like a dumb concept to begin with, but they used it any way. If you don't take this show seriously, you can still savor the wholesome moments where Iska and Alice discuss how to bring about peace between the warring empires.

That\'s all, ohhh and there is a city called ""Neutral"", no comment on that city\'s name, where all people are accepted , even if it\'s a witch or a...human plus violence is not allowed.

There is a perfect blend between it that I could not find anywhere else, even when I looked up shows similar to it. I have never rewatched an anime so fast.I usually don't do summaries in my reviews (as I already assume you've read the MAL rewrite) but I'll do a short one. The two MCs, Iska and Alice, belong to enemy organizations. Iska belongs to The Empire, an organization set on destroying witches, and...Alice is a witch herself. Through shenanigans, Iska and Alice fall in love, but they must maintain their feelings and their relationship of enemies in order to not cause exile for both of them.I admit, it does sound generic, but the show has such a charm to it that cannot be described with words. The producers were also sure not to make the anime solely romantic or solely action. Some episodes do have more action/romance than others, but in total I'd say it's about a 50/50 split. The military aspect is very strong, so if you like military against magic you may like this. The OP has also quickly become my favorite. Not for the music or the visuals, but for the story it symbolizes.To summarize, this anime has an amazing EtL plot with a perfect balance of romance. It may seem generic at times, but it is different enough to love.I just hope S2 is received well enough for a S3 to get greenlight. I'm not the biggest fan of LNs. Alice is a witch herself.

That being said, eight episodes in and I am hooked!While not outstanding, the show is an enjoyable watch. The worldbuilding may be basic, but it's not terrible to the point of breaking my suspension of disbelief. Iska and Alice are a likeable pair and their moments can be adorable. That being said, my favorite character is currently Rin. She's not only cool, but among the cast her actions...make the most sense in a world of war.The artwork and animation are pretty good. The fight scenes are well done. The fanservice is there, but it's not as glaring as most fantasy-scifi anime. I hope the worldbuilding is fleshed out a little bit more.

The characters are complex and believable, and the world-building is top-notch. The romance between Iska and Aliceliese is also very well-developed and believable.Animation 6/10The animation in Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou is average at best. The character designs are good, and the animation is fluid, but the special effects are often quite bad. This is especially noticeable in the battle scenes, which can be quite difficult to follow at times.Characters 7/10The main characters in Kimi to Boku no...Saigo no Senjou are very well-designed and animated. Iska is a strong and likable protagonist, and Aliceliese is a complex and intriguing heroine. The supporting characters and villains, on the other hand, are not as well-designed or animated.Sound 5/10The sound in Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou is good. The voice acting is excellent, and the music is very fitting for the tone of the story.Overall VerdictDespite its average animation and special effects, Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou is a very enjoyable anime. The story is excellent, the characters are well-developed, and the romance is believable. I would definitely recommend it to fans of fantasy romance anime.Additional ThoughtsOne of the things that I appreciate most about Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou is that it is not a typical good vs. evil story. Both the Empire and Nebulis have their own strengths and weaknesses, and both sides are fighting for what they believe in. This makes the story more complex and interesting, as it forces the viewer to question their own beliefs.Another thing that I appreciate about the story is that it does not shy away from the darker aspects of war. The story shows the death and destruction that war can cause, and it does not try to sugarcoat the realities of battle. This makes the story more realistic and believable.Overall, I think that Kimi to Boku no Saigo no Senjou is an excellent anime series. It has a great story, well-developed characters, and good sound design. Despite its average animation and special effects, I would definitely recommend it to fans of fantasy romance anime.Looking Forward to the Next Season with more improvements.

But as the story goes on I started to see the main focus of the story is on the romantic relationship between the main character.The war looks like a side dish because there's so many weak plot point that is questionable or absurd. Among the weak plot...is the act that had been done by a certain character and the character's role in the war.

I get the fact that there are a few things that make no sense, however, since i have read an online book (Flames of Love) from Hollowfiedwriter on wattpad, it has a similar story, actually, it is a mixture of My Hero Academia And Our Last Crusade.In it, it is explained that the empire (the hero kingdom in the book) used their own people from the shadows to attack their own kingdom, naming that the other empire did it, so since then the war arose. The hero kingdom/ or the empire as the anime, wanted power. SO thats the...reason the war kept going. However the poor local people didnt had a grasp of this so they thought it was just an endless war.A similar story is in the anime, this might be one of the reasons. Its plot is good. but some things dont make sense, like how they defeated people so easily, but this was answered by me myself, ;) that they defeated the strong villains by the combination of the strongest people from both the kingdoms, Iska the youngest saint deciple, that weilds two VERY OP Swords, one which can cut through astro power (MAJIC) and the other that can copy it once.While the other is aliceliece Nou Nebulis XI (Idk if its IX, sorry, however its no. 9) with incredible Ice Powers.

The result is a sci-fi vs fantasy mash up with elements of politics and Romeo and Juliet that on paper sounds quite interesting. In practice however Last Crusade is rather bland. Whilst there is some interesting political developments closer to the end with Elletears plotting It comes far to late in the series (literally the last two episodes). Instead most of the series' runtime...revolves around bland protagonist Iska and the equally bland Alice whose only real stand out feature is that she’s a low-key Tsundere who, for once, is not a Twin-tailed loli but rather a mature Blonde.The side characters fare little better. Like Iska and Alice they are equally bland and have even less character development or backstory. The worst example of this being Iska’s superior Mismis who is a generic genki loli character who does little other than get herself into trouble and does nothing to justify her military rank. The villains don’t fare too much better. The worst example is Eve Sophi Nebulis, the legendary founder of Alice’s homeland, the Nebulis Sovereignty. She is built up both before and after her appearance as a end-boss like figure. A powerful witch who devastated Iska’s homeland- the Heavenly Empire. However when she does appear this figure, who seemed so powerful and threatening when described by others or in lore, is simply dispatched in the third episode. In what felt like less than 24 minutes. Rather than being a plot twist this felt like little more than an anti-climax and, quite frankly, when you dispatched the sovereignty’s legendary founder, how can anyone else come across as a physical or magic threat to our protagonist who now feels kind of OP. The only saving grace character-wise for me was Alice’s elder sister, the beautiful but definitely-up-to-something nefarious Princess Elletear. However even here she only appears in the last two episodes and I only find her interesting as a character because I read her TV Tropes page. Had I not done so she would have come across as just as bland and run of the mill as everyone else.Plotwise, things are only marginally better. Things start off slow with a Romance between Iska and Alice that feels unearned (they have to have three rather unbelievable co-incidences before falling for each other). However the last part of the series begins to introduce more political shenanigans both for the Empire and the Sovereignty. These plot-lines do not come to fruition in the series and are left hanging however a second season has been announced and if the 2nd season follows up on these plot-lines well, then said second season could be good. However whether these plots can save the series from blandness will depend entirely on how good the second season is and what it does with the material present.Overall, this season has a bland start with bland characters but events pick up in the second half with Alice’s cold distant mother, Elletears plotting with the Zoa family and the Empire’s own schemes as well as the release of major threat. However whether or not this will turn into a good and enjoyable story will depend entirely on how good the already announced second season will turn out to be. revolves around bland protagonist Iska and the equally bland Alice whose only real stand out feature is that she’s a low-key Tsundere who, for once, is not a Twin-tailed loli but rather a mature Blonde.The side characters fare little better.

I ended up really enjoying it for a few reasons.Story 8: The story is your typical sci-fi fantasy action, with a huge war going on between highly advanced human military serving the empire, and the Witches gifted with magical ability serving their own sovereignty. The MC (badass soldier) and FMC (badass witch) cross paths on the battle field and discover that they have the same goal of ending the senseless war....While the story is kind of generic, it definitely makes up for it with its unique take on the Romeo and Juliet-like inspiration. I feel it is somewhat rushed as it almost seems to skim past a few scenes and development, being a tad fast pace . However I can forgive this as I enjoyed it so much.Art & Sound 7: Both art and sound are pretty good but not amazing. The art quality isn't bad but was somewhat generic. However its battle scenes where quite awesome and well made. The sound was also alright, nothing too notable. The OP and ED where fine I guess. The voice acting was quite good in both Sub and Dub. (the captains dub voice while kind of goofy is really cute idk just me?)Character 8: the characters where quite cool, my guilty pleasure is watching anime or reading manga with an OP edgy MC, but Iska was only OP and quite an alright guy which was refreshing I guess. Alice was also pretty great, having her cute moments while also being an absolute UNIT on par with Iska. Their relationship is pretty nice to see too. The other characters are pretty cool and quirky too, the Captain especially being one of my favourites.Enjoyment 9: The setting, action, characters and the Romeo and Juliet theme with the MC and FMC just made for a really enjoyable watch. Its not amazing by all means, but I felt I could just relax when watching this series. Overall I'd highly recommend this series for those who aren't too nit-picky, and don't mind it's generic feeling.

I usually never drop a series and this is one of only two anime I have ever watched that I dropped completely. The characters have some redeeming qualities but the MC is one of the most boring if not the most boring characters I have ever seen. There is supposed to be a degree of romance akin to that of your typical Romeo and Juliet series and while the female protagonist has a likable personality, most of the time I found myself feeling disinterest in the male protagonist. The story had...some interesting parts but as I continued watching, hoping for the plot to progress to a point where things started to pick up, my desire to continue watching only declined. The visuals for the anime are great but the lack of character depth and character expression cannot make up for that. There hardly, if any, character development from the protagonists, as their motives do not really change throughout the run of the series. If a season of a series is only supposed to be 12 episodes long and I'm still unsure if I like it 6 episodes in, there is something off about it. I wanted to finish it because I hate dropping series and leaving things unfinished but I just could not do it with this one. It was so stale and boring. Overall I rate it as a 5/10 just because there were some parts I enjoyed but it was just missing too much from the characters to make up for the lack of plot depth. some interesting parts but as I continued watching, hoping for the plot to progress to a point where things started to pick up, my desire to continue watching only declined.

So, was Our Last Crusade any good? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe idea of enemies-turned-lovers during times of warfare isn't necessarily a new one to the world of fiction, but it can still be entertaining if a story puts an interesting spin on it, and to its credit, Our Last Crusade succeeds in that regard. Iska and Alice's...love story is certainly the strongest aspect of this show, as they both want to end the war between their nations even if they find themselves in opposite sides and while they do have a clear goal, they have no roadmap to get there, not to mention that circumstances often conspire to bring them together.Unfortunately, what truly keeps Our Last Crusade from achieving its full potential is that, outside the main characters' love story, the show isn't that interesting. The main characters spend too much time relaxing or going on vacation instead of doing actual work and the show doesn't dedicate enough to explore life in both sides of the conflict. I don't need first-class world-building to enjoy this show, I just need enough context to understand why is this happening and why am I supposed to care and Our Last Crusade doesn't provide that context. (6/10)CharactersI've always believed that characters are the lifeblood of a story and if a story doesn't have characters worth sympathizing with, then the story isn't worth caring about. Like I said before, the story of Iska and Alice is Our Last Crusade's strongest aspect. The show is at its best when it explores the relationship between the two main characters and it's always heartwarming to see how Iska and Alice aren't that different from one another and begin to acknowledge one another as both rivals and possibly even more.It's such a shame, however, that the supporting characters aren't as interesting as the protagonists. Jhin and Nene are little more than cardboard cut-outs with almost no personality whatsoever, and seriously, how the heck did Mismis become their captain? Her subordinates are cleary more mature than her and she often plays the role of damsel-in-distress, even more than the actual princess. Even Rin, the princess' maid, has an actual role and a personality, but that isn't saying much. (6/10)ArtThe artstyle in this show is very simplistic, but that isn't necessarily bad. The lighting and the backgrounds look good, especially during daytime and the fight scenes are passable, even though some of them look like they were done on a deadline. The CGI looks plainly obvious in some scenes, though, and sometimes, it doesn't mesh well with the hand-drawn animation. Ultimately, the show looks better when it performs quieter scenes and charater moments than on action scenes. (7/10)SoundsThe opening song is pretty good and the ending song is a beautiful piece performed by the always appreciated Sora Amamiya. As for the vocal performances, let me say that Emily Neves is a very talented actress. I couldn't have picked a better VA for the role of Alice and she has fine chemistry with Jason Liebrecht (Iska). Unfortunately, its sounds like Liebrecht had a hard time voicing Iska. While he does have the soft and gentle voice befitting of a caring and compassionate character like Iska, sometimes it sounds like he's straining his voice or running out of air, especially during action scenes. On another note, I did like the performance of Lindsay Seidel (Mismis), even though her character left a lot to be desired.

Music, animation, story, setting, characters and development are all above average and ranging from ok to good. It's not great or a masterpiece. It's not breaking the mold, but it doesnt really do many things badly. So if your down with a solid action take...on romeo and juliet, well watch it. You can still enjoy and have fun with the series.

Iska and Alice\'s interactions were very cute and I loved all the down times they had in the neutral city. Their relationship alone would\'ve been fine if it was your average romantic drama but that\'s not the setting setting of the anime. We\'re told in the beginning of the first episode that these two countries, the Empire and the Nebulis Sovereignty, are fighting and have been at war...for the last 100 years. With this conflict going on, it\'s impossible for Iska or Alice to enter a relationship but that\'s the thing: I don\'t see enough conflict!Stakes are risen high every episode with the introduction of something that could shift the balance of power... but it kind of feels lackluster whenever Iska handles it on his own or when Alice lends him a hand or vice-versa. I didn\'t really like reading ""Romeo & Juliet"" because honestly those two were dumb, BUT at least there were consequences for their actions. I was never on the edge of my seat with fingers crossed hoping the two sides would be safe because they never seemed to face any direct consequences for their actions. Towards the end of the last episode, we see the beginnings of a potential consequence but we won\'t know unless the series gets a second season. While I love seeing their relationship develop further, I think this story suffers from not fully delivering the war to us and downplaying certain plot points.There are plenty of issues that are swept under the rug for the sake of romance that I just can’t get behind. Iska’s unit discovers a huge bombshell and don’t even think twice about helping a certain character EVEN THOUGH it contradicts what they’re fighting for as Imperial soldiers! Whenever Iska gets into fights that conflicts with his orders, he never seems to be reprimanded or simply the council never notices. I would’ve liked to see Iska contemplate over whether his approach is the right one since witches, like Alice, have been killed. From where I stand, it seems like the Empire are the bad guys here while the Sovereignty has domestic disputes centered around hierarchy and which of the royal family should succeed.Aside from Iska and Alice, we don\'t really know about the characters, even the ones on Iska\'s own team going up against the Nebulis Sovereignty! Nene and Jhin are kind of boxed in as the kind and calm friends. I REALLY don’t like damsel-like characters like Mismis, the weak loli who has a big chest. She’s a military CAPTAIN for crying out loud! She always has tears in her eyes and forces her subordinates to help her. Alice’s maid, Rin, was probably the best of the secondary characters since she tried to act based on Sovereignty’s best interest while supporting Alice as a future queen.

Sadly it was not utilized and even if the series continues, I doubt there is much hope for any improvement.  The whole thing is just a generic re-hash of many existing anime tropes with nothing original added.Here we have the story of a soldier who hate the war he's fighting, imprisoned for treason, then released by his government/military to continue fighting because he's 'special'.  His mission to fight a powerful warrior princess from the opposing side and they almost immediately start crushing on each other.  And hence we have the primary plot of this anime.  A...trite star-crossed lovers story with next to no story or character development.  Just a simple setup to tell a bland story.The only reason I kept watching was because there seemed to be the possibility that something interesting could take place in the next episode.  Which seems to be a common practice in anime these days.  The promise of getting better only to fallback on mediocre, or worse, pathetic stale archetypes,  clichés, tropes, memes or other simplistic plot devices to move an ultimately boring story along.  How anyone could rate this above a four out of ten escapes me.  It never elevated itself above the blurb used to describe the series.  That makes this a very sad anime. trite star-crossed lovers story with next to no story or character development.

This movie has a super character development. I mean, by first sight you may say this is just a movie about fishes but hell the end hits hard.I see lots of topics into here, the learned helplessness, the model of social conformism, surviving hard times and coping mechanism. The art is good and music is fine, maybe the style is not the best but what can you ask when using CGI in 2012, anyhow the script even though they are only fishes is daring and herathbreaking. Just, a whole new experience. I will never regret this movie.Top films...that make you think that you eat. that make you think that you eat.', '7/7/5/6/7/6I wandered into one of the viewing rooms at FanimeCon just this weekend (memorial weekend 2016) during the very beginning of this movie.  I thought to myself, ""hey, this is pretty cute"", not to mention I had a couple hours until the next panel I planned on going to.Now, what I have to say about this, is that it\'s a lot like Finding Nemo--- only that it gets really fucking brutal in a subtle, built-up way.  The crazy thing is that this was obviously meant for kids.MILD-MEDIUM SPOILERS AHEAD: (Though personally, I don\'t think these will ruin the movie experience, but...rather, make you realize what exactly I mean.)So, yeah, like I said, its a lot like finding nemo.  It\'s even got that Pixar feel to it.  However, shit starts to get real because apparently the Koreans do not like to white-wash their shit, like how (for example) sometimes fish attack each other and feed on their corpses.  So while it\'s kind of cute, I started building some level of empathy for these little fishies, especially Padak, the main character.  ""Padak"" is apparently the Korean onomatopoeia for the sound a fish makes when it flips around on land, hence the name ""Flippy"" in the description of this movie.  Padak is a fish in captivity, living in an aquarium tank in front of a fish restaurant/market.  She wants to escape back to the ocean and tries to convince her new fishy friends to either help her or to do the same.  Only one fish, a mean and rugged flatfish, knows about the sea.  Drama ensues inside the tank, some fish fighting, and some dying in the process, only to be fed upon by the other fish.  Sometimes, they have to ""play dead"" in order not to get picked by the customers of the market, and do other things in order to survive in the tank.  What really got me was when one actually did get taken out, and he was taken to the table to get slaughtered and eaten.  It looked on in horror as the cook beheaded and gutted his half-dead comrades, throwing their guts and bones in the garbage disposal and searing their bodies on a stove.So, I would say this was rather interesting.  Just like a fucked up ""Finding Nemo"".  For that reason I give the plot somewhere around a 7 or 8 even.The art was nice, because like I said it looked like a pixar film.  So I give it a 7.The sound/music didn\'t really captivate me.  I never really noticed it.  I give it a 5.Characters weren\'t totally fleshed out, though I did feel some empathy for some of them.

I give that area a 6.', 'This was a great movie, but not one for the faint of heart. It\'s a depressing, yet bittersweet tale about fish in a tank in front of a restaurant, whose fate is seemingly set in stone.To address the biggest issue I see in this movie, I have to mention the art style. Most of the time, the CG is god awful to look at. Other times, it\'s tolerable. It\'s not even a matter of the dull colors and bland look. That can work to a certain degree in an almost ""realistic"" type of setting. It\'s hard to describe. Each human looks nasty, and not even...in a grotesque ""they\'re the monsters in this story"" type of way, but a ""the animators are new but determined to make a movie"" sort of way. The beginning doesn\'t look so awful, but immediately after the market scene, you see a child whose face and how it\'s animated look like if you take Sid\'s face from Toy Story but give it a less ""clay-like"" look where it\'s at least brushed over and looks soft and give it a 3-4 x\'s downgrade where it looks like it\'s lost texture. The coloring and outlining look flat and blunt, to put it nicely. And the design, while probably purposefully made to look unattractive, unlike Sid, just doesn\'t have any charm.Unfortunately, MANY of the humans are like this. Not always, mind you. But most of the time. It\'s like if you took the animated baby that was passed around in email chains back in the day, saw it, and said to yourself ""this is actually really good!""In regards to the other parts of the art direction, the camera work is always really interesting. There are times where it focuses higher at human level to make the fish feel extremely small, while other times, it brings you down to the fishs\' height. The song segments, too, also get very experimental with the art change. THAT part of the art direction is absolutely beautiful. It surprised me first seeing this movie just how pretty the art was at these points.Sound direction was decent. There were times during emotional scenes especially where the ambience made me even more immersed in the moment. I also really love the music. The musical numbers are all very nice. I\'ve seen some people compare the songs to Disney in quality, and I can kinda see it. Only complaint is a few songs didn\'t really feel like they furthered the plot or really gave us something new about the character, while at other times, the songs did just that.The characters themselves were great, mostly simple but were still played out nicely. You have your ""villain"", a bully in the tank who is a flatfish that was previously living in the sea like the main character, a mackerel, who is determined to flop to the sea. They\'re your two main characters, along with an important secondary character who is a young fish who is inspired by the mackerel, hopeful and kind. I was honestly surprised by how the development for the flatfish went as he was easily an unlikable prick when he\'s first introduced. The mackerel is kind of your standard ""I\'m going to beat the odds!"" type of character, however, but she\'s alright. Despite the tropeiness, the characters all served their purpose nicely.There\'s also an eel that is like a snake, the lackey of the flatfish. He\'s in charge of rallying the fish to solve ""riddles"" each night, where the winner gets to eat a piece of the tail of the fish furthest from the right answer. There\'s 3 others, too, fish species I cannot remember, but you have a tired and somewhat dumb one, one who\'s openly apathetic as well as another who\'s even more-so. Otherwise, those 3 are the least interesting in the tank, while at least the eel is an okay villain with a fun song number.The sea is within a short distance from the tank, but the issue is the humans which will instantly go after them (and the lid being placed on top at night). The flatfish taught those in the tank to play dead whenever a customer is spotted so that they\'ll eye another tank, coming back to life when the workers are by themselves so that they aren\'t thrown out. It made for an interesting set up, especially with the hierarchy in the tank being thrown into question with the mackerel being brought in.Overall, it\'s not a long movie, and I think it\'s well worth the watch. I say that anyone watching it should give it at least 15-20 minutes before deciding to duck out. It\'s a good movie, like a macabre take on Finding Nemo but ""Nemo"" is freedom and the journey is without comedy or a completely happy ending.. in a grotesque ""they\'re the monsters in this story"" type of way, but a ""the animators are new but determined to make a movie"" sort of way.

Of course you haven't, you're a normal person. But if you watch this, you'll get to find out, and holy shit is it a one-of-a-kind experience. This film is like little else I've ever seen, maybe the closest animated films I could compare it to would be Perfect Blue or Grave of the Fireflies, but even then this is a whole other beast. Death, despair, nihilism, gore, fucking Disney-like songs to express all of these elements... this is a...totally unique film that knocked me for a loop. It's better to just experience it I feel than to say too much, but I will say if you're not in the mood for something that will linger around and make you feel bad for a bit after the credits roll, skip it until you're prepared. And yeah, I'm still talking about an animated film about fish.My only gripe is that I wish it was traditionally animated instead of CGI (whenever there's a song, it switches to normal animation and it's beautiful), and to be totally honest the style of CGI used is kind of ugly, but with a story this strong, it's not a huge deal. Seriously, check this out if you're looking for something completely different. You'll never eat fish again without thinking of this film. totally unique film that knocked me for a loop.

Oyayubi Hime Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2783/Oyayubi_Hime_Monogatari,"['The eternal dilemma which is always brought up infront of Anime and cartoon lovers, by those who are close minded is “These animations are for children, not for grownups.” As a result, you find a lot of Anime lovers resorting to Anime with evident superficial markings so that they could prove that Anime is not in actuality for children. Some examples of superficial markings is the presence of violence, blood, fatal injuries, or sexual intercourse. This way of looking at things is not accurate, because some Anime on the outset - such as Deadman Wonderland – look like they contain a lot of blood, gore...and violence, but their storytelling in general is unoriginal, weak, and most importantly, immature. The Anime Thumbelina: A Magical Story, on the outset, looks very childish and is made for kids, and it lacks any semblance of violence or gore. The surprising thing is that this Anime is more suitable for adults than, let’s say, an Anime that actually entails all kinds of violence in it. So, what is the general rule that is applied to knowing precisely if a work is for children or for adults? Hopefully after describing this Anime, you’ll get a better view.The story is an adaption of the novel by writer Hanz Anderson, by the same name of Thumbelina, and it talks about a princess who is the size of a thumb, who comes out of a flower and faces many who would like her hand at marriage, until she settles in a true and loving relationship. The Anime adapts this in a light manner, and tells the story from a different angle. The main girl, Mia, is a normal human girl, who makes her mother exhausted due to her bad demeanor and shady shenanigans. Due to this trouble that Mia is causing, her mother seeks the advice of an old woman so that she could help her out with her issues. The old woman gives the mother a book by the name of Thumbelina, and the mother takes it before she falls asleep on her rocking chair, and is later picked up by Mia. Unfortunately for Mia, the book imprisons and traps her in it’s fantasy world, and from there on, Mia tries to return to her own world and her mother, and her true size as well, since she became much smaller upon entering the fantasy world. In that book, she will face a lot of enemies and circumstances, and form a lot of friendships as well in each passing episode. This is the body structure of the story, it is classic, and is ready to be filled with well-developed characters and a strong narrative. The script is very well done in the sequence of events and the speed at which they take place in, is intelligent in showing the necessary details. The writer is proficient at writing the script, and he respects the mind of the viewer.The Anime’s beginning is straightforward and spectacular, where the viewer gets to know the titular character Mya and the general goal of the story in a clear manner, and it contributes to sculpting a road for the writer to take later on in the story. The Anime is episodic, and each episode is different from the other, but they are all related in the fact that they have the general goal of adventure. Due to this, some episodes will turn out excellent while some others will turn out to be fairly average, and with that I find that the average mean score for all the episodes is fairly good.The main characters which are reoccurring in most of the episodes have a lightweight depth and are easy to understand, but they are still fairly developed, and that is something which makes it easier for the younger viewers to follow the story and understand the events that are taking place, while the older viewers are not deprived of any depth in the story as well. The most beautiful aspect of the story is that the development of the main characters, and that of the heroine are very concrete, and it begins to show more and more in a logical and natural way over time, and this is a professional achievement when it comes to storytelling.The secondary characters, or the guests of each episode, are complete in their compositions and are fairly developed. The ending is intact and beautiful, although being normal, and it was in dire need of a touch of brilliant directing to make it better, not better writing. There are some light negative points in weaving certain events and reaching their significance, and a lack of excellence in some episodes, and this deprives the storytelling in this Anime from reaching the highest level of writing, but does not deprive it from achieving a high quality nonetheless.All of the camera angles and movements have a significant meaning, and they contribute to the narration and making the Anime more exciting. The visual backgrounds throughout the Anime’s run are beautiful and very well done from a technical standpoint, and are filled with important details, to the point where they reflect on the personality of the characters that live in them, giving off a deep backstory for them, and contributing to making the story highly credible. The drawing of the movements and the characters maintain their quality throughout the Anime’s run, as most of the episodes contain incredible drawings and visuals, and there are episodes which are even greater, especially when those episodes become plot driven in a big way.The character design is imaginative and brilliant, even the secondary minor characters look unique in their own way, since each design reflects on the personality and traits of a character in a correct manner, without the need to make them look as outlandish as possible. The color palette is brilliant, especially when it comes to creating indoor lightning and mixing it in a way that comforts the eye and contributes on making the events more focused. The sound effects are also brilliant, as well as the music, which is harmonious with the events of the story and effectively contribute to aggregation and integration.All in all, this is an Anime that walks a fine line when it comes to writing, creative in showcasing it’s themes and has some of the best pacing in Anime. The characters are all well developed and lovable, appropriate for both young and old audiences. As for the old person, who suffers from the eternal dilemma of Anime being a children’s medium, this one proves otherwise. Don’t let the outer design of something fool you, rather let the essence of something be the most important. Plenty of times do we see something that looks like it was made for adults, but is in fact contextualized for a young audience of little experience in life, and plenty of times do we see a work that looks like it was made for a young audience, but rather becomes apparent through it’s context that it was clearly done for an older one. and violence, but their storytelling in general is unoriginal, weak, and most importantly, immature.

Plenty of times do we see something that looks like it was made for adults, but is in fact contextualized for a young audience of little experience in life, and plenty of times do we see a work that looks like it was made for a young audience, but rather becomes apparent through it’s context that it was clearly done for an older one.', ""I seen this twice and re-watching it again, I really think its underrated, also a very rare gem of early anime too.Story - This story is really a twist; it has elements of the story of Thumbelina base off Hans Christian Andersen but goes its own way.A woman whose fed up of her daughter's bratty attitude went to the town's witch and ask what to do, the elderly witch gave her a book called 'Thumbelina' and told her to  read it to her daughter.When she get home, she told her daughter Mia about the story and started reading it; a few pages in the...story the Mother felt asleep and Mia decide to read the book however she suddenly grow smaller and smaller.Mia started her adventures, made friends along the way as well while heading to a kingdom to get back home and avoiding the evil witch and her magic.The story like I said has some elements of Thumbelina and a hint of the Wizard of Oz too while still being its own.Characters like the Toads and the mouse appear in the story as well with other creative characters.Characters - I'll admit their pretty descent but the only grew we see is our Main Character.Mia is indeed a total and ungrateful brat, like kids mostly are when she suddenly shirk down; she was helpless and scare  while still being bratty but along her journey, she starts being less of a brat.-The side characters are fun and cute too, Noble and Hoppy are super cute.Art- The art is good old school anime style, bright and colorful to dark and mysterious. True gem.Sound - Thou I did watch the dub, the voices were okay and I'll admit Mia's voice gets annoying at first but gets better later on.The music is wonderful and magical.The only down side I'll admit is the Witch Character, thou I won't say anything about it.This is a wonderful story to watch, and I want to find the DVD to this since its a cute story. story the Mother felt asleep and Mia decide to read the book however she suddenly grow smaller and smaller.Mia started her adventures, made friends along the way as well while heading to a kingdom to get back home and avoiding the evil witch and her magic.The story like I said has some elements of Thumbelina and a hint of the Wizard of Oz too while still being its own.Characters like the Toads and the mouse appear in the story as well with other creative characters.Characters - I'll admit their pretty descent but the only grew we see is our Main Character.Mia is indeed a total and ungrateful brat, like kids mostly are when she suddenly shirk down; she was helpless and scare  while still being bratty but along her journey, she starts being less of a brat.-The side characters are fun and cute too, Noble and Hoppy are super cute.Art- The art is good old school anime style, bright and colorful to dark and mysterious.

It was my favorite for some reason.The characters were very good. Mia was a little bitch the whole time but she was useful sometimes I guess haha.

Pokemon Best Wishes! Season 2: Episode N,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17115/Pokemon_Best_Wishes_Season_2__Episode_N,"[""No reviews? Really? I'll make a short one then.It's Pokemon! Yeah the previous seasons were.. meh but this set Pokemon on the right path, the episodes all have a decent plot and Ash actually shows he has some experience under his belt for the first time in awhile. And Pikachu is still pretty good for a pokemon that jumps from level 5 to 80 then back to 5 at the start of every season.  This re-kindled my love for Pokemon :3  Very nice watch! "", 'In this pokemon season the story focuses on N and the legendary pokemon of Unova. Well if you followed the game Black And White after that Black 2 White 2 you will see well from my point of view the anime didnt live upto the game or the game sequals. I wont say the main game character [Black/White or Black 2/White2] was absent and thats why the anime didnt turn out to be a better season but still it felt like they tried to rush in and missed N\'s true ambition and other stuff that we seen in the Black and White game. Also they...tried to focus what we seen in the game black 2 white 2 like Ghetis\'s plan after 2 years and the outfits of the team plasma. Also Including the scientist all of a sudden. The anime should have atleast follow the time line from the pokemon game and try to make it that way but sadly they tried to keep balance between and black white and black 2 white 2. Also Cheren\'s appearance was questionable too. But still it was enjoyable by seeing same old Ash pikachiu and their ideals.In the end i should say rather than rushing to the scenarios of black 2 white 2 they should follow the scenarios of Black And White it would be ""More Enjoyable"". tried to focus what we seen in the game black 2 white 2 like Ghetis\'s plan after 2 years and the outfits of the team plasma.

Episode N was interesting. N himself was... interesting. Maybe a little too talented and special, on the heels of Meloetta it would seem, but dark enough to still pull me in. N\'s purpose was almost to break the fourth wall. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised. I never expected Pokémon to address this aspect of their lore. It\'s been kind of a long-running gag among the fanbase now... you know, the morality of capturing and training Pokémon and then sending them into battle for our amusement. (And questionable reward.)So as far as that goes, the story...for Episode N was really interesting. Maybe the whole ability to hear a Pokémon\'s ""inner voice"" thing felt a little... I don\'t even know the word for it. Cliché? Whatever it was, that was the one part that was a little off-putting for me. But N\'s distaste for humans, as a part of his beliefs that all Pokémon should be free, was fascinating. A little misplaced maybe, as he says himself he\'d never experienced the outside world, so the only relationship he\'d ever witnessed between humans and Pokémon was that of the way Team Plasma treated Pokémon, but as this whole season was basically dedicated to N learning about that bigger world and how Pokémon and humans CAN live in peace... I guess that can be forgiven. (Actually, for a while there, I was actually expecting N to end up being the Plasma leader\'s son... But maybe I was mixing his lore up with... Silver? I think it was Silver. I don\'t know; I never played that game. Anyway...)And speaking of Team Plasma... I\'m not sure how I feel about their little arc. It\'s odd, to me, for the big bad specific to this region to only exist for 14 episodes. Unfortunately, Team Rocket does go back to their previous antics, acting as if their last arc didn\'t happen, as I\'d feared it might. Maybe that\'s why Plasma felt a little disappointing to me. Their goals just felt like a reiteration of Giovanni\'s in the last season, and not done nearly as well. That and their villain outfits made them impossible to take seriously...Honestly, I wouldn\'t have been disappointed for this season to be the end. But *deep breath* there\'s just one more season before I\'m finally out of Unova... I can\'t imagine what the storyline is going to be for the next 20 episodes, but I can\'t imagine it will top this.

Princess Lover!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6201/Princess_Lover,"[""Of course this is series is still ongoing so I'll be giving my current impressions of the Anime.Initially I was skeptical about watching this since it seemed like just another harem Anime thrown at us. But so far I find it quiet enjoyable.. Pros+ Not your typical generic harem+ Has a mature feel to it+ Nice balance between comedy and drama+ Unique setting, harem in a rich setting+ Pleasing visuals which matches the theme and setting+ Ecchi not over the top ( well most of it is censored anyways )...+ Comedy level is just right+ Potential to get serious in the latter of the series+ Characters have depth to them+ Big boobs. Cons- Censored ( it can be good too, fanservice can be distracting ).- Girls a bit cliched ( but the series makes them feel refreshing )- Will it be able to wrap up nicely given it's only 12 episodes total?. In Detail :So far it doesn't seem to be your typical generic harem Anime. I haven't watched an extensive amount of harems. But I found the rich harem theme of this Anime unique. The main character is rich and so are the rest of the girls. While harems are typically comedic this one has a serious tone right off the bat. Of course that doesn't mean this Anime doesn't have comedy ( it is labeled ecchi, though it's currently censored ), it does. I feel that this Anime so far has a nice balance of comedy and seriousness. The series so far seems to have more depth than the typical harem. It takes the characters and plot in a mature way while being able to entertain us at the same time. Something that definitely stood out to be was the visuals which I found very pleasing to the eyes. It fits the theme of the Anime well which I believe greatly enhances the entire experience. While the characters may be fairly cliched ( girl with sword,tsundere, etc ), the way the series currently presents them makes the experience more refreshing. There's not so much to say bad about the Anime, it only just started and I didn't start watching with very high expectations. But so far I'm surprised by how well I enjoy it so far. It seems that it well get more serious in the latter of the series. I'll continue watching. + Comedy level is just right+ Potential to get serious in the latter of the series+ Characters have depth to them+ Big boobs.

Does Princess Lover fall into this abysmal group? Yes, however it had the potential to achieve a lot more than what most harems fail to achieve, seeing how it's based on a rather popular visual novel.That potential was shown in its characters however that same potential was foolishly squandered with its mediocre story. The story itself is typical, yet intriguing enough to keep most viewers interested. It’s about your average teenage boy...named Teppei, living an average life, with his average family... Then shit happens and our protagonist is later forced to live with his super rich grandpa and transfer to some absurd school for the super rich.After watching this I thought the writer must’ve taken whatever he could find from “Ye ol’ book of anime clichés” and decided that was their plot. Strangely enough, it worked surprisingly well when it came to introducing the characters to this profoundly entertaining story. The first half of the story basically sets this kind of tone for an exhilarating short series but in the end it was a wasted effort once the “real” story kicks in and boy, are you in for a ride. By ride I mean a one-way ticket to idiotsville, because only an idiot would throw away an enjoyable story for the garbage that replaced it.With all that said, this anime didn’t entirely turn into a steaming pile of crap and that’s thanks to the interesting cast of main characters. Harem protagonists usually fall into 2 groups: the losers and the kind-hearted saviours. Yet Teppei initially doesn’t fall into either, because within his playful character is a young lad struggling to deal with his past and moral dilemmas. Not to forget the 4 leading heroines, who were rather well developed, some more than others and 2 of which who seemed similar in design and personality to 2 more well-known characters from other series. Whether that was intentional or not is unknown to me but they happened to be the most interesting of the 4 heroines. However apart from Teppei’s grandpa, the supporting cast turned out to be far weaker than the loosely put together story and if a couple of them were killed off, the story could have done a whole lot better.The production values are somewhat difficult to delve into since a fairly unknown studio (GoHands) took on this series. The music was just about as memorable as every breath I take and the sound productions overall really isn’t any good. Yet the art style and animation has a unique vibrancy to it, giving a colourful experience that’s pleasing to the eyes. However the jarring simulated camera panning/rotation and the out of proportion bust sizes really brought it down for me.Overall Princess Lover is a series that I hoped would break the chain of generic harem that seem to appear year after year, yet all it did was add unto the already tarnished reputation of the harem genre. Some of the blame falls onto the villains, who were the worst villains ever constructed but I blame the real villain… the idiot who thought of this crap. Well if you don’t mind all that I’ve said then watch at your own discretion; however I feel it’s more worthwhile to sit wait for the next Key & KyoAni collaboration. named Teppei, living an average life, with his average family...

I won\'t post any spoilers, so don\'t worry.Overall  7Princess Lover started off very good. It had a serious with light humor tone, with all the ecchi-ness included;  but, then went way downhill in the second half which really hurt it overall.Story  6If I was only rating the first 6 or so episodes, this show would be a 9 because it was very enjoyable. It\'s very obvious who Teppi likes right from the start (Charlotte) and they have a lot of nice romantic moments. So why did...I give the story a 6? In the second half of Princess Lover, this show fails.....very hard. The last episodes were pretty bad. They bring in special ops and the story tries way to hard to be funny causing it not to be very funny. The story tries to be serious, but overall just can\'t be taken seriously. The only plus to the story in the last arc is that Teppi weeds girls out with a kiss. That\'s the only good thing.Art  8The art was very good, epically for a harem anime. Everything was pretty fluent and looked fine, but there were some distortions in some scenes that weren\'t really the focus of the shot which, if you noticed them, made the art seem not as good (animators got lazy/ budget issues). It never happened on the main focus of the scene though** not included in the rating** I would wait for the uncensored version to watch this show, in the censored version they censor things that are already censored.Sound 8The OP/ Ed were pretty good and the characters voices were all done well. Nothing to really say here, no complaints and nothing to really say that was especially amazing.Character 7One downfall to the characters is even thought Teppi, Charlotte, Seika, Yuu, and Sylvia are the main characters, only Teppi and Charlotte get any real screen time. The others are are there, but don\'t do a whole lot until the end.Teppi >> an okay harem lead. had some funny moments and wanted to save everyone. But he turned into one of those ""talk it out"" characters to the main ""villains""Charlotte >> A lot of people didn\'t like her, but I liked her. She\'s a typical pink haired harem character who is very clingy to Teppi. SHe isn\'t very smart, but she was the funniest.

Well, here\'s the thing: I\'ve been watching anime for over five years, which means that I\'ve seen several romance/harem series (everything from Maison Ikkoku to Love Hina). Most of them have the same traits, but in order to poke out a bit from each other, they\'ll have to be in different settings. The question is if it\'s different and well enough executed in a fashion that captivates the viewer. And I\'ll let it out straightaway: Princess Lover fails epicly at that. By looking at the title, you know that you\'re already fucked:Uh, so...the main character, Arima is going to succeed Arima Group Corporation, and by the sounds of it, it looks like it\'s like the biggest company in the world. And who\'s gonna take over it in near future? A teenager that knows shit about business. Who in the world would give away such a big responsibility to a relative they barely knew just like that? I can go on and on about this plot convenience, but hey, I\'ll spare you for that.Because succeeding the corporation is just a lame excuse to enter a rich girls\' school (okey, there are also boys there, but we barely get to see them). And of course, who do we meet there? It\'s the pink-haired girl whom he saved and his fiancee. And to answer your question straightaway: Yes, they do have big breasts. And yes, the pink-haired girl hugs Arima all the time with her gonzanga breasts. She\'s your typical cheery girl with a cheery voice with a hand that likes to wave awfully a lot. And the fiancee? She\'s your typical, somewhat-shy girl who speaks little. And when she does speak, she speaks kinda without emotions. She has coincidentally fencing as a hobby, which coincidentally matches with Arima\'s kendo, so they have by chance some common ground, I guess. With other words, we\'ve seen these type of personalities before. A lot. So what personality are we missing now? Tsundere? And yes, there is a tsundere girl in the series.  You\'ll know it straightaway when she pops up for the first time (hint: she has a slightly annoying/whiny voice, which all tsunderes have, so I guess that\'s alright). Did I mention that we also have a big-breasted maid? The anime industry sure knows what we like. And Arima Teppei is your average male main character.And that\'s not the best part yet (and by that, I mean the worst). The thing is with harem series, is that the plot can\'t be all fluffy and boobilicious all the time; it also needs some drama. Without telling too much: It\'s fucking ridiculous when you get to it. If you by any chance come to episode 7 or 8 (I don\'t quite remember which one), you\'re gonna have a fuckin\' laugh. I swear, the plot progression from there might be the most retarded one in harem anime history. It\'s clearly not to be taken seriously. I don\'t know, but I sure facepalmed a lot during that particular episode. And by of what I\'ve heard; the series is based off of an H-game, so that kind of sucky plot is expected, I guess.Is there anything good in Princess Lover? The art is decent and not ugly to look at. The animation is standard, but not bad. And if you\'re looking for ecchi-ness, you\'ve found it. A lot of booooobies. *coughEDcough* The music is not memorable at all; it\'s just generic. Visually speaking, the opening was pleasing to look at. In fact, I remember the breasts more than the music itself. And btw, Arima Isshin\'s voice is so badass (Wakamoto Norio is badass after all).So unless you enjoy torturing yourself or your friends, avoid Princess Lover at all cost. I fuckin\' used 160 minutes of my life saving your eyes. At least the show wasn\'t as bad as Koi Koi Seven. If you wanna see only big breasts and ecchi-ness, then there\'s actually better shows for that, like ""He is my Master!"". If you\'re looking for a good romance/harem anime, then go watch ""Ichigo 100%"" (the manga is better, though), ""True Tears"", ""Lovely Complex"" or ""ef - a tale of memories"".YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE. the main character, Arima is going to succeed Arima Group Corporation, and by the sounds of it, it looks like it\'s like the biggest company in the world.

She has coincidentally fencing as a hobby, which coincidentally matches with Arima\'s kendo, so they have by chance some common ground, I guess. With other words, we\'ve seen these type of personalities before. A lot. So what personality are we missing now? Tsundere? And yes, there is a tsundere girl in the series.  You\'ll know it straightaway when she pops up for the first time (hint: she has a slightly annoying/whiny voice, which all tsunderes have, so I guess that\'s alright). Did I mention that we also have a big-breasted maid? The anime industry sure knows what we like. And Arima Teppei is your average male main character.And that\'s not the best part yet (and by that, I mean the worst). The thing is with harem series, is that the plot can\'t be all fluffy and boobilicious all the time; it also needs some drama. Without telling too much: It\'s fucking ridiculous when you get to it. If you by any chance come to episode 7 or 8 (I don\'t quite remember which one), you\'re gonna have a fuckin\' laugh. I swear, the plot progression from there might be the most retarded one in harem anime history. It\'s clearly not to be taken seriously. I don\'t know, but I sure facepalmed a lot during that particular episode. And by of what I\'ve heard; the series is based off of an H-game, so that kind of sucky plot is expected, I guess.Is there anything good in Princess Lover? The art is decent and not ugly to look at. The animation is standard, but not bad. And if you\'re looking for ecchi-ness, you\'ve found it. A lot of booooobies. *coughEDcough* The music is not memorable at all; it\'s just generic. Visually speaking, the opening was pleasing to look at. In fact, I remember the breasts more than the music itself. And btw, Arima Isshin\'s voice is so badass (Wakamoto Norio is badass after all).So unless you enjoy torturing yourself or your friends, avoid Princess Lover at all cost. I fuckin\' used 160 minutes of my life saving your eyes. At least the show wasn\'t as bad as Koi Koi Seven. If you wanna see only big breasts and ecchi-ness, then there\'s actually better shows for that, like ""He is my Master!"". If you\'re looking for a good romance/harem anime, then go watch ""Ichigo 100%"" (the manga is better, though), ""True Tears"", ""Lovely Complex"" or ""ef - a tale of memories"".YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE.', 'This could have gotten a big fat ""1/10"" if not for the art/fanservice.Basically an H-Game that should have been an H-Anime. The storyline is so poorly constructed and contained reasoning so shallow that I have thought to myself ""WTF?"" or ""That\'s so shallow"".The deal with Princess Lover is that it\'s basically a harem anime but for the reason of making it feel different (in a disastrous way) from the rest, it goes on by inserting a serious side to the plot which can be seen halfway to the end.This is where the story becomes irredeemable.The first 2 or 3 episodes was quite interesting since it...feels like a royalty harem anime that feels like it has a potential to be something unique. After the introductory arc comes the annoying ""Passing the Club"" which has started the downhill trend for this title. Then there\'s the last arc (Save the Princess). I found myself remembering the forum posts on various anime sites saying how bad it was.In a nutshell, you\'ll watch this for the high production values and fanservice and nothing else.

I’ve customized this list to what you typically see in ecchi series. First I give the criterion, then I define the parameters of the criterion, then I state how the series matched up against the specified parameters. I also note how things like art and the soundtrack affect my overall rating of a series (along with what I thought of the two components), if anyone is interested in that.I don't claim that...this criteria will be universal - different people have different tastes and value different things, but this review is what would make/break watching a series for me. Mild spoilers ahead.Annoying Mascot Characters1. It's not a matter of whether or not the mascot character is annoying, it's a matter of how annoying the mascot character is.1) There is not a clearly defined mascot character in this series. Occasionally the main romantic interest acts as a mascot character, asking really simple questions so things can be elaborated more for the viewer, and offering overly-simple frustration at whatever unfortunate circumstance is unfolding. That being said, the main romantic doesn't often do that and when she does it's only mildly annoying.Art1. I find art to be pretty subjective. If I find it to be particularly good, it might +1 my overall opinion of the series, but I typically don’t hold it against a series for being averagely animated for the time it was animated.1) The art in this series was pretty average, nothing eye-popping and almost nothing distractingly bad. If I had one complaint about the art it would be that the most of the main female cast had breasts that were big just a bit beyond  the point of believability. I personally find female characters more attractive when I think that finding someone with their proportions in the real world is not impossible.Friend Quality (MC-Male Friends)1. The male friend(s) is/are (a) pervert(s) who do not get much characterization outside of getting the MC into trouble1) That’s essentially what Teppei’s group of male friends are. There are two distinctions to be made: first, Teppei is the ringleader for his group of friends; second, there is a male friend Teppei has who is constantly ignored – he’s generic, but outside of the parameter of the stereotypical male friends in ecchi series.Gratifying1. The MC is not a hopeless loser with no talents and horrible grades. If he is, when he improves, his improvements come relatively early in the series and they stay for the duration of the series.2. When the MC has to fight, he fights. (This doesn't have to do with the MC fighting well, just not being a pushover.)3. The MC hones his skill and visibly improves throughout the series (when there's action in the included genre)4.  Romantic interests are forthcoming about their feelings (both the MC and the girl involved)1) The main character certainly was not a loser, and not a clear-cut winner either. His grades weren't mentioned at any point throughout the series, so we're left to assume he's okay there.2) When the MC had to fight, he fought, with little or no prompting from other characters.3) The MC had good swordsmanship, but did not visibly improve it throughout the series. There was character skill progression, but it was more learning how to function in high-society (think Hayate no Gotoku without the ridiculousness and you'll have a decent perspective of what the training was like).4) The MC was not too decisive during the course of the series about who his number one female was, he seemed to enjoy his female counterparts equally, there weren't any surprises about who he somewhat leans towards at the end of the series. The female counterparts are all pretty forthcoming about their feelings, there was one girl who was kind of a tsundere, but she was definitely forthcoming by the middle of the series and not particularly violent.Magical Falling1. The MC somehow ends up in the 69 position or groping the female foil(s)' chest more often than humanly possible1) This is an ecchi show, so it does happen; however, it's much less frequent than other ecchi shows. Also, the female character(s?) play(s?) it off much better than other ecchi show female character(s) do.Memory Problems1. The MC has forgotten a promise to a childhood friend2. The MC has forgotten the face of a childhood friend he made a promise to3. The MC has amnesia1) There were no MC memory problems in this seriesPredictable Transfers1. If they're an antagonist in one episode, they're in the MC's class the next.1) The only predictable transfer was the MC into the academy, and it was by no means painful to watch.‘Special’ Main Character1. The MC is somehow distinguished during the course of the series from his peers – be it a special power or sudden change in social status1) This happens – you know what it is from the summary given on MALSoundtrack1. This rarely has an impact on my overall rating of a series, but I do feel I should note when I think a soundtrack is particularly memorable1) I thought the soundtrack was good, in that I remember thinking it was good as I watched the series; however, I don’t remember any scenes that really hit home for me because of the music – which sometimes happens to me when I watch anime.Voice Acting1. I'm not particularly judgmental about voice acting, the only thing that really bothers me is if there's a male character with a particularly effeminate voice or vice versa2. If there is English in the subbed version, there either isn't a lot or there is not a thick Japanese accent with characters who are supposed to be native/fluent English speakersThe voice acting was fine in both regards.1) I remember thinking (as I was watching the series) that the antagonist for this series has a great voice actor.2) There was not a lot of English in this series.1) One thing that bothered me about the show was how clear-cut the themes were, despite them dealing with complex topics which don't really have an answer to them. One of the themes is more 'money more problems'. Another one of the themes seems to be, 'poor people shouldn't blame rich people for their being poor, they should just stop being poor'. This really just left a bad taste in my mouth, if they left some characters and some plot more up to the viewer to decide what is right and what is wrong, I would have been much happier with the quality of the story. this criteria will be universal - different people have different tastes and value different things, but this review is what would make/break watching a series for me.

Princess lover focused more on romance than ecchi, and that's probably the reason why I got more emotional.The characters were different, especially the MC. Instead of a shy and normal protagonist living a normal life in a normal house, It had Teppei, the heir of a rich man living a dangerous life in a huge mansion. I've never seen any character like him. There's a lot of Charlottes and Sylvias out there, but only a few Teppei. Sure, he resembles other mainstream characters,...but you can see that his personality was different from them.As to the plot, it was perfect. There were no holes other than the open ending. What made it unique from ther harem anime is that it had a balanced plot. It didn't have a hella long introduction and fillers. It went straight to the point and perfectly balanced, with cliffhangers to keep the tension and interest of viewers.One thing I liked. About this anime was the graphics. You won't even realize that there's a transition from picture to picture. The graphics were simply a classic, even though it was aired in 2009.The voice acting... Pretty common, to be honest. But still, they did a great job.All in all, I loved it. It was an entirely new thing for me.

Emotional and romantic, that's princess lover!"", '""Ill deal with it somehow!"" - Teppei ArimaTeppei, a young teenage boy who lived with his mother and father in a social status that could be considered poor, but he was happy. Unknown to him, his life changed dramatically after his parents died in an accident that could be related to the recent attacks on the rich families in his area. Accepting his grandfather\'s adoption, Teppei is forcibly thrust into a world where he went from poor to filthy rich. The romance/comedy/action that ensues following his attempts at adapting to the rich life is one worth watching.I found Princess Lover! One of the unique harem/ecchi/romance...anime that I have seen. Contrary to the many harem anime out there, Princess Lover! put on its own style despite being adapted from an adult visual novel.The Story: Considering all the harem based anime I have seen thus far, Princess Lover! is set in an entirely different setting. Rather than the typical high school drama, PL focuses more on a the world that surrounds the main character which includes Japan families, royalty from other countries, and heirs to major fashion companies. (Not to mention all of whom are filthy rich). The story starts out suddenly, Teppei, completely happy with his life, is suddenly ripped from his normal atmosphere when his parents die in an accident. His grandfather, who adopts him, turns out to be the owner of a mega famous and popular company, The Arima Combine. The comedy that comes from Teppei\'s sudden transfer to the rich and famous was very pleasing. Even in the short 12 episodes, the plot development surprised me. Usually in harem anime, one doesn\'t see much plot development because of the major focus on the characters, PL does a good job of balancing both. The story setting and plot isn\'t a typical harem themed anime, and because of that, PL has a more mature/different/pleasing feeling. Not only does the plot explain more on the conflict between the rich and poor, it also touches on economics and the roles that CEO play in running major corporations. Not only did GoHands, and Dream Force did a good job of balancing the plot and characters to where the story actually progressed to an obvious well done climax and falling action, but they also did well in including comedy and drama.Art and Sound: The visuals done by the producers weren\'t sharp and picturesque like one would see in modern anime, but the smooth brightly colored drawings added to the music that accompanied it. I\'ve never had to find fault at an anime\'s pictures or music, but for a 2009 anime, I think PL did very well. Being tagged as an ecchi anime I was pleased that the fan service wasn\'t over the top, but tastefully added. There are uncensored and censored versions but either way, it doesn\'t detract from the work as a whole.Characters: Like in any generic harem anime, the main character can fall into one of two categories. The useless loser type, or the kind-hearted ""I\'ll save everyone type"". Unusually Teppei doesn\'t fall into either. With a good background from his parents backing his personality, a kind output that allows him to interact well with the people around him, the animators also made a character that I haven\'t seen so far. Teppei, unlike generic harem main characters, actually saves the day from time to time, either with his badass kendo skills, or his growing skills in managing a business. It seems as though to put it in other words, comparing it to usual harems, for example To Love Ru, Teppei and the characters in PL, and Rito and the characters in TLR are reversed. While Rito depends on the aliens to save him most of the time (not to mention he is dead useless physically), Teppei can be considered the opposite. (Although, I think deflecting bullets with a wooden kendo sword is a little far fetched.) The other characters in PL were also somewhat unique, but not so much that one couldn\'t see similarities.Enjoyment and Overall: I think the major aspect of PL that allowed it to be good, would be the overall feeling of how different it is compared to the norm. In my words, it thought outside the lines of the box and succeeded. If one is looking for a break from the typical harem type anime, PL provides pretty much all of that. To reiterate, with a unique setting, different main character, and actually some plot development that occurs, succeeding at balancing these unusual additions to the harem style, PL is one worth watching. PL can also be considered an indie anime, but it is also underrated; if any of you who read this play League of Legends, it\'s like an unpopular champion that is actually very strong.Thanks for reading,-Nebarto anime that I have seen.

So that\'s where that ends...this anime can be summed up in pretty much one word: Fanservice!Trying to understand some of the events that goes on as the ""plot"" progresses is not good for your health and...I highly advise against it. Seriously...some of the events that occur are downright outrageous and make no sense whatsoever. So stick to the reason why you chose to watch this, okay?Being the fanservice anime that it is, it knew where to focus its budget. The fanservice art is superb and gets the job done. There are no complaints on this department whatsoever and this may be the only point in which this anime excels at.The musical score is decent, but nothing memorable so let\'s keep moving here.Character wise...well this will pretty much play like most visual novel adaptations out there. You\'ll grow to like the sub heroines and hate life as the main heroine pales in comparison to them. Seika (the twintail tsundere) is the highlight of the show for me. I can\'t divulge anymore details without entering spoiler territory, but she fits in to the catogery of ""proactive"" tsundere. Oh there\'s also the other heroines...maid-san is nice, the blond fencer is also nice, and the heroine is annoying.I chose to watch this anime for the sake of the comedy and knew full well what I was getting in to with the \'ecchi\', \'harem\', and \'romance\' tags attached. If you keep those in mind and brace yourself for what\'s to come, then you\'ll have no problem getting some enjoyment out of this. And even then that doesn\'t say much as everything is a giant trainwreck after the Seika arc. Oh and don\'t even bother expecting a Sylvi route as there is none; go check the OVA if you want Sylvi goodness.Overall...a deploring anime whose sole redeeming factor is the fanservice and Seika. If you aren\'t a fan of either, then stay the hell away. If you are...well its only 12 episodes and they really handled Seika\'s character pretty well.And that\'s Princess Lover! in a nutshell.

He knows that the girls around him love him, Hell they even say it to his face, and hes man enough to take it into...consideration and go with the flow. He doesn\'t hurt them like other guys do.I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who is interested. consideration and go with the flow. He doesn\'t hurt them like other guys do.I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who is interested.', 'When people say this isn\'t your typical harem anime THEY ARE LYING TO YOUR FACE. Just like every other anime a majority of the girls fall in love with the main protagonist for next to no reason and the further in the anime you get the less sense everything starts to make. Normally for a review a would talk about the story in detail but because this one is essentially only a slice of life for the first 7 eps im going to only briefly talk about them. Warning contains spoilersStory:The story centres around Teppei Arima who becomes super rich after been named...the heir to the Arima corporation. He then finds out that he has an arranged marriaged to Sylvia Van Hossen.The first 3 eps is simply introducing the cliche\' harems girls (none will stick with you for very long). After that until ep 7 it is simply him going to school and finding out just how hard it is be super rich for no reason. Such complications include trying to get into his schools social club ( i know right riveting) and trying to get a girl to not hate him simply because of his last name.After ep 7 however is where it starts to get really stupid, a group of terrorists who hate the armia group because they\'re rich (yep thats the whole fucking reason, no joke) attack their headquarters to try and frame them doing something bad or something and during the attack they take control of their systems. Never ever ever ever have I heard computer terminology so poorly used in my life. It was so bad iI had to actually stop the ep and go for a walk to clear my head; I dont think the writer of this anime knew what the fuck they where writing and just put in whatever words they thought might work for the scenario. So after a bunch of bull shit that lead them to regaining control Tempai Arima decides to go rescue Charlotte Hazelrinkin (more on her later) instad of letting the professionals handle the workWARNING THIS IS WHERE I GET REALLY PISSES OFFAfter rescuring the useless Charlotte he finds and does not raise a point of asking why everyone else in the FUCKING BUILDING HAS UP AND LEFT THEM IN THE BUILDING WITH FUCKING BOMBS IN  IT and must now with the extremely useless Charlotte go defuse one of the bombs planted in the building. After getting to safety Sylvia now decides she is not going to let her fiancee\' die with her doing nothing like her mothers deaths (I get more into this with the character portion of the review but this makes no sense at all) and goes back into the building she just ditched him at and try to defuse a bomb (note she has absolutely no fucking experience what so ever with bombs) instead of letting the bomb specialists do it under the ruse that ""they cant make it in time"". So you\'re telling me you have time to helicopter some fucking inexperienced girls into the building but not bomb specialists? . After finding the bomb Teppai runs into one of the terrorists with a gun. Remember when i said that this anime was exactly like every other harem out their? This puts the nail in the coffin. Whilst being a very huge range disadvantage teppai with Charlotte cheering him in the background proceeds to dodge every bullet he fires ( and this is a professional marksman btw) and knocked him out in one hit; even though he was wearing full body armour. He then proceeds to throw the bomb into some shaft which was then stated to be able to withstand the bomb.If you havent got the message yet this story sucks fucking balls, all that happens later is the girls fighting over his attention. I give the story a 2 because not only does it use every cliche\' in the book but it is terribly written, and poorly executed.Art;Thankfully the one good thing I can say about this anime is that it looks the part, this is the only good thing that I got out of this anime (note: dont use this as an excuse as I did to watch this piece of shit)CharactersArima Teppei: His your typical harem anime main protagonist, oblivious to peoples feelings of him? Check. Has supernatural speed and dexterity only when the situation demands it? Check . Puts his life on the line to save people despite not knowing them? check. Solves every problem around other characters in an attempt to help? Check. The list goes on and on, he is nothing more than your typical good guy anime protagonist. Very poorly done and a shit character all around.Sylvia Van Hossen:Like every other main character in this piece of shit, Sylvia is nothing more than a kundere, she ticks off every cliche\' in the book. However she does have some strong points and is probably the most enjoyable of all the main characters. She has a great deal of experience in fencing and doesnt just start to like him out of the blue for no reason like the rest. In this story she is his fiancee\' however this anime for some reason doesnt use this has an excuse for her like him out of the blue which is weird  cause this anime is nothing but a giant cliche\' fest. She has a strong bond Charlotte which is actually properly explained in the story through a series of flash backs. She is the only character besides charlotte to have an actually explained bond with any other character that is simply because the story said it must be like that.Charlotte Hazelrink:Typical dereder who falls in love with Teppei and is jealous of Sylvia cause they\'re getting married. Aside from having large breasts their is nothing really more to say about this character, very boring.Conclusion:This anime sucked balls, the only good character was Sylvia.

I am glad they managed this from a harem/ecchi point of view.

It was really enjoyable.When I compare the animation quality in 2019 with those in the 2000s, it is obvious that the animation industry has gone through a lot of changes and unfortunately, these changes are not positive. The animation execution quality really took a hit in the 2010s with the implementation of  horrendous CG to...save some costs. Its a sad state of affair. I really hope that the Japanese begin to reflect on the better anime era in the 2000s and change their current practices. save some costs. Its a sad state of affair.

I felt that it is very well-structured and fan-service does not impede the plot at all, except in the first part of ep 6, which was a bit excessive. Little unnecessary scenes.Especially worth commending are the drama and inspirational scenes, which were aplenty. Drama especially unfolds from the ep7. That means that before ep 6...the mood for the series was quite light, whereas it was heavy from 7 onwards.Story was original, especially when this is a harem genre series. Like Asu no Yoichi, all of the main and some of the side characters played a heavy part in the development of the plot and climatic ending. The seemingly deep plot uncovered at the intro was properly addressed by the climatic ending, which is not every series could do.One setback is that by the last minutes of the last episode, the harem presented seems to be still held there, and no firm conclusion was made with who Teppei was going to be with.Art:9The art was amazing. Characters sometimes had near-perfect expressions. Colour was comfortable with the eyes and landscape was amazingly presented. Special effects looked almost real.Sound:9Some bgm were fantastic, some OSTs were spectacular and fitting in well with the scenes. OP and ED were great and fitting with the series, esp OP. Voice actresses and actors displayed emotions, reactions etc. well.Character:10Amazing use of characters to move plot along, all had special talents. We have a combat butler, a compassionate princess, a pro-fencer, a pro-swordsman, people with high authority and wisdom etc. Character development was great, but Isshin seemed to have a mysterious feel even to the end.

Can't forget fanservice. But, it seemed like romantic and awkward moments were just being tossed at you between Teppei and Charolette, but seeing Charollete often, i didn't really mind ;D. The real story only kicked in during the last few episodes so it seemed as if you were just being assaulted by a very predictable story line.Art: Some very good art in this anime, structures and backgrounds as well as character details were great. Once again, the fanservice of pantie flashing and...big breasts was still there, as well as many ecchi moments in the later parts of the show. All in all, good art.Sound: Voice acting was fairly decent, opening and closing themes were a bit upbeat and fluffly, but were at least decently made. Not much to say on the sound.Characters: Protagonist not the average one, actually a good guy instead of the seemingly common harem protagonists, which was a breathe of fresh air. The four main female characters weren't very developed throughout this anime's short life, but the cliche of the mind you, extremely attractive airhead lovergirl was shown too much, and the other girl characters probably should have received more screen time if the show lasted more than just 12 episodes.Enjoyment: I did actually enjoy this anime, contrary to some others.

There's no exception here. This was a pretty bland ride throughout the entire anime, and mediocre at best.Story: 5The story here is nothing original. You have your male protagonist, Teppei, who seems to be your average high school student. Soon after, though, you find out he's someone who's rich. Not to spoil anything, but from here on out the story doesn't even matter. It's a continuous nonstop ride of events that don't connect very well together, and the creators trying to make sense of...it all. The way the anime ends was very anticlimactic as well.Art: 9If there was a very good pro about this anime, it's that the art is very good looking. There were very few bad frames of animation here and there, but all can be forgiven when the characters and the background all look superb.Sound: 8The sound was pretty good too. The music was upbeat and easy on the ears, but I found some of the seiyuus to be very annoying to listen to, especially Charlotte. For some reason, that voice was just frustrating to hear in the tone she uses. But Yuu's soft soothing voice made up for that one.Character: 4This is where I felt the anime fell apart for me. Teppei's character was absolutely flat in my opinion. When tragedy befalls his family in the beginning, he doesn't even seem to give a squat about it. You don't feel any sympathy for him as his personality just seems to be as blank as a piece of paper. Sometimes, I felt like yelling at some of the characters at how bland they were. I also saw how even though it was a harem, the story seemed to focus much more on the random events that happen chronologically then the characters themselves. We start out with five or so female leads and in the end learn that they weren't the focus of anything that happens. The characters just seemed lacking personality.Enjoyment: 5At best, Princess Lover! was an anime that didn't go anywhere, and after you finish, you'll most likely forget what happened. It satisfies that harem  which keeps your attention with its fan service here and there.Overall, I felt that the anime was a waste that could have been something better and something that should be skimmed through. Even if you had the time, I recommend you skip over this. it all. The way the anime ends was very anticlimactic as well.Art: 9If there was a very good pro about this anime, it's that the art is very good looking. There were very few bad frames of animation here and there, but all can be forgiven when the characters and the background all look superb.Sound: 8The sound was pretty good too. The music was upbeat and easy on the ears, but I found some of the seiyuus to be very annoying to listen to, especially Charlotte. For some reason, that voice was just frustrating to hear in the tone she uses. But Yuu's soft soothing voice made up for that one.Character: 4This is where I felt the anime fell apart for me. Teppei's character was absolutely flat in my opinion. When tragedy befalls his family in the beginning, he doesn't even seem to give a squat about it. You don't feel any sympathy for him as his personality just seems to be as blank as a piece of paper. Sometimes, I felt like yelling at some of the characters at how bland they were.

The manga actually started off very differently with the focus on the princess alone, but that's beside the point. Overall I really enjoyed this anime, it was a nice watch. It starts off intriguing and then kinda slows down a bit into a nice good-hearted watch. However, it actually gets serious pretty abruptly, and the serious section is quite nice, and at times a bit darker than i expected (people actually got shot!). The characters are all nice, if not a bit small of a cast, the main...guy and the girls taking up pretty much most of the focus with very little light on others. The animation is fantastic, and yes, gives nice ecchi moments because of it. Actually, it wans't that bad when it came to ecchi-ness. Sure it had some fan-service from time to time but it was never so thick and saturated that it put me off, although i did download the censored version. The one complaint i have about this anime is that it is far too short and the ending doesn't really solve anything! C'mon man, pick a girl! Even so, this anime is still a nice watch and would appeal to men and woman alike. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to see a nice romance anime with a decent plot, and some ecchi.

I\'ve read many stuff about it being different from other harems, but Princess Lover is indeed just another harem.  However there was something different about Princess Lover compared to many harems/ ecchi that we have today that encouraged me to write a review.Story:To go straight off to my point about the difference between Princess Lover and other harems is that it had a story.  Something I really want to focus on is the protagonist, Arima Teppei.  Arima Teppei and his grandfather were probably the ones that snatched all...the meaningful quotes in the entire anime.  The anime studios has become so corrupt, the""typical"" harems today have become, ""the girls have big boobs, but the story is crap, but girls have big boobs."".  Indeed I am nuts for 2D girls like many of us here, but I really disagree with such nonsense.  In a harem field, having unique and attractive girls should be a given.   There are just never ending list of girls that can be in a harem field and I have seen that much of it.  Harems are no longer about how attractive the girls are, but what will make it different from other harems are the protagonist.  There can just be so many fan-services in harems, but if the main character sits, so does the story.Now, Princess Lover didn\'t have such amazing story, but the fact is, it did have one.  The author was writing with a purpose and he did have a message that he wanted to share with the audience.  The one that will fulfill this will be done by Teppei.  I think it is about time harem animes change their ways a little about having pretty dominant and stable protagonist, because he still is the main focus and the story moves on based off of him.  Not only that, but he is representing the author\'s ultimate message.  What are harem authors doing these days?It did lack motions in action scenes, so I wouldn\'t say it was super actiony, but it did have action moments and it\'s thrills.  Starting from the first episode, like all the other action movies and animes, it would constantly jump to here and there with such inconstant events.  While continuing with the story, they definitely don\'t miss out with the fan-services and the comedies.  and ofc the jiggly boobies for all the ecchi fans.art:The art of Princess Lover was probably the best part of the anime.  But it is something a studio can\'t miss out when producing a ecchi anime.  The character designs for all the girls and even the adults suit them very well.  It took me a while to realize, I was kind of disgusted with Teppei\'s character design.  It wasn\'t all that bad tho.sound:I really don\'t even remember sounds in this anime.   I rushed through it, skipped all openings and endings, and barely bothered to listen to the music.  The only music that caught my attention was in the very last episode, which really was out of place...  In the very last scene... YEA. you all know what the hell i\'m talking about.  They just couldn\'t find a suitable music for the last epic scene.  It totally killed Teppei\'s awesome speech for that blonde guy, whatever his name was.character:The girls of this anime were just like every other harem anime girls.  nothing special.  Just a maid, and 3 rich girls.  Although I don\'t mind the girls being typical harem girls, Teppei was best.  The speeches he gave during the most dramatic moments for the girls was very encouraging and acceptable.  Many other harem animes disappoint me when the protagonist gives crappy speech as if it was something so great...  Even if it was great, the character would drop back to zero as if his life lesson just went past, and became history.  Teppei didn\'t lose nor forget the things he learned throughout the story, and he even said some great stuff in the last scene.  ahh words are good stufff. :\')Enjoyment:I enjoyed the anime.  cause i like harem, and tsundere services, with princesses and maid girls :)  and bouncing boobs.  anything more?  oh and it did have great settings and some of the episodes felt like mission impossible or something.  Some serious action stuff in this anime.  I was pretty surprised.Yea.. I\'m getting lazy with the review, and i basically said what i wanted to say.  It was one of the good harems I\'ve watched, but the problem probably laid on how it was directed.  I don\'t fault the seiyuus but the anime wasn\'t all the professional overall.Harems don\'t always have to be 1 guy + 20million girls with no story.  but I\'ll cope with it and wait until the day, someone comes to realization of the failures in the harems being produced today.

I've got nothing much to say here, except that this is my kind of animation style.Sound - 8The OP & ED was fairly good, I've got nothing much to say on that.

And high school anime can work but have recently been kinda shit. But nothing can describe the kind of hatred I feel towards the mixing of high school and harems. So what happens when I watched this high school harem! Belong to the genre that needs to go brutally anal rape itself to death!... It was good... I cannot even begin to comprehend how this anime could possible have been in any way, shape, or form decent! There\'s something fundamentally wrong with that picture. Well lets get to it.Story 6/10:...Okay, the story is only slightly above average. It starts out kind of following the harem formula of coming up with an extremely half-assed reason for having the main lego brick personality protagonist end up surrounded by chicks. In this the lego bricks parents die and he goes to live with his grandpa who just so happens to be extremely rich and our lego brick had no idea. But... Wait?... The plot, starts to make sense after a while in and somewhat diverges into a far more decent political story and story of revenge!... Well to a degree. So yeah the shows plot starts out fairly standard harem but it becomes far better later in. My one problems is *warning, minor spoilers* the main villains motivations for revenge in contrast to what he actually does to get the revenge is kind of, ridiculously over the top. I mean sure some people have embarrassed me as a kid too but you don\'t see me planning murder, I just slashed their tires later.Art 5/10: I have nothing bad to say about the art, I also have nothing good to say about it. The art is extremely average and generic. The character all follow the basic anime character template that seems to be so fucking popular (people, when will you learn? Anime means it was made in Japan, it\'s not a specific art style, you\'re allowed to make the basic design to make your show look unique!), the backgrounds are nothing special what so ever, and the animation with both just regular walking and fighting is about the same as you\'ll see almost everywhere else unless you watch something like Akira or Jin-Roh (then again, those were the pinnacle of animation smoothness in anime in my opinion, so it\'s unfair to compare them)Sound 5/10: Once again a very average part of the show. All the music is exactly what you\'d expect from a harem anime and there are no memorable tracks, nor any that stand out. This is another thing anime studio\'s need to realize, music is supposed to fit with the scene at hand in a way that perfectly accents the scene and be easily listened to and appreciated by the audience without drawing attention away from the show. If your audience says ""wait, there was music going on in that scene? Oh yeah that really background generic stuff, right"" you\'re not leaving a good impression. And my rule about not reviewing voice acting in languages I don\'t understand still stands so no dub = no voice acting review.Character 8/10: Fantastic! I now get review the extremely bland and personality-less harem male lead #24601 (""What? No not you Valjean, some other guy"") so allow me to rip this sexual oblivious dumb fuck a new assho- Wait a second, the male lead is actually good! Holy shit guys! The internet is about to break, everyone evacuate! ABANDON THREAD!!!!!!...Is it safe to come back... It looks kind... Yeah, we\'re good. So anyway, the lead character is actually pretty decent. He\'s pretty competent, doesn\'t over-react whenever he accidentally touches breasts, and he\'s not a complete dumb fuck who\'s completely oblivious to the fact that women have vagina\'s. But he\'s still flawed enough to not be at the hateable level of Mary Sue, he\'s more on the level of ""the lucky pervert!"" (honestly, episode 6 will make you shit yourself laugh)  As for the females, you have the basic trends of the Mary Sue main (and she\'s really Mary Sue level, god I hate this archetype), the tsundere, the... Supporting Mary Sue (okay, one was bad enough but this is ridiculous). But one of our other female leads makes up for this, Silvia, who doesn\'t follow a certain archetype and for a female in a harem anime is actually quite competent on her own.Enjoyment 7/10: Okay, I liked watch Princess Lover, I will admit to actually having enjoyed a... A... *mumble*... A HIGH SCHOOL HAREM!!!! The show, despite the average art and sound and only slightly above average story is actually quite entertaining. Every episode is generally packed with plenty of fun to watch antics or suspense (I say this is thanks to the 12 episode length that keeps the show nice and compact, keep this in mind anime industry, longer is not necessarily better. Yes, I\'m looking at you 300+ episode shows)Overall 7/10: So yes, it\'s a high school harem, and it\'s actually fairly decent. I don\'t know how they managed to pull it off but Princess Lover is actually quite a good show and I\'d recommend it if you\'re looking for something short. One thing people often complain about though is the romantically inconclusive ending however I myself didn\'t really mind this too much.

But if you don\'t like shows where the romance aspect isn\'t resolved at the end you should be wary of this show.', ""This is your typical harem anime. It involves a story about a young boy who happens to run into a great sum of money through an inheritance. Over all the main character is a kind and fair guy who attracts 4 girls. They never end up telling who he will end up with at least in the 12 episodes I have seen but you can really assume who he will end up picking from the first or second episode. This becomes extremely obvious in the last 4 episodes. Even though this anime was quite predictable there was a good story line and involved political and...economic problems that come with being extremely rich. Over all I had to take a few breaks between the episodes due to the fact that I would get slightly bored but as soon as this series started to pick up in the last few episodes I couldn't turn my eyes away. economic problems that come with being extremely rich.

Shirou- Teppei Arima voiced by Takuma Terashima is our typical ""wanting to protect and care for his harem"" type with a tragic backstory added to him. The tragic backstory of his parents dying leaving him to his grandfather actually...kickstarts the anime but that isn\'t really his bright spot for the Teppei as a character, it\'s more or less what happens when a normal teenager is now brought to a place of wealth (it might sound off but LA will get to this later). Sakur- Yuu Fujikura voiced by Yuki Matsuoka becomes Teppei\'s personal maid and is the typical nice girl who minds Teppei, she is LA\'s favourite character in this anime, no not only because LA has a thing for maids, but also because her typical nice girl and the minder to Teppei is a nice combination of NOT getting her annoying and helping Teppei\'s cause at the same time. Ride- Charlotte Hazelrink voiced by Ryouka Yuzuki is our resident genki girl and ALWAYS happy in any situation and she is our MAIN focus of this entire anime, why does LA say this?, well she\'s the first girl Teppei meets, she has the most screentime even outside of her main plotline and the anime itself is gunning for Charlotte and Teppei to be together as this relationship also gets the most screentime...LA didn\'t like this turn of events, she wasn\'t an absolute detriment to the anime as her plotline leads to one of the grander themes to Princess Lover!, but LA wished some of the other harem members could get if any screentime. Rin- Seika Houjouin voiced by Emiri Katou is your resident tsundere and strict ""club president"" type character and she gets a small arc to herself that ties into her and Teppei grandfather\'s family issues and LA didn\'t mind it but like any harem member with a small arc and gets added to the harem, she fawns and tsundere\'s over Teppei. Finally we have Sab- Sylvia van Hossen voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi the character with the most wasted potential within this harem and quite honestly the LEAST amount of screentime in LA\'s eyes. Why?, well Sylvia becomes Teppei\'s fiancee through Teppei\'s grandfather Isshin Arima. This is interesting as we could see how Teppei would have felt being forced to marry Sylvia and then later on Sylvia and Teppei might fall in love naturally and break the social structure OR Sylvia and Teppei liking each other but rebelling at their forced marriage just something like that but again...due to Charlotte being the main focus, this was just wasted potential from LA. LA still preferred Yuu as favourite, but Sylvia was probably the most interesting character in the harem. Also if LA\'s hinting isn\'t obvious enough, kinda a coincidence that the harem members were carbon copied from Fate stay night right?For minor characters, it\'s expected that most of them supporting characters for a harem anime, but LA would note that the majority of the minor cast do have some semblance of screentime whether it be Haruhiko Nezu voiced by Minoru Shiriashi the butt monkey of the cast, Ayano Kaneko and Erika Takezono voiced by Nozomi Sasaki and Kaoru Mizuhara being Seika\'s posse members and Alfred voiced by Yousuke Akimoto, the extremely clingy butler of Charlotte.Princess Lover!\'s plot progression is albeit quick even for a 12 episode anime, consisting of 3 ""arcs"" in a ways, the Introduction arc focusing on what\'s going on and introducing the majority of the characters along with Teppei\'s situation of finding his parent\'s killers, Seika\'s arc along with the Hot Springs Meta Episode (Don\'t ask) then Charlotte\'s arc that gets serious. Now how the mood is placed, LA thought this anime would get extremely moodswinging due to how it gets ""serious"" and ""comes out of nowhere"" or stupid comedically ecchi moments appear but LA by the end didn\'t really see this, the anime was always goofy and ecchi as hell even when it\'s serious, minor characters and especially Charlotte backs up it\'s goofiness even in the most serious at times (also see the two dorky ""terrorists"", Nezu and gratitous amounts of fanservice). Like harems that are comedic ecchifest animes doesn\'t ALWAYS need to be like this, look at The World God Only Knows: Goddesses arc and hell Highschool DxD did this!, a harem isn\'t just limited to it\'s premise.If there was anything LA could actually be annoyed by the plot is Sylvia\'s screentime taken away by Charlotte instead and adds to the missed potential Sylvia as a character would of had. Although it wasn\'t from the first episode, but it becomes quite noticeable almost blaring out like an S.O.S signal that this won\'t be a balanced harem and the Hot Springs Pact disguising as if it would was a lame attempt in thinking that no one other than Charlotte would win this harem.So about Teppei\'s situation of being brought into a world of wealth through his grandfather is actually an interesting theme to this anime, as the majority of the harem and characters are aristocrats or of royalty or wealthy businesswomans, seeing Teppei being the average guy and STILL being one by the end of it is actually quite interesting as he is unaffected by money or power and this fuels his want to protect people due to his parents dying. This dynamic actually works pretty well and even Charlotte\'s arc main villain is essentially a polar opposite character to Teppei only this time the villain took the wrong path and doesn\'t care about anyone but himself and his ambitions. Princess Lover! underlying theme tucked under the forced panty shots and harem antics does shows us that even if your rich, you can quite easily have even newer problems as well as the fact that you might self destruct yourself if your not careful with your money. Cheesy enough as it sounds, this notion is kinda manifested in Teppei of that having power and money isn\'t everything.On speaking of fanservice.......HELLLLLLLLLLLO uncensored glory, yup the anime is completely uncensored and although the forced panty shots and jiggle physics is strong in this one, the fanservice is pretty plentiful albeit forced typical for an ecchi harem anime.The animation done by GoHands has GoHands\'...hands all over it. From the typical shining effect to the decent enough backgrounds that could make JJ Abrams blush. The character designs are pretty polished and exotic, this is kinda obvious to the wealthy characters, special mention probably goes to Sylvia\'s normal outfit. The fights that happen in this anime is sparse but ok enough, though the fencing and swordplay are decent to look at. Overall, yes LA thought the animation was typical of GoHands and decent to look at.The voice acting.....well NORIO WAKAMOTO as Isshin Arima, man LA heard him in quite a while. Yuki Matsuoka, Megumi Toyoguchiand Ryouka Yuzuki were pretty good however LA\'s surprising voice actor would go to Emiri Katou as Seika, mainly because Emiri is typecasted as the genki of the harem members, here?...she\'s the strict tsundere character?...yeah LA wasn\'t expecting it and she does it pretty well.LA also thought that because of it\'s themes being taken full circle along with Teppei\'s resolution taken place during the finale, LA thought the ending was done pretty well for Teppei and this anime\'s themes quite well. Not so much with how the harem ending...ends with a harem ending with Teppei still not choosing even though it\'s goddamn obvious that he\'s gonna be with Charlotte.So Princess Lover! kinda got LA torn over many elements to it by the end of it. LA liked it\'s grander themes of being rich not always being ideal and safe, Princess Lover! knowing itself and it\'s limitations and wanting to be different if it could and tried, the decent ending, the animation and voice acting being decent, however with Sylvia\'s and Yuu\'s lesser screentime due to Charlotte highjacking the plot and forced panty shots and fanservice and finally having that  harem ending. Princess Lover! isn\'t that bad, yes it has it\'s problems and sometimes those problems are due to LA\'s own bias due to best girl and all but LA just can\'t hate it but it\'s not great either. kickstarts the anime but that isn\'t really his bright spot for the Teppei as a character, it\'s more or less what happens when a normal teenager is now brought to a place of wealth (it might sound off but LA will get to this later). Sakur- Yuu Fujikura voiced by Yuki Matsuoka becomes Teppei\'s personal maid and is the typical nice girl who minds Teppei, she is LA\'s favourite character in this anime, no not only because LA has a thing for maids, but also because her typical nice girl and the minder to Teppei is a nice combination of NOT getting her annoying and helping Teppei\'s cause at the same time.

I thought that this would be 'just another' harem anime with lots of ecchi.But somewhere along the 2nd and 3rd episode the things started to turnaround.Good thing about this anime is that the characters in this anime have got some level of depth in them.I watched the uncensored version as usual 8-).As far as the eccchi content is concerned, it is very less in this anime....The Story:------------I don't want to tell you the whole story (I don't like spoilers).But it shows the glimpse of the rich people's life.Stuff's like,-> It doesn't matter what you social status is, people all over sacrifice something for something else.->You have to make decisions at every point in your life and these decisions are the ones that makes your life.And ETC  are shown in a nice way in this anime.If you the semi-serious kind of person (like me) this anime does make you think about all this.The Art/Sound:-------------------The art is really good, so is the sound.I would say it is a Good Anime and is worth watching at-least once.(This is how I perceived this anime. We all have different view point and we all see things differently. This is my point of view.) :) The Story:------------I don't want to tell you the whole story (I don't like spoilers).But it shows the glimpse of the rich people's life.Stuff's like,-> It doesn't matter what you social status is, people all over sacrifice something for something else.->You have to make decisions at every point in your life and these decisions are the ones that makes your life.And ETC  are shown in a nice way in this anime.If you the semi-serious kind of person (like me) this anime does make you think about all this.The Art/Sound:-------------------The art is really good, so is the sound.I would say it is a Good Anime and is worth watching at-least once.(This is how I perceived this anime. We all have different view point and we all see things differently. This is my point of view.) :)"", ""I already finished this show and I just now looked at how many users Princess Lover has. Holy Jesus! Did I miss something? Over 100,000 users! I feel like I'm out of the loop here. And the score is not all that great, considering the large amount of people who watched this. Princess Lover is serviceable. I legitimately had fun with the show, but at it's core, it all just feels very shallow. I mean, I already had that idea going into it. On the surface it looks like any other generic late 2000's ecchi series, and it was just that, sorta. I'm conflicted, because...I had a good time with the show, but I can't say a lot positive things about it.Teppei Arima loses his parents in a terrible accident and he is forced to move in with his well off grandfather. He transfers to a prestigious highschool of snobby rich kids, and slowly learns they way of the wealthy life. It's like that one scene in The Great Gatsby, Teppei adopts many of the fancy mannerisms to fit in with his peers and over time, he adapts to his new environment. He encounters this beautiful girl who looks just like the vampire chick from Rosario to Vampire, named Charlotte Hazerlink. She's a cute little princess who quickly falls in love with Teppei and yada yada yada. She's not my favorite girl in the group, that honor goes to Syliva van Hossen. She's a perfect example of how this show puts a lot emphasis on big ass. It's very rare that an anime does that, they mostly focus on the tits. I greatly appreciate that. Sylvia is Teppei's fiancée and she has a great respect for Teppei, because while other boys were financially successful and had parents, he was studying the blade. He's also a good sparring partner for her in fencing. She's a cute tomboy with a deep voice and is definitely best girl, fight me.And then you have the rejects, I MEAN, other girls you should care about. Like Seika Houjouin. When Teppei first transfered to the school, Seika immediately saw him for who he truly was, a commoner, and treated him as such. During the early parts of the show she had a very rotten personality and has these two sidekicks that stay by her side all of the time. And guess what, as the series goes on she falls in love with Teppei and becomes slightly less of a spiteful meanie. She's okay. And the last one I'll mention because I'm already sick of talking about these characters,\xa0 Yuu Fujikura. She's the head maid of the Arima estate. A soft spoken and mild mannered girl who would've been my favorite if Syliva wasn't there.Shockingly, the show is well made and I got in a few laughs, but other than that, I can't say many positive things about it. Alfred (Charlotte's butler) was an absolute riot to watch. His obsession with Charlotte was very entertaining and how he acts like an overprotective grandfather. There's a goofy scene that happens later in the show where Teppei and Alfred do rock, paper, scissors in the middle of the action to see who gets to ride the motorcycle and chase after Charlotte. It was a scene that made me smile for how out of nowhere it all was. The girls are unbelievably cute and they all have nice asses which I mentioned earlier. Almost forgot about these two guys that were working with the villain who were incredibly kind to Charlotte. They also went to medical school and play a semi-important role later on. It was fun watching them be goofy.Aaaaaaaaaaaaand that's it. That's all I can say about Good Old Fashioned Princess Lover Boy. It's not offensively bad in anyway, it's just nothing substantial. Nothing happens for most of the show and it's not until the last four episodes when the plot kicks in. The villain was lame. His actions were a little predictable, and the reveal in the last episode I also called relatively early. Just like writing this review, watching this show felt pointless. Why am I still writing? Why are you still reading this? Is anyone even listening to me? Please leave.

But not really in a good way. It was very entertaining to watch though for all the wrong reasons mostly. It was often so stupid. Like really really stupid. Story was predictable and plotholes were so huge that they make all those boobs look small.Main plot tells story of Arima Teppei, guy who likes motorcycles and swordfighting. His parents are killed and the he becomes the vengeance, the night, the Batma…wait that’s not how it went! There is Alfred the butler though and a lot of...other things that are so much like the life of Bruce Wayne if he would be the main character of harem anime of course.So parents are killed and the the rich grandfather takes Arima to live with him and he is going to be future owner of his grandfather’s large company. On the way he saves the nice pair of boo… cough… I meant the princess Charlotte Hazelrink from a group of random bad guys who hate rich people. Later he meets more girls to fill his harem and eventually bad guys return, turning this school comedy to attempt of action genre... or maybe attempt is too kind word for that mess.Story: 1 PatheticStory is honestly absolute crap and attempt to go into some sort of action genre was honestly laughable. It must work better in the game, but bad guys, terrorists and secret nuclear facilities in ecchi-anime right after the cliché episode with hot springs? Haha it was so absurd turn it sure made me laugh a lot though. When action starts main character has a character shield so strong that he doesn’t need to fear any guns. Bad guys also make stormtroopers in Star Wars to look like sharpshooters.Sure fanservice was expected, but many times it ruined even the most serious attempts to tell a serious story. Even during supposedly serious conversations there were pantyshots. Fan-service was overall good though, so if it’s the boobs and panties you want- this may be the anime for you. If you want action or story that makes sense you are in wrong place- excitement is zero and stuff happens, but most of it makes no sense or is so unbelievable stupid you can only laugh.Art: 5 MediocreThis anime would have looked pretty good really, if the art would be consistent, but quality goes up and down. Faces, even boobs are often drawn wrong and animation looks weird at times. Some of animation is pretty creative like uncommon angles (not always just for panties), but inconsistencies in style are too big to go unnoticed.Sound: 6 FairNot much to say. Most characters are rather stereotypic and speak with stereotypic voices. VA:s are actually very good  in this one. Music is allright, especially OP almost sang along few times. Ending has boobs shown so I don’t remember the music :P nuff said….Character: 4 DecentTeppei Arima, lucky guy for sure, has his own harem, own company and he can walk into a crossfire without getting hit, because reasons… As character he is rather generic boring protagonist, that has these superhero-like tendencies without it being cool. He also eventually shares his blatant life philosophy  ”humans are humans, there are good people and bad people”- that’s… deep.Charlotte Hazelrink, Princess of Hazelrink, fictitious country in the Europe (yet she pronounces her own name in the most japanese manner possible Charurotte Hazurorinku which sounds very funny). She is damsel in distress with huge…. abilities to get captured. Old fashioned heroine that constantly needs Arima’s help. She is cute though, but her uselessness is unbelievable most of the time.Sylvia Van Hossen, Imagine the Saber from Fate Stay Night, change eyes to blue and it’s her in another anime, such a rip-off design. She is honestly boring as character, but not useless. She is OP swordsman who helps Arima, she is also his fiancée.Seika Houjouin, Tsundere because… that was needed I guess…. she is fashion designer and leader of the rival company to Arima’s group and leader of the social club in school Teppei is transferred.Yuu Fujikura, That's the maid. Almost forgot there was one.Isshin Arima, owner of the wealthy Arima corporation and Teppei’s grandfather. Rich but wise old man, not much to say about him.Because bad guys are needed in harem animes, there is also that one evil fellow. He is just bad… and rather stupid bad guy to be honest, with a very poor backstory as well.Then there are all sort of side characters from hyperactive guy from the class to Seika’s girl posse and two funny terrorists.Enjoyment: 7 GoodIt’s trash, but trash is fun to watch at times. Fan-service and absurdly bad plot developments kept me entertained.Overall: 5 MediocreStory was too bad for a serious anime, yet too complicated for harem ecchi show. Absurd is the best word for the story I think. It goes way too far and does it so poorly you just cannot believe it. Fan service was top-notch in this one though, but art was often inconsistent. other things that are so much like the life of Bruce Wayne if he would be the main character of harem anime of course.So parents are killed and the the rich grandfather takes Arima to live with him and he is going to be future owner of his grandfather’s large company.

She is OP swordsman who helps Arima, she is also his fiancée.Seika Houjouin, Tsundere because… that was needed I guess…. she is fashion designer and leader of the rival company to Arima’s group and leader of the social club in school Teppei is transferred.Yuu Fujikura, That's the maid. Almost forgot there was one.Isshin Arima, owner of the wealthy Arima corporation and Teppei’s grandfather. Rich but wise old man, not much to say about him.Because bad guys are needed in harem animes, there is also that one evil fellow. He is just bad… and rather stupid bad guy to be honest, with a very poor backstory as well.Then there are all sort of side characters from hyperactive guy from the class to Seika’s girl posse and two funny terrorists.Enjoyment: 7 GoodIt’s trash, but trash is fun to watch at times. Fan-service and absurdly bad plot developments kept me entertained.Overall: 5 MediocreStory was too bad for a serious anime, yet too complicated for harem ecchi show.

Even after Completing it the feeling of dread of what could happen never left, it felt like it was coming and even at the climax it still lingered.

While I did get some of that, the anime surprised me by making shit actually happen.Spoilers below:The story itself is a bit overdone, with the main character's parents dying and him coming to be crazy rich because he was adopted by his grandpa all in the first episode. From there, the show takes a nice little slice of life detour for a couple episodes, which develops the relationships between most of the girls and Teppei, and between each other. Then, ABDUCTION, BOMBS, GUNS, CONTROVERSY. With our little female lead being captured, Teppei and the...rest of his girls rush in to save her and his grandpa. Of course, only after succeeding will she be taken again. Hartmann's rags to riches story is touching, but he ruins himself. In the end, the story concludes just as you think it would, happily.

Not one girl in the harem is ugly. All of them have bangin bodies, trust me. While the main girl, Charlotte Hazelrink, leaves a lot to be desired in intelligence, she does show signs of maturity at times (not only in her ass and tits).

After sucking it up and watching the few couple episodes, I realized that this anime is unique to its kind. You have the typical harem romance with that hint of comedy, but you also have plot twists outside of those relationships involving powerful corporations, governments, those who want to overthrow, and betrayals.I'm only slightly disappointed that it's only 12 episodes long. "", ""Not gonna lie, they had us on the first half.The strongest point of the series is the art and the animation. There are scenes where you clearly can see smooth animation out of characters with detailed/borderline realistic movement. At the beginning of the series, the action scenes actually took me by surprise, and so did the sparring match between Teppei and Saber from «Fate». Nevertheless, this is also their weak point, because when the animation involving rapid action decays, it's very noticeable.Now, the story started promising, and it turned out better than I thought it would be. But, towards the second half of the...series, a villain becomes the focus and basically, a harem-esque, high school story became a poorly cliched save-damsel-in distress story with unrealistic motivations and just mediocre character development.

Hell, they even attempted a homage to Spike and Vicious's fight from «Cowboy Bebop» that just came off as blatantly underwhelming.Then there's the MC's relationship with these girls, of which only two are somewhat developed. Obviously, the one he has the most chemistry with Maka from «Rosario+Vampire», and their relationship is well constructed. Then, his relationship with Saber is established per their love for swordsmanship, but it never goes further than that. At a certain point, everyone (them, plus Rin Tohsaka and the Maid) just admits their feelings for him, which came out of nowhere. Although, I must point out how all of them came to the agreement that they would respect their friendship and the MC's decision, which was something I've never seen before, as well as surprisingly mature.In conclusion, this is a series I wouldn't recommend to anyone who's looking for a story that at least makes sense within the constraints of the series itself.

In fact, extremely childish.Many think that being childish is a defect for a work, but these people are wrong. There is anime for all audiences, the one for children is no different.Kitty's Paradise is episodic, and each episode is an adventure in Kitty and Mimmy's imagination.Each episode teaches something to the kids, and it's run in a...somewhat expository way for the target audience. This anime wants to teach basic things to kids while they have fun watching.Kitty and Mimmy are two very cute characters, and quite amusing at various times.As they are sisters, it is natural that they fought for silly reasons, especially since they are children.As a whole the anime is good, taking into account its purpose and target audience. somewhat expository way for the target audience.

Juushin Liger,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4119/Juushin_Liger,"[""One of Go Nagai's lesser known works, Jushin Liger follows the formula that most anime based on his works do, and it does so very well. I had always thought this show looked awesome, but it wound up exceeding my expectations. Being a 43 episode series based on 2 volumes of manga, it is not without its issues, but overall it is thoroughly entertaining and fans of this kind of thing are gonna love it.Although it's technically a bio armor show, for all intents and purposes this is a monster of the week show. The bio armors are controlled G Gundam style, and are massive...and much more than a suit of armor. It doesn't excel in the character and plot departments, but it delivers awesome action and great episodes in spades. The story starts kicking right away and in the first episode we see the hero dawning the bio armor and fighting monsters. Characters basically appear out of nowhere and receive little development. It's the same way in the manga. But for me that didn't detract much, this show is all about delicious 80s vibes and monsters tearing each other to pieces. The characters aren't necessarily bad though, and in some cases do get development. There is a renegade-type henchman (fittingly enough he has blonde hair and wears red sunglasses) that by the end is a very different person, and one of the main character's sidekicks winds up being more than just the pointless goofball. Ryu (the renegade henchman) is the only character that stands out much on the antagonists side, and he was the most interesting character. As for the plot, it's pretty barebones stuff but we do see twists and turns here and there.Now for what makes this show a joy to watch: the action and the music. The incredibly awesome OPs and EDs are among the best, and the soundtrack itself is pretty much just as good. 80s guitar riffs galore, and seemingly always present. The amazing soundtrack is one of the defining parts of this series. Watching Jushin Liger rip and tear through the opposition never once gets old, and being a late 80s show the budget seems to be fairly high. There is minimal use of stock footage (aside from combination sequences) and in general everything looks very high quality. Another thing that helps maintain a high level of episodic quality and helps to hold your attention is that things are always changing. Jushin Liger gets several upgrades and and multiple forms, and as the show progresses we get pilots that use actual mecha to support Jushin Liger, and previously useless comic relief characters become pilots. It goes from just following the titular robot to eventually having a competent military force around with new characters. The Jushin Liger continues to evolve until it attains its final form in the very last episode, a nice touch. Another interesting note about the art would be how it looks much more akin to typical 80s anime (the main character almost looks identical to Saint Seiya), and it drops the defining Nagai character design. As much as I like Go Nagai character design, I can't help but feel like the characters look better, more fitting, in the anime than they did in the manga.The sheer brutality is another thing that really stood out. The show was quite violent, and in the first episode the main character watches his girlfriend get vaporized before his eyes. Human deaths are typically brutal, and when Jushin Liger destroys monsters it is extremely brutal and we see goo and body parts flying everywhere. The monster blood is green so I'm assuming that's why it is spilled so liberally. Although I'd label it as monster of the week, it was more like warzone of the week. Especially in the second half of the series, it felt like Japan was in constant warfare and under attack by demons 24/7. In stark contrast, the show is also big on sexual humor. If the main character isn't in combat, he's peeping on girls taking showers. So basically, lots of brutality and boobs. Pretty typical of Nagai stuff.All in all it was a great watch that I would sit through again. Maybe not as good as the greats of the genre but damn close. If you like Go Nagai manga/anime, you will at least be entertained by this. Really solid action series with top notch animation and a phenomenal soundtrack. and much more than a suit of armor. It doesn't excel in the character and plot departments, but it delivers awesome action and great episodes in spades. The story starts kicking right away and in the first episode we see the hero dawning the bio armor and fighting monsters. Characters basically appear out of nowhere and receive little development. It's the same way in the manga. But for me that didn't detract much, this show is all about delicious 80s vibes and monsters tearing each other to pieces. The characters aren't necessarily bad though, and in some cases do get development. There is a renegade-type henchman (fittingly enough he has blonde hair and wears red sunglasses) that by the end is a very different person, and one of the main character's sidekicks winds up being more than just the pointless goofball. Ryu (the renegade henchman) is the only character that stands out much on the antagonists side, and he was the most interesting character. As for the plot, it's pretty barebones stuff but we do see twists and turns here and there.Now for what makes this show a joy to watch: the action and the music. The incredibly awesome OPs and EDs are among the best, and the soundtrack itself is pretty much just as good. 80s guitar riffs galore, and seemingly always present. The amazing soundtrack is one of the defining parts of this series. Watching Jushin Liger rip and tear through the opposition never once gets old, and being a late 80s show the budget seems to be fairly high. There is minimal use of stock footage (aside from combination sequences) and in general everything looks very high quality. Another thing that helps maintain a high level of episodic quality and helps to hold your attention is that things are always changing. Jushin Liger gets several upgrades and and multiple forms, and as the show progresses we get pilots that use actual mecha to support Jushin Liger, and previously useless comic relief characters become pilots. It goes from just following the titular robot to eventually having a competent military force around with new characters. The Jushin Liger continues to evolve until it attains its final form in the very last episode, a nice touch. Another interesting note about the art would be how it looks much more akin to typical 80s anime (the main character almost looks identical to Saint Seiya), and it drops the defining Nagai character design. As much as I like Go Nagai character design, I can't help but feel like the characters look better, more fitting, in the anime than they did in the manga.The sheer brutality is another thing that really stood out. The show was quite violent, and in the first episode the main character watches his girlfriend get vaporized before his eyes. Human deaths are typically brutal, and when Jushin Liger destroys monsters it is extremely brutal and we see goo and body parts flying everywhere. The monster blood is green so I'm assuming that's why it is spilled so liberally. Although I'd label it as monster of the week, it was more like warzone of the week. Especially in the second half of the series, it felt like Japan was in constant warfare and under attack by demons 24/7. In stark contrast, the show is also big on sexual humor.

Lostorage Incited WIXOSS,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33197/Lostorage_Incited_WIXOSS,"['Disclaimer: This is the 3rd instalment of the WIXOSS and would advise watching Selector Infected and Spread beforehand. Spoilers for prequels in this.For a quick summary, skip to bottom paragraph.The chains that bind us the most closely are the ones we have broken.The ‘lost storage’ part of the title is some great wordplay as it can be substituted for lost memories which is what defines this anime. The protagonist in question Homura Suzuko has returned to her hometown only to find out she must participate in a WIXOSS game that involves LRIGS. Morikawa Chinatsu, a childhood friend who has experienced hard times with her...family’s financial position makes a declaration to Suzuko. Chinatsu without a moment’s hesitation firmly tells her to disappear as if she were unsightly. Chinatsu is adamant that she will regain happiness by severing all her ties with Suzuko, who is left stunned and speechless from their meeting.The WIXOSS game in this instalment has changed its rules, with the most noticeable one being that males are now participants this time round whereas in the prequels it was restricted to just females. The consequences for the game have changed dramatically, with winning and losing being dependant on the number of coins a LRIG user has. The LRIG user loses their personality and effectively dies when their coin’s total reaches to zero. The user’s LRIG takes possession of the former host’s body and continues life as planned. This is much like the LRIG switching bodies with their users once they became an eternal girl.Memories are the strongest themes associated with this version of WIXOSS. The notion that one would retain fond memories and try to block out unpleasant ones is the norm. The idea of altering undesirable memories is something that many would approve for due to its benefits involved. However, even when a LRIG user has obtained the 5 coins required to change a single memory, it never goes as planned as one has to reexperience that memory, which may prove to be repulsive for some as was the case for Mikage Hanna. Just like the other instalments it’s still a lose-lose situation with nothing but hardship and despair awaiting our participants.The bond that Suzuko and Chitose share goes back many years to the time they were still in elementary school. Personal circumstances dictated that they would not be reunited until sometime later but that didn’t stop Suzuko from keeping her in the back of her mind. The matching key-chain is a solid representation of their relationship, even though Chitose trampled on it declaring it was all over between them. Suzuko still was optimistic that their friendship could be restored and was genuinely concerned about her wellbeing.The girls have had their fair share of problems with Suzuko arguably having it the worst. The simple matter is she lost her mother during the separation stage and returned only because of her father’s work commitments. Meanwhile, Chitose’s family business went under with her family having to relocate most of the time due to the job insecurity involved. This doesn’t give the right for Chitose to act all obnoxious because of the fact she has suffered all this time. There was never a reason for Chitose to hate her knowing deep down she honestly liked her and saw her as the ideal friend.The antagonist this time is a man named Satomi who is known as the broker between the LRIG users. The shady man can set up matches for his clients who are desperate to earn some coins. The strange thing is that nobody suspected him of being a LRIG user this whole time. The fact is that LRIG users can identify each other within a certain radius but can’t detect him is baffling. I thought that all LRIG users had to carry their LRIG cards around but he never did which was surprising. It is known later that he challenges others to a battle when they are at a risk of being erased all together.To him, the act of ending one’s life is deemed to be irrelevant as he derives pleasure from the opposition’s anguish. The level of corruptness found in him was pitch black meaning he was a lost cause from the very beginning. The ability for him to nonchalantly carry out murders from a personality sense is made redundant when we find out it’s a former LRIG now in possession of the body. He wasn’t evil for the sake of being evil and I just found him to be a poorly written antagonist along with the plot conveniences.There is extra symbolism that needs mentioning. The LRIG template seen in the very beginning of the opening is an important discussion point. The white girl is the LRIG before users insert their personal memories into them. The template LRIG before then is a pure entity, meaning it has neither positive or negative memories. I would use the analogy of a new-born infant who enters the world as being sinless with nothing to be judged on. The LRIGs reflect the mental state of the user with Suzuko’s LRIG resembling Chinatsu and vice versa. The themes to be honest are a lot more engaging than the other aspects of the show such as the card battles which are secondary in nature.Now on to the technical aspects on the show, with the art style being quite different from its predecessor. The prequels had a design being dubbed dark moe which was true for those who sat through it. The art style is less moe than before but has much better character designs along with the fact you can’t have moe guys. There was a need to conform to a more traditional look even though the setting stayed relatively the same. The background art with some of it being CGI looks vastly improved in comparison to the prequels. The actual animation seems to have taken a decline in quality with it looking less fluid than before and more of an emphasis placed on still frames and such. There are also occasions of sloppily drawn characters which is just a minor gripe of mine.The sound by Maiko Iuchi (A Certain Magical Index, Heavy Object) was relatively tame compared to the other series she has produced music for. There was extensive electronic music used in this one which would be found mainly in the card battles. The tempo adjusts to the intensity of the scene which is determined by the situation involved. The voice actors did a decent job which was expected of them but Hashimoto Chinami who played Suzuko kind of irritated me with the prolonged “Chi-chan” cries making her sound like a child asking for forgiveness.TLDR: All in all, this was a relatively decent addition to the WIXOSS series but I find to be poorer in terms of script quality but in terms of thematic depth, it’s right up there with the characters holding it back. The production side to it felt adequate but feels like only the bare minimum being met in standards. The show is watchable but definitely has it faults here which is reflected in my score. family’s financial position makes a declaration to Suzuko.

It’s so bad to the point where the show feels like a giant depressing mess. There aren't many enlightening moments featured within the story, which makes a majority of the show a chore to watch. In addition to this the dialogue and characters do not feel fleshed out enough. Characters that are featured feel so one dimensional.They have the childhood friends who have become disconnected.  There is the insane main antagonist who cannot be...harmed until the end because of plot armor. Then lastly, we have the character, whom has morals, and a goal, yet falls flat during their big opportunity.  The biggest problem I had with them was that they lack any interesting qualities to their personalities.Of course the story goes back and tries to explain the past traumatic events to certain characters; which do in fact make the story and individual character a little more intriguing however, not to the point of complete satisfaction.Sometimes during the show I would think to myself, “Damn these guys need some Prozac.” However, I don’t even think that medication would help these crybabies and drama queens. The so called “drama” in the story is so cliché and repetitive that I found myself losing interest in the entire series.I would've liked to see the show branch out more and at least try and get out of the constant drama.I felt like the story needed that one fan service beach episode to enlighten the mood. This simply was not the case. One of the worst reoccurring themes in the story is the card battles. The overbearing drama coupled with the characters fear and lack of attitude that isn’t anger or depression took away the pleasure of watching the card game.This is how I interpreted the card battles,Suzuko: “wah wah, I can’t lose this battle; I only have one coin left, boo hoo.”Chinatsu:  (Unnecessary angry grunts and screaming) “I hate you; you need to disappear, derpa herp.”Kou: “Hee hee hee” (sucks crazy juice through a straw in the background) these dumb bitches are fighting for my amusement.”Hanna: ________ Attackuu, Coin betto, please recharge batteries... well she isn’t a robot but you get the picture.Rinse and repeat…Finally, during the girls' overly dramatic climatic battle; I couldn’t feel bad nor make any connections to the characters because they've been depressing and angry throughout the entire story. Flashbacks, intense moments of screaming & crying... yeah, they've been doing that through the span of the story. So why the hell would it make a difference now? Because it's the last episode? Of course.Overall the storytelling was terrible. It lacks refreshment and creativity. I felt like it focused too much on drama than the quality of anything else. I mean for Pete sake there was a damn suicide… lighten the story up just a little.Moving onto the art. The art and animation that Wixoss provides is pretty impressive, although I felt like there could've been improvements to background settings, most specially details in objects. There could’ve been more of an effort made to make background details livelier. The special effects were good.They’re noticeable and stand out in battle, which makes the action look great! Character designs were not that impressive. I’m mostly criticizing the outfit designs for the Lrig’s for lack of creativity.The soundtrack was pretty good. Maiko Iuchi & Yasumasa Koyama did a great job with sound effects and creating music that fit the tone of many of the battles. The voice actors do a good job of making their characters sound like whiny annoying high school students,  and one crazy adult... well, sadistic man-child.Overall there are many changes I would’ve liked to have seen during the show. Number one would be more action without the dialogue. I felt like every time a character had an opportunity to speak they would just ruin the simplicity of a card game battle by making everything so serious. Lastly I would’ve loved to have seen at least one beach episode to enlighten the overall mood of the show.Ultimately, I was so unimpressed with this entry in the Wixoss franchise that I gave it a well-deserved final score of 4/10. harmed until the end because of plot armor.

Despite the clunky explanations they gave it was still a clever and intimidating, the consequences mattered to the characters enough that the stakes were high. Lostorage changes it around so their memories are at stake, and while the downside is losing your memories and becoming an entirely different person, the upside is... the ability to change one of...your memories.How incredibly situational. In fact, if you want to change one of your memories you can just do that, that\'s how memory works. On top of that, the major conflict between the main characters feels incredibly forced.Art and Sound: 6I am a whelp and don\'t generally notice the art and sound in anime. The environment the battles take place in is pretty cool but gets old quickly. Nothing else popped out at me.Characters: 3This is where Lostorage really falls flat.Homura Suzuko - Suzuko is the ""main character"" of Lostorage but she really doesn\'t feel like it. We don\'t really get into her headspace all that much past the first few episodes and because of how the show works by not really explaining the card game much, it\'s difficult to see her growth. If anything, it seems like rather than improving at the game like Ruko from Selector, she learned how to make up rules as she goes along.Hanna Mikage - Hanna is a weird mix of the cute small character due to her hands always being in her sleeves and the cold analytical character due to her personality. While Hanna as the best reason for wanting to win the game, regaining the memories of what happened to her late little brother, she also has the most obnoxious speech quirk of stating a word that summarizes her sentences before saying them. An example would be a sentence like ""Suspicion. What are you doing here?"" which would be ok for a minor character, but she ends up becoming a major character in the story and it is incredibly grating.Shohei Shirai - Is a nice guy. This is pretty much the extent to his personality, he\'s just really nice and wants to get some memories back about soccer or something. He refuses to fight battles early on even though the rules this time around impose a time limit that needs to be upheld by battles, so I don\'t know what he thought the outcome would be. His effect in the story is basically just to make one character question her actions but not actually do anything.Chinatsu Morikawa - She\'s the secondary main character, or arguably even the main character in this show, but I saved her til now because holy crap does this character suck. I hope it\'s not a spoiler since it happens pretty early on that she effectively becomes a villain for most of the show. The issue with this is that her reasons are absolutely absurd. She wants to forget her memories of her childhood with Suzuko in order to ""become stronger."" It gets to the point where she has effectively killed people for this and she becomes completely irredeemable. I hate this character, she is an awful person for no reason.Kou Satomi - Here is the only good character. Satomi has a reasonably interesting backstory and is entertaining and expressive enough to be fun to watch.Unlike in Selector, the LRIGs are barely even characters. I guess it comes from them being a manifestation of their selectors\' memories rather than existing people with their own names and personalities, but there is no emotional connection there, no matter what the ending tries to dredge up.Enjoyment: 4I kept trying to like this show. I thought at the beginning that the concept was interesting, but that was because I thought that the winner of the battles got to change their opponents\' memories, which could have led to an interesting plot whereby the characters don\'t know what\'s real or and maybe we would have gotten an unreliable narrator. Instead the premise just makes the battles feel like more of a chore than anything. I like how Satomi abused the system for his own amusement, and I suppose it makes sense for the time limit to be there in that case, but the incentive to winning is mostly just not having to play the game anymore, which makes the show just feel empty, like the characters aren\'t really working toward anything, they just want it to be over.Overall: 4Lostorage is not a very good show, which is disappointing because I thought Selector was great. It got to the point where the intricacies of the game really should have been explained better. The coin betting mechanic they introduce was cool and made every player seem unique, but without a knowledge of Wixoss as a game it doesn\'t make a lot of sense. The final episode is full of cop-outs too and while I do like the ending scene, a lot of the emotional moments feel profoundly undeserved. your memories.How incredibly situational.

They seemed melodramatic and heavy handed, and somehow at the same time the story felt like the stakes were very low. All in all, it felt like a pretty cool idea hampered by some pretty blah execution. When I saw that there was a new season (series?) coming out, and that the name was somehow even crazier, I was like ""oh this is going to be awful and I can\'t wait to watch it!""I started this show...expecting to laugh at watching it fall painfully down the stairs, but I will be damned if I am not actually really enjoying it.Story: Anime had a baby with one of the darker Blocks of Magic the Gathering. Young people, originally just girls but now in the 3rd season suddenly boys too, have to play MTG in the Twilight Zone, but if they lose too many times shit goes downhill. It\'s more or less an attempt to make a serious anime out of the genre that contains shows like Yugioh, Beyblade, and Cardfight Vanguard. The first season felt like an amateurish attempt at that; this one feels like the concept has been refined into something much more ominous and engaging. There appear to be approximately 0 rules to the card game as well, but in a way that feels much quicker and not so bogged down in the mechanics as compared to Yugioh. Watching people play a children\'s trading card game gets boring fast. This is more like watching people slowly fall apart emotionally while playing a children\'s trading card game, which at least allows for some stakes and character development.Art: It all looks pretty good. Only pretty good though. The human characters are kind of bland and monochromatic, although in all honesty it kind of adds to the already noticeably bleak and melancholy atmosphere. The characters who are actually children\'s trading cards look significantly cooler, and the aesthetic of the card fights is both unique and attractive.Sound: Atmospheric and perfectly appropriate, although not particularly memorable. The opening song is also pretty bad (skip-worthy).Characters: In the first two seasons I though that they were silly; in this season I think they are actually mostly pretty good. There are still some characters who feel very artificial, and unfortunately the main character, Suzu, is among them. Some of the other main and supporting characters, particularly grumpy AF Chinatsu and certified weirdo Hanna, are fun and interesting, and seem to have believable motivations and real human reactions to difficult situations. Watching them struggle is both gripping and sympathetic.Enjoyment: Way more than I expected. If this had been lame, I was perfectly prepared to drop it after a couple episodes and never think of the series again. Instead I ended up writing an overly elaborate review for it and would recommend it to anyone who likes broody psychological stories and also wouldn\'t be bored to death by the idea of watching some kids play Magic. expecting to laugh at watching it fall painfully down the stairs, but I will be damned if I am not actually really enjoying it.Story: Anime had a baby with one of the darker Blocks of Magic the Gathering. Young people, originally just girls but now in the 3rd season suddenly boys too, have to play MTG in the Twilight Zone, but if they lose too many times shit goes downhill. It\'s more or less an attempt to make a serious anime out of the genre that contains shows like Yugioh, Beyblade, and Cardfight Vanguard. The first season felt like an amateurish attempt at that; this one feels like the concept has been refined into something much more ominous and engaging. There appear to be approximately 0 rules to the card game as well, but in a way that feels much quicker and not so bogged down in the mechanics as compared to Yugioh. Watching people play a children\'s trading card game gets boring fast.

Both sequel have the same genre that ranges from School, Psychological, Shoujo and drama, but, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS has a yuri element in it cu\'z it involves the relationship of two former childhood friends namely Suzuko Homura and Chinatsu Morikawa. Also, though both may be the same in one way they\'re still different in another way, in which it wouldn\'t be fair to say that one is the continuation of the other. Let\'s not forget that selector spread WIXOSS has a clean ending...and it wasn\'t much of a disappointment, while Lostorage Incited WIXOSS has somewhat a lot of loose ends, soooooo,Storywise, I\'ve rated it as a Mediocre 5, since it still has the same plot with some slight differences, when it comes to how both main characters got their start from being drafted in the WIXOSS game, and both have the same situation as to what them selector have to do, the only differences was that in the 1st WIXOSS the loser only gets to have her wish cursed and it was also not good for the winner since she get\'s taken over by the LIRG, while the 2nd WIXOSS the selector looses his or her memories and get\'s taken over by a LIRG, but nothing was known if the loosing selector becomes a LIRG, since at the end of this anime we the audience haven\'t seen any LIRG who is a guy and in fact I don\'t think that the antagonist itself is a guy at all, he is more like a female LIRG in a guy\'s body.Art, just like any anime with a school genre, I\'ve rated it as a mediocre 5, since we still see them characters in their  quintessential eye candy school uniform, and the LIRG\'s themselves, when it come to their attire were not that different from the LIRG\'s of the 1st WIXOSS.Sound, frankly, I have no comment as to which seiyuu voiced who, the rating ""good 7"" is for the opening theme.Characters, remember the loose ends I\'ve mentioned? Well, the characters themselves were the loose ends, namely:Suzuko Homura- ok, so she came back to Ikebukuro from Hokkaido due to family issues, what were her family issues we don\'t know that her loose end, also, her character suggests that she may be lesbian and wants to continue her relationship with Chi chan, but got sided when Chichan seemly tries to distance herself from her, don\'t get me wrong, but I like her her character is good but not very good.Chinatsu Morikawa- Suzu\'s childhood friend and pretty much a lesbian, her loose end is for us not know what were the memories she want\'s to forget, and foe her to forget Suzu was just too shallow for her to risk getting her ass in the hole of being a selector, though she got her wish, since Mel now has her body, her ending arc was the bitter part for me.Kou Satomi the bookkeeper, I\'d say that anime writer Michihiro Tsuchiya, did a good job of adding him as the main antagonist, his loose end was the details as how he came to be which is pretty unclear, and is he a LIRG in a man\'s body or is he a LIRG who came in to the real world  and became a man by choice? Either, it wasn\'t konw if we will be able to see him again in another WIXOSS sequel.Hanna Mikage- I can\'t understand as to why she has to be one of them selectors just to find out as to what has happen to her bother, when she can simply ask her mom or her oneechan.Shohei Shirai- I kind like that he traide in vain to save Chichan, too bad that he could have broken the Suzu X Chi yuri relationship.LIRG\'s , I have nothing much to say since their personalities  were merely the same as the 1st WIXOSS except in a different attire and capability.So with all that\'s been said , I give the characters a good 7.Enjoyment, it was good enough for me to keep following up this anime, but I just can\'t forgive that yuri element that this anime has, sure it maybe touching and nice, but it feels like that the ending was rushed and we\'re left as to why Chi chan want\'s to get rid of her memories, also what\'s up with the college of her choice that she has to throw a fit towards her folks? all we know was that she is now Mel. So, it was a good enough 7 , for this part.Overall, this anime has presented us with a bitter sweet ending, sweet cu\'z Suzu is still Suzu and is no longer a selector, same cannot be said for Chi chan, also this sequel hasn\'t given us a clean ending, so overall this is a fair 6, so, another sequel? Maybe. Honest.GROW!!!!!! and it wasn\'t much of a disappointment, while Lostorage Incited WIXOSS has somewhat a lot of loose ends, soooooo,Storywise, I\'ve rated it as a Mediocre 5, since it still has the same plot with some slight differences, when it comes to how both main characters got their start from being drafted in the WIXOSS game, and both have the same situation as to what them selector have to do, the only differences was that in the 1st WIXOSS the loser only gets to have her wish cursed and it was also not good for the winner since she get\'s taken over by the LIRG, while the 2nd WIXOSS the selector looses his or her memories and get\'s taken over by a LIRG, but nothing was known if the loosing selector becomes a LIRG, since at the end of this anime we the audience haven\'t seen any LIRG who is a guy and in fact I don\'t think that the antagonist itself is a guy at all, he is more like a female LIRG in a guy\'s body.Art, just like any anime with a school genre, I\'ve rated it as a mediocre 5, since we still see them characters in their  quintessential eye candy school uniform, and the LIRG\'s themselves, when it come to their attire were not that different from the LIRG\'s of the 1st WIXOSS.Sound, frankly, I have no comment as to which seiyuu voiced who, the rating ""good 7"" is for the opening theme.Characters, remember the loose ends I\'ve mentioned?

Maybe. Honest.GROW!!!!!!', 'Well looks like WIXOSS is plaguing new characters with new rules but the same old bleak outcomes.Lostorage Incited WIXOSS is by all means the same game and a somewhat continuation from the original Selector WIXOSS series what with it\'s several hints towards the fact. Lostorage Incited WIXOSS however does have differing themes towards it\'s original series what with it\'s new cast and main characters of Suzuko Homura voiced by Chinami Hashimoto and Chinatsu Morikawa voiced by Yuka Iguchi.Lostorage Incited WIXOSS\' characters are probably one of the better strengths due to it\'s development of it\'s core players, especially concerning Suzuko, Chinatsu and Hanna Mikage voiced by...Yuriko Kubo a genius at WIXOSS and a writer for a WIXOSS magazine. LA says this as Suzuko and Chinatsu brings in a theme of duality, one going through the WIXOSS game unscathed and peacefully, the other dragging other people to the twisted game and not caring what happens in order to win. Suzuko is by all means one of those protagonist who is unsure of herself due to her recently transferring schools, but at the same time trying to find her old best friend, Chinatsu. Chinatsu on the other hand experiencing many hardships and using WIXOSS to erase any of Suzuko\'s memories she had as a motivation. Suzuko and Chinatsu does bring in yuri undertones though not at first. Really Suzuko\'s and Chinatsu\'s development through WIXOSS are interesting contrasts to one another. LA will bring up the fact that sure Chinatsu goes down the ""evil just because"" and doesn\'t realize she\'s being played by the puppetmaster to the new WIXOSS game Kou Satomi voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura, but if going by the duality theme, she made a good anti-villain, although her decent into darkness is somewhat forcifully played at first to make her play her part AND her ignorance and motivations didn\'t really add up to show her true motivations. The other players of the WIXOSS game do have their motivations to win (the win function is different from the original series now, instead of having any wish you want, it\'s now about memory, but yes, the lose function is the SAME from the original) and given some character development to the characters and really it\'s not like the characters ""dies"", it\'s more like their ""personalities"" change to the point they might as well be new characters. Besides Kou Satomi having an impact towards the plot, Shouhei Shirai voiced by Shinsuke Sugawara, a friend of Chinatsu and Hanna Mikage get a more centralized focus in terms of character development, Hanna if anything is finding something about her own memory that she has forgotten and will win just to find out, she also essentially becomes Suzuko\'s mentor later on, on the other perspective, Shouhei DOESN\'T want to fight any battles and just try to live out the game by the newly added ""90 day time limit"" to the other new ""coin function"". Kou Satomi however is a different breed of character altogether, being a mysterious benefactor and bad influence towards Chinatsu and just Satomi in general being a puppetmaster to Lostorage Incited WIXOSS makes him both an interesting character and obviously suspicious character. Hanna Mikage however is probably one of the better developed characters, with her motivations, impact towards Suzuko along with her having a resolved plotline of her own and to make it better, her personality making her LA\'s favourite character in Lostorage Incited WIXOSS.Some flaws however...Lostorage Incited WIXOSS once again like it\'s predecessor doesn\'t really want to focus on the game it in real life is an actual card game trying to advertise to us and instead making a game where you\'ll lose everything just by playing and losing isn\'t good advertising material, Lostorage Incited also gets to some moments in the games they play where it felt like they did some illegal moves which compounded by the fact of the ""Coin Bets"" makes the rules even more confusing and sorta asspulling at times, the biggest offender going to Suzuko because she\'s the main protagonist and whatnot and we ""gotta keep the main protagonist alive"" and everything. But for the most part that is a more ""sins of the father"" flaw towards Lostorage Incited. The next problem is that once characters lose everything, again they don\'t necessary die in Lostorage, but once they do lose they become a pawn to Satomi and essentially lose focus towards them and sure the anime is more focused on Suzuko and Chinatsu dilemma, but nonetheless it then brings up the predictability to the results of some of the games at that. LA will bring up one more flaw but that a bit later...There are callbacks to the original series, mainly from the ruined WIXOSS stage shown as background throughout the anime thus saying it\'s a conituation from the original series, the other more obvious one being Piruluk voiced by Saori Oonishi from the original series returning, LA isn\'t saying that because it has callbacks it\'s bad, but it does makes Lostorage Incited WIXOSS a bit more interesting, LA main concern about this mainly coming from Satomi and where most of LA\'s speculation compounded by the callbacks came from.In terms of animation once again done by JC Staff, the animation has the same aesthetics to the original series overall and really the detailed backgrounding to the distinct character designs makes the characters easy to notice and easy enough to see that the character designs are pretty well done. The backgrounding especially in the new WIXOSS battlefield has quite the contrast to to the real world, what with it being ruined and rusty looking to contrast to the more colorful ""table cubes"" that the players fight on. Not much else to say but ok animation overall.In terms of voice acting, LA does have to commend Yuriko Kubo in voicing Hanna and Chinami Hashimoto did decently as the main protagonist, but LA does have to tip LA\'s hat to Yuka Iguchi in voicing Chinatsu, fine call her hamming up her vocals and being ""edgy and dark"" but that\'s just what LA kinda liked about Chinatsu as she drove deeper to the dark side and Yuka Iguchi\'s vocals were more or less perfect for this role, range is more or less why LA picked Yuka Iguchi as LA\'s favourite voice actor, Yuriko Kubo gets second place. However as much as Yuka Iguchi gets broad range, it\'s Yuuichi Nakamura that goes full out crazy with his vocals ESPECIALLY during the final episode if anything showing Satomi\'s hamminess up to MAX levels far out beatng Yuka Iguchi\'s ""edgy vocals"", it kind made sense since he\'s the major antagonist of this series, but still LA kinda liked found that it was making him the cheesy over the top villain by the end of it to the point LA can easily say that Yuka Iguchi\'s edgy vocals is on point compared to Yuuichi\'s haminess.The ending gave us a sorta satisfying yet depressing ending. Let\'s start with bringing back to Yuuichi\'s Satomi role into this is where Yuuichi both shined and detrimented Satomi by the end. Firstly, the final battle had it\'s flaws with the ""illegal moves?"" along with Satomi getting thrown into the mix as to LA\'s speculation lead LA...NOWHERE as he never tells us WHO he is at all, so LA\'s speculation and investment to this character went nowhere. Secondly, THE FINALE was where Satomi goes full out crazy with Yuuichi\'s hammy villainy vocals just makes the entire atmosphere comical than threatening if anything which brings up Satomi\'s detriments as a character, how he shined was that Yuuichi Nakamura was giving his all to this character but that\'s all LA is giving him. Where the satisfying yet depressing ending comes from is the aftermath with Suzuko and Chinatsu by the end of it which ""resolves"" things with these two characters and really reigns in LA\'s duality theme with these two characters and vaguely gives epilogues to the rest of the cast. The only plotline they left loose is with Satomi. Nonetheless, a satisfying yet depressing ending which is a plus for LA.Lostorage Incited WIXOSS may have the ""sins of the father"" flaws it had from it\'s original series, but Lostorage Incited WIXOSS still feels like it\'s own, what with it\'s new rules and new characters and if there was anything LA would commend Lostorage Incited for in which the original series didn\'t would be it\'s more focused characters and to be honest, it\'s more darker and depressing nature of the WIXOSS game it impacts on it\'s characters it takes itself in which the original really never went to. It\'s hard to compare Lostorage to it\'s Selector counterpart as they both have their flaws and their strengths, but if there was anything to go by for Lostorage Incited WIXOSS that made LA still carry on watching was it\'s greater detailed character development, the GREAT vocal talent and the massive amount of speculation that fueled LA to see what will happen next.

How to not tell a story, for example. And how to not develop characters."", 'After what for most, was the peak of Wixoss, Selector spread, came Lostorage incited. Now in all honestly, I found my self feeling a slight disappointment that the original characters were no longer to be found in this new series. HOWEVER, this disappointment was soon to be turned to into an endless flow of love for the new characters and hype for what\'s to come. Especially for the next season, since it was hinted at times, that the original characters would be returning at some point. For example in the anime opening, a scene of Mizushima Kiyoi, also known as piruluk-tan, who was originally the...LRIG (a person within a card, who a selector uses to battle another selector) of Akira (whom I like to call aki-lucky) was shown, in which she is human and her old LRIG form is flashed onto the screen momentarily. At this moment I was incapable of holding in my disbelief, and hope of a spectacular return of the original characters was reborn in me. As well as this, the now human Kiyoi becomes a crucial character later on, and especially in the next season, winning a spot as one of my favourite characters. Her nonchalant tone contrasting with her unyielding determination to end the chain of suffering after experiencing the pain of being a LRIG, established herself as an amazing character, who evolves even further in Lostorage Conflated. (fair amount of spoiler tbh but I don\'t think it affects enjoyment much)The MCs:But that\'s enough rambling when she isn\'t even one of the major main characters of this season. Now for Homura Suzuko, the main character of Lostorage incited. A girl much like Ruuko in terms of being warm and caring, however unlike her predecessor, she is bound by the childhood memories of her best friend Chinatsu Morikawa (aka Chi-chan, a very interesting character btw, I will get to her soon enough), who she has lost contact with. She starts off highly dependant on others, she spends each day replaying her memories of Chi and when she obtains the LRIG, Ril (whom she named based off a doll given to her by Chi-chan, Ril is another character I love) she is quick to turn to Ril for guidance and is soon unable to function properly without her. However, after the predictable yet impactful encounter with her best friend, Suzuko begins to change. Chinatsu, opposite to Suzu found her childhood memories painful, weighing her down and bringing unnecessary stress from trying to live up to Suzu\'s high expectations of her (I personally found it cool how Suzu\'s overeliant nature helped cause Chinatsu\'s change), along with other factors such as difficult living conditions, Chinatsu becomes twisted and seeks to use the wixoss battles to overwrite her childhood memories of Suzu and finally be free, no matter who she hurts along the way. Chinatsu is also a character I love dearly, she brought really dark or heart aching moments to the show, I found myself caring for and pitying Chi-chan despite her evil acts, which are generally rare coming from a show\'s main character. I wished for Suzu to be able to rescue her, Chi-chan was truly a tragic protagonist turned bad. To shorten what I could speak about forever, Suzu ultimately renews her passive nature and grows in confidence and strength alongside her trusted partner and friend, Ril, as she overcomes numerous wixoss battles in an attempt to bring Chi-chan back (who in her twisted state is being manipulated by a greater evil and the main villain Satomi Kou, more on him later), Suzuko\'s growth was one that really pleased me, bringing fresh air to the previous set of Wixoss characters and cleansing our pallet, so to speak, before the breathtaking finale season that is Lostorage Conflated.The battle system:With this new season came a new type of Wixoss battles. Instead of the previous reward and punishment of either being granted your wish or having the opposite of your wish occur, a selector (one who is part of the battles) is granted up to 5 coins representing their memories and a LRIG (the person within a card who a selector uses to battle another selector), who\'s personality and other aspects are formed based off of the selector\'s memories and experiences, for example Ril, knew all of Suzu\'s memories and acts in a stern yet caring way towards Suzu as a result (or at least that\'s what I believe). When battling a selector, winning means taking the opponents coin, which of course means the loser, has their coin taken along with the memories it represents. The stakes seem low compared to the previous seasons, right? That\'s what I thought too until I found that the loss of all a selector\'s coins mean they disappear from existence and their body is instead inhabited by the LRIG they once owned... I mean damn. Furthermore one of my favourite aspects of battling, coin betting was introduced, by offering to lose another of your coins if you lose the battle, a selector can use an ability specific to their LRIG, bringing a very fun aspect to selector battles raising the stakes of battles even more, I was very hyped when coins were bet, to the say the least. Oh yeah I completely forgot the reward hehe... Winning 5 coins means you get to change a memory in any way... Great reward to risk ratio am I right... WELL TOUGH Wixoss has never been about things being fair and balanced, the cruelty of selector battles is emphasised by this reward in my opinion. I\'d imagine, merely being able to survive these battles if I were in a selectors position would be a tremendous relief. Once again the old way of battles has evolved after Ruuko (the previous protagonist) fought Mayu and supposedly destroyed the wixoss battles, only for the battles to be reborn as an even more convoluted way of torturing humanity. The idea of the build up of humanity\'s negative emotions resulting in the wixoss battles was an idea which impressed and intrigued me deeply. To me it made great sense, where would the strong feelings of stress, sorrow, anger and hate, go in the world? Would they just simply disappear with time? No, it makes much more sense to me that these strong emotions result in something befitting of the pain everyone had suffered because of them. What else than the birth of the new selector battles which force innocent people into a cruel battle for their precious memories, birthing more pain and suffering and continuing what Kiyoi calls \'the endless cycle of darkness\'. Once again I\'ll stop myself from rambling further on about this.(i forgot to mention that coins disappear over time if no battles occur, so avoiding battles is not an option for the selectors)Satomi Kou, villain:Satomi kou is a man, who was previously a LRIG and is now inhabiting the body of his previous owner, who I assume lost all their coins. He is known to selectors as the bookmaker, since he runs a service where he sets up battles between selectors who have signed a contract with him so as to ensure they have selectors to battle before their coins disappear on their own. However, the battles they get set up with are compulsory, even if they did not want to battle for whatever reason. Kou finds the torment and pain selectors experience stimulating. He prides himself in setting up selector battles to produce the maximum amount of despair. It is his revenge against the selectors who heartlessly used their LRIGS like tools, as well as his twisted method of fulfilling himself. He recruits Chinatsu as a subordinate to carry out this despair, I found it heartbreaking watching Kou\'s venomous nature seep into Chi-chan, as she recruits innocent selectors into the bookmaker\'s trap. On a final note I really enjoyed observing Kou\'s sadistic nature as he guides selectors to their dooms (the faces he makes are especially breathtaking in my opinion lol)I decided to review Lostorage incited, specifically because it is the least liked of Wixoss\' seasons, I wanted to project how amazing I found the characters (many of which I haven\'t mentioned), and how well this season performs in both following Selector spread, which could have been a finale in itself, as well as setting up perfectly for the true finale, Lostorage conflated, which was able to win me over and choose the Wixoss series as my favourite anime despite it\'s obscurity and unpopularity.I wish more people would share the same love for Wixoss as I do (If you wanna help you could... i dunno maybe rate every Wixoss season a 10 or another high score (;  or don\'t, just a thought... please do it!)Extra Notes:I found it so satisfying whenever Ril and Suzu bet a coin and went ""coin bet! HONEST!""The contorted evil faces the characters made at times were amazing, Kou and Chi-chan making them were to be expected since they were more on the evil side, but then Ril makes one too, ahh it got me good.When the selector who lost his sister (his name eludes me, guess I should rewatch Wixoss) was fighting Kou and fell into a blind rage and then disappeared whilst crying , it was a very heart touching moment for me, a character who isn\'t too relevant being able to make me tear up is a rare thing indeed, well done wixoss, well done indeed.The disappearance of the boy who liked chinatsu was a tragic one too, sighhThe WIXOSS OPENINGS ARE ALL FIRE, opening 1, killy killy joker is my favourite, opening 4 unlock is a close second, and 3rd is opening 2 girls rondo worlds end, funnily the lostorage incited op is the lowest of the 4 openings but it\'s still an opening very dear to me, I cant help but headbop to the wixoss openings.oh yeah when chinatsu tells suzu not to give up, ""Suzu Gamba *smiles*"" warms my heart every time i think about it, I use it as a charm when the going gets tough, always works lol.The character Hanna is also an amazing one but I don\'t wanna speak forever so i\'ll stop.Man I love talkin about wixoss. LRIG (a person within a card, who a selector uses to battle another selector) of Akira (whom I like to call aki-lucky) was shown, in which she is human and her old LRIG form is flashed onto the screen momentarily. At this moment I was incapable of holding in my disbelief, and hope of a spectacular return of the original characters was reborn in me. As well as this, the now human Kiyoi becomes a crucial character later on, and especially in the next season, winning a spot as one of my favourite characters. Her nonchalant tone contrasting with her unyielding determination to end the chain of suffering after experiencing the pain of being a LRIG, established herself as an amazing character, who evolves even further in Lostorage Conflated. (fair amount of spoiler tbh but I don\'t think it affects enjoyment much)The MCs:But that\'s enough rambling when she isn\'t even one of the major main characters of this season. Now for Homura Suzuko, the main character of Lostorage incited. A girl much like Ruuko in terms of being warm and caring, however unlike her predecessor, she is bound by the childhood memories of her best friend Chinatsu Morikawa (aka Chi-chan, a very interesting character btw, I will get to her soon enough), who she has lost contact with. She starts off highly dependant on others, she spends each day replaying her memories of Chi and when she obtains the LRIG, Ril (whom she named based off a doll given to her by Chi-chan, Ril is another character I love) she is quick to turn to Ril for guidance and is soon unable to function properly without her. However, after the predictable yet impactful encounter with her best friend, Suzuko begins to change. Chinatsu, opposite to Suzu found her childhood memories painful, weighing her down and bringing unnecessary stress from trying to live up to Suzu\'s high expectations of her (I personally found it cool how Suzu\'s overeliant nature helped cause Chinatsu\'s change), along with other factors such as difficult living conditions, Chinatsu becomes twisted and seeks to use the wixoss battles to overwrite her childhood memories of Suzu and finally be free, no matter who she hurts along the way. Chinatsu is also a character I love dearly, she brought really dark or heart aching moments to the show, I found myself caring for and pitying Chi-chan despite her evil acts, which are generally rare coming from a show\'s main character. I wished for Suzu to be able to rescue her, Chi-chan was truly a tragic protagonist turned bad. To shorten what I could speak about forever, Suzu ultimately renews her passive nature and grows in confidence and strength alongside her trusted partner and friend, Ril, as she overcomes numerous wixoss battles in an attempt to bring Chi-chan back (who in her twisted state is being manipulated by a greater evil and the main villain Satomi Kou, more on him later), Suzuko\'s growth was one that really pleased me, bringing fresh air to the previous set of Wixoss characters and cleansing our pallet, so to speak, before the breathtaking finale season that is Lostorage Conflated.The battle system:With this new season came a new type of Wixoss battles. Instead of the previous reward and punishment of either being granted your wish or having the opposite of your wish occur, a selector (one who is part of the battles) is granted up to 5 coins representing their memories and a LRIG (the person within a card who a selector uses to battle another selector), who\'s personality and other aspects are formed based off of the selector\'s memories and experiences, for example Ril, knew all of Suzu\'s memories and acts in a stern yet caring way towards Suzu as a result (or at least that\'s what I believe). When battling a selector, winning means taking the opponents coin, which of course means the loser, has their coin taken along with the memories it represents. The stakes seem low compared to the previous seasons, right? That\'s what I thought too until I found that the loss of all a selector\'s coins mean they disappear from existence and their body is instead inhabited by the LRIG they once owned... I mean damn. Furthermore one of my favourite aspects of battling, coin betting was introduced, by offering to lose another of your coins if you lose the battle, a selector can use an ability specific to their LRIG, bringing a very fun aspect to selector battles raising the stakes of battles even more, I was very hyped when coins were bet, to the say the least.

When I heard of another season of the anime, I was ecstatic. However Lostorage Incited Wixoss was not a patch on the previous two seasons.Story (5/10):The story itself fell short for me. It was all too dramatic, it didn't make any sense or make for an enjoyable viewing. The characters emotions seemed like they were exaggerated to make a plot. In terms of the games, the way they changed it with the game revolving around a selector's memories seemed good at the beginning but as the season went...on there wasn't the same feeling about the games. There wasn't the same worry, it didn't seem as big of a deal if you lost or won like it did with Selector Infected/Spread. While some parts of the plot were fun to watch, overall it just seemed messy and like the writers didn't know where they were going with it.Art (6/10):Not much to say about the art, it was okay nothing appalling in my opinion. But then again nothing memorable either.Sound (5/10):The music was really disappointing. The title sequence was forgettable and not even worth watching. I loved the title sequence's for the past two seasons, with Kanon Wakeshima singing both. They were both great, and it was so disappointing that with Lostorage the music is just so forgettable and not even worth listening to.Character (5/10):The two main characters, Suzuko and Chinatsu, were pretty bland. Their friendship was interesting, and I thought Chinatsu's story was interesting in regards with her family life and how she struggles to be the best at everything. Suzuko was sweet but there was no real background and I just didn't really seem to care. I was happy to see a range of selectors in the sequence, thinking that the season may not just focus on two people but a range. It didn't. Other charcter's like Rio or Shohei were only touched on and kinda faded into the background. Even the LRIG's seemed more boring this time, there was no real personality to any of them.Enjoyment (6/10):As much as there was to pick at and complain about, I still enjoyed it. The basic premise was the same from the previous seasons and that's what I loved. It still had me on the edge of my seat at some battles and there were many great moments within the show.Overall (6/10):I would suggest you watch Selector Infected/Spread, not only to give you a little background on the universe but also as in my opinion they are much better than Lostorage. I am a little dissapointed with this in comparison to previous seasons but I still enjoyed it, and I hope they'll improve it with the next season. on there wasn't the same feeling about the games.

It wasn't particularly the anime that I've enjoyed the most but it somehow managed to get entertaining and being an overall passable anime.The main story about this friendship getting torn apart got completely dramatized in my opinion, generating such conflict...over a misunderstood perception of friendship I'd say was unnecessary. But in the end, the dependence they both have for each other ends up being something good. They both end up being someone they look up to. It really ends up showing some values to put it in a way. The side stories were not that bad either and it got interesting seeing the character development shown in this anime. Although this didn't quite incite me to continue with the rest of the seasons, I'd overall rate it a 7. over a misunderstood perception of friendship I'd say was unnecessary.

It\'s almost too kind to call it a train wreck because that would imply that there was some velocity; something good about this anime to begin with.The show was completely bland, uninteresting, and uninspired until around episode 8 or 9 where we finally get some of the payoff scenes I had grown to expect from the franchise. Sadly enough however, this rising tension and emotional buildup were not sustained through to the end, as it eventually just goes back to being the same uninspired trash that the series had been up to that point. It was just a flash in...the pan that got my hopes up for nothing.Lostorage Incited Wixoss felt uninspired compared to the original. Shallow characters across the board, not to mention the boring protags and one of the most generic bad guy characters I\'ve ever seen felt like a major step back compared to how good and genuine the characters were in Selector Infected. It was very difficult to feel any sense of sympathy for the trials these characters suffered because they were just that shallow. This lack of character building is the hugest differentiation between this and the original series. The original series put time and effort into making you care about the characters, which in turn gave the plot meaning. In this type of story, if the writers don\'t nurture an emotional attachment to the characters, then the story does not really have any weight to it.To put it in the most basic terms, how can the authors expect me, the viewing audience, to care if the characters lose their memories? The backstory given to the side characters was glossed over at best, most of the time being non-existent. I felt bad for their suffering only out of principle.The main characters, even though they got more attention, were almost worse than the side characters. Basically just one girl fighting for the ""power of friendship"" and the other fighting to lose the ""weakness of friendship."" Yes, it actually is THAT nauseatingly edgy.Everything else was ok I guess. Soundtrack was passable I suppose. Nothing really stood out. Animation was very lazy at points. If I had a nickel for every time they reused shots of the stairs and brewing machines in the coffee house, I\'d probably have... a couple bucks?... Okay, maybe not the best analogy, but it was lazy. No excuses.Surprisingly, I actually liked the ending of the series. Not the final battle, that was complete bullshit, but the actual conclusion of the story was actually kind of sweet. As generic as it was, it still put a smile on my face and made the entire journey up to that point almost feel worth it.One other thing I have to point out though, something that really pissed me off, is how they just seemed to make up the rules of the game as they went in this one. While neither this anime or the series that came before it explain the actual rules of Wixoss, they still set the parameters for the rules of the survival game they are playing. That\'s not the case in Lostorage Incited Wixoss. The coin system and how betting coins worked wasn\'t fully explained, which made it difficult to understand the risk of betting your coins.Along these lines, as a competitive tcg player, I was mortally disappointed to see yugioh-esque ""gotcha!"" tactics being used.

While it doesn't live up to its predecessors, it certainly gave the dark fantasy vibes that define wixoss itself.

The second main character, Chinatsu (arguably felt more important than the actual MC), was the bitchy type character that wanted to cut her ties with the MC for...some stupid reason (honestly her change in attitude felt so forced) and magically turned good at the end because you know, its the final episode and the genius writer just wanted to sort of resolved the problem with no solution whatsoever.

The story, while minimal, is charming and does a wonderful job of illustrating each character.  The art is fantastic.  You can really appreciate the effort put into it, and the colors and scenes were close to breathtaking.  The soundtrack is ever memorable, though nothing new.  And of course, each member of the...primary ensemble makes their appearance.  Zenigata's parts are written with aplomb, and the man in the iron mask was a great touch that genuinely had me guessing until the end.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

But even if I don't know which category Re: Stage fits into, I would say there are enough reasons for any Idol anime fan to watch and enjoy this it.The story is pretty basic: girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(AS AWAYS). Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ was definitely the seasonal anime I enjoyed most, one of my most favorite one\'s so far.CGDCT + music is always a great combination.

The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it. Give it a try at least for the above average treatment this anime has received. but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

But even if I don't know which category Re: Stage fits into, I would say there are enough reasons for any Idol anime fan to watch and enjoy this it.The story is pretty basic: girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(AS AWAYS). Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it. Give it a try at least for the above average treatment this anime has received. but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

But even if I don't know which category Re: Stage fits into, I would say there are enough reasons for any Idol anime fan to watch and enjoy this it.The story is pretty basic: girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(AS AWAYS). Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it. Give it a try at least for the above average treatment this anime has received. but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

But even if I don't know which category Re: Stage fits into, I would say there are enough reasons for any Idol anime fan to watch and enjoy this it.The story is pretty basic: girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(AS AWAYS). Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it. Give it a try at least for the above average treatment this anime has received. but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

But even if I don't know which category Re: Stage fits into, I would say there are enough reasons for any Idol anime fan to watch and enjoy this it.The story is pretty basic: girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(AS AWAYS). Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it. Give it a try at least for the above average treatment this anime has received. but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

But even if I don't know which category Re: Stage fits into, I would say there are enough reasons for any Idol anime fan to watch and enjoy this it.The story is pretty basic: girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(AS AWAYS). Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it. Give it a try at least for the above average treatment this anime has received. but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage.Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.About the story and the characters:""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor.

Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too.

But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems.

The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.The bond of the six girls together is very strong.Top idol music:The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live.Re:Stage!

Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice.

It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical.

When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ\'s is my favorite idol group.

Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones\'s? Why should I watch an idol anime again?I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since...you will discover many similarities.If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power.If you haven\'t watched anything like this one before, give it a try.

At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn\'t reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one.

For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them.Although there aren\'t many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music.

Let\'s hope there will be a second season so we can see our girls on the Prism Stage!Thank you for reading!', ""There aren't many idol animes out there that is why having a new one pop out is A BLESSING, well at least for me, i'm a shoujo fan so yeah.First off, i don't really write reviews that much, i only review those underrated animes like this one. I wanna say that this anime is sooo goooooddd, the art and everything, the performances too, and lemme ask you this, do you hate when they use CGI to idol characters when they perform? If yes, well i do too but this anime will NOT disappoint you, i was really expecting this one to have CGI as well...but i was wrong, i was really really suprised and happy that they didn't use CGI when all the girls perform that is why you gotta give this one a shot. but i was wrong, i was really really suprised and happy that they didn't use CGI when all the girls perform that is why you gotta give this one a shot."", ""This anime is based from the game. I learned that recently and honestly, the anime adaptation is really great. Especially the art. It has a cg opening sure but unexpectedly, most of their performance does not use cg throughout the season. The songs are great, I kind of wish they have a merch and characters are cute too. Each one has her own style of cuteness and attributes. The story though is pretty mediocre but nonetheless, I enjoyed watching it.Art style of anime is great, even when they aren't performing. Re: Stage! has five main groups but only three of them mainly made a...performance; the other two made an appearance but only for a while and didn't perform. I wish this anime had more audience though. Here's hoping for season 2; hopefully we'll see more of the other two groups if ever season 2 was announced? performance; the other two made an appearance but only for a while and didn't perform.

But even if I don't know which category Re: Stage fits into, I would say there are enough reasons for any Idol anime fan to watch and enjoy this it.The story is pretty basic: girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(AS AWAYS). Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some,...but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing. The character design is unique, kawaii and well made. The animation is good and all the dances have been mostly 2D(some distant shots are CGI but isn't bad). The show also have a lot of cute and fun moments provided by this visual quality. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims and as I said some distant dance shots). The backgrounds are good.The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad.The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. There are several eccentric characters in the series that even if they have no special characteristics, give the anime a special spice. Inside Kirare the 6 girls split into 3 affinity subgroups that have excellent chemistry (although this slightly harms the overall chemistry).It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical. The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it. Give it a try at least for the above average treatment this anime has received. but mostly standard character developments and some slightly sad moments that some people can connect with.The art is amazing.
