Wanwan Sanjuushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3761/Wanwan_Sanjuushi,"['Guessing from the lack of reviews, I will assume this series was a sole phenomenon in Portugal, and maybe Spain?The Dogtanian ""Dartac√£o"" opening song was such a hit here that every kid and adult knew how to sing it or as least hum the melody. The opening YouTube video in Portuguese has 712,378 views, and it\'s only one of the many ones.The series was created by Claudio Biern Boyd. The 26 episodes were produced in 1981 by the Spanish international BRB and the Japanese Nippon animation.It\'s a faithful adaptation of Alexandre Dumas\' novel ""The Three Musketeers"", although it has some different details such as the...protagonists being dogs or the protagonist\'s beloved being called Juliet instead of Constance. One can be sure that this series inspired many cartoons and was highly influential to the now famous ""Beastars"". Nah, just kidding.This series premiered in Portugal in 1983 on Saturday mornings. It quickly became a success, being repeated several times in a public main channel. In the beginning of the 90s, it was repeated and also on another private channel in 1995.All in all it was a light-hearted and very entertaining series with a classic good vs evil theme. protagonists being dogs or the protagonist\'s beloved being called Juliet instead of Constance.

I just rewatched it again recently to live out my youth and it is still as good as I remember. However, I feel like it's something you can only truly enjoy if you have the nostalgia with it.Story: 10/10I always loved the story, it's a take on a book written by Alexandre Dumas from the 1800s. I think it is portrayed well and the pacing of the story is also very good. It is not rushed and seems very well thought out. Though,...I have never read the original book so I have no idea how loyal it is, but as a standalone it is great. The different plot points are awesome.Art: 9/10I rate it highly due to nostalgia but the animation is quite simplistic and inconsistent. Though I think that adds to it's charm. The backgrounds are all very beautifully drawn and the character designs are also great.Sound: 10/10The music in this is AMAZING! I have ALWAYS loved the theme tune and it is so catchy. All of the background music is also perfect. Would highly recommend just for that on it's own. The voice acting could have been a little better, as a few characters sound stale, but I think it works fine. I only saw the English dub, it being on when I was younger, so I am not sure if it is the same with the Japanese dub.Character: 10/10I ADORE the characters in this! Again, may just be nostalgia talking, but I think they are all very unique and thought out, all with different personalities. The villains in this are also amazing and I adore them.Enjoyment: 10/10Honestly, there is nothing I would change about this whole experience. It is an amazing watch. Perhaps the voice acting for some characters could have been better, but I only saw the English dub so no idea how it plays out in Japanese.Overall: 10/10An amazing show, but only truly enjoyable if you watched it as a child, and are now revisiting it. I had no idea it was counted as anime until I saw it pop up on this site, so that is also really cool. I highly recommend you watch it. It is very child-like, as it is meant for small children, but the designs and story are really good still. I would personally recommend the English dub, but I'm sure Japanese or any other dub is good too.

by the Japanese anime Studio company Nippon animation which I guess this is an Anime this series premiered in Japan on October 9th 1981 which is before Ulysses 31 premiered on October 10th 1981 and it

director Hayao Miyazaki because it's very good.Sound 10/10The sound is good I like the music in this particular series however I mean if you watch it and its original Spanish dub of this Classic series like dogtanian and the three muskehounds however it plays the Spanish theme song with opened the Spanish dub of the original anime performed by Popitos the music is composed by Katsuhisa Hattori who is known for Fist of the North Star which is in the Japanese dub of the anime but the music for the English dub of Dogtanian and the three Muskehounds is composed by italian music composers Guido and Maurizio de Angelis which are known for their songs for the Terence Hill and Bud Spencer movies and other work.Characters 10/10The characters are great in this particular Classic series most of the characters are like anthropomorphic dogs especially for the character like dogtanian which is basically how it's designed which is kind of similar to Snoopy from Charles M Schulz

And this one so happens to be one of the most popular anime shows in Portugal. Right alongside with Tom Sawyer, Heidi, Maya The Bee and of course, Dragon Ball.Dogtanian and the three Muskehounds (Or Wanwan Sanjuushi as it\'s called in japan) is an anime show made in 1981 by both Nippon Animation and BRB International. It\'s based off the novel ""The three Musketeers"" by Alexandre DumasEver since it\'s airing on european televisions in the 1980s, it became an huge hit to the point of getting it\'s...own merchandises. It even received a sequel made years later known as ""The Return of Dogtanian"". Which takes places years after the events of the anime. As well as we are given a CGI animated movie released in 2021.However, we\'re not gonna go too deep into the franchsie itself, but rather the anime show that started it all. Which is why you\'re here in the first place.So, how much this anime holds compared to what it did back in the days? Let\'s find out:The story, like i mentioned, is based off The three Musketeers as it follows the story of the novels pretty well. Dogtanian goes to paris to become a muskehound and does what he knows best. Helping out thoses in need to prevent any incidents ever happening.While the obvious difference here is that the characters became anthropormorthic animals, the key difference between this anime and the Duma\'s novels is that the character traits of Athos and Porthos are interchanged. Porthos became the secretive noble of the group while Athos became extrovert.So far, aside the changes to the characters, the anime does a pretty good job following the anime pretty well. Telling the story of The three Musketeers faithfully.So no issues with the story here.As for the animation, even though this is a co-production between BRB International and Nippon Animation, Nippon Animation handled the entirety of the show with the animation throughout 26 episodes.With that said, i have to say that the animation is pretty great for 1981. You get lots of details on certain areas and locations of France and the fight scenes look pretty good as well. Very detailed and fun to look at. The character designs are good as well. Each of the characters are given some nice looks on their outfits and designs as animals. Even Juliette doesn\'t look that bad but rather decent, as well.Them you have the characters. Again, just like the story, the characters are also fun to watch and follow.You have Dogtanian, who\'s the main protagonist of the series, who\'s very brave and not afraid of taking challenges againts thoses who get in his way to become a musketeer.You also have the musketeers like Athos, Porthos and Aramis. Athos is more of the strongest of the three musketeers and enjoys drinking and eating alot. he can be a goofball at times while Aramis is more of a gentle swordman who enjoys reading books (especially the bible) and does poems to women anytime he\'s in a conversation with them and then you have Porthos, who\'s more of a bravest of the group who does anything he can to stop any bad guys anytime he sees them.There are also other characters that do serve purposes to the story of the anime. You have Juliette who would later become Dogtanian\'s love interest and the small mouse named ""Pip"", who would appear later in the show as Dogtanian\'s sidekick that would help and advice him what he should think isntead of resorting into using his sword to attack.And then you have the villains of the anime. First you have Rochefort, who would become Dogtanian\'s first enemy he fought againts, who spies on each of him and his musketeers and does anything he can to take them down.There\'s also Vidimer, who\'s mostly a comic relief who tries so hard to put a stop to them by coming up with many plans. From making booby traps on them to even disguise himself as a girl just to trick them and basically, he fails at everything. he\'s quite an hilarious character, by the way.There\'s also Milady, who also plans to kill Dogtanian and his musketeers with her schemes that she comes up with. Quite a gorgeous neko girl.And finally, you have the prime minister of France himself, Cardinal Richelieu. Who wants to have the power to control King Louis. He\'s the one who orders both Rochefort, Vidimer and Milady to do anything it takes to take Dogtanian and his musketeers down. But sadly, he gets frustrated because it never goes the way he wants it to be.There are a few more that i would like to talk about, but i just felt like theses characters i mentioned here are makes the story important.Now for the sound. Like i did with Vickie The Viking, i watched the PT-PT dub of the anime since it\'s the only one available on Youtube and the one that i\'m mostly familiar with. Never watched the Japanese dub, although i heard a few things about the anime that makes the sound of the anime different here. So i will check them out and update this review whenever i can. But for now, here\'s my thought on the sound:The music is probably my least favourite part of the anime. Mostly because it re-uses the same score as the opening theme song of the spanish version but with different composition. I mean, it\'s nice to hear the opening theme song since it brings so much joy of watching this anime as a kid again, but when you start repeating the same song but with different scoring, it gets annoying alittle too much.The sounds are pretty good. You get some unique sound effects added when it comes to fighting scenes which makes it more interesting and fun to listen, to.And for the voice acting, or the Portuguese dub that i watched which was done by National Films, it\'s pretty good to a certain degree. On one hand, i\'m impressed with how many voice actors did great performances for each of the characters. Milady\'s PT-PT voice by Maria Emilia Correia really gives a soothing and beautiful voice for an already beautiful catgirl. While Ant√≥nio Montez did a splendid job at making the voice of Aramis in a beautiful and wonderful way. Giving him a very kind and gentle voice for an already kind and gentle musketeer. May Ant√≥nio rest in peace.So yeah, i think everyone did a good job at voicing the characters in the PT-PT dub. But Dogtanian\'s PT-PT voice actor on the other hand? Ehhhh, i don\'t know, man, it\'s not that the actor that voices Dogtanian, Jo√£o Louren√ßo, did a terrible job at it. Quite the opposite, he did a good job as well, but i just don\'t think his voice fits for that character because from what i know about Dogtanian, he\'s a child. He\'s supposed to have a more child-like voice, so hearing Jo√£o do an adult voice for him just sounds pretty off even for a great performance.But other than that one instance, i think the dub still holds up very well. Given that it was done in 1983 and it\'s the only dub that is still available to watch after so many years is just as impressive as the PT-PT dub of all things Dragon Ball, except much better.But yeah, so that\'s Dogtanian and the three Muskehound. Overall, i think this show still holds up to this day after 40 years. The story is outstanding, the art and animation is great, the characters are very memorable, the sound is good, but the music needs a little more work, the dub is still pretty good to a certain degree and bottom line, i had a great time watching this classic gem.If you\'re a fan of literature-based shows who wants to watch a great adaptation of The three Musketeers, i highly recommend this anime. There\'s also the english dub for this anime, too. Not sure what it sounds like, but if you live in an english speaking country and want to watch this show in it\'s english dub, go to youtube and there you go. Have fun with this one. You won\'t regret it.This may be an autracious rating i\'m going to give, but i definitely want to give it a 9 out of 10. This anime is definitely better than Mickey, Donald and Goofy: The three Musketeers. Now that\'s a fact that cannot be proven wrong.Now there\'s actually yet another three musketeers anime that also aired in japan and other countries during the 80s and 90s, as well. It\'s called ""Anime Sanjuushi"". This one is meant to be a much more serious adaptation than the more kid friendly one that i saw. Not sure how that one holds compared to this, but i will definitely check it out sometime in the future once i get around it.Anyway, that\'s my review of Dogtanian and the three Muskehounds, i hope you enjoyed my review for this anime and i\'ll see you guys next time. ;) own merchandises.

Working'!! Announcement Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10532/Working_Announcement_Specials,"[""Working!! was greatly popular at its release time in 2010, and its sequel in 2011. The cast's zany and fun attitudes towards one another, and their hilarious daily lives, it makes you want to be them.This was the announcement for the 2nd season and the possibility of a spin-off, or WWW.Working!! (which is just as hilarious). The first was a simple April fools joke about their upcoming show, with the characters from WWW.Working!! and the second is a true announcement on the second season, to continue their fun adventures on trying to help Inami get over her Androphobia. This announcement put a smile on...my face. And no, I don't speak Japanese (this is unsubbed), but just the characters interactions made this a fun little project.As it's 2018 now, it's safe to say that Wagnaria has reached its final season, in the Working!!! franchise, yes, it's sad but true. However I still have high hopes for a 2nd season of it's spin-off.Thanks for reading my review, cheers! my face.

X OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/595/X_OVA,"[""X is basically about an underground war between two opposite, er, cults. It's all very dramatic, sweeping, and extravagant, but I felt that this movie had unfulfilled potential. For example, the story was fascinating, but the ending, while dramatic enough to suit such a fantastical film, was ultimately unsatisfying and made useless all that effort taken to build the audience's interest in the plot. Expect a great deal of angst along with themes of sacrifice, duology, etc. It's not a light anime. The art is pretty and elaborate, typically CLAMP. Each character is painstakingly drawn and varies widely in age (which is nice). I don't...particularly remember the music, but the same composer produced the X TV music (which was a grand orchestra score very suited to a war in a magical/fantasy setting), so it can't be bad. I would have liked to delve more into each character's story, but not bad for a movie. particularly remember the music, but the same composer produced the X TV music (which was a grand orchestra score very suited to a war in a magical/fantasy setting), so it can't be bad.

Venus Senki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/544/Venus_Senki,"[""Venus wars is to me a classic, Its not very very good but I watched it many years ago and by the standart back then it was quite good.Probably not the best choice for younger fans who cant stomach the outdated animation but it is a fine example of 80's sci fi anime.Its a decent quick watch, and a peek into the 80's, the golden era of anime, and by this I mean it's better than 90% of modern animes easily... "", ""If you want a gritty war anime full of tanks, look no further! This sci fi ova embodies the charm of 80s anime; though very flawed, the aesthetics and love put into its making is enough for an enjoyable watch.The premise is sound if not a bit basic. Humans have colonised Venus (out of all the planets in Sol) but thanks to ecological disasters, it is a backwater hellhole far from the supposed utopia of this world's Earth. Its people have a reckless, fatalistic and at times apathetic view towards life and peace (the ridiculously deadly bike racing games they have!). The nation Ishtar launches...a surprise attack on Aphrodian's capital, Io and conquer it in one day. The anime then chronicles a bike racing gang's involvement in the war to recapture Io. The simple plot is made up for by a sense of scale. There is a huge array of futuristic armoured fighting vehicles with the combined arms firepower that lays waste to the massive industrial complex of Io. Rarely in anime will you see such gratuitous scenes of warfare! There is more attention to detail than you'd think. The only aircraft are all prop driven as jet aircraft do not work in Venuses' atmosphere.At the same time, while one and a half hours is enough to craft a rich geopolitical thriller and a dose of history on top of the basic story, we only get a couple of basic anti war and totalitarian messages. The government is pretty corrupt and incompetent; that's always fun!Instead, the runtime focuses on the biker gang. While there is no problems with good character development, this IS NOT done well. A lot of the dialogue IS unnatural as hell, their interactions do not reveal as much about themselves and the world around them as it could have and a lot of the movie seriously lacks a sense of direction. The beginning could have been condensed to half the amount of time without much difference. Definitely the weakest aspect of the anime!The characters are decent to poor. Most of the biker gang are the standard kids transitioning to adults type characters. There is no development for most of them save the main character and the alpha male and even then it is poor. It is quite probable that you'd make no real emotional connection to any of them! This is nothing compared to the reporter character; she takes the blondes are dumb stereotype to the max and is easily the dumbest character in anime I've ever seen. She contributes almost nothing to the anime and her only redeeming feature is that she has more balls (or is it ignorance?) than most of the male cast! Literally just a dumb pretty face.Art quality is typical 80s ova type stuff; brilliant if you are used to old anime. What really boosts this anime are the insanely over the top and extremely cool military weapon designs. The giant tanks bristle with cannons that cover all of its sides! It is absolutely ridiculous and the anime knows it. They often operate alone as assault weapons; presumably because their all round fire power is expected to cover every possible approach to the tank. In practice, there are only 3 or so crewmembers operating the tank; so in battle, half of the guns are never used! Those monowheel motorbikes are also so impractically dumb that they end up becoming cool. You know what else is dumb? That experimental section of the movie where they animated motorbikes on top of live action video footage. Interesting? Yes. Well done? No, very roughly! Its more jarring than bad anime cgi!Sound is your typical 80s music. Its slightly above average compared to other 80s anime osts.Yes I really enjoyed this, you don't watch this anime for the lame, unrealistic characters and the barebones plot. You watch this for the badass mechanical designs waging blitzkrieg war over desert wastes and wreaking total destruction of the intricately detailed cities of Venus. What makes this even more interesting is the asymmetrical forces of the two nations. The Ishtarians have massive tank armies while Aphrodian's prefer hard hitting mobile forces. In conclusion, this is one of the coolest war animes ever made! Recommended for fans of military sci fi, the junkyard future aesthetic and war anime in general. a surprise attack on Aphrodian's capital, Io and conquer it in one day. The anime then chronicles a bike racing gang's involvement in the war to recapture Io. The simple plot is made up for by a sense of scale. There is a huge array of futuristic armoured fighting vehicles with the combined arms firepower that lays waste to the massive industrial complex of Io. Rarely in anime will you see such gratuitous scenes of warfare! There is more attention to detail than you'd think. The only aircraft are all prop driven as jet aircraft do not work in Venuses' atmosphere.At the same time, while one and a half hours is enough to craft a rich geopolitical thriller and a dose of history on top of the basic story, we only get a couple of basic anti war and totalitarian messages.

I have seen many movies from late 80s that are written in same way and this also borrows many elements. I felt that this movie was re-written less bloody version of Akira. These two movies have many things in common!And the characters are forgettable. I didn't even  remember anyone's names.Only one thing that is good in this anime is its artwork.

The two new independent nations are vying for control of Venus as tensions between the nations quickly spiral toward war Susan Sommers a carefree reporter from Earth who is arriving on Venus to report on the growing tensions between the two Venus nations. As war breaks out with Ishtar invading Aphordia\'s capital with giant flying ships that drop huge advanced tanks into the city Susan encounters Hiro and the other members of the ""Killer Commandos"" who are...a Venus bike racing team. The rag tag group is soon faced with the horrors of war, and is forced to make tough decisions as their homes and nation collapse around them.I had originally first Watched Venus Wars back in the very early 1990\'s when anime was truly gaining ground in America with such films as Vampire Hunter D, Akira, Ninja Scroll and Robot Carnival started airing in the US on the Sci-fi channel when it actually had true science fiction programming. I had originally loved the film, and I believe I would have given it five stars all those years ago. Besides shows like Robotech and Transformers that I grew up watching Venus Wars along with Vampire Hunter D and Ninja Scroll truly got me involved with Japanese Animation, so I do have the soft spot for Venus Wars, but after recently watching Venus Wars again after about eight years my views of Venus Wars have changed.Venus Wars is based on a short run manga with the same name created and written by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, which I have never read, so I can\'t compare the two, but the biggest issues with the film is the paper thin plot. It\'s not that that the plot is bad, it\'s just that there it is too familiar compared to many other anime films and films in general during the 1980\'s, and there is no real or detailed back story to go along with the unoriginal concept. The prologue to the Venus Wars is about thirty seconds long and does nothing to explain how Ishtar and Aphordia came to be, and doesn\'t answer other questions like what their relationship to Earth was or how Ishtar and Aphordia came to be independent. Nor does the film give any detail Ishtar or Aphordia besides they are at war for control of Venus. The lack of backstory for the human history on Venus is continued with the characters. Hiro the main character is from a rich family and he obviously has issues with his family, but yet he only really mentions them once with how the Aphordia government pays them to do basically nothing. The same can be said for the rest of the characters in Venus Wars. Still with that said the characters like Maggie, Susan, Will and Kurtz will keep you entertained and compelled by their flawed, but entertaining stories. I think the problem with the plot and characters rest on the head of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko who was both writer and director of the film. From seeing looking up his credits I think he was the wrong choice for both writer and director. I believe Triangle Staff who produced the film should have made different choices for writer and director of Venus Wars, but Yasuhiko could have compelled the animation company to bring him on as writer and director Venus Wars. If not he wouldn\'t have allowed them to make a film about his comic. Whatever the reason I believe the choice of Yasuhiko to write and direct Venus Wars was the wrong one.What works in Venus Wars, and keeps the film from being below average film is the animation, designs, action and music. While the animation is dated and even at the time of its release didn\'t compare to other anime film the animation doe by Triangle Staff still works for the type of film Venus Wars is and the environment of the planet. The animation is was dark and dirty that perfectly fit the gritty and desolate landscape of Venus. The designs and detail of vehicles from the advanced military tanks to the tactical assault military motorcycles are cool looking, and extremely well drawn and animated. The actions is riveting from the Venus War\'s brutal motorcycle races that is like a marriage between Nascar and Death Race that has so many convoluted rules, and is yet so compelling and exciting to the battles that are well planned out, beautifully drawn and animated. The action and animation is complimented by composer Joe Hisaishi score. Hisaishi who is a long time filming partner to the great Hayao Miyazaki delivers a compelling score that matches the environment of Venus as well as the tone. The combined animation, designs, action and music help to elevate the underdeveloped plot and characters tuning Venus Wars from a flawed below average film into a good action war film.While Venus Wars isn\'t as good as I first thought it was when I first watched the anime film over twenty years ago especially plot and character that is flawed, but does have a decent plot and characters that is saved by good well drawn designs and animations along with some spectacular action, and a beautiful score that keeps Venus Wars from being dragged down into mediocrity.

You don't have to endure the extremely harsh and frankly dull monotony of death that actually makes up most of war yet you are still shown realistic fates of those thrust into a conflict in a beautifully realized world.

You could learn how to write amazing worlds just from watching this film!"", ""Look, I'm just going to say it: I like Venus Wars more than Akira.Let's get two things out of the way.1) Reasons to compare the two movies. One came out only a year after the other. They're both about rebellious youth living in a cyberpunk landscape who are thrust into an apocalyptic conflict that is drawn painstakingly well in that 80s anime way.2) I wrote a 4000 word dissertation on Akira at university, so I am not what you would call a 'hater'. It was one of the first anime I ever saw, so it holds a special place in my...heart. It is a seminal piece of work, but I now feel Venus Wars has been in its shadow for long enough and deserves its time in the limelight, hence this review to get more eyes on it (and hence why Sentai released it on bluray).Both Akira and Venus Wars suffer from thin characterisation and superficial plotting, but I consider Venus Wars a superior work because its thematically more rich and the character arcs are more coherent.Akira is not a thematically bankrupt piece of art, not at all. For my dissertation of Otomo's movie I carefully studied the text of the work and behind the scenes interview with cast and crew, ultimately coming to the conclusion that the movie's most compelling theme is about exploring Japan's relationship to modernity. This is a meaty abstract theme to chew on, but there's no character in it. Character is what drives story, without character a story is not worth a damn in my opinion. You could have the most amazing plot in the world but if I don't care about any character, then what's the point? A paper-thin story with compelling characters will always be rewatchable though.Despite its thin characterisation, Venus Wars still has more compelling character archetypes than Akira. When protagonist Hiro's nation is invaded by the enemy, his first reaction is a petulant sort of anger. There's no heroics, these are just kids who have an addiction to racing. They flail about as their lives are destroyed by occupation, only coming together to fight back when their rage boils over at the mere sight of a tank parked on their local stadium. One thing leads to another and the next thing you know they are part of the war effort. A plucky opportunistic journalist comes along for the ride, providing a few laughs (some unintentional).If I were to rewrite Venus Wars to iron out its issues, I'd simply rewrite the third act a bit, add more character moments, a little more to the resolution to give some pay-offs, and also re-do the climax, as what occurs during it does feel both a little silly and a little anticlimactic despite the death and destruction on display.Venus Wars actually has more in common with Gundam than Akira, in that the movie is a compelling depiction of not-Earth kids being thrust into war due to the insanity of adults. Gundam F91 and Venus Wars would make a fun double-bill.The animation of Yasuhiko's movie is phenomenal and was what made me think of Akira in the first place. Both movies have incredible animation and attention to detail, the screen is constantly full of life and depth. They really don't make anime like this anymore. The soundtrack (by Joe Hisaishi!) is also an 80s banger with some nice pop tunes.Despite the hyperbolic start of this review, both Akira and Venus Wars are worthy of attention, they are intriguing windows into the 80s, bold and kinetic depictions of futurescapes populated by jaded characters who don't fit into neat boxes, there's no cliched heroes here, just furious action and unbridled emotion. heart.

While I've never been much a fan of war films, this one particularly grabbed me. Centering around an Earth reporter and a motorcycle team who are essentially drafted into war after taking matters into their own hands against an invading army, the Venus Wars is a rather grim look at wartime life. Helped by...the color palette of the film being gritty and muted, it doesn't have a bright and vibrant appearance, which gives it a tone that certainly isn't cheerful. Which I don't mind, this is war after all.Much of the main cast are teenagers, and as such seem mostly complacent to the severity of the situation their country is in until it really hits home. They're not terribly concerned with fighting for their country as much as simply defending the stadium they race at, but by doing so effectively enter into the war. The characters are more or less fleshed out well, giving you enough reason to care about them once things start to get really serious, and hoping they make it to the end.The animation is nice and fluid, not having many still frames and providing plenty of movement. And the character and mechanical designs are solid, with all the characters having very specific looks that make them all very easy to differentiate despite their similar racing uniforms many of them wear, and the various vehicles being very unique. Particularly that of the mono bikes and police patrol cars. I've always thought those were pretty cool looking. The music by Joe Hisaishi is good also, and really compliments the film well, adding much to the atmosphere of the world in which the film exists.While not necessarily nihilistic, having first seen this the day after seeing Project A-ko, the generally solemn nature of Venus Wars was a shock to the system. I clearly enjoy it now as an adult, but I'm always a bit surprised by how much I enjoyed it when I was 13. Venus Wars isn't a fun film per se, and can sometimes wax poetic about politics, but it's great art designs, animation, and engaging story make it well worth a view in my humble opinion. the color palette of the film being gritty and muted, it doesn't have a bright and vibrant appearance, which gives it a tone that certainly isn't cheerful.

Venus has become...habitable due to ice comet colliding with the planet which has dispersed the atmosphere and made the planet ripe for terraforming.The very beginning of the film revolves around a single female character by the name of Susan Sommers, a reporter from Earth that has travelled to Venus in order to get a scoop on the escalating tensions between the two continents and she manages to arrive on Venus just as the war is ready to begin. However, once we get a few minutes into the film we discover that the main plot of the film focuses around a sports biker team (Killer Commandos) who play this rollerball style of game led by the hot headed Hiro. In the middle of a competition against another biker team, all hell breaks loose as war is unleashed across the city and the Killer Commandos try to get out of the crossfire and find a safe haven and in the middle of the chaos they pick up the Reporter (Susan Sommers) in the war torn streets and bring her with them back to their garage.As Hiro and the team start to adjust to their new reality as the police, government and other forces bend to the will of Ishtar they realize that this is no way to live they decide to take it upon themselves to fight against the forces of Ishtar with a few plot twists thrown in for good measure since a simple sports bike gang cannot take on the army of an entire continent, not without a little bit of help at the very least.The biggest strength of this entire film is the action and the animation quality. I absolutely love how action packed this anime is - the action stays relatively consistent throughout the entire film and never focuses too much time on boring plot points before it gets right back into the action again. There are times where the film has to slow down in order to build the world that the film takes place in or provide adequate input from the characters with regards to the current situation that they're put in. I do appreciate the fact that the action set pieces are very long and detailed especially when the Killer Commandos take on their first tank at the stadium where they perform their usual competitions and it turns out to be an incredibly tough battle and the film is not afraid to sugar coat things because some members of the Killer Commandos actually get killed during their first conflict against the Ishtarian Army and death still follows their team even after they're recruited by the Aphrodian Freedom Force.There is a great amount of detail put into the designs of the tanks, motorcycles, and the wide array of weapons put into this anime with some really great back and forth combat between the sports biker team against the Ishtarian Army before and after they are recruited by the Aphrodian Freedom Force. I really have to give credit to a lot of background art throughout this entire anime. The animators did a wonderful job making the world of Venus look livable despite the absence of any vegetation throughout the entire planet but there is so much detail put into a rocky barren world that you can't help but be completely enthralled with how beautiful it looks especially with the deep mixtures of black, brown, red, orange, and gray colour throughout the entire film.Even though the characters are really one-dimensional and there aren't a lot of scenes that help significantly build the characters personality they put enough there to make them serviceable. The film does have some great one liners and some pretty awesome comical moments between the bikers because for the most part they're a bunch of hard headed teenagers/young adults trying to make sense of the situation they're put in which often gives them the feeling that they're invincible. I think one little fault with the film is the characters that seem interesting at first never really have enough time to develop such as Miranda and Gary, and then Susan disappears after 60% of the film with minor scenes afterwards when she confronts the Istarian General and a very brief exchange with Hiro as he is trying to find his love interest Maggie after the war is over. I will praise the film with the reluctance to show blatant fan-service in order to make it enjoyable because it certainly doesn't need it. There are scenes of one of the female characters changing clothes and another female character getting harassed at the spaceport but it never needs to go completely all the way to show any semblance of nudity.There are some odd animation styles especially when they show a battle scene in the latter half of the film where they overlay animation over a live action landscape, it's actually incredibly jarring and it doesn't really suit the film if you ask me. Live action landscapes are used again during the very end of the film when Hiro is on a journey to look for Maggie in a refugee camp. Personally, I don't think it's needed but it certainly gives the film it's own sense of style. The main style of animation throughout the film is incredibly beautiful especially for a late 1980's anime film.The film has an incredible score and some really beautiful songs throughout the final conclusion of the film, so along with some really great action you get to enjoy some really enjoyable music as well. It's actually a film in which both English dubs are surprisingly competent. The film originally had one english dub for the longest time from central park media which is a little cheesy and some of the acting is a little wooden but they had some good voice talent behind the voices of Gary, Miranda, and Susan. It was only recently that sentai filmworks issued their own English dub which is much more professional and well acted for a lot of the characters but I still have a lot of fondness for the original English dub of this film.Overall this is an anime film that uses a recycled plot point in a lot of films (foreign and domestic) in which a group of stubborn ill-equipped teenagers/young adults takes on a force regardless if it's the military, terrorists or something else that disrupts their way of life and they take matters into their own hands when nobody else won't do anything. We've seen this plot in live action films such as Red Dawn and Toy Soldiers but one of the reasons why a plot like this has many different iterations of it is because it's a plot point that works no matter what kind of setting you put it in. This film proves that it can work in anime and it can also work on a completely different planet. It is truly a wonderful timeless watch and it still holds the test of time because if you focus on your film on being action packed and entertaining then any faults when it comes to one dimensional character development and razor thin plot can be completely forgiven, habitable due to ice comet colliding with the planet which has dispersed the atmosphere and made the planet ripe for terraforming.The very beginning of the film revolves around a single female character by the name of Susan Sommers, a reporter from Earth that has travelled to Venus in order to get a scoop on the escalating tensions between the two continents and she manages to arrive on Venus just as the war is ready to begin.

Nothing special.Beautiful animation, a lot of gifs from this movie cycle all over anime aesthetic and vintage anime type forums.But the story is as cliche as it gets. Your basic boring ""war is hell"" drama cept it can\'t even get the HELL part right. Hardly anyone dies, zero gore. The protagonist ""Hiro"" is just a jerk who disagrees with everyone around him all the time no mater what unless the plot absolutely needs him to honour his word or get involved in something stupid.The plot also doesn\'t kick in until way too late, and for the dumbest reasons. The protagonist just decides...to commit terrorism and kill the crew of some random tank because its parked at the race track he used to drive at??????Multiple key characters never get named. Even once, and yet the movie expects me to care for them? Why. It never gives anyone time to breathe or much motive, Hiro could be cool but we never get into his reasons to be. He\'s just a rebel jerk who doesn\'t take no guff from no one not even military officers who could have him killed at a moments notice.Almost nothing happens action wise is good I guess.The scenes are very well animated and scored but the action is also highly predictable and full of plot armour that leaves everything feeling floppy with no meaningful sense of danger. Like I said earlier hardly anyone dies, I think a total of three named characters die and one of them only got a single speaking line before he was game ended.Unless your a really big fan of old school animation, skip this one. to commit terrorism and kill the crew of some random tank because its parked at the race track he used to drive at??????Multiple key characters never get named.

The soundtrack also contains a couple cheesy 80s pop songs which are used to bolster some of the character-focused scenes and, as I've been told, can be enjoyed on their own merit if you're into those kind of things.What I didn't particularly enjoy about the sound of this movie is the voice acting: it is satisfactory in a dry, professional way yet largely lacks nuance and therefore prevents the characters from expanding beyond their respective personality cliche, with a couple of notable exceptions.Unfortunately, neither of the standout characters belong to the main cast, and for the vast majority of this movie you are going to be stuck with a band of 80s action movie tropes and side characters who are largely irrelevant to the plot(compared to the amount of time they occupy) and are written in a realistic enough manner to be outright dull, which would have been fine if those characters were used for something like a coherent commentary on the effect war has on a regular civilian's psyche, but the script stops one step short of even that, which makes for a rather frustrating experience.But not nearly as frustrating as the script of this movie, which sets up a complex geopolitical plot in the opening minutes only to tear it down immediately with an extremely dumb scene that lacks any authenticity regarding military strategy and the realities of urban warfare; which bluntly narrates how tragically meaningless armed conflicts are, then proceeds to exult in a protracted colorful combat scene straight from some action comedy, which sacrifices basic physics, damaging properties of large-caliber artillery weapons and common sense at large for the sake of spectacle; and which by the end of the movie pretends it was an anti-war human drama all along, and demands an emotional response which is completely unearned.„ÄåVenus Senki„Äç is an exasperating muddled mess, which I can only recommend watching in good faith if you crave seeing a tank getting taken out by a excavator crane. of being outright primitive; most of what you see is intimately familiar from the mundane reality, with the exception of some vehicles designs, which are for the most part comically impractical and antiquated even by the 1989 standards.The 1989 standards for production quality of anime movies are outside my area of expertise, but going in without expectations, I was satisfied with the detailed artwork, vivid special effects and animation that is capable of fluidity and a certain old-school grace when it wants to; unfortunately, even though this movie is capable of delivering both impressive vistas and intense action sequences, most of its screen time looks good in an unremarkable way.The same can be said about the sound, which is used competently and does a good job accompanying the visuals, but is unremarkable otherwise.

I love the story behind it and the ova was following volume 1 perfectly.

I'd...say it's a great one filled with what i expected.. though a little too much blood for my taste is all.To tell the truth, ova 1 only contains chapter 1 from volume 1 from the Vassalord manga which contains many more chapters and more than 4 volumes.

OVA, which I watched one week ago on a whim, for my first ever review because it left me surprised and disappointed at the same time. I\'m struggling to come up with a suitable word to describe what I was left feeling when the credits began so I hope I can figure it out through writing this spoiler free review.- STORY/CHARACTERS -The story obviously suffered because the OVA is only 27 minutes long. It would have benefited hugely from being much, much longer. I feel parts did not get enough time focused on them and the explanation of...things was rushed. I really enjoyed the action, mystery and overall darkness of the story though. If you like that kind of thing  then you\'ll probably enjoy this.Character development could obviously not be done all that well either but I quite liked the two main characters Charles Chrishunds and Johnny Rayflo and their interactions with one another. It\'s a real shame because from what the little the OVA gave us, it was truly promising. I need more! Preferably a TV series! I want to see a more detailed and longer story involving these two guys. The other very few characters were not memorable or likeable at all.- ANIMATION/ART -I adore Production I.G and everything visually in Vassalord. was beyond beautiful. Overall I really loved the animation, art, character designs and so on. It\'s just something really gorgeous to look at. Watch this if you adore Production I.G or just good looking anime in general.- SOUND -I liked the voice actors for the two main characters Johnny Rayflo and Charles Chrishunds. The voiced fitted the characters and they did a good job. The ED song Misunderstanding is a really pretty sounding song. It ended the OVA perfectly and was great to listen to as I reflected on what I had just seen.- OTHER COMMENTS/ENJOYMENT/OVERALL -I\'m disappointed despite going in to the anime with no expectations at all. It kind of just felt like a promo for a manga. However, I want to read the manga now so I guess it did its job there. It does does its job well of giving you a taste of what Vassalord. is all about. I adore the overall darkness and the atmosphere of the anime. It left me wanting and literally needing more. I am very intrigued and want to see and explore more of the world of Vassalord. It seems like a really cool supernatural world.It could have been something incredibly special (I wanted to say, ""Really *swear word* amazing!"") but it turned out as being a decent but too short OVA which left me with a great and difficult to explain feeling. Since I just clicked and watched it at random Vassalord. took me completely by surprise. After some consideration: I\'d give it a 6/10, it just fell short of a 7. I wanted to be very generous with my rating for it but I felt I had to be harsher due to the disappointment and thoughts of ""Huh? Is that it!?"" I had at the end. I was not satisfied at all. It\'s a good job there is a manga to read next!If you have nothing to watch and half an hour to kill then I suggest you watch Vassalord. Definitely watch it if you can\'t get enough of the supernatural (specifically vampires!). By the way, this anime also has a tiny, little drop of shonen-ai in the atmosphere but don\'t let that put you off if you don\'t like that kind of thing. If you do like it then you\'ll be disappointed by the lack of it but enjoy the little hints.Please don\'t expect Vassalord. to be a masterpiece, just an anime that had some potential. It is definitely an interesting watch and I\'m sure those who did read the manga before watching this enjoyed it more. Who knows, maybe when I\'ve read the manga I\'ll feel differently...?

When i first watched it, i had absolutely no idea what it was about and only went in due to the shounen ai/yaoi factor. However, once i got the gist of what the story is about i found that i loved it. It has a pretty good plot going on. Though if like me you went in without any idea of the actual story you will find yourself completely confuse. Being confuse isnt such a bad thing to me tbh, because most of the time whenever i watch/read...something new i would be unclear of what the main story is about.The characters to me are pretty interesting. I feel that the two main characters have a good chemistry going on. haha. After completing the manga, i feel that they did a decent job of developing the characters just through 1 OVA.I think that the art and sound did the best compared to the story and character. The way the characters were designed and the voices they had fit perfectly well together. Of course im not trying to say it was the best thing i have ever seen, but compared to my expectations, it was very well done.Overall, i feel that watching this OVA is worth wasting 27 min of my life. It is visually pleasing, and you can really get engaged into the story if this kind of story is your thing. It even made me read the entire manga afterwards so... Therefore, i give this OVA an overall of 8 and hope that people that enjoy this genre should give a shot. something new i would be unclear of what the main story is about.The characters to me are pretty interesting.

It is impossible to capture the full complexity of the manga's plot and character development in just 20 minutes. Vassalord's OVA does not try to do that. Instead it focuses on simply capturing the mood and tension of emotions in the story, and that, it does extremely well. The opera-inspired music score is juxtaposed with a lot detailed, blood-stained scenes, to very memorable effect. Some might find the music somewhat melodramatic. But for me, it takes away the 'gore' effect of the blood, and transforms it into something beautiful, melancholic, full of lost and...longing.Having read the manga, I found this very enjoyable. But I think, even for someone who has not read the manga, this OVA is a good first taste of what the rest of the story would feel like. longing.Having read the manga, I found this very enjoyable.

I felt no emotion attachment, the story was rushed, the characters weak, and the plot devices were interesting but underdeveloped.I'm a person who has never seen the manga, so I can only review from the anime alone, and it doesn't carry itself well at all. I found myself thinking that it would be interesting in a short anime series where more character development and exposition can take place.That being said, the art and music is interesting and the characters had an intriguing enough premise that I was annoyed when the plot didn't deliver.

If you're looking for a teaser or a quick preview of what you can expect from the manga before you dive in, then PERHAPS this is the way to go."", 'It\'s a really bad sort of trailer for the manga, from the voice acting to fighting, to plot, to characterization.Perhaps its worst crime is that they decided to make this the only anime adaptation of the manga, when it\'s a relatively faithful adaptation of the manga\'s beginning, but the beginning is probably the weakest part of the series. The reason I\'m unsure if its worst crime is what the crew chose to adapt (so you can\'t really blame them for how bad it is) is because the \'episode\' opens with a really, really terrible broken English conversation. While watching this I thought I\'d mistakenly found...an English dub of the video. I\'m not sure if it\'s better that this ISN\'T the English dub; it\'s just THAT bad. I\'m also not sure why it was necessary? It adds nothing to the story. In the manga, there\'s no indication they\'re speaking in English (or if there is, it doesn\'t break you out of the story so bad). And this is LITERALLY the first spoken part of the episode. Bad opening.The episode(?) (it\'s not an OVA) is basically a quick runthrough of the first mini-arc in the story. They skip over a couple minor tidbits (off the top of my head they remove a funny character-building scene between Rayflo and Charles when Rayflo buys some stuff, and they for whatever reason remove the dead bodies when Rayflo and Charles come across the massacre, but leave these weird bodiless blood spatters on the ground), but overall it\'s basically just the opening of the story. They even add a scene where Rayflo solves a cypher, perhaps so they could give Rayflo something to do. It actually helps the scene flow better and helps demonstrate Rayflo\'s age, whereas in the manga it kind of just cuts from Charles not understanding something to answering a phone call. They also made it look like one character is a vampire when they\'re actually not for some reason (in both anime and manga), which wasn\'t the case in the manga. I don\'t know what that was about.In this arc/episode we\'re infodumped, which is normal for the openings in fantasy/supernatural series. We\'re also introduced to the primary relationship - RayfloxCharles. You have to set the rules. Unfortunately the rules set are largely ignored for the rest of the series, and the dynamics set up are, for no apparent reason, bizarrely twisted to something else. The problem is that neither of the dynamics set up are necessarily bad as story elements, but that one doesn\'t just switch to the other.One rule that\'s completely ignored until basically the very end of the series is the wings. Charles gets them when he nearly dies near the end of the episode due to, I guess, blood loss, and then gets a boost of blood from Rayflo. We never see these again. We never get an explanation for why this happens. Charles does frequently abstain from drinking from Rayflo during the series, even collapsing twice from it during the series outside this scene, and Rayflo appears to give him an emergency transfusion. But at neither time do the wings reappear. Rayflo does get his wings at the end of the series, but this is implied to be a power he seldom activates, and only when he\'s very, very angry. Charles gets angry and desperate plenty of times. The wings never show up. No other vampire is shown to have this ability besides Charles and Rayflo. Rayfaelle, like Rayflo, is shown to be able to turn into a swarm of bats. Princess Minae, who is apparently old and powerful, does not seem to have wings. Now imagine this, but microcosmed into one episode with no explanation before or after. Other than that it\'s a thing that Rayflo is apparently aware of.And then there\'s the RayfloxCharles relationship. I don\'t hate the relationship. It just doesn\'t make sense half the time and a good chunk of that is in this arc. In this arc, it initially seems to be setting up a relationship where 1) a vampire hunter somehow ran afoul of a powerful vampire who turned him, and now the vampire hunter keeps trying to kill him to get free, but since he\'s weaker than the vampire and partially under the vampire\'s control, he can\'t do it, or 2) Charles knows Rayflo is immortal and just uses him as a punching bag to test his skills so he can level up because it\'s easier than looking for targets to murder and he cares very little about Rayflo\'s wellbeing.Whatever is happening is undercut almost immediately by the fact that it\'s very clear that Charles cares very deeply for Rayflo. This is all before any backstory is revealed. The whole \'using Rayflo + his maids for target practice\' thing is also dropped after this arc. In short, there\'s a couple ways the story sets up their relationship all at the same time, none of which are ultimately true for no apparent reason, all of which conflict with each other, and basically the guy who cries over Rayflo at the end of the episode has done precisely zero character development over the course of the episode from where he was attacking Rayflo + co out of nowhere at the beginning of the episode. I think the creator wanted to make Charles a tsundere who uses weapons for his feelings at all times but didn\'t know how to do that?The art itself is fine. It\'s actually slightly worse than the manga. The fight scenes are meh. Most anime make up for the brevity of manga pages by adding the inbetweens of shots you don\'t see on the page. This one doesn\'t. It\'s just a lot of cut cut cut superpowerful badasses fighting each other in a fight where nothing matters and no one is harmed or dies. It\'s actually harder to understand what\'s going on in the anime than in the manga because the cutting is that bad, except for one shot where Rayflo gets iced. The anime did a better version of that.Other than that, the actual plot of the arc itself is pretty bad. Part of that is more worldbuilding I\'m not going into because it\'s more of an issue for the manga, but part of that is just that the plot is very confusing, which only makes everything else worse when it\'s dropped on top. Charles is back briefly from somewhere, attacks Rayflo because... tsundere? Sort of suicidal tendencies? He gets a job and decides to take Rayflo with him for food. But wait, it\'s actually not the Official church giving him orders. But wait the not-church churchies... don\'t actually want him? They want Rayflo? Because their test subject coma patient they decided to wake up gave this vaguely foreboding prophecy about something bad happening?But wait, they were never supposed to wake her up. So why did they? No no, she woke up on her own. Okay, why does this group answer her wishes? And she didn\'t ask for Rayflo. She was just weirdly foreboding. Is she a special vampire cause she\'s got ice magic? And maybe other magic? Who cares. The writer doesn\'t. Just how many kinds of abilities do these vampires have? And why IS Charles mostly immune to sunlight but like these uber powerful vampires aren\'t? Thus, in this one episode of anime we are introduced to a race with a seemingly endless range of abilities and very few to no vulnerabilities, a world that doesn\'t make a ton of sense, and relationships that flip flop so badly you get whiplash.Overall this episode is a mess from pretty much every angle, although again - it\'s not entirely the crew\'s fault since they pretty faithfully adapted the manga. If you want to read the manga, it\'s... I mean it\'s fine as a yaoi. It\'s definitely better than this. Just get past this section and you\'ll be fine. Mostly. Also, Rayflo and Charles get better looking as the series progresses so that\'s already more points in favor of skipping this and just reading the manga. Although if you want to watch this, at least it\'s short? If you want to watch a better shounen-ai story, watch ""Douyusei""/""-Classmates-"" (just a movie) or ""Sekaiichi Hatsukoi""/""World\'s Greatest First Love"". If you want a better supernatural story with vampires, ""Sirius the Jaeger"" is pretty decent and has great art. an English dub of the video.

Yoshinaga-sanchi no Gargoyle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/965/Yoshinaga-sanchi_no_Gargoyle,"[""I've noticed that there is a trend amongst anime fans to automatically hate shows with no real plot, or where the plot takes a long time to develop. It's a shame that this is the case as there are a number of gems out there that have been misnomered by one fan or another, and have thus failed to gain any sort of popularity or commendation.Take Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle for example. The show is about young Yoshinaga Futaba and her family (mum, dad, older brother), and the strange statue that she wins in a lotttery at the local shopping district. This statue is Gargoyle -...a talking statue that moves (just not how you expect), flies, and shoots beams from it's eyes. Gargoyle is alive, and in the tradition of gargoyles, he has taken it upon himself to protect the yoshinaga's and their home from such menaces as the paperboy, the mailman, people walking down the street, etc. There's more to the story than just that, but it all gets a little surreal from the get-go.The animation in Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle isn't anything special. The creators weren't trying to break any new ground either visuals or sound. The score is reasonable, yet forgettable. The animation is sometimes jerky whilst the backgrounds are okay at best. The one big plus point the show had for me, in terms of sound that is, was the fact that Gargoyle is voiced by the stupendous Wakamoto Norio.The characters were, again, nothing special. Futaba is a typical tomboy, while her brother has his girlish tendencies. Mother likes wrestling, and will punish the kids and hubby by using a suplex or similar. Father is just plain forgettable. The only really memorable character in the show is Gargoyle-kun.Given all of the &quot;flaws&quot; of the show, you're probably wondering why I gave it a score of 8. I'll explain....If I were to classify Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle, I would have to place it firmly under the heading of &quot;no-brain&quot; entertainment. It has no real plot, the characters get little to no development, the animation is okay at best, and the music an sound effects are reasonable enough.HOWEVER, Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle is no-brain entertainment of the best kind. It is a surrealistic, oddball comedy, and barring a few blips, doesn't really pretend to be anything else. That's one of the beauties of a show like this. The fact that they aren't concerned with great animation, sound, music, plot, etc, as all they really want to do is make you laugh. And I did. A lot :DIf you're terminally addicted to shows where there has to be a plot, then you probably won't like Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle. Likewise if you can't live without seeing strong character development, great animation, excellent music and effects, etc, then you probably should avoid this show. It's unfortunate that there's a lot of people out there who fit into those categories, but that's by-the-by.If you're after something that is entertaining (without the need to engage higher brain functions), will make you laugh (a lot), and basically does exactly what it says on the tin, then give Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle a try.And for all those addicts I referred to above - why not give this, or another show  (Seto no Hanayome or Inukami), a try. You never know. You may find you enjoy them... a talking statue that moves (just not how you expect), flies, and shoots beams from it's eyes.

This would be a good anim&eacute; as a sort of intro for kids. It's definitely lighthearted in general, though it's still...got some points serious enough to make it not totally silly by any means.If you've got a bit of a silly sense of humour or you like something vaguely, but not totally mindless, I think this anim&eacute; is worth watching.

Youkai Watch Movie 2: Enma Daiou to Itsutsu no Monogatari da Nyan!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28257/Youkai_Watch_Movie_2__Enma_Daiou_to_Itsutsu_no_Monogatari_da_Nyan,"[""Preface: It is Youkai Watch! What else do you need to know? If you are reading this you probably have either an interest in the movie or the series so I will keep this short.Story 8/10:Compared to the first movie, I felt like this one had a more engaging story/stories. The movie has four separate stories that ultimately lead to the fifth story which is the climax of the movie. Each story is about the length of a normal episode and has more or less the level of depth you are used to in the series. Though for long time fans it tugs a bit...more on the heart strings with the inclusion of a certain lady tied to Jibanyan's past. Everything is what you would expect from a kids movie and has a cute little message of Yokai and Humans coming together to prove that they can exist together.Art 7/10: Nothing spectacular here, but the animation is noticeably better in certain places then you would get in your typical episode, especially during the action oriented scenes. I was not a big fan of the use of 3D in this movie but it is pretty negligible and easy to overlook but it does stand out a lot more than it probably should.Sound 8/10: Same old soundtrack, same old pleasant little songs. The movie ending theme is a nice little song and it reuses the at the time current ending theme of the anime for the proper ending credit scene. If you like the upbeat and plucky tunes of the series you will feel right at home here.Character 9/10: The strongest point of the series and the big favorites are here: Jibanyan, USApyon, Komasan, Fuyunyan and Whisper with Keita and Inaho to round out the cast. They act like their predictable selves but that isn't a bad thing at this point is it? We finally get to Komasan's larger than life mother and to be honest it was well worth the wait even if she is only in the film briefly. Lord Enma plays the role of cool new character and demonstrates his role as the current leader of the Youkai Watch with Nurarihyon playing the villain steeped in his old ways of doing things. Enma and Nurarihyon don't get much development but they are nice addition to overall cast of characters the series brings.Enjoyment 9/10: While your mileage may vary on how much you may like this movie but I found it fun for the time being. You can definitely go without seeing it but with how much advertising the show did for this movie, you would really be doing yourself a disservice not to give about 90 minutes of your time for this film. It won't change your life or make you rethink anything but I can say it will brighten up your day, even if just for a tiny second.Overall 9/10: Give it a shot you might just enjoy it. Certainly not the best film out there but certainly not the worst film either. Everyone can benefit from a little cuteness that Youkai bring into this world. more on the heart strings with the inclusion of a certain lady tied to Jibanyan's past.

I loved the idea of the story and felt that the anime was truly lacking so I sought out an English translation of the web novel to gain the enjoyment this idea presents. The anime only gives a very rough summary of the story and a shallow glimpse into the relationships...between each character. The shortness of the episodes and the abrupt ending fail to convey the story as it should have been done. As well, there are many changes between the two formats with the anime failing to meet the same satisfaction towards the story line as what the web novel conveyed. It lacks the gravity of the betrayl between Yun Qi and Su Luo and fails to portray the weight of Nangong Liuyun and Su Luo's relationship; which is the whole premise for the story. Overall the anime is too short and rushed to accurately portray the story leaving the viewer unsatisfied with the end result.I would recommend, if you're truly interested in the story, to read the web novel as the anime fails to provide a resolution to the story as it abruptly ends. The anime ends around chapter 114 of the web novel and covers maybe an 1/8 of the story to that point. It combines many of the plot elements while leaving a large majority of the story out and adds some aspects that just do not flow right and leaves the viewer confused. At the time of this review the web novel is ongoing, yet unless you devour books as I do, it is far enough ahead to provide a few months of reading before you catch up. It updates Friday evenings. between each character. The shortness of the episodes and the abrupt ending fail to convey the story as it should have been done. As well, there are many changes between the two formats with the anime failing to meet the same satisfaction towards the story line as what the web novel conveyed. It lacks the gravity of the betrayl between Yun Qi and Su Luo and fails to portray the weight of Nangong Liuyun and Su Luo's relationship; which is the whole premise for the story. Overall the anime is too short and rushed to accurately portray the story leaving the viewer unsatisfied with the end result.I would recommend, if you're truly interested in the story, to read the web novel as the anime fails to provide a resolution to the story as it abruptly ends.

First, are its downfalls and then it's strong points:1) The characters are very pleasing and interesting, there could have been so much more added to them. Their backgrounds, the mysteries about the main character, how she gets to is able to even start her new journey. Her feelings about what caused her to even start that journey could have been elaborated so much more. The other main character (male) he could have been explained so much more, about his past and what he has to...struggle and deal with.2) Same thing here. The story misses some huge plot points that could have strengthened the story sooo much more. As I said, there was so much potential, yet it didn't pull through and I was very disappointed. Sometimes, it felt very awkward to end at certain moments.3) Episode lengths. Short. Short. Short. The episodes themselves aren't even that long, however, the intro and ending songs are each over a minute, add the overview of the previous episode you are looking at possibly 11 or 12-minute episode.4) Was it just me? Or did the last episode end on a cliffhanger and leaving us with nothing more? I know it is a new anime and maybe that's all they got so far.Strong points:1) The art background wise is amazing! It's beautiful especially for the intro and closing songs.2) I really like the music that goes with the anime. It is very fitting.3) The art for the characters design wise is very clean and fitted.4) Previously, I did say that we lacked character development, but that doesn't mean none happened. We did get a few glimpses here and there on the male main character past went, but not too much. We do get to see how the character changes in some crucial parts which is important.Overall: This anime is pretty good, It had a lot of potential, but if you're really really really bored and have nothing to do watch this and give it a chance. However, if you have something else in mind, you might want to go for that one.;) struggle and deal with.2) Same thing here.

The story held itself together enough to make the episodes make sense, but the interactions between the characters were so rushed, it felt like some things were just getting forced into place rather than having it feel natural. It made it feel like characters feelings for each other were just there for the image of a romance rather than having one culminate with actual reasons or causes for it.Overall,...I was pretty disappointed with how this anime was handled. It's okay for when you're bored, but it's just going to get your hopes up for nothing. I was pretty disappointed with how this anime was handled.

It's less than that. Counting the intro and outro you only have about 10-11 minutes of actual anime time. The characters are great though. I love the heroine. She's gutsy and determined and makes her own way. The male lead is a little weak. Ironic considering he's supposed to be the strongest. It's a little choppy because of the short time. If they made these full episodes it'd have a higher rating. I like the premise and hope they come back with a season 2. Hopefully...with full-length episodes. with full-length episodes."", ""STORY: 4/10The premise seemed promising in the initial episodes, but it quickly went downhill. The story was rushed and the romance felt really forced and awkward.There was a lot of tone inconsistency throughout the series. We got a lot of cringe-worthy shoujo moments, some awkwardly placed comedic scenes, and some moments that got uncharacteristically dark compared to the rest of the story.The opening and ending sequences as well as the unnecessary episode reviews and previews took up way too much time. That precious time could've been used for better story pacing.ART: 3/10Animation wasn't smooth and was really basic. The studio didn't convey different moods...or emotions very well. The art style was bland and inconsistent. The ending sequence animation was probably the nicest animation in the whole series.I'm not a fan of how the female lead and her maid look like they're wearing magical girl outfits compared to the rest of the cast. It made it harder for me to take the female lead seriously when she's supposed to be a bad-ass assassin.SOUND: 3/10Voice acting was fine, but other than that, nothing really stood out sound-wise. Like the animation, the sound was really basic. I did like the ending OST though.CHARACTER: 3/10Everything in this series felt rushed and that goes for the characterization as well. Personality wise, I think the male lead was perfectly fine. He's a bit of a tease, but he's kind and protective to those he cares about. If the studio paced the story better and fleshed his story out (seems like he had a tragic past), he would've been much more interesting to watch.On the other hand, I found the female lead really annoying as the series progressed. I liked how she stood up for herself in the first few episodes, but her personality quickly deteriorated. She is impulsive, hypocritical, and somewhat arrogant. I don't understand how the male lead fell for her because she was pretty cold to him for most of the series. I understand that she was bitter and reluctant to trust because of her past, but her back-and-forth regarding the male lead was incredibly frustrating.ENJOYMENT: 3/10The limited amount of episodes combined with poor direction from the studio made for a poor watch experience. I really wanted to like this series, but it was extremely mishandled by the studio with a rushed story and poor animation, not to mention an unlikable female lead. or emotions very well.

I love the idea of magic, special abilities, dragons incorporated here.  Given that the story line is so rich, they could really have stretched out the episodes more.  Episodes are rushed and details are not explained properly.  Actual anime time is only about 11-12 minutes per episode.  knowing how Chinese series usually...reach up to 60 episodes, why did they make chinese animes so short.Characters- I love how the lead female is so strong.  The male lead is supposed to be the strongest, but how did it end up that way in episode 13, makes you wonder how that relates to being the strongest.  One character, the head of the armory, only had such a small part that you can't even figure out where he falls into this story.Artwork- Wonderful.  Makes you just want to look at them the whole day.  Even the bad guy looks good.  Yellow eyes for the male lead, that is something new.I truly enjoyed watching this.  I hope they make a season 2.  If you like romantic animes, then this is worth watching.  Again, I am not disappointed with the story, only disappointed at how the ending left me hanging. reach up to 60 episodes, why did they make chinese animes so short.Characters- I love how the lead female is so strong.

I later found this title again and picked it up and thus here I am.Story:So I really don‚Äôt want to make this a spoiler review so I won‚Äôt mention much and also keeping in mind the fact that this is a drama anime so there isn‚Äôt much to spoil. Anyway, so the Donghua has a female lead and is from the perspective of a female. It has its decent comedy scenes and some tense scenes as well and both worked out well for the series. I for once didn‚Äôt really expected tense scenes of the intensity of saw from this dongua, it really was surprising to me and that was a good thing they include and went into that length. However, mostly its just like the usual Chinese Donghua there are, rom-com so no need to feel down or in my case be excited. So the main character gets Isekai-ed to another world due to an incident that takes place in the first episode and there she starts to discover the new life she gets and the world and people around her i.e. the usual stuff and this makes it mostly a drama donghua and most of the series focuses with the relationship building of the main couple with the instances they get drawn to.There‚Äôs that so my opinion about this is that the story didn‚Äôt interest much, especially the latter half of the series as the villain was off and I am not satisfied with the reason they provided for the male lead to be as to why he is tailing around the female lead. and also the fact that he seemed a little bit off on some scenes at the latter half. They should have had another episode or a few extra minutes on the last one.Art & Animation:First, in terms of Chinese animation I prefer the character designing of King‚Äôs Avatar than coming in this designing and animation. The good thing was they didn‚Äôt have much characters which is a good thing I believe because if they did then it would be hard to distinguish them from one another or I would have to recognize them, judging by their clothes/dress etc. In terms of China, the animation is nice but overall they still need to step up a lot more. I could see that they couldn‚Äôt animate much action scenes accurately so I don‚Äôt know if they just removed the action form the Donghua because they are weak in this or the source material didn‚Äôt had any action in this arc but then overall it was nice in terms of art and good on most aspects of animation but underwhelming on a few big parts like action as I mentioned.Sounds & Music:Firstly, I‚Äôll write about sounds, so all the characters with their respective voice overs were alright specifically, Luoluo, Luluo, Suxi, Lingfeng. However, Jinwang did seemed off on a few scenes, but that‚Äôs because of the expressions of the characters and the movement of it, i.e. animation so they could have fixed the animation or could have made sure the voice over did his part accurately according to the scene animation they had. Also to mention, sometimes the characters steps sounds didn‚Äôt match the character‚Äôs movement or was louder than it should be. Other than all this it was good.Secondly about the opening and ending themes. This is one of the best things about this donghua as both of them sounded good and were done very well. The opening theme starting visuals, music and the vocals is the best part of it in my opinion. I have no problems with this aspect of the donghua. The opening is something that I liked better than the ending.As a standalone, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not something I would listen to all day rather sometimes so I‚Äôd say its pretty nice to listen to. The music and the vocal composition match up pretty well and this results in a pretty decent song. Probably, all other listeners would‚Äôve loved this song as well. I‚Äôd say this was a pretty good attempt.The ending theme is pretty much romantic as the series is but this season didn‚Äôt deal with much of that aspect which in turns doesn‚Äôt make this song much related, but anyway, this theme lyrically is how it should be and there was nothing of that I could find and that is if the translation was accurate. In terms of listening, it goes pretty well. I don‚Äôt think the Chinese vocals would be a problem for anyone listening to it as most people doesn‚Äôt like to listen to the Chinese as they cannot bear the toning of the language but this wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt the case with me. In terms of visuals, The art and animation they had in the ending theme was good.As a standalone, I wasn‚Äôt able to find a full version as that‚Äôs usually how it is with a Chinese material so I don‚Äôt know it actually has a full version or not, but I think even if it did then it would be that like repeating the same lyrics and music on the second phase of the song so I judged it on this aspect and would still be nice and pretty decent.Lastly about the OSTs, again, I wasn‚Äôt able to find a full list as its a Chinese material so I‚Äôll skip on this matter now. Mostly I have no problem with this aspect of the series. Nearly all of the tracks matched the scene they were used for and I like a 2-3 of them specifically Luoluo‚Äôs theme track for ROM-come scenes and the theme used for tense scenes was nice too. However, I would say they don‚Äôt have much action so not having a good track for action is okay.Characters:So there were only a limited number of characters which I believe was the right thing for this show as by doing this most characters got enough screen time. I believe the protagonist was alright and Luluo (maid) was done exceptionally well in terms of a supporting character and Suxi did her part well in the series, but the series lacked a central antagonist as Suxi was more of a supporting antagonist for a few episodes. I mean we had one, but he seemed underwhelming to be honest but then as I mentioned before that this mainly focused on the main couple‚Äôs interactions and focused on the relationship of both leads hence this could have resulted in the antagonist to be underwhelming but he as a character seemed off a lot. Other than that I really couldnt grasp Lingfeng‚Äôs role in the series.As this is somewhat of a short drama donghua so I won‚Äôt be mentioning most details since you can catch that easily if you watch it. I‚Äôll mention their names and a little intro as tracking websites doesn‚Äôt have characters listed on the donghua‚Äôs page.Luoluo, our main female protagonist. Is a Assassin for an organization of the real world and gets Isekai-ed to this world of cultivation with magical creatures and spiritual powers.Luluo, the maid of our main protagonist in the new world she gets Isekai-ed. She‚Äôs loyal and caring for our protagonist and a little bit dreamy.Prince Jinwang, The male lead who acts as the price charming and forces himself on the female lead as he is interested in her due to a reason. Well he is kinda prince Charming to every person in that isekai world as he is known to be the best cultivator there.Lingfeng, probably the aid of the male protagonist but he seemed unnecessary for now but lets see how he goes on about in the nest season.Miss Suxi, The evil female which serves as the antagonist for the first few episodes. She wants all the limelight to her so that she gets chooses by Mr prince Charming.Liu Jue, the crown prince and the main antagonist of the season 1 and probably season 2. He is probably the brother of our male lead I believe so. As I mentioned he was pretty much underwhelming throughout the series. Lets see if he can be better at season 2.Yunqi, the assassin boyfriend of the female protagonist from the first episode.Conclusion:So long short, this isn‚Äôt a series one should watch no matter what rather its something one can try out just like a change of appetite as this isn‚Äôt bad rather it‚Äôs an alright shoujo material to watch.Tags:Xie Wang Zhui Qi (donghua), The Demonic King Who Chases His Wife (donghua), ÈÇ™ÁéãËøΩÂ¶ª („Ç¢„Éã„É°„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥) Genres: Drama, Romance, Comedy, FantasyThemes: Isekai, CultivationFavorite quotes:‚ÄúMiss, you forgot again that you are a trash that‚Äôs good for nothing.‚Äù - Luluo (Maid)I started watching this way back at about the start of this year and placed this on hold as its episode didn‚Äôt get uploaded for some time and with time I just forgot about the series as a whole.

Sadly, the only positives about this show were that the episodes were really short and I liked that the female lead was kick-ass.The story/plot was rushed. There is zero world-building. I know next to nothing about the world that our protagonist is ""reincarnated"" into after watching the whole show. The only thing I picked up was that people have special powers and they get tested for it when they\'re kids. There was no character development. And then there was the cliffhanger ending. I\'m a bit...upset that I even wasted my time on this show. I kept watching it hoping it would get better.

Even though the premise is interesting, pacing is wack. That is mostly due to the episode count and episode length. Having at most 8-10 minutes of actual watching per episode is way too short, but they do not seem to rush the story too much. Second season does account for the episode length, so if you finish this to the end - you...may as well continue on to season 2 because it will be much better compared to the first one.Last episode finishes it off on the weirdest cliffhanger that I could imagine. It just doesn't work where the cliffhanger is - you know those cliffhangers before the next episode when something big is supposed to happen (so the fanbase needs to be hyped up for the next ep)? Except without the massive hyping and drawn-out fillers before it. It doesn't have an impact, you don't even realise that was the last episode and boom - you see credits and behind-the-scenes of the show.The animation is, depending on the situation, bearable to watch. During fight scenes it isn't that bad, but it's obvious that the budget was limited. It becomes eminent at times without fighting that the animation is relatively choppy. However, besides that, there is one issue as with many shows like this - the sound effects are lackluster. You definitely don't feel the impact of the hits, swings, jumps, drops and whatnot, which ruins the immersion.Overall, it's a great show to pass time and enjoy a nice story. It has an interesting plot behind it, but at the end of it all, it is (kind of) another isekai without enough budget. Depending on your tolerance (which would mean surviving like an hour), have fun watching it until season 2, which greatly improves upon the shortcomings of this season. may as well continue on to season 2 because it will be much better compared to the first one.Last episode finishes it off on the weirdest cliffhanger that I could imagine.

During fight scenes it isn't that bad, but it's obvious that the budget was limited. It becomes eminent at times without fighting that the animation is relatively choppy. However, besides that, there is one issue as with many shows like this - the sound effects are lackluster. You definitely don't feel the impact of the hits, swings, jumps, drops and whatnot, which ruins the immersion.Overall, it's a great show to pass time and enjoy a nice story. It has an interesting plot behind it, but at the end of it all, it is (kind of) another isekai without enough budget. Depending on your tolerance (which would mean surviving like an hour), have fun watching it until season 2, which greatly improves upon the shortcomings of this season.""]"
Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku wo Ketsui Shimashita. OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20545/Yuusha_ni_Narenakatta_Ore_wa_Shibushibu_Shuushoku_wo_Ketsui_Shimashita_OVA,"[""Ah, OVA's.  A full-length episode where we can all just sit back and enjoy a random episode of an anime we wish continued on...is usually what people say whenever they watch an OVA.Story (5.32/10):  For this OVA of Yusibu, the story is really about Miuri, Raul's imouto, coming to the capital to see her big brother work as a hero, whilst Raul himself acts like a hero, while covering up the fact that he works in a magic shop.  That's pretty much the story of the OVA.By itself, the idea seems innocent, staging a simple setup of a hero...on a quest in order to make a little girl falsely believe that her brother works a fantastic job.  But...this is Yusibu, a show that must be watched alone, otherwise other people will judge you for your life decisions.  To put it simple, every single minute of the show has at least one ecchi scene in it, leading to some very...uncomfortable or enjoyable scenes depending on the kind of person you are.To put it simply, this OVA is nothing but pointless fanservice that serves to the people who want more boobs than they should ever be allowed.  The story is pretty pointless once the fanservice starts kicking in.Overview-   Way too innocent story idea-   WAY too much fanservice in one episode (in my opinion of course.Characters (7.43/10):  Aside from Miuri, which can be explained as a little sister who looks up to her brother, (basically summed up in 8 words), the majority of the main cast makes a return at some point or another, naked and molested at least once.There's not too much character explored or developed (aside from a dense side that Raul somehow NEEDED to have), and you won't find much really change in terms of this OVA.  Overall, the characters are the same, nothing really changed.Overview:+/-  The number is pulled from my old review of the main show.Art and Sound (6.09/10 and 7.00/10):  Everything in terms of the art and sound are quite consistent.  (Since most of it was just pulled from the original show, songs, art, and all.)One thing however, is different...is the fact that this OVA is practically uncensored.  To put it bluntly, they show nipples.  A lot of nipples.  Since every girl in the show gets stripped down at one point or another, it almost falls into the realm of hentai, and almost pedophilia.  (Since Miuri is also subjected to this shit and she's like...9?  10?)  Just be mindful that the ecchi is strong with this one...very strong.Overview+/-  Standard art style from the original show+/-  Same music-   Way too many nipples-   You stripped down the 9 year old.  No, just no.  (-1.00 from art score.)Personal Enjoyment (6.00/10):  Personally, I'm surprised that I finished it.  While personally, I was able to watch the original show with little to no problems (maybe cringe every now and then at how borderline hentai it was), the fact that they went this above and beyond was a little sickening to me.  Frankly, I'm fine with ecchi as long as it's not overly done, and I felt like the creators went a bit too far with this OVA.  It was a cute idea having the little sister come in to see her brother, but the OVA really went to the extent to make this really something you have to watch by yourself.  It was nice to see Fino and some other characters I liked in the series, but...it was just a bit much for me.Overall Score: 5.98/10 on a quest in order to make a little girl falsely believe that her brother works a fantastic job.

Fino shes pretty much the same as in the main anime she usually forgets stuff on the plan and also screws up abit at the end. Raul is...basically that same as before aswell a guy that is super shy to the lewd stuff and also pretty much what my main review of the anime is what he is.

Alps Monogatari: Watashi no Annette,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2546/Alps_Monogatari__Watashi_no_Annette,"['Before I get to my review, I\'d like to talk about something. Some anime cliches that I really hate--which are unfortunately being used a heck of a lot more nowadays--are when characters act like jerk butts because the story tells them to (Minko from Hanasaku Iroha, anyone?), when characters don\'t solve their problems by talking to each other and just keep being stupid for the sake of dragging the story out (I\'m looking at you, Tuxedo Mask in Sailor Moon R!!!), and characters who ABSOLUTELY refuse to listen when someone tries to clarify something to them. I really hate these cliches. For one thing, if...done wrong, they can really hurt a story and characters. However, if done right, it can really bring a story to life. I was really convinced I would absolutely HATE this anime...but I don\'t, because not only does it wonderfully lampshade, avert, and call out these horrible cliches in the best way possible, they\'re wonderfully used to craft a very well done story, especially considering the big theme and message of the show is forgiveness and how hating someone and not listening to them can make both parties suffer horribly.The story focuses on two childhood friends, Annette and Lucien. They\'re opposites, but they\'re good friends. But even they get into fights and misunderstandings sometimes. Annette later has a little brother named Dani, but her mother dies after his birth. Five years later, Annette and Lucien were still good friends until a misunderstanding creates a rift between them. But when they\'re on the verge of forgiving each other, Lucien gets extremely mad at Dani and threatens to throw his pet ermine (It\'s a cat in the novel. Don\'t know why they changed it into an ermine) down a ravine (but he wasn\'t going to go through with it). However, said ermine, Klaus, bites him in retaliation and falls down, with Dani going down with him. Lucien is convinced Dani is dead, and Annette, when she finds out, is absolutely furious with him, vowing to hate him forever. Dani is alive, but his leg is broken, and doesn\'t heal properly, leaving him handicapped. From then on, Lucien becomes a pariah, and Annette is so immersed in her grudge against him that she\'ll do anything to make his life miserable, never to let him forget about his crime.The animation is good for it\'s time, even though I did see a couple of off model shots and misplaced body parts here and there, but nothing too bad. The music isn\'t much to write home about, and for the most part, it does its job well, except some happy music plays during some pivotal scenes where they weren\'t really needed, which kind of killed those scenes for me. The characters--most of them, I\'ll get to it in a later paragraph--are good, well written, and wonderfully flawed. Annette in particular is very well developed, as she is a good girl, but she\'s not perfect and even she succumbs to making bad decisions and doing things that make both her and the person she hurts suffer greatly. You want to root for her, but the show doesn\'t let us forget about her negative traits, nor does it want us to condone the bad decisions she makes. Lucien is the same. You really feel bad for the poor kid, as he\'s always being misunderstood and judged for stupid things, even by his best friend and his family. There is, however, one character who is my absolute favorite: Annette\'s Great-Aunt Claude Martha. I don\'t know if she\'s a character in the novel or not, but if she isn\'t, then I don\'t care. She is awesome. Why? Not only is she the kindest, most understanding person in the entire cast (unlike Annette, she knows Lucien never meant to hurt Dani!), she gently chastises Annette for her grudge and nudges her to change her ways for the better so she and Lucien can get along again. She even tells Annette that it\'s stupid to not listen to Lucien and judge him over stupid things, but she\'s nice about it and doesn\'t do anything like spank her or yell at her. That\'s what makes a good caregiver! She\'s nice, but doesn\'t gloss over Annette\'s bad decisions, and gently pushes her to improve on her behavior.Which brings me to what I feel is the biggest flaw of the series: Lucien\'s family members, his mom and big sister Marie. For the most part, they\'re better than most anime characters, and I want to like them. I really do. But whenever I get around to liking them, they do something that makes me hate them, especially in later episodes! Lucien\'s mother does have good intentions, but she\'s also bossy, self-centered, and overbearing, and whenever she scolds Lucien for something, she\'ll say something like ""it\'ll be an embarrassment to me if you do this and that!"" and she always talks about punishing him whenever he does something, even though he doesn\'t do it to be bad! She could at least have the decency to at least TRY and understand her child\'s feelings instead of spending her time lecturing him! Heck, Lucien\'s teacher even tells her that scolding him won\'t solve the problem, but she goes and lectures him anyway! Worst of all, his sister, who I used to like, even spanks him 20 times in the same episode! That is NOT how you treat your brother, nor is it a good way to make a child not do something again! And everybody treats it like it happens every day! I know the time period plays a role in this (1900s), but really, I wanted to smack them for choosing to punish Lucien instead of trying to understand his reasons for doing what he does and actually tried to help him. I tried something similar, and my parents and sister NEVER yelled at me or spanked me 20 times to make me not do it again! Instead, they talked things out with me and wanted to help me, and currently I\'m in therapy for it, and it\'s helping a lot! I really wanted to enjoy this show, and it would have been a lot better had they not acted the way they did during that episode! Also, I don\'t like Lucien\'s classmate Jean. He has the most annoying voice I\'ve ever heard next to Kappei from Zambot 3 and PallaPalla from Sailor Moon SuperS!However, I do love and respect this show for taking typical anime cliches and doing something wonderful with them. The show\'s message is this: it\'s better to forgive than to hate. If you spend your whole life hating someone, you\'ll never be happy, and just because someone committed a crime, whether by accident or on purpose, it doesn\'t mean they can\'t repent for it, nor do they deserve having their lives made miserable because of it. And don\'t hold their crime over their head, because that won\'t make things better. In order for this message to get across, those cliches had to be used, and I at least praise the creators for actually having Lucien try to explain his actions--while at the same time not justifying them--even though Annette refused to believe any of it. I especially praise the show for lampshading these cliches and how horrible they are (Aunt Claude). Really, if there\'s a show kids really need to watch, it\'s this one. Why can\'t shows like this be aired in the US?! Kids can handle drama!! We can\'t hide this stuff from them!!This show is the prime example of how to take certain horrible cliches and use them in the best way possible.

I highly recommend it!', ""I watched it exactly  this time of last year. It's amazing as typical of World Master Piece Theater. I liked Annette's Father, who is gentle. I was captivated by the way the animators depicted the sceneries of old Switzerland and the school environment. It reminded me of the adventures of my grandparents (both paternal and maternal ) when they had to go to school in those days.Coming to the summary of my perception of the Story, I liked Lucien than the self-centered Annette. She just does everything against what has been told to her. In comparision...to her,  Dannie ( her little brother) was more considerate of others. I watched it along with my mother and both of us sympathized with Lucien. Repentance was shown in pure action by him. LUCIEN Is the main protagonist of the story. LUCIEN'S skills were amazing with the wood and i wished that evey child in our schools should be taught such work and teachers should support the creativity of them like in the school of Annete.I was worried about her step-mother and my worries were wiped away as the story progressed. All it seem to me like Annette is the MOST LUCKIEST girl in the world to whom all other characters in the anime support greatly and none of her mistakes were seem to bother people around her. Sometimes youngones teach elders some lessons, i mean that she has to learn from her brother.FINALE IS SUPER. JUST WATCH IT.ART: art is of old  style. But it matched the sceneries and narration of old times.MUSIC is appropriate and soothing.Finally i recommend it to everyone and has a moral lesson for every age group and to all individuals of different cultural backgrounds. to her,  Dannie ( her little brother) was more considerate of others.

The pacing is very slow but it worked for the show in the long run. The actual plot of the show doesn't reveal itself until around ep 15.As far as visuals go I mean you get what you get, its nothing amazing, a lot of the backrounds are pretty, but everything is pretty basic.As far as characters go, there are going to be times were your just going to be upset with a character in this show. However I can promise you it doesn't last long as problems (besides the main plot) in this...show seem to get solved pretty quickly. Other than that the main characters are all children and they all act like such, Annette is the classic tomboy with a quick temper, Lucien is her closest friend with a talent for wood carving who at times lets his temper get the best of him as well, and Dani is just a happy go lucky little boy unless he's throwing a tantrum.As far as story goes, it's a good story. Solid 8/10 story. It's going to feel like it drags a bit towards the middle, but if you commit yourself to watching the whole thing there are several emotional payoffs when you get to the end :)So let me just say this, I liked the show. It's not in my top 5 world masterpiece shows, but it was still charming, memorable and all around worth watching. I'll admit there were times were the show just seemed to be dragging on, but by the time I reached the last ep, I was actually a bit emotional.

After the 14th episode, the series takes a dramatic turn, loses its cheerful and relaxing atmosphere and one by one tragic events occur in many forms.The concept of forgiveness is a natural and inescapable part of being human. Is it possible for a person to live their whole life without making any mistakes or without hurting anyone?...It‚Äôs not, since we are not some kind of machine. The necessity of forgiving and being forgiven is an essential requirement of human nature, and this anime contains many well-thought-out examples of this situation.Various cases such as denial of wrongdoing, occurrence of untimely pride issues, failing to share someone‚Äôs pain due to the lack of empathy, seeking revenge rather than forgiveness, delayed apologies and the consequences, self-forgiveness and self-sacrifice are examined thoroughly.As you can see it becomes indeed nerve-wracking to watch this anime from time to time. On the other hand, our lives are full of ups and downs, none of us can spend a perfect and uneventful life. Therefore I think it‚Äôs essential being patient even if it becomes occasionally unbearable to watch. Reaching maturity doesn‚Äôt happen suddenly out of the blue and you know, heart-wrenching angst is a must for children and teenagers to become emotionally mature. Otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt make sense and I can assure you that the ending is definitely worth waiting for.About the animation, nothing special due to the technology of the date, I personally like classic art style of World Masterpiece Theater and must say each character is distinguishable. Facial and bodily expressions of short and long bursts of intense anger, sudden rush of nerves or other emotions like guilt, hatred, remorse, fear, resentment, anxiety, relief, pleasure, joy are reflected particularly well.I‚Äôd like to end the review with a text from the author‚Äôs autobiography: ""The world was settling down after the war, but as the atrocities came to light there was so much anger and hatred. I remembered the boys coming back from the war to wives who had proved unfaithful. I remembered the faces of those who had seen the first photographic exhibition of the horrors of Belsen and the state of the bombed cities of Europe; the resentment of those who could not forgive others, the remorse of those who could not forgive themselves, and I knew that this generation of children needed, above all things, to learn the meaning of forgiveness.""

Then about 2 years ago someone uploaded the last remaining episodes to youtube with captions and I was able to complete the series.The story is about a fictional future where tournaments are held between robots for entertainment. The...protagonist wants to become the pokemon master - err I mean to get the Titan Belt by winning the tournaments. He has team of robots that he acquired from his scientist grandfather. Initially it looks like that is all to the plot. But later it turns out that an evil scientist is planning to steal the technology powering the best robot Daigunder. The story then gives more focus on fighting this dude.What makes it good is that all robots are sentient and have their own personalities. They are able to change their shape and battle capabilities, like in transformers and they are able to fuse with each other to make stronger robots like in gurren lagann.The animation is subpar even for a 2002 anime. I think they could have done better. But that is the only criticism I can find.The story completely ends at 39th episode and does feel complete, unlike pokemon. So if you are looking for a PG show, this is a good bet. You can find all episodes in youtube. protagonist wants to become the pokemon master - err I mean to get the Titan Belt by winning the tournaments.

Black Lagoon Omake,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8440/Black_Lagoon_Omake,"[""If you expect this to be as the first three seasons of Black Lagoon you're wrong. The Omake are just separated stories which have nothing to do with the original story. This serie is basically a comedy where each one of the stories is in a different world.You will probably like this if you like to see the original characters in situations that differ from the original story because that is all it is. "", ""There isn't much to say about this series. Anyone can pretty much know everything about these special episodes by just seeing the cover art. Since no one wrote any review, I wanted to give it a try.It's some special episodes of the Black Lagoon series which is totally different from main series. It's  about comedy & not about action. Main characters of the series are put into many awkward & funny situations resulting in a good comedy.Reasons to watch:It's really funny to see the toughness of the characters gone & they are acting funny & doing childish things.The artwork & the comedy is spectacularly...done.You will definitely like it if you have seen the main series or like comedy. done.You will definitely like it if you have seen the main series or like comedy."", 'Ok.. so i tried to watch this Omake but i could not pass the 2nd episode.The entire crew gets transformed.. Its impossible for me to watch how Revy becomes from a respectable gunslinger to a Magical Fairy.My eyes cannot assimilate such a radical change.But to be fair, if you wanna see some crazy twist and specially some Revy fanservice (If being cute can be considered), then this is your OAV. ', 'If you watched original theres a chance u will not like this because it is not as seryous as original but its extremly funny and intresting to watch... Picture is not as detailed as in regular seasons, but it helps to give out the casuality (dont know how to say that sry). Anyways episodes are short and so even if u dont like it u still will not lose much time XD...Im really sorry for my bad spelling hope it helps... ', 'I say 1 for the story because there is absolutely no story line what so ever. Nothing in these specials match the anime, they are all just a bunch of comical shorts. Remove the hate and seriousness and you are just left with weird comedy and some random violence, that is basically what these Specials are all about. It features all of teh characters in some really weird situations ranging from Magical Girl Revy to all of them going to back to being 9-16 year olds to inverting everybody\'s gender. Its good for a quick laugh and it really leaves you thinking, ""The heck did...I just watch?"" I just watch?""', ""No spoiler review!Black Lagoon Omake is a spin-off of the popular anime series Black Lagoon. The Omake episodes are short, comedic skits that take place outside of the main story arc. As a fan of the original series, I had mixed feelings about the Omake episodes.On one hand, the comedic elements were a welcome change of pace from the intense action and violence of the main series. The Omake episodes provide a nice break from the seriousness of the main story and offer a different look into the characters. The animation and character designs are consistent with the main series and the voice acting is...top-notch as usual.On the other hand, the Omake episodes feel somewhat just something from the main series. The skits are often nonsensical and don't add much to the overall Black Lagoon universe. Also, the episodes rely heavily on slapstick comedy and it can be hit or miss.In conclusion, Black Lagoon Omake is a decent addition to the Black Lagoon franchise. It offers a comedic change of pace and a different look into the characters, but the humour can be hit or miss. If you're a fan of the main series, you might find it amusing, but it's not essential viewing and will not be missing out in anything if you don't watch it aswell. 5/10. top-notch as usual.On the other hand, the Omake episodes feel somewhat just something from the main series.

They are all super short and each one is like a different reality . True that ep2 with Revy being a ""fairy"" wasn\'t that cool but all the other ones were great.That\'s all i really have to say actually . Go check them out you will definitely gain more than you could lose. ', ""Warning possible Spoilers (If there is any)That moment when you find the parody version of an anime series certainly changes your perspective on the show and the characters too because this was one weird, but somehow funny ride.This is basically 7 episodes of 3 minute long parodies of the Black Lagoon characters.I thought it was pretty funny seeing the characters from the show being put into these situations like if they were in High School, having their genders swapped around, seeing Revy as a surprising cute or Kawaii magical girl depending on how you pronounce it, what Balalaika would be like if Hansel and Gretel...were her kids (yeah that's pretty f**king weird) and even showing the characters when they were kids.I had no idea how to react my brain turned to mush watching this, sometimes I was either laughing my ass off or I was just completely weirded out because the focus of the episode was so stupid or just random.There is not really much to talk about the characters since the show is showing them in a parody perspective and their personalities always change each episode since the subject of each episode is always different.The artstyle looked like a child had made it which was probably the point of it since the show itself was a big joke although I felt like they put a lot of effort into making Revy look like a cute as hell magical girl or fairy.The comedy was actually pretty funny, but absolutely weird and random mainly because like I said before my brain turned to mush so I couldn't take the show seriously then again you're not supposed to.Overall this was something that probably didn't need to exist or maybe it existed because of the imagination of the fans, if you're a Black Lagoon fan maybe it's worth watching well it is less than an hour of your life, but I wouldn't watch it if you don't want to spoil the perspective you got from the main series. were her kids (yeah that's pretty f**king weird) and even showing the characters when they were kids.I had no idea how to react my brain turned to mush watching this, sometimes I was either laughing my ass off or I was just completely weirded out because the focus of the episode was so stupid or just random.There is not really much to talk about the characters since the show is showing them in a parody perspective and their personalities always change each episode since the subject of each episode is always different.The artstyle looked like a child had made it which was probably the point of it since the show itself was a big joke although I felt like they put a lot of effort into making Revy look like a cute as hell magical girl or fairy.The comedy was actually pretty funny, but absolutely weird and random mainly because like I said before my brain turned to mush so I couldn't take the show seriously then again you're not supposed to.Overall this was something that probably didn't need to exist or maybe it existed because of the imagination of the fans, if you're a Black Lagoon fan maybe it's worth watching well it is less than an hour of your life, but I wouldn't watch it if you don't want to spoil the perspective you got from the main series."", ""*Sigh*...no I didn't forget about this...I've just been dreading it ever since I saw the ratings on here and the cover for it....let's get this over with...:Story:Uhhh...well, just to name a few, a weird Rule 63 episodes happens where Rock and the other guys get turned into girls and vice versa with the girls, there's a comedy sketch as the last episode which is pretty dumb, Revy turns into a magic girl, and like three school episodes that are all just...weird after freshly coming off of watching the ACTUAL series so...yeah. Just your typical nonsensical fan-service stories. It's just weird to watch this after binging...the entire series.Art:The art's creative and cute and the animation is expressive and nice just like anything Black Lagoon related would be. The visual gags are...okay, I guess, it's just kinda bland and weird to me. The animation overall is just...fine, I guess.Sound:I'm...don't hate the Japanese voices obviously, but seeing as I watched pretty much the entire series in dub, it's a little jarring to hear them, especially when they get weird with the voices for the sake of some throwaway gags...there's not really any crazy music, it's kinda goofy voicing and slapstick sounds and not much else.Character:The characters act either entirely OUT of character or its just them being overly exaggerated, it's not as annoying as I thought it would be, that being said it still kinda bugs me how some the characters completely don't act like themselves, even Higurashi's OVAs were kinda better because at their the characters have been established to have soft sides, while with this show we've mostly just seen em' shoot at each other and literally murder some of these characters, so it's just jarring and weird to see.Overall:...Honestly, this is up to you. This still didn't really hurt my love for the series, but it's certainly not something I'm gonna watch ever again like I would with the rest of the series.

Brave Witches,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32866/Brave_Witches,"[""Anime's featuring girls with magic that fight against invaders are one of the most common and popular anime genres in japan and as a result is quite popular and common. What sets brave witches apart from this is that its set within an alternate world where the various powers that would have fought ww2 have united to defend against the threat of an invasion by an alien race called the Neuroi. As a result Brave witches which is a spin off that takes place between the the first and second seasons of the strike witches anime is a combo of a military and magical girls...anime.The main story of Brave witches follows the adventures of of Hikari Karibuchi a young witch that lives on the island nation of Sasebo as she joins the 502nd Joint fighter squadron in Orussia as they fight in the war against the Neuroi. Just as it is in fighting the war a crucial point of the story also deals with Hikari's establishments of friendships with the members of the squadron and her quest to get strong as well.As stated the story of the anime takes place within an alternate earth and in this case largely takes place within the country of Orussia which is the alternate alter ego of Russia. Being an international effort other nearby countries that existed in that time period also contributes personal to the squadron.Hikari voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk wars and Rokka of the six flowers fame is one of the main characters of the show. A young witch that lives in the country of Sasebo thats part of the island of Fusu thats also the alternate version of Japan. Hikari is the younger sister of Takami Karabuchi a veteran witch and a rather famous one that is known for her accomplishments in the war against the Neuroi. Hikari's relationship with her sister Takami is one of the central points of the story and a well executed one at that. Personality wise Hikari is brave, determined and kind with perhaps her determination being her most prominent trait. Hikari's skills as a witch is not as powerful as her sister and indeed not much use to the squadron that she joined due to her low magic but instead of feeling dejected she consistently trains herself with endurance runs that take place in any weather. It is especially comical seeing Hikari do her runs in just her uniforms and bloomers when the areas around her are frozen solid. Hikari's determination to get stronger both to be of use to her friends in the squadron and to make her sister proud is an enduring trait of hers and seeing her manage to beat every trial that was stopping her really is nice to see. It was also nice to see that her quest to get strong has also allowed her to bond with and make friends with her squad mates who had low opinions of her at the beginning and eventually join them as a full member. Hikai i felt was a pretty good character that showed that with determination and perseverance one can clear any hardship and trial thats stands in your way.Takami played by new seiyuu Rie Suegara is one of the main characters of the show. The older sister of Hikari Takami is a veteran witch and a veteran of the Neuroi war that is well known for her accomplishments in many battles of the war. Due to her abilities she was reassigned to the Orussia front to take part in a major operation there at the start of the anime that turned out to be anything but. Takami is confident, friendly and professional person that has little ego in the way and gets on well with people. Takami's relationship with her sister is an interesting one in that she cares deeply for Hikari but at the same time she is very protective of her knowing the limits of her magic and tries to protect her by not having her on the field at all. This does clash against the wishes of both Hikari and her squad mates and form one of the sub arcs of the last part of the anime. This aspect of her personality is actually quite understandable as having seen the ravages of war anyone would try and prevent their friends and family from entering it and taking the risks that are inherent on the field.Despite being a new seiyuu i felt that Rie Suegara did a great job portraying Takami.Naoe Kanno that is better known by her family name Kanno is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by veteran seiyuu Rie Murakawa of log horizon fame. An aggressive and somewhat arrogant witch that is also a bit of a tsundere Kanno is a part of the 502nd joint fighter squadron and is one of Hikari's squad mates. Kanno and Hikari had a rather cold start to their friendship as Kanno had expected Hikari's sister who Kanno admires to be the one that would join them only to see Hikari instead. As a result their relationship was a bit rocky at first and true to her tsundere personality it wasn't until Hikari started to prove herself to her and the others that Kanno herself started to warm to her. Despite that Kanno still acts like a typical Tsundere well after that fact despite being one of Hikari's eventual best friends.Nika better known as Nippa to Hikari and co is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by veteran seiyuu Natsumi Takamori of Orange fame. A witch from the country of Suomus Nippa is a carefree, honest and fun loving witch that also has a big heart and often tries to stop arguments from breaking out between Hikari and Kanno. Nippa is part of the break witches group a group of witches that consistently trashes their engine units accidentally while engaged in their duties with Nippa being the worst offender of this group. Nippa was one of the first members of the squadron to befriend and bond with Hikari as both share similar circumstances with both being posted to a place where they know no one. This shared bonding i felt was interesting and quite natural given the circumstances. Nippa cares a great deal about Hikari and is one of her closest friends and allies in the squadron.Edytha Roffman known as Roffman sensei to Hikari and sensei to the others is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by veteran seiyuu Hiromi Igarashi of high school fleet fame. A veteran witch from Karlsland which is the alter ego of Germany in this alternate earth Edytha is a calm, methodical and logical person that acts as the second in command to the squadron and specializing in tactics and instruction. Within the story Edytha was one of the members that did not place must faith in Hikari which is the reason why she decided to train her in the first place. Despite appearing to be somewhat unforgiving towards her students Edytha has a strong sense of responsibility and would like to see Hikari succeed under her care. Edytha actually has a strong personal reason for being strict that i thought was interesting and seeing Hikari struggle in her training actually reminded her of that. Edytha like the others eventually saw the good in Hikari's skills and become one of her strongest allies and friends in the squadron. I thought that Edytha was a pretty good character and that her seiyuu Hiromi Igarashi did a great job portraying her. Seeing Edytha actually be moved by Hikari's determination was a nice thing to see.Aleksandra known as Sasha to her friends is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by veteran seiyuu Yumi Hara of Log Horizon fame. A veteran witch and a captain within the Orussia air force Sasha is generally in charge of combat operations in the absence of Rall. As a captain Sasha is a capable commander and strategist and additionally serves as the squadrons mechanic as her ability as a witch is related to maintenance of equipment. A professional, by the book and somewhat up tight person Sasha tries to remain detached during operations and only look at missions from a objective point of view that can clash with the likes of Hikari. Ironically that her story arc had her revisiting her hometown that she has not been too for some time and revisiting buried memories that she never knew she had. One of her most prominent traits is perhaps her uniform in that she is the only one that wears a skirt that really stands her out among the cast. A running gag within the series is her arguments with Nippa over her breaking of her units which i found to be pretty funny.Waltrud is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by new seiyuu Kayo Ishida. A veteran witch of the Karlsland air force like Edytha Waltrud is a mature, funny and professional person that never less can be easily distracted and also be quite reckless in battle. She is part of the Break witches along with Kanno and Nippa. However despite appearing laid back and humorous Waltrud can get serious when she see's her friends in danger and when she does gets serious she's a far different person to her usual joking self. A recurring theme of Waltruds is her horrible cooking skills and her womanizing ways and indeed Edytha is always the one that keeps her in line.Shinohara Sadako is one of the main characters of the show and is voiced by new seiyuu Marin Mizutani. Like Hikari and Takami Shinohara comes from the country of Fusu and is one of the flight leads of the squadron specializing in recon duty due to her special abilities of magic eyesight. Additionally Shinohara also serves as the squadrons cook being an accomplished chef of her own right. Seeing Shinohara manage to make the characters happy with her food alone is hearwarming to see. Personality wise Shinohara is more like a mother in that she is caring, motherly and compassionate towards other while at the same time caring of others as well. The story arc that allowed Hikari to befriend both Shinohara and Georgette was a great one that i quite liked due to its simplicity. For a new seiyuu i thought that Marin Mizutani did a great job portraying Shinohara.Georgette portrayed by veteran seiyuu Haruka Terui of Haito gensou no grimgar fame is the combat medic of the squadron and one of the main characters of the show. A witch from Gallia which is the alter ego of France in this alternate earth. Within the squadron Georgette serves as both the combat medic charged with keeping the squad members operational and also the resident cleaner as well. Despite being a healer she also actively takes part in combat with the rest of the squadron and has some skill in defensive maneuvers. Personality wise Georgette is a rather shy and meek girl thats also very quiet as well. Georgette doesn't deal well with strangers which is the reason why she avoided Hikari in the first place. However as a result of the arc that she shared with Shinohara Georgette eventually become good friends with Hikari. Georgette is one of my favorite characters of the show in that she's a rather gentle character thats at the same time kind and caring towards other while not being a total klutz lol.Haruka Terui i felt did a pretty good job portraying her.Arts and animationArt for the series i felt was pretty good with the character designs being especially detailed and impressive. The environments shown was also detailed and well colored. The designs of the flying units that the girls use as well as the guns that they fired i felt were pretty well designed and animated. The combat scenes within the anime i felt were well designed and animated and some of them were very impressive.MusicMusic for the series was pretty good especially the opening and ending themes.Voice actingVoice acting as a whole was pretty good and i felt that the series had a well rounded and talented cast. The series had a number of new seiyuus whose role in this anime was their first main roles and i felt that these which in this case included Kayo Ishida, Rie Suegara and Marin Mizutani did a great job in portraying their characters here. It also helps that the series also featured a number of veteran seiyuu's like Yumi Hara who voiced Sasha and Ai Kakuma and Haruka Terui who played the characters of Hikari and Georgette respectively that were able to help them and support them.ConclusionIn conclusion i felt that Brave witches was a great anime in that it had a great story that emphasized on duty and friendship and a great setting that allowed witches of different countries to come together to face a common threat together. The series had some great characters that were all unique in their own right and a great cast of seiyuu's to portray. The arts and animation i thought was pretty good and the combat scenes got better and more detailed as the series went on. In the end i really enjoyed the story and while i haven't seen the strike witches anime that Brave witches sits between i might give that a ago as i liked the concept of girls armed with magic fight against alien invaders. anime.The main story of Brave witches follows the adventures of of Hikari Karibuchi a young witch that lives on the island nation of Sasebo as she joins the 502nd Joint fighter squadron in Orussia as they fight in the war against the Neuroi.

Despite being a healer she also actively takes part in combat with the rest of the squadron and has some skill in defensive maneuvers. Personality wise Georgette is a rather shy and meek girl thats also very quiet as well. Georgette doesn't deal well with strangers which is the reason why she avoided Hikari in the first place. However as a result of the arc that she shared with Shinohara Georgette eventually become good friends with Hikari. Georgette is one of my favorite characters of the show in that she's a rather gentle character thats at the same time kind and caring towards other while not being a total klutz lol.Haruka Terui i felt did a pretty good job portraying her.Arts and animationArt for the series i felt was pretty good with the character designs being especially detailed and impressive. The environments shown was also detailed and well colored. The designs of the flying units that the girls use as well as the guns that they fired i felt were pretty well designed and animated. The combat scenes within the anime i felt were well designed and animated and some of them were very impressive.MusicMusic for the series was pretty good especially the opening and ending themes.Voice actingVoice acting as a whole was pretty good and i felt that the series had a well rounded and talented cast. The series had a number of new seiyuus whose role in this anime was their first main roles and i felt that these which in this case included Kayo Ishida, Rie Suegara and Marin Mizutani did a great job in portraying their characters here. It also helps that the series also featured a number of veteran seiyuu's like Yumi Hara who voiced Sasha and Ai Kakuma and Haruka Terui who played the characters of Hikari and Georgette respectively that were able to help them and support them.ConclusionIn conclusion i felt that Brave witches was a great anime in that it had a great story that emphasized on duty and friendship and a great setting that allowed witches of different countries to come together to face a common threat together. The series had some great characters that were all unique in their own right and a great cast of seiyuu's to portray. The arts and animation i thought was pretty good and the combat scenes got better and more detailed as the series went on. In the end i really enjoyed the story and while i haven't seen the strike witches anime that Brave witches sits between i might give that a ago as i liked the concept of girls armed with magic fight against alien invaders."", ""Brave Witches it's a spin-off of Striker Witches, but unlike the main show, Brave Witches had less ecchi and it's focus more in the plot and the development of the characters.When I saw Strike Witches I had a big problem with the main character. It feels that Yoshika it's introduce as a complete developed character for the first chapters...With Hikari I hadn't that problem, when you saw her in the first scenes you could understand perfectly that she's trying to reach someone, this someone is her own sister, Takami. Here we have the perfect point to start the plot.We have a reason to...follow Hikari's path. As I said with Yoshika I don't have this feeling until the end of the first season and all the second season.The story. It has the same background, Witches fighting an alien race called Neuroi.  But as I wrote in the previous paragraph, the plot it's about Hikari trying to reach her big sister, because surpass it's her goal.Speaking about the art of the anime, Silver Link has its own type of Drawing and it's beautiful. In Brave Witches the color, is well defined and invites to continue watching the anime.About the sound... well it's good, the think that you will remember it's the opening, the ost it's not a think that I would remember.About Characters, the episodes are focused in introduce us the Witches that form the 502nd Joint Fighter Wing and give they more importance than the Striker Witches 501. I mean, in Brave Witches you will see how Hikari relates to her companion in the 502. In Strike Witches I remember that until the second season we didn't know what power had each one.I really enjoy with this anime. The best it's that this anime doesn't have an excessive amount of fanservice.Overall, I think that if you watch Strike Witcher and you didn't like it you should see Brave Witches. follow Hikari's path.

I know I didn\'t write that good of reviews back when I wrote it, but it\'s been helpful to people, so I\'m not completely changing it.  Even when I\'m trying to write better reviews now, they\'re aren\'t necessarily getting as many helpful replies as even older, kind of poorly written, reviews, so no sense changing one of the begging reviews if it\'s been more helpful than a good amount of the better written ones.  Anyhow, I realized when watching the dub as it was airing, just how sub par the animation quality is...due to the use of so much 3d cgi and I\'m changing my score just slightly because of it.  Unless I give a number rating to the category, assume it\'s still a personal 10.As you can tell from my profile I\'m a huge Strike/ Brave Witches fan despite not reading the manga yet and not having a lot of merchandise.  Both shows are just simple fun and have a bunch of characters that are easy to like and there\'s a lot of great character interactions.Although, the story is pretty much the same, Brave Witches is different.  To start, there\'s a lot less fan service. aka panty shots.  All the characters are also new and Eila and Sanya actually appear in three different episodes, even though their appearances are brief; it was nice to see them since Strike Witches the movie showed that they are good friends with Nikka, aka Nipa. Character special abilities were different too.  Since some differentiation was needed, these three bits worked.The story is definitely weak, but I won\'t take points off because I don\'t care if the story is strong or weak, usually.  It\'s just about a young Witch being recognized by a  squadron and having to work harder than anyone else just to meet the minimal requirements.  Just like Strike Witches, this story of growth has it\'s own flare with wonderful characters interactions, fun scenes, amazingly fun to watch yet simplistic battles, and so much more.The art is very well done for the type of show it is, even though it wasn\'t always consistent, but a lot of show aren\'t and at least, the picture didn\'t seem to get really grainy for no reason.  I\'m taking a point off though because the sub par 3d cgi does ruin a look slightly and it affects the visual experience enough to deem a 1 point reduction, even though I love the memorable character designs and everything else., making my score a 9/10.  The animation is sub par though, due to the 3d cgi so I\'m only giving a 6 for this part.I\'d have to say that Brave Witches/ shows and things based on the Strike Witches world always shine with amazing theme songs, great character development, and amazing character interactions.  Out of all the opening and ending themes, the only 1 I can take or leave is Fly Beyond from the Operation Victory Arrow episode for Francesca and Shirley.  Connect Link, the Brave Witches opening, and Little Wing-Spirit of Lindberg (BW ending) are three of my favorite anime theme songs.  The background music is amazingly done too and it stands out from other soundtracks even though some tracks seem to be repeated with different lengths, slightly modified sound, etc.I\'ve always loved the characters, character development, and the interactions between characters as well.  My order of favorite characters goes: Takami, Edytha, Nipa, Gundula Rall, Geogette, Waltrud, Hikari, Sadako, Sasha, Naoe; I don\'t hate any of them, but they can\'t all get top spots. Almost every character gets their own episode to show their development, and of course Hikari\'s too.  They still develop beyond what\'s seen in their episode, but the major highlights about the thoughts and feelings are shown in their episode.Overall, I have no major complaints.  I\'ve always loved the Witches from this world, even though I definitely like some as much as others or even as much as characters from other shows.  For me, the enjoyment was definitely there, but it is slightly lessened due to the 3d cgi messing up the visual aspect slighty;  my enjoyment still ranks a 9.5/10 though.   Brave Witches is one of three anime that I\'ve watched from like September to now that have pretty much instantly made it into my top favorites; the other two being ""The Future Diary"" and ""The Seven Deadly Sins"".  It\'s definitely  an honor for an anime to be an instant favorite since it doesn\'t happen all that often.  Well, that\'s all I got and thanks for reading.  It would be a really time consuming task to list out all of the character development and such so I\'m sorry that category doesn\'t have a lot of detail.I forgot to add that you\'ll get to see a very funny scene with Nikka (Nipa) and Naoe towards the end of episode 12.New last remark (from the edit):  My final score is now a 9.4 instead of a perfect 10.  It\'s not a huge switch in my score, but I felt that I should re-evaluate it a little, after I noticed the sub par use of the 3d cgi.  My final scores are 10 for story, 10 for characters, 10 for sound, 7.5 for art and animation combined, and 9.5 for enjoyment.

(like the creators will ever see this lolz)after finishing watching brave witches and had recently finished watching strike witches (season 1 and 2 with movie) it seems this series was more like a cash in on the franchise, first off why introduce a new main character if you are just going to copy the likeness of the previous one, if you have seen the strike witches the movie you know that the main character can still fight...soo why not just keep the chars we had?. i swear at first i really couldnt tell the diference if it wasnt for a lame segment where hikari sees a news paper about unit 501 and how they won their battle, the side chars are not nearly as close as beeing memorable as the previous chars, i think they realized this so the had some cameos in some of the episodes. if the hole world witches deal is true i hope they dont wait time making new chars, i would say maybe less chars so you can put more time on to the plot and not char development. other than that animation and sound efects where good. soo why not just keep the chars we had?. i swear at first i really couldnt tell the diference if it wasnt for a lame segment where hikari sees a news paper about unit 501 and how they won their battle, the side chars are not nearly as close as beeing memorable as the previous chars, i think they realized this so the had some cameos in some of the episodes. if the hole world witches deal is true i hope they dont wait time making new chars, i would say maybe less chars so you can put more time on to the plot and not char development. other than that animation and sound efects where good.', 'iTS GUD AS DIS GUY SAID :""Brave Witches it\'s a spin-off of Striker Witches, but unlike the main show, Brave Witches had less ecchi and it\'s focus more in the plot and the development of the characters.""its 2021, After watching the Strike Witches Road to Berlin, i can concluded dat Brave Witches is still the best in  strike witches series, although it categorized as a spin off.,Well, DON\'T Believe the ""BELOW 7 RATING"" dis series had. While strike witches had avarage 7 rating in MAL (as per today), it doesn\'t compared to Brave witches Story plot.i mean , In Brave Witches they emphasis not...only just air, but The Ground Troops as well.  Even from this series we can even confirm the existence of  Ground Witches (witch equip with ground arsenal) although its just a cameo. Dis was just the tip of it, Brave witches offer something dat the original series didn\'t have bcuz They had little time and money to tell dis kind thing In strike witches.Yes the Road to Berlin had a massive fight including ground troops as well, but it happens at the late episode while the rest are filled with Ecchi....., and stuff...... only just air, but The Ground Troops as well.

Not only is she best girl and super cute she also has the bottom half of her outfit on. Yes, that is right she has a skirt on.The second place goes to Naoe Kanno who is a proper Tsundere so always cute to see. Cute design also.Overall best girl is still Sanya from the 501st who is just perfect.This time around we have a good storyline to follow that is taken much more seriously than Strike Witches but also has cameo appearances. This...one also has a satisfying continuity that makes sense and also ties into the universe well.I would say that this time although Hikari the main to begin with was a bit hard to like she was great in the end and this season by episode 12 has actually a really great ending that wraps it up nicely.The art is great and better than the last one. It is far less Ecchi but that is also still very much here but a bit more restrained. The only issue with the art is sometimes in a fast-paced action scene it goes into a more CGI look which doesn't actually fit greatly and suddenly switches back to the normal art.Sound is really well done too. Voices (Japanese) fit nicely.Characters are built up very strongly in this. You get a good amount of backstory and reasoning to why people do things. You also get to see some of the normal people a tiny bit more.Overall, I would say this was a great show. It ticks many boxes and is only let down slightly in a few places.

The shock that you could turn WWII fighter jets into small Japanese and British girls and pit them against literal space-nazis in a weird U.N. coalition alternate timeline that also featured superpowers granted only to the aforementioned pubescent girls was new. The final item in the mix? None of them are ever wearing pants. It was an ecchi-military-action-moe-comedy that catered to such an incredibly niche audience you couldn\'t help but be endeared. The question of who would watch this was overshadowed by how was this made. Of course, Strike Witches became a cult...classic.Now after two seasons, a film, and some spin-off OVAs the second iteration of Strike Witches called Brave Witches is here. With the exception of cameos, none of the original cast of characters return. The original series seemed to be pretty concluded, so the existence of this third season is already a bit confounding. You could honestly watch this series as a standalone work and I\'m pretty sure that was why this work involved a name change instead of a sequential numbering. It\'s formulaic to the original work down to the final battle, and Brave Witches greatest problem is that the shock value has completely worn off.The reason why Strike Witches worked was because it was so bombastic and so unapologetic. There were episodes dedicated to dumb ecchi shenanigans in ways that made your jaw drop. These were never overtly sexual, they were just really really ridiculous. Episodes dedicated to one of the girls refusing to put on underwear to attend an award ceremony and another one involving how to pick up brooms with your ass. These thinly veiled attempts at keeping the viewer involved worked because they were so outrageous. The creators had come up with an insane and nonsensical setting, story line, and character backgrounds all for what? To show you panty shots. It sounds stupid and it is. But it\'s that overly-complex dedication that wooed me and others to this series.The reason why Brave Witches doesn\'t work is because it is safe and repetitive. The characters still don\'t wear pants but it feels natural at this point. The shock of the new is gone, and the dedication to create insane new scenarios to perplex the viewer seems to have left the creators\' minds. The narrative from episode one to twelve is an atypical shounen series. The main character decides to join the Brave Witches despite not having any talent for magic and then ends up attempting to save the world. The characters are more muted than they were in the previous series, with most of them barely receiving any characterization or memorable lines. The worst part is that each character seems to be a carbon copy of a character from Strike Witches. Even the visuals don\'t look like they have been updated since 2007. For a 2017 anime, Brave Witches feels like it\'s just punching the clock.My parting words on this series is that I really didn\'t expect much from it and I was still let down. As a fan of Strike Witches the last thing I expected from Brave Witches was wholesome family content and that\'s what I got. If Brave Witches wanted to lecture me about camaraderie and familial bonds I genuinely wished these girls were wearing pants. And that is the saddest part of Brave Witches.

What\'s left is a generic mess riding on the coattails of it\'s parent series former glory.', 'What I find fascinating about Brave Witches is the fact that its protagonist is different in just about every way to that of Strike Witches\'. Whereas Yoshika has prodigious levels of latent magic power, Hikari has less than average, and isn\'t much good at using it either. This creates a set of problems for her that Yoshika never even had to think about, for example where Yoshika was scouted Hikari had to prove herself, a feat possible only with her incredible levels of grit and stamina. This extended socially as well, manifesting in Kanno. While Yoshika and Lynne became friends because they saw eye-to-eye and...related heavily to each other, Hikari and Kanno start out hating each other\'s guts. Right, ""each other\'s."" I appreciate that Hikari responds to Kanno\'s aggression with a reasonable amount of her own, which is something I couldn\'t imagine Yoshika doing. That, too, is part of Hikari\'s determination, I find.Those two and Takami were the best characters in Brave though, most of the rest weren\'t quite as interesting or lovable, (but they were still cute) though they have potential were we to get another season. (Which we should.)I\'ve heard people say Brave\'s art and animation is a lot better, which you might think based on the date and studio, but nah, some of that CGI was pretty bad. Still looks good overall.Brave Witches is much more about Hikari, as opposed to Strike Witches tending to focus more on everyone, so even with its inferior cast Brave can get surprisingly close to Strike in overall enjoyability for me. While Strike is a more episodic show about the world\'s best witches beating the strongest Neuroi and living together, Brave is the story of Hikari\'s growth and acceptance into a community despite the odds, and for that I think it deserves more credit than it gets. That\'s not to say Strike lacks such things, but Strike can do it for everyone so it\'s different than Brave pretty much dedicating itself entirely to it. related heavily to each other, Hikari and Kanno start out hating each other\'s guts.

It's made clear early on that Hikari is crippled with inherently low magic, and thus has to improvise her fighting style in that she has to choose between her shield or her flying, both which require magic to run on. Hikari thus has to focus all her magic on maintaining her Striker Unit (flying device) and instead has to learn how to dodge attacks in a way that would make Strike Witches' Eila proud. On top of that, she has an elder sister Takami who DOES have amazing magical abilities and is a decorated war hero.From the very start, Hikari, because of her average abilities, is the underdog. No one really expects any amazing feats from her because of it, and the fact her elder sister is far more talented too. But Hikari doesn't see her sister as someone she feels inferior to, rather, she looks up to Takami as her inspiration for joining the war in the first place.The greatest thing about Brave Witches' protagonist is that she doesn't have a genius father or amazingly overpowered magical abilities like Strike Witches' Yoshika does, it's that Hikari makes do with what little she does have in hard work and effort, and it shows.Hikari's initial induction into the Brave Witches squadron is not even intentional like it is with her predecessor, it's all by accident and whim of the Takami's higher up in the squad who pities Hikari after her sister is put out of action after a battle.The underdog position Hikari has to deal with is fleshed out well by her interactions with other squadron members like Kanno, who doesn't particularly warm up to her or take well to the inferior sister taking over for Takami, even in name. Hikari spends the first episodes training in order to prove to her flight instructor that she is fit for combat, even if she's not as good as Takami.I've never liked a Witches franchise protagonist as much as I have Hikari, because despite being the underdog in a world that is against her, she doesn't give up until she can prove she's not just talk.Brave Witches isn't 100% perfect however, as the semi-finale episode forces Hikari to prove herself the better Witch against her sister, and the writers throw a curveball at viewers expecting Hikari to overcome her sister in cliche shonen battle anime style, by having her realistically fail and is a subverting genre twist that so surprising it makes it feel like Hikari's protagonist position has been usurped. Despite the unexpected however, the finale more than makes up for the subversion and Hikari's training pays off, leaving me wanting for a Brave Witches Season 2. Another thing I could find fault with is the lack of characterization for Gundala Rall, the Brave Witches' squadron leader, who only comes off as a stiff but caring military type. If there ever is a sequel, I would like to see some backstory for her.Art is much better than it was back in the Strike Witches first season, and the soundtrack is memorable for the ages, with each track being used for a specific mood or scene.Overall, this was even more enjoyable than even the emotional Strike Witches The Movie.And to be clear, this series can stand completely on its own without comparisons to Strike Witches, and is a good entry point for anyone new to the World Witches franchise who desires good characterization over excessive fanservice. witch whose Gigantic overpowered magical shield and healing abilities make her a natural genius talent wise; she isn't particularly challenged by the Neuroi enemies because of her strong powers, and thus doesn't make for that interesting a character to develop.On the other hand, Hikari is a witch who can barely generate a shield effectively enough to block enemy attacks, let alone make a big one. It's made clear early on that Hikari is crippled with inherently low magic, and thus has to improvise her fighting style in that she has to choose between her shield or her flying, both which require magic to run on. Hikari thus has to focus all her magic on maintaining her Striker Unit (flying device) and instead has to learn how to dodge attacks in a way that would make Strike Witches' Eila proud. On top of that, she has an elder sister Takami who DOES have amazing magical abilities and is a decorated war hero.From the very start, Hikari, because of her average abilities, is the underdog. No one really expects any amazing feats from her because of it, and the fact her elder sister is far more talented too. But Hikari doesn't see her sister as someone she feels inferior to, rather, she looks up to Takami as her inspiration for joining the war in the first place.The greatest thing about Brave Witches' protagonist is that she doesn't have a genius father or amazingly overpowered magical abilities like Strike Witches' Yoshika does, it's that Hikari makes do with what little she does have in hard work and effort, and it shows.Hikari's initial induction into the Brave Witches squadron is not even intentional like it is with her predecessor, it's all by accident and whim of the Takami's higher up in the squad who pities Hikari after her sister is put out of action after a battle.The underdog position Hikari has to deal with is fleshed out well by her interactions with other squadron members like Kanno, who doesn't particularly warm up to her or take well to the inferior sister taking over for Takami, even in name. Hikari spends the first episodes training in order to prove to her flight instructor that she is fit for combat, even if she's not as good as Takami.I've never liked a Witches franchise protagonist as much as I have Hikari, because despite being the underdog in a world that is against her, she doesn't give up until she can prove she's not just talk.Brave Witches isn't 100% perfect however, as the semi-finale episode forces Hikari to prove herself the better Witch against her sister, and the writers throw a curveball at viewers expecting Hikari to overcome her sister in cliche shonen battle anime style, by having her realistically fail and is a subverting genre twist that so surprising it makes it feel like Hikari's protagonist position has been usurped. Despite the unexpected however, the finale more than makes up for the subversion and Hikari's training pays off, leaving me wanting for a Brave Witches Season 2.

The Neuroi too were such a step-up from the past seasons, it\'s great seeing the witches have to use their brains to take out the neuroi.Hikari Karibuchi\'s magic struggle no doubt made Brave Witches very compelling to watch as a story.Plus the neuroi became smarter, making the battle scenes give me the same hype akin to good shounen fight scenes.Brave Witches is not ""meh,"" and it is much more than just a ""spinoff."" The flawed but hardworking 502nd Brave Witches should have its own franchise, a foil to Strike...Witches\' super-aces that never fail. Witches\' super-aces that never fail.', 'Brave Witches is the story of Karibuchi Hikari, who joins the 502nd Joint Wing, hoping to meet the expectations of her older sister and become a greatly skilled witch. It is a sequel and spin-off to the Strike Witches anime series, and the second anime in the World Witches series.When I started Episode 1, I\'d expected a direct clone of Strike Witches. Due to the similarities in some characters, I didn\'t expect to like Brave Witches much at all. However, one concurrent theme used between characters in Brave Witches had me like it a slight bit above Strike Witches.I found Brave Witches to be its...own underlying story about meeting the expectations of someone who is more skilled than oneself. Our main character, Hikari, aims to be like her older sister, Takami. However, living in the shadow of Takami, Hikari finds herself being treated as the much lesser and weaker sibling. Hikari\'s story arc is hinted from Episode 1 and is explored more thorougly throughout the Brave Witches anime. Yoshika had a similar character arc in Strike Witches, although it was more of an internal struggle where Yoshika wanted to have powerful magic like her mother and grandmother. Hikari constantly fights to be as strong and skilled as Takami, centering around both an internal and external struggle.By using Takami to tell the ""expectations"" narrative, it gives some of the best developmental moments for World Witches series\' characters by far. Hikari goes through the challenge of trying to be like her sister, although she slowly learns that to grow her skills, she must distance herself from meeting Takami\'s expectations, attempting to do what Takami does, and to accept and be herself.Kanno, another character with a major story arc in Brave Witches, has become one of my favorite characters in the World Witches series. Kanno, along with Hikari, have brought the most interesting character arcs I\'ve seen in Strike Witches yet. Kanno, at first, loathed Hikari. She simply saw Hikari as the ""total opposite"" younger sister of Takami; No skill outside of stamina. However, being exposed to Hikari\'s unwavering will to improve her skill, and that Hikari\'s undergoing a similar struggle of wanting to become stronger, Kanno opens up much more and becomes more relaxed around Hikari.Outside of her character arc, I enjoy Kanno\'s personality, as she has a slight ""rebellious"" nature. This is characterized by her dressing style, foul-mouth, and her fighting style. Oh man, Kanno\'s fighting style is awesome. She uses her fists rather than just firearms.Hikari and Kanno definitely get the most screentime, as Kanno\'s story arc closes around Episode 10. Though, because of the focus these characters get, the rest of the 502nd Joint Wing get little to no screentime. This is to the point that I don\'t even remember most of their names, save for Sasha and Krupinski, both of which have miniature story arcs.Furthermore, the art is a lot more pleasing than the 2007-2014 period of Strike Witches. It seems that the art style and animation for the World Witches series improves with every new release. I don\'t have any problems with fanservice, but when compared to Strike Witches, it has been severely toned down. Though in Brave Witches, the toned down fanservice has its benefits, mainly in action scenes where we get extravagant shots of a character\'s attack.Speaking of World Witches, Sanya and Eila, two characters of Strike Witches, had little screentime in Operation Victory Arrow and The Movie. So, the two receive spotlight for half an episode and an OVA, effectively a crossover between Strike Witches and Brave Witches.In terms of sound, there are some repetitive songs in the anime\'s soundtrack. They are not bothersome, nor memorable. The soundtrack is serviceable. The opening song, however, is amazing. It elicits emotion and describes how it would feel if an anime came back after several years, which for Strike Witches to Brave Witches was 6+ years (not counting the movie and OVA). The visuals in the opening aren\'t spectacular. Once again, they are serviceable. It gives you everything you need to know, including Hikari\'s story arc and the Brave Witches in action. The song itself carries the opening, being so good that there is not a single episode that I skipped it. The ending song is alright.Overall, I found the underlying themes of attempting to meet the expectations of someone that overshadows you, and the attachment the Brave Witches grew for Hikari incredibly moving.

I am very well versed in the franchise by reading the novels, manga, short storys, watching the anime, translating several works, and operating two Strike Witches fan communities with the intent of using the powerful fanbase to create new and exciting things. So... while I intend this review to be more of a constructive-criticism type... it may come off to some people as overhwelmingly negative. This doesn\'t mean that I didn\'t...like it... it just means that I went in with exceedingly high expectations, only to set myself up for disappointment when Brave Witches brought nothing new and exciting to the table. So if you want the brief review, here it is: Brave Witches is a stagnant installation to the series and is at best, a mediocre product that is the result of a careless cash-in opportunity.So uhh.... if you wanna hear more misery like that, please read on! If not, I hope you will read my words and garner a better understanding of my critical perspectives. Enjoy!SETTING ‚Äì 7/10For those familiar with the World Witches franchise, I don‚Äôt have to do a lot of explanation on the setting. Set in an alternate World War II situation where mankind is fighting a common alien threat, the Neuroi, Brave Witches is the third anime series produced in the World Witches franchise after a movie and 3 episode OVA series. It is the first animation project to adapt the story of the 502nd Joint Fighter Wing based in Petersburg, Orussia, A cold, desolate, and snow-covered territory being overrun by a Neuroi hive known as ‚ÄòGrigori.‚Äô When the announcement for a new World Witches anime was made, I was incredibly excited that we‚Äôd be following a different squadron in a different location. The grittier and less luxurious nature of the Orussian base is in stark contrast to the posh and colorful Mediterranean setting of the Strike Witches anime. While more detail of the Orussian front could‚Äôve been explored over the 12 episode TV run, it still offered a new perspective on the series that I think a lot of the fans stuck on the surface can dive into a little more. The producers‚Äô decision to move on to another squadron is progressive and crucial to keeping the series alive.The Neuroi enemy itself doesn‚Äôt shine quite as brightly in Brave Witches as they did before, feeling more like an episodic ‚ÄúVillain of the Day‚Äù type of antagonist rather than a looming, dangerous, and mysterious one with a solid backstory. In fact, Brave Witches did little in the way of explaining anything about the Neuroi or where they come from ‚Äì something that has bothered Strike Witches fans for a very long time. Instead, there is a sense of detachment between the writers of the anime and the original works in that they are adding too many complexities and new concepts such as shape-shifting and ice-forming Neuroi into a setting that is already very complicated and not fully fleshed out. Magic has also been used in new ways, almost as a convenient plot device where it could\'ve benefited the 501st JFW, had they been given the same skills in their anime. In this way, Brave Witches almost feels like a step back because they have essentially written themselves into a bigger hole to climb out of. Instead of getting the answers we wanted from this series, I believe it only raised more questions. Luckily a few hints of creativity and a refreshing snowy white battlefield was just what we needed to get the series rolling again and hopefully more anime features in new and unique locales will follow.STORY ‚Äì 7/10Upon the initial announcement, fans could easily assume that the story would be a fairly close adaptation to the original short story written about the 502nd Joint Fighter Wing, but in fact it never even touched on the literature. Instead of Shimohara Sadako taking the lead role, we are set to follow the Karibuchi sisters in their life-changing experiences with the Orrusian unit. Brave Witches is nothing short of a predictable and old-fashioned story of triumph in the face of adversity as we watch the young and zealous Hikari take place of her elder sister Takami whose overconfidence put her in a life-threatening situation. The story of how Hikari joined the 502nd and her attempts to fit in are admittedly more brief and sincere than the Yoshika‚Äôs tale of the 501st JFW, but at times it does feel a bit rushed and hammered by clich√©s. All-in-all, there are points where the story feels genuine and likable.Progression of the plot in Brave Witches is very slow but never really builds up to much. There is a shockingly long and unexplained absence of Takami through the middle of the series that made watching every new episode feel like she had been completely forgotten. However, a startling return later on shows that tension had been building between the sisters. This actually came as a surprise to me and many other viewers, but sadly I think that was only time I was caught off guard. The drama, while more scarce than it should be for a war story, was handled fairly well and I did find myself almost tearing up at one point. Thankfully, after the story teases us with a dreaded repeat of Strike Witches season 1 and 2 featuring ‚ÄúNeuroified weapons,‚Äù the story takes another more reasonable turn. Perhaps it‚Äôs a bit too reasonable because from start to finish, every moment of Brave Witches was being played safely. Nothing really new or exciting found its way into this plot, leaving it as just another anime pushed out the door for profits. It‚Äôs a shame really, considering the incredible amount of well-written source material at their disposal. In comparison to what could have been, Brave Witches fell disappointingly short.CHARACTERS ‚Äì 6/10As previously mentioned, what most folks anticipated would be a story following the 9 members of the 502nd JFW turned out to be more with the addition of the Karibuchi Sisters. Fortunately, despite stealing the spotlight from Sadako, Hikari and Takami karibuchi turned out to be rather remarkable characters and held a strong lead in the entire anime. Character development in typical Strike Witches fashion, is strong for some, and weak for others. With 11 characters to develop and only 12 episodes to do so, time is very limited to learn about each character‚Äôs personalities, backstories, and their shortcomings. Brave Witches understandably spends most of its episodes focusing on Hikari‚Äôs growth and triumph, but the balance of character development for the rest of the 502nd JFW is quite troubling. Characters like Naoe Kanno and Nikka Edvardine-Katajainen, who some people have complained about are annoying, also spent a long time in the spotlight, detracting from other characters such as Gundula Rall, Edytha Rossman, and Shimohara Sadako mostly. With each character given an average of 1 episode to grow, it feels like most of them never had the chance to shine. Strike Witches solved this issue by adding a second season. Perhaps Brave Witches will endure the same treatment.Characters are the stronghold for the World Witches Series. With well over 100+ witches to explore, it‚Äôs got more than enough content and lovable characters to keep coming back for more. Most of them even have incredible depth and uniqueness, without ever being adapted for the TV screen. and Brave Witches‚Äô best quality is the expansion of anime characters that we have waited so long for. It does my heart good to see a new cast, taken mostly from existing witches of Humikane‚Äôs creation. The anime does have a few weird moments however, with the appearance of an unnamed Brittanian witch that was never even properly introduced. Also the acknowledgement of Land Witches and brief cameo by Aurora Juutilainen at the very end are a subtle nod to fans, but kind of unexpected. Brave Witches does miss out on a lot of chances however, to feature even more background characters. Especially that the entire time the anime was aired, the 507th JFW was consistently mentioned and shown on the map, but never played a role in the story. Nor did the Suomus witches who sent gifts for the Saturnus Festival episode. The producers decided instead to bring back Eila and Sanya from the previous anime. I cannot complain because this gave these characters the screen time they were robbed of when they were excluded from the Operation Victory Arrow shorts and even though I‚Äôm not a fan of either character, their presence was rather comforting in the otherwise unsettling new atmosphere.ART & ANIMATION ‚Äì 5/10I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a meme here, but it‚Äôs 2016 and we really deserve better than this. I think fan reception is pretty unanimous in saying that Brave Witches‚Äô weakest aspect is its sub-par artwork and animation. This new anime was their chance to refresh the series and give it a new tone, maybe even closer to Shimada Humikane‚Äôs fascinating artworks which are gritty and rich with earth tones that add to the war setting. But instead, what we got from SilverLink studios seems to be using Strike Witches season 2 as a starting point, and then regressing steadily to the point where it almost looks like a major downgrade. World Witches has jumped animation studios 3 times since its inception and although SilverLink showed consistency and promise with the Operation Victory Arrow series, Brave Witches is not quite on the same level.The most notable issue with Brave Witches‚Äô animation, apart from a few goofy and disproportionate characters and recycled or discolored frames, is the excessive use of CG. While CG has its place in animation, the liberal use in Brave Witches is really jarring and distracting. From one moment of typical hand-drawn expressions you could suddenly be looking at a lifeless potato flying though the sky and back again by the next scene. The lack of detail is utterly disturbing and furthermore the choreography and movement of the CG characters is very poorly planned, killing off all sense of danger and action that should‚Äôve been present. Most of these issues can possibly be blamed on a rushed animation schedule, using CG only to as a quick placeholder for upgrading at a later date. We can only hope that by the time the BD/DVD is released, SilverLink will have been wise enough to reanimate large segments of the anime to bring it up to acceptable levels of quality. Sadly it looks like they have a lot of work to do if they want World Witches anime adaptations to continue to be taken seriously.SOUND & MUSIC ‚Äì 6Music and sound has always been a rather prominent part of the original Strike Witches in my mind. I remember the astonishing quality of the sounds that the Striker Units and various weapons used. It was as if the sound engineers actually recorded each and every airplane and gun specifically for each character which added so much to the realism and immersive nature of the original series. Add in the wonderfully catchy and grandiose tune of the 501st JFW theme song, and it was a winner. Now while I may be in no position to judge because my surround sound system is currently broken, I felt as if Brave Witches did not make as much effort and is leagues behind competitive anime such as Girls und Panzer who dominate in the sound effects department.The original compositions for background music are nice and pleasant, but lack the mystique and emotion of the Strike Witches soundtrack. It‚Äôs important that the music is indicative of the 1940s time period and honestly more could be done to enhance that atmosphere. OP and ED songs are par for the course and to me don‚Äôt fit the military theme very well, but there is nothing wrong with the otherwise well made into and outro songs. There is no memorable 502nd JFW theme to speak of. Guns and Strikers, while still loud and clattery as usual, felt a bit more generic this time around too and every gunshot and engine startup sounded the same. Had Brave Witches been a bit more ambitious in it sound and music, I think it would‚Äôve done wonders for making the series more memorable and charming.OVERALL SCORE ‚Äì 6.2/10Overall, despite my negative ramblings, Brave Witches has a bar minimum solid base to stand on. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúbad‚Äù anime by any means, but it‚Äôs certainly not anything new or special, especially compared to some of the rival anime being produced today. World Witches could‚Äôve used this chance to revitalize and bring more people into the series but instead it rested on its laurels and is destined to let itself fade to mediocrity unless something can be changed soon. And I do think the high expectations of long-time Witch fans like myself do play into this disappointment factor, but underneath this mumbling I am truly happy that Brave Witches was made and I am glad I have had the opportunity to watch and analyze it. I hope they will continue to produce more anime adaptations and hopefully I will get to see my beloved 507th JFW in the form of a film or OVA in the near future. I‚Äôm just hoping that in the meantime, producers of the anime will look back and what they have created and start focusing on how they can improve the series to make it more satisfying for fans and more competitive in the ever-advancing and extremely cut-throat anime industry. I think all of us in some way could say ""I would have differently,"" but we just have to play with the cards we are dealt.Is Brave Witches worth watching? I will say quite readily that it is only right for people who are truly fans of the World Witches series. Outsiders might find it a little unwelcoming and hard to understand. They probably won‚Äôt find themselves latching onto the characters too well either. I never thought I‚Äôd actually say this because I‚Äôm not particularly fond of the 501st JFW, but I have looked at my given options and decided that I got far more enjoyment from Strike Witches than I did with Brave Witches. Let‚Äôs hope whatever comes next will blow our pants off in true Witches pantsless fashion! like it... it just means that I went in with exceedingly high expectations, only to set myself up for disappointment when Brave Witches brought nothing new and exciting to the table. So if you want the brief review, here it is: Brave Witches is a stagnant installation to the series and is at best, a mediocre product that is the result of a careless cash-in opportunity.So uhh.... if you wanna hear more misery like that, please read on!

This new anime was their chance to refresh the series and give it a new tone, maybe even closer to Shimada Humikane‚Äôs fascinating artworks which are gritty and rich with earth tones that add to the war setting. But instead, what we got from SilverLink studios seems to be using Strike Witches season 2 as a starting point, and then regressing steadily to the point where it almost looks like a major downgrade. World Witches has jumped animation studios 3 times since its inception and although SilverLink showed consistency and promise with the Operation Victory Arrow series, Brave Witches is not quite on the same level.The most notable issue with Brave Witches‚Äô animation, apart from a few goofy and disproportionate characters and recycled or discolored frames, is the excessive use of CG. While CG has its place in animation, the liberal use in Brave Witches is really jarring and distracting. From one moment of typical hand-drawn expressions you could suddenly be looking at a lifeless potato flying though the sky and back again by the next scene. The lack of detail is utterly disturbing and furthermore the choreography and movement of the CG characters is very poorly planned, killing off all sense of danger and action that should‚Äôve been present. Most of these issues can possibly be blamed on a rushed animation schedule, using CG only to as a quick placeholder for upgrading at a later date. We can only hope that by the time the BD/DVD is released, SilverLink will have been wise enough to reanimate large segments of the anime to bring it up to acceptable levels of quality. Sadly it looks like they have a lot of work to do if they want World Witches anime adaptations to continue to be taken seriously.SOUND & MUSIC ‚Äì 6Music and sound has always been a rather prominent part of the original Strike Witches in my mind. I remember the astonishing quality of the sounds that the Striker Units and various weapons used. It was as if the sound engineers actually recorded each and every airplane and gun specifically for each character which added so much to the realism and immersive nature of the original series. Add in the wonderfully catchy and grandiose tune of the 501st JFW theme song, and it was a winner. Now while I may be in no position to judge because my surround sound system is currently broken, I felt as if Brave Witches did not make as much effort and is leagues behind competitive anime such as Girls und Panzer who dominate in the sound effects department.The original compositions for background music are nice and pleasant, but lack the mystique and emotion of the Strike Witches soundtrack. It‚Äôs important that the music is indicative of the 1940s time period and honestly more could be done to enhance that atmosphere. OP and ED songs are par for the course and to me don‚Äôt fit the military theme very well, but there is nothing wrong with the otherwise well made into and outro songs. There is no memorable 502nd JFW theme to speak of. Guns and Strikers, while still loud and clattery as usual, felt a bit more generic this time around too and every gunshot and engine startup sounded the same. Had Brave Witches been a bit more ambitious in it sound and music, I think it would‚Äôve done wonders for making the series more memorable and charming.OVERALL SCORE ‚Äì 6.2/10Overall, despite my negative ramblings, Brave Witches has a bar minimum solid base to stand on. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúbad‚Äù anime by any means, but it‚Äôs certainly not anything new or special, especially compared to some of the rival anime being produced today. World Witches could‚Äôve used this chance to revitalize and bring more people into the series but instead it rested on its laurels and is destined to let itself fade to mediocrity unless something can be changed soon. And I do think the high expectations of long-time Witch fans like myself do play into this disappointment factor, but underneath this mumbling I am truly happy that Brave Witches was made and I am glad I have had the opportunity to watch and analyze it. I hope they will continue to produce more anime adaptations and hopefully I will get to see my beloved 507th JFW in the form of a film or OVA in the near future. I‚Äôm just hoping that in the meantime, producers of the anime will look back and what they have created and start focusing on how they can improve the series to make it more satisfying for fans and more competitive in the ever-advancing and extremely cut-throat anime industry. I think all of us in some way could say ""I would have differently,"" but we just have to play with the cards we are dealt.Is Brave Witches worth watching? I will say quite readily that it is only right for people who are truly fans of the World Witches series. Outsiders might find it a little unwelcoming and hard to understand. They probably won‚Äôt find themselves latching onto the characters too well either. I never thought I‚Äôd actually say this because I‚Äôm not particularly fond of the 501st JFW, but I have looked at my given options and decided that I got far more enjoyment from Strike Witches than I did with Brave Witches. Let‚Äôs hope whatever comes next will blow our pants off in true Witches pantsless fashion!', 'I see no actual reason why people might enjoy this anime. It is a spinoff of ""strike witches"" but doesn\'t bring anything to the table whatsoever.It focuses on a completely new group of witches but everything from character developemend to world developement is plain out idiotic. Now I have to make it clear that it doesn\'t focus on advancing the plot at all, since it focuses more on the slice of life part here which is made ridiculously clear since they are supposed to be in the front lines battling alien enemies and all of the front lines is managed by 7 girls that mostly,...don\'t even battle, but instead have ""fun"".So if it\'s not about the story and it\'s about character developement, how does that hold up? Well, short answer is, it doesn\'t. They have choices where you can pick a good candidate for a fight or a complete klutz and they choose the worse person because they are the main character. They have moments where they literally state something concrete and then in the next episode, disregard it completely.I have no problem with anime that is absurd but once it stops following its own logic, it has failed.You can see more of my angry rant here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9X3igJVlEQ don\'t even battle, but instead have ""fun"".So if it\'s not about the story and it\'s about character developement, how does that hold up?

Brave Witches however, is wrongfully underrated and unloved, hence this review. No major spoilers ahead.Is it a masterpiece? Far from it. Personally I\'d give it a ""7"". But an ""8"" on MAL is ""very good"" and if Strike Witches is considered a ""7"" here then I have no shame in giving Brave Witches an ""8"". Keep in mind that the rating system is flawed and numbers are meaningless without context. This review is tailored around the...comparison between Strike and Brave Witches. (Don\'t worry i\'m not spoiling anything in Strike Witches either)Main CharacterHikari is a much better main character than Miyafuji from Strike. To start things off, Hikari does not have plot-given powers. In fact, she\'s considered weaker than your average witch by power level and had to fight tooth and nail just to get her spot in the 502 Brave Witches. Comparatively, Miyafuji possessed an abundant amount of inherent power, had a direct connection to the 501 Strike Witches and a mentor that literately sought her out. Just based off of this alone i found Hikari to be a much more realistic and relatable character. Hikari also got a much better development arc. From ep1, we see her deal with being weak and constantly overshadowed by her sister which fuels her desire. Miyafuji\'s character progression doesn\'t excel till much much later in the Strike franchise. I found it especially neat that Hikari doesn\'t flinch at insults thrown at her in the 502 since she\'s dealt with it her whole life. I found it a lot easier to root for and be inspired by Hikari than i initially did with Miyafuji.Side CharactersThis is where i argue that Strike Witches did a much better job... In two seasons + movie. I cannot deny that most side characters from Strike are more mainstream and recognizable than that of Brave Witches. That being said, Brave Witches played to its strength and didn\'t bother with giving equal screen time to each character, rather it focused more on the select few that really mattered. Instead of extensive use of flashbacks, flat exposition of a character\'s tragic past or lines like ""That\'s ____ who did this amazing thing back in ____""; Brave Witches focused more on the present and chemistry between the characters. I\'m not saying that Brave Witches is without bad character moments or that Strike Witches is filled with them. Comparatively, Brave Witches just had a lesser %composition of those cliche and poorly written parts, but Strike Witches as a whole has had more character developments overall.ArtI absolutely despise the CG used in Brave Witches. It\'s painfully obvious when the CG came on and it took a heavy toll on the battle-scenes. A few instances it was used well but the majority of the time it was flat out terrible. The normal animated parts are well done, and scenes that really mattered were at least not CG.StoryBrave Witches contains fewer of your typical anime-cliches which is nice, it also contain my most memorable(and favorite) episode in all of the World Witches anime universe. I especially enjoyed seeing the specialized/new enemy types introduced to the series. There are also less obvious Ex-Machina moments throughout Brave Witches. Aside from all that the story/writing quality is on par with Strike.Fan-serviceI suppose if you were someone that honestly watched 2 seasons and a movie just for fan service in ""Strike Witches"" you\'d be truly disappointed with the dramatic decrease in fan service when it comes to Brave Witches. Sucks for you, but personally i\'m kinda glad that Brave Witches focused less on fan service and more on the real plot. (There\'s not even a beach episode, the horror!) The characters are still always in their underwear/tights and there are some fan service shots so stay calm and keep in mind that something is better than nothing. The OVA does make up for some of it too.I may be just speculating, but the nostalgia and attachment to characters in Strike Witches has resulted in a significant portion of the fan-base developing bias against Brave Witches. Actually, it\'s more than just speculation when a large portion of the comments everywhere are ""Mio is still the strongest"", ""Where\'s my waifu Sanya?"" and ""I hope the 501 witches is in the next episode"". In reality, Brave Witches is just as, if not much better than Strike Witches especially when it comes to story and character.

It's an abstract remake of the first season of SW starring Miyufiji with an inverted color palette and hair that goes down instead of up. A gang of magic girls with airplane legs is once again waging war against shapeshifting aliens with the help of their new recruit from not-Japan. Despite that premise it's a very different take on the same basic idea. The characteristics of Strike Witches are mostly inverted: the MC is noticeably underpowered instead of overpowered, she's not competent and nearly kicked out of the 502nd on arrival, and...her relationships with other characters start as standoffish or antagonistic instead of instant friendship. She's still in a support role like Miyufiji but has no magical ass-pull to lean on, nor does anybody else. Different characters have different traits and defects making it so that nobody can entirely carry the team by themselves. Additionally the Neuroi are now a dangerous threat instead of just a present one: fighting them isn't free, and even when they lose it's after they've caused damage and bent the trajectory of events that follow. All this greatly affects the character interactions because now they're operating from an entirely justified sense of self-preservation. Being a hero will get them killed so there's a limit to how much they'll stick their neck out for each other. However they also need to co-operate to win, and there's a war in the background with a bodycount that will keep rising until they take action to stop it. Strike Witches dabbled with all of this but would eagerly end conflicts on a shitpost or gag to defuse the tension. The main difference with Brave Witches is that it doesn't and plays everything mostly straight.Ecchi content returns from Strike Witches in a more moderated role. It has the obligatory episode where they took a doujin they liked and made it canon, and contains the biggest horndog character in the entire franchise, but gags mostly wait their turn for the plot to be finished first. This is still a fanservice show, though.The art for this show got trashed when it was new because the CGI in the TV version was rough and they leaned into using it for every striker flying scene. In re-releases this was cleaned up a lot and now it looks a little more reasonable like Road to Berlin.On the whole if you want to get into the whole Witches series, Brave Witches isn't a horrible place to start. It has a plot and if you're coming from other anime it'll align with your expectations a little better while not being totally unlike the other shows. If you don't like it then you won't like the other ones.

Also touches on how others can be flexible, find ways to utilize such passionate spirit, and how those with ""talent"" can be inspired by those that show results through hard work.The show, overall, was average at best. No part of the production quality really stood out. The main reason I rate it below average is because it was fairly emotionless, with tragic and suspenseful moments not registering. I tend to like military oriented shows for the mixture of various...backgrounds/cultures, and the eventual camaraderie, but this had none of those qualities other than one event involving members from a neighboring base. I can only call it cute, but it if you want cute girls + military, I\'d recommend Girls und Panzer.Suggestions to producers:Story - kind of cheap to use intermission screens full of text to create story background, but I\'ll take it. The story needed a lot more individual purpose behind it. Attack on Titan did this and its story is at least 2x better. Needs some depth, regarding how people with different personal interests manage to unite under a cause.Art - not going to suggest the liberal use of sakuga, but there were many times I wanted to *see* things in more detail, like just how close are the enemy shots are getting to witches closing distance on the target, or their perspective of aiming and firing at moving targets, or even how they reload.

I just watched Macross Delta and its sound carried it, while a show like Cross Game can evoke tearjerking moments with a simple soundtrack. Don\'t need to spend Yuki Kajiura or Hiroyuki Sawano money...Character - you don\'t have to make them look like they\'re wearing totally different uniforms to give them individual style. In fact, giving them all something different devalued their individuality to simply showing their origin. Good to show the difference in culture when they were playing on a sled, but that scene seemed like a waste of airtime. How\'d that girl forget a traumatic place she visited? Didn\'t get to learn much about the high ranked/veteran members, other than one having an old injury and another liking ""grape juice""...Enjoyability - this is subjective and personal, but I am apologetically interested in certain values in all shows I watch, primarily valuing lessons on life. The message I got from this show was quite cheesy. I like watching acts of bonding and comedy, but apart from scarf girl becoming less tsun towards genki girl, nothing of the sort really happened.

There are hints of 3D-CGI that slightly throw things off when it appears.Animation here is an improvement, battles are no longer (how do i say this without spoiling/summarizing part of it) linear. Fight scenes are slightly more inspired is all i can really say without giving too much away.MAL says this is...a side story of Strike witches but its also a sequel to it. they tie the 2 stories such that its almost necessary to watch the parent story Strike witches first to know whats going on. a side story of Strike witches but its also a sequel to it. they tie the 2 stories such that its almost necessary to watch the parent story Strike witches first to know whats going on.', ""So I have to say that brave witches is better that Strike witches in some some aspects.

In this particular series Hikari's clumsiness is explained away by having a lack of magical power, not that this really stops her later on because she's just that much of a hard worker and with that being her counter trait she's...able to overcome her flaws.The problem is, this idea that a person simply needs to put in the hard work and they can thus overcome anything is a lie. Its always juxtaposed around this idea that every genius out there doesn't put in any iota of hard work, though in reality the geniuses out there actually are putting in some level of hard work.

Somehow, that really is all this show needs to keep you hooked.Coupled with excellent character writing and perfectly complimentary voice acting (of which Ange's VA does a superb job), this anime is an extremely wholesome and enjoyable watch well worth your time, and a gem full of sparkly tender moments that you'll find yourself wanting even more of."", 'This anime/manga could be resumed in one line.""Do the simple but well made.""S-Rank Musume have a very simples RPG enviroment, nothing special, only stoytelling with a good quality and patience world building, unfortunately the anime had a ""ok"" animation, with some good animations on fight scenes but being only carried by the story.The main characters evolving in this 12 episodes was very well made, you can see from the first to the last how Belgrieve changed a lot because of his daughter.I think that the greatest point of this story it\'s that don\'t follow others ""Adoptive father"" animes/mangas, I\'m very happy to see another story...were I would\'t be angry with a ""after so much years in the future they married"" like UchiMusume.Story : 9Characters : 8World Building : 10VA\'s : 9Animation : 6 were I would\'t be angry with a ""after so much years in the future they married"" like UchiMusume.Story : 9Characters : 8World Building : 10VA\'s : 9Animation : 6', ""And dad of the year goes too...Seriously though, while the plotline can be a little misleading in how it sounds.

Shortly its a fantasy-adventure story starring a father and a daughter with nice balance of action, drama and comedy (or at least it ought...to be), with some nice mystery hooks.The reasons for why I can not really recommend the series are mostly based on two points, the rushing of the plot, and the art-direction and quality of animation. I am constantly surprised when watching the series how quickly the just breeze through all the plot-lines, leaving them feeling rather unimportant, while also failing to adapt a plenty of nice little moments that brought the distinct sometimes serious, sometimes humorous, atmosphere of the manga to life. For the art&animation admittedly I am not familiar with the original VN but comparing both for example the art of the characters and animations as depicted to the how these were dealt with in the manga has left me significantly disappointed.

This also introduces different side characters for each of them, which sometimes crosses over.For the plot development is there generally a clear progression, where the plot builds up the world and helps expand the viewers perspective on the world. The plot in...itself is very simple though, and does not come with a lot of twists or surprises. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the plot bad, but it just seems very stereotypical and kinda basic.When it comes to the characters is there little to no development, where the most development is seen in some of the side characters. While the daughter seems rather stagnant in her development and the father has a small amount of character progression. The show still explores the characters, but this is done in a very limited amount, and still leaves room for improvement.The animation and voice acting in the show seems very much on par with the standard of the current time, but doesn‚Äôt bring anything new or special to the table.The relationship between the two main characters is also very special, where the dad seems rather normal, and the daughter is very clingy.

Despite obviously having very little to work with, all the characters look amazing designwise, the backgrounds are incredibly beautiful, and the action scenes, while not amazing, are at least passable and get the point across. And I should mention, Belgrieve is one of the best father figures I've ever seen across all...the various JP media I've read and watched over the years.Also, the opening song has bagpipes. BAGPIPES.It's rather unfortunate, considering that the underlying source material is considered to be extremely high-quality and is a really good wholesome story with action interspersed throughout, and would have greatly benefited from having a huge budget like some of the other adaptations this season, but the team working on the show clearly did their best with what they had and it actually turned out pretty decently.Overall: (7.5/10)Story (8/10)The pacing is a little rushed, but the essence of the story is still there and is filled with all kinds of wholesome interactions between Belgrieve, his daughter, and the various other individuals who they become acquainted with during their journey.Art and Sound (7.5/10)This one is a bit weird, because the action animation quality suffers from the low budget, but they still managed to do an incredible job making the backgrounds extremely beautiful, something I wasn't expecting from the show. Character designs are also excellent, with a huge variety of actual normal-looking people that you wouldn't expect from anime. You can tell they took shortcuts to conserve budget but the directing was done really well and they made the best of what they had. Sound/music is all right, nothing spectacular, but works for what's needed in the show.The VAs are mostly good, with some heavyweight names voicing the main characters, although there's a few characters that stand out for not having quite as good VA work as the others.TL;DR: the show is low-budget but does its work very well despite that. Character designs are excellent, and while the action sequences onto great, the show really shines during the slice of life segments and is filled with very wholesome interactions between the different characters of the cast. A great show to pass your time with a wholesome story while having an interesting plot moving along in the background.Unfortunately I have to deduct points because the low budget does hit the animation quite hard at certain points, but overall I'd give it a 7.5/10 because of the quality of the story and surprisingly good character design and backgrounds despite the obviously lack of budget. the various JP media I've read and watched over the years.Also, the opening song has bagpipes.

Sure, it's not a nuclear family unification that calls of a massive celebration. However, it does set the tone of the overall story together between our two main characters - Angeline and Belgrieve.Based on the light novel of the same name, I will say that you don't need to put too much thought into going into this show despite the somewhat complicated synopsis. What you do need to know is the background of Belgrieve and how he became who he...is today. Life in an unpredictable world is harsh and he learns it the hard way. Despite the hardship Belgrieve has went through, he establishes himself as a formidable adventurer capable of handling himself and even protect villages on his own turf. There's no doubt taht Belgrieve represents the role of a guardian and even moniker 'Red Ogre', nicknamed by Angeline herself.Similar to her father, Angeline adapts a work ethic that pushes herself to become what she is in the present. She wants to prove to herself and Belgrieve that she is worthy of being his daughter. This is where the core of the show is known for - a father and daughter relationship. It's formulaic with recurring gags most noticably for Angeline's behavior. She's essentially protrayed as 'daddy's little girl' and acts such so. Some might call this pattern as insufferable to watch while others will label it as a charming relationship. Regardless, it is what it is.The story structure, meanwhile transitions between the two main characters. Sometimes, we get to see Angeline's side of the story while other times, it follows Belgrieve and his everyday adventures. It retains a similar tone for both sides while adapting a different tone at times. For instance, Angeline's side can sometimes revolves around her hanging out with friends and enjoying time together. Belgrive on the other hand is more of a lone wolf, who observes from afar but nonetheless helpful towards others he meets. Adapting both side of the story fully embraces itself as an adventure with an acceptable cast of characters.Unfortunately, supporting characters is mostly overshadowed by our two main leads. Characters such as Miriam, Marguerite, Mit, Charlotte, among others really can't hold a handle to either Angeline or Belgrieve in terms of characterization. The lack of their background story or development doesn't necessary hurt their characters but they are far from being superstars in the show. In fact, there's no real superstar carrying this anime. It's instead, a lighthearted fantasy adventure with the occasional high stake battles thrown in. Even so, it adapts a fairly light toned adventure that mostly loves its relationship between Belgrive and Angeline. And don't get the wrong idea, this isn't some bizarre romance either. It's more an old fashioned relationship between two close family members.You shouldn't expect to also jump into this show to be blown away from its animation quality. Typhoon Graphics doesn't exactly set the industry standard but adapting from the light novels, the character designs looks similar. The most noticable characteristics is the emotive reactions from our cast, most noticably Angeline. The balance between her expressions ranging from a battle harden adventurer to daddy's little girl is striking. Belgrive mentains a similar range of tone throughout the series, protrayed as a mature father who loves his daughter.There's no right or wrong way to watch this anime but don't get misunderstood by some of the tones in the show.

Boukensha ni Naritai to Miyako ni Deteitta Musume ga S-Rank ni Natteta is a story about the importance of family.

"", 'I had this ridiculously unnecessarily long title under my radar for a while before it aired because it seemed like it would be cute, but I was also worried because, as other manga and anime before it, it could go down a perverse route at any moment, thankfully it didn‚Äôt and remained as it began throughout all of its duration.There‚Äôs nothing special about the show, it‚Äôs a typical lighthearted adventure in a typical fantasy setting with a typical class system that makes you think that the characters are in a videogame.Ok, there is a political plot, and there are powerful demons hidden somewhere affecting...the setting in one way or another, but the first is resolved quickly and conveniently, while the second is hardly given much importance, even though it‚Äôs hinted that the main girl herself might be another one of those creatures as well, something that the studio seemingly tried to hide by changing a little her original character design.So, there kind of is a plot and some drama, but honestly, the series is at its weakest when it focuses on that, as things are resolved easily and conveniently, so no attempt at a serious plot is believable nor very enjoyable, the show is at its best when it focuses on what the stupid long title tells you, how the main girl, one of the strongest characters in the world, as protagonists end up being a lot of the times, is a daddy‚Äôs girl that cares about going back to her father more than anything else, like saving the world or some shit. That‚Äôs why coup d‚Äô√©tats can be taken down easily, antagonists are defeated almost instantly, and if they are children, they are forgiven instantly for everything they did, and reformed right away.There is some action but honestly that‚Äôs weak as hell as well, very short, most of it is kept out of screen and from what I understand heavily shortened and altered from the source material, resulting in some really badly planned, storyboarded and scripted scenes, and since the main characters are so strong, they hardly face any threat.

That‚Äôs why coup d‚Äô√©tats can be taken down easily, antagonists are defeated almost instantly, and if they are children, they are forgiven instantly for everything they did, and reformed right away.There is some action but honestly that‚Äôs weak as hell as well, very short, most of it is kept out of screen and from what I understand heavily shortened and altered from the source material, resulting in some really badly planned, storyboarded and scripted scenes, and since the main characters are so strong, they hardly face any threat.

The action which should break up the slice of life, struggles to achieve its purpose as it's simply not exciting enough to look forward to.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10...------------------------------------------Pretty solid stuff. Nothing remarkable but nothing to bother you either.Story - 7/10-------------The story is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand we have a wholesome family dynamic between a father and his daughter, and on the other, we have a grander fantasy storyline of demon kings and monsters, political drama and so on.The father-daughter dynamic receives a good amount of attention and is quite nice and wholesome. The larger fantasy storyline however is poorly developed and confusing. Not much is explained, which creates this weird clash of themes within the show where you'll be enjoying the father-daughter dynamic, only to suddenly be greeted with poor action scenes of fighting against monsters or political opponents whose motivations aren't clear and who just seem annoying more than anything.Characters - 7/10---------------------Characters aren't particularly noteworthy. The father being the better of the bunch, showcasing adorable fatherly love and care towards his daughter, as well as care and loyalty for the village they live in, and its people. The father is smart and strong, while lacking any ambitions that might generate an ego. He's humble and non-confronting where possible.Daughter is more of a mixed bag. While loving his father dearly is a nice dynamic, she is utterly obsessed with him to the point of becoming distracting and silly. A 17 year old girl latching onto his dad for a better part of a day is borderline crazy.Other supportive characters lack any serious depth, though at least they aren't annoying.---Total - 7/10---S-Rank Musume is a fine fantasy adventure story with a lovely family dynamic.

And even though the anime shows a portion of the already completed Syosetu WN and 11-volume LN that spans from February 2018 to November 2021, it\'s definitely a slice of that pie in both good and bad ways.The protagonist, or rather, the formal parental figure, Belgrieve, is once known as one of the S-Rank adventurers, often called the Red Ogre due to his red hair and ogre-like stature that people would fear fighting him for. But when he gets into a scuffle where he loses his right leg in the process, Bel knows that his adventurous time has already passed its peak and has decided to retire to a small, secluded village where he\'ll spend his days in the countryside resting till his natural demise. But just when he thinks that his adventuring days are over, apart from gathering herbs and defeating beasts, he somehow finds an abandoned child, and out of his compassion, he brings her back to his hometown to be raised. Time passes, and the protagonist\'s successor, Angeline, has grown into a mature girl who has become the aforementioned top-tier S-Rank adventurer in her own right, nicknamed the Black-Haired Valkyrie. But her wish, as opposed to Belgrieve\'s fame and fortune, is that she will always want nothing more than to see her guardian father after every expedition. Talk about being a dad-con in the most childlike (or sometimes, childish) of ways.I\'m not gonna lie: when it comes to the parental aspect, I truly adore the father-daughter relationship of Belgrieve and Angeline, other than the latter\'s perspective of always being too attached to the former and always wanting his love more than anything. I\'m not saying that it\'s wrong to love your parents (as we all ought to do), but Ange\'s attachment to Belgrieve can over time feel very forced. As much as it is being a loving family from the outset, her obsession can be seen as one of ""needless"" fervor for end objectives. A crazed daughter being a yandere of sorts for her father for no matter how long the duration they\'re separated? That\'s quite the ""unique"" fascination that this show has going for it.Otherwise, S-Rank Musume is just your typical slice-of-life show of the usual fantasy adventures ranging from normal daily life to defeating evildoers. As Ange tags along with her best friends of mage Miriam and warrior Anessa, they are a party of exceptional and strong young women who have earned themselves in the same position as said S-Rank hero. With their names known far and wide, there will always be space for evil to do their usual acts, and for the most part, Ange can stop with ease given her high-ranked status; that\'s just the par for the course. The other characters are just like what you would find in typical normal MMORPGs, being most akin to NPCs, who act like side quests to grow Ange\'s relationship with as many people as possible, since this is such easy-going source material that the importance is only slain on Ange, always making sure that her final objective is to go back home and embrace her father. It\'s a rather simple plot, and it does work fine, but you\'re not going to get serious issues (apart from thwarting evil) that are life-threatening whatsoever, which does make the plot feel dry.After the rather relative success of Kanojo ga K≈çshaku-tei ni Itta Riy≈´ a.k.a Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke\'s Mansion earlier this Spring, the 3rd-rate studio Typhoon Graphics is back once again on the animation side of things, though the production is rather iffy, if not mediocre at best. I never once saw Typhoon Graphics as a studio that\'s capable of ever producing action-heavy shows (Raeliana was never one of them), and it really shows in S-Rank Musume that if this is the best that the rather small studio can muster, then future shows produced by them will always look mediocre at best. Despite having episode director Naoki Murata and storyboarder-cum-chief director Takeshi Mori, both of whom are anime veterans, they did their best, but no amount of effort is going to hide the fact that the anime will always look so drab and lifeless, almost as if there is little to no soul in it.And then, there\'s the music. Since her departure from fripSide last year, Yoshino Nanjo has since been earning even less accreditation for her music composition, which would\'ve made little to no difference had she stayed on in the lucrative group.

Chikyuu Shoujo Arjuna,https://myanimelist.net/anime/812/Chikyuu_Shoujo_Arjuna,"['Message films or those with controversial or social commentary often don‚Äôt seem to fair well with the general public.  That is honestly the only reason I can see for this series having such a small base of viewers.  Arjuna from an art and production standpoint is really one of the better shows I have seen and one that I think everyone should check out.  It attempts to deal with some very important issues facing our planet from ecology issues to the over medication of society.  For the most part it does a really good job at this, even though at times...I felt it got overly preachy.The story starts out with Juna, out heroine, being involved in an accident which leaves her dead.  She feels her spirit slipping away when she is contact by another mysterious spirit who offers to save her life if she will help to save the planet and become the Avatar of Time.  She accepts and much to the surprise of her mourning boyfriend, mother, and medical personal she jumps from her death bed and into action.  Overall it‚Äôs a good start and we are treated to some good action right off the bat.  From these beginnings you might think that this anime is going to be a pretty exciting action series.  But the action soon lets up and slows down to a crawl.  This is sure to disappoint some people who were expecting more action based story.  Eventually it becomes a very endearing romance as well.  I found this part of the series to be the most rewarding personally.  The social commentary is also interesting as Juna learns about the world and what is damaging it and what could be done to fix it.  Whether or not you agree with the conclusions or ""facts"" expressed in the show I think everyone can agree that the problems do exist.  Many of these are hot political issues that have strong feelings on both sides of the debate.  While I believe that some of the statements made in the show are naive and only tell partial truths at times, I still think it allows you to make up your own mind about what it is saying.The relationship between Juna and Tokio is one of the best I have seen in a series to date.  We get plenty of character development and a lot of back story on the both of them.  They both feel like very real and relatable.  Juna\'s struggle to be able to fit in with modern society after some of the changes her body goes through was interesting.  This became a major part of the plot for most of the series as well as Tokio trying to understand what she is going through.  Most of the supporting characters are left in the background.  This is good and bad.  Good because it did allow the extra screen time to our leads and was what lead to them being so interesting to me.  We do get to see some important side stories regarding Juna\'s and Tokio\'s family but some of these stories are left open towards the end without any real resolution.  It wasn‚Äôt overly important to the story in the end but some of it I would have liked to know how it turned out.  Particularly the side story involving Juna\'s older sister.  The most irritating character to me was definitely Chris.  I found him to be a pompous know it all who is constantly telling Juna one thing and then when she does it asking her why she did it.The production values of Arjuna are quite spectacular.  From the beautiful artwork to the epic feeling of the music, this series feels like a movie in a sense.  The background music in particular really makes the story feel like a grand experience and is really one of the best music scores I‚Äôve ever heard.  The animation uses a lot of CG effects which are for the most part very good.  Though I am not a fan of this style it did mostly flow seamlessly with the rest of the animation.Where my score of Arjuna really drops is in my overall enjoyment, this is mainly due to the ending.  While it‚Äôs not a bad ending, I just didn‚Äôt like it and was disappointed almost across the board.  There was too much uncertainty regarding the fate of most of the cast and I was left confused by many of the sudden revelations at the end.  Also the social commentary got fairly intense and overbearing towards the end too which affected my enjoyment.  I felt my intelligence was being insulted to some extent as characters would lament the starvation of millions in Africa yet their policies on farming and livestock production would lead to millions or perhaps billions more starving.  I also found it a bit naive that simply turning off ones air conditioner for two weeks in the summer or eating a little less meat would somehow solve the energy crisis or end world hunger.Despite my problems with how things ended and with some the series opinions, I still found this to be a show well worth seeing.  If you just look at it as a work of fiction and a story and not try to take what is said as the absolute truth you are sure to enjoy it for what it is, a wonderful romance and adventure.  Those looking for action and intense special effects will be disappointed however.  Arjuna is anime that should be viewed by more than it has been to this date. I felt it got overly preachy.The story starts out with Juna, out heroine, being involved in an accident which leaves her dead.  She feels her spirit slipping away when she is contact by another mysterious spirit who offers to save her life if she will help to save the planet and become the Avatar of Time.  She accepts and much to the surprise of her mourning boyfriend, mother, and medical personal she jumps from her death bed and into action.  Overall it‚Äôs a good start and we are treated to some good action right off the bat.  From these beginnings you might think that this anime is going to be a pretty exciting action series.  But the action soon lets up and slows down to a crawl.  This is sure to disappoint some people who were expecting more action based story.  Eventually it becomes a very endearing romance as well.  I found this part of the series to be the most rewarding personally.  The social commentary is also interesting as Juna learns about the world and what is damaging it and what could be done to fix it.  Whether or not you agree with the conclusions or ""facts"" expressed in the show I think everyone can agree that the problems do exist.  Many of these are hot political issues that have strong feelings on both sides of the debate.  While I believe that some of the statements made in the show are naive and only tell partial truths at times, I still think it allows you to make up your own mind about what it is saying.The relationship between Juna and Tokio is one of the best I have seen in a series to date.  We get plenty of character development and a lot of back story on the both of them.  They both feel like very real and relatable.  Juna\'s struggle to be able to fit in with modern society after some of the changes her body goes through was interesting.  This became a major part of the plot for most of the series as well as Tokio trying to understand what she is going through.  Most of the supporting characters are left in the background.  This is good and bad.  Good because it did allow the extra screen time to our leads and was what lead to them being so interesting to me.  We do get to see some important side stories regarding Juna\'s and Tokio\'s family but some of these stories are left open towards the end without any real resolution.

Arjuna is anime that should be viewed by more than it has been to this date.', ""Earth Maiden Arjuna...it could be described as either you love it or you hate it. It's hard to say considering I'm one of those who loved it. I'll assume you have read the synopsis and at least have a basic idea of what this anime is about. Very good, on with the review!Story: The story of Arjuna had a lot of promise, I'll tell you that. With the first and second episodes I was mildly in shock at the premise set out before me. It could have been a true masterpiece, but when you think about it, this is a tricky story to dive into....I refuse to post spoilers, but a good majority of the show is about Juna's 'education' you could call it. With every new thing she learns about the world, another hint towards the ending is revealed. They do this well and I have no complaints about the ending. Although there are a few things I would have loved to know that they just seemed to refuse to reveal (origin of the Avatar of Time for one), though it was nothing that damaged my enjoyment of the series.Every so often the show would trail off and become (dare I say...) preachy. It goes just a tiny bit over the top with the whole &quot;Save Nature!&quot; thing it's got going on. Luckily this only happens a few times, and if you can get past that and just go with the flow (an open mind is essential), then I promise you'll have an enjoyable experience. If this is the anime for you anyway.Art: Wow, where Arjuna lacks in story-telling, it completely makes up for in the art. While I myself had a personal hatred for Juna's hair, the art is just downright beautiful. No complaints here. The second time I watched this show, I watched it purely for the eye-candy for a while. It's just so beautiful to watch, especially the few transformation scenes (there aren't many). Seeing the way Juna begins to view the world can be breath-taking.Sound: If you haven't heard this by now, it's about time someone told you. The music in this show is amazing. Absolutely amazing. Most of the music was done by Yokko Kanno, who I believe also did the music for Cowboy Bebop and Raxephon (don't quote me on that last one). Even if you go into this series feeling skepitcal of the plot presented to you, I believe it's worth it to stick with it just for the music. The music is haunting and fits the scenes beautifully. Combine the music with the art and you have the perfect reason to try this show right there. In this category especially, Arjuna does not disappoint.As for the voices, I will admit, I've only watched the English dub. Feel free to attack me or whatever. At first the voices for the dub seemed a bit...off, as most dubs usually do, but after a while you could tell they were starting to get a feel for the characters. Lip-synching was kind of off, but it was nothing noticeable in the later episodes. I especially loved the voice of the character Chris. :] Pardon me for being a fan-girl, but the voice made me love the character.Characters: Speaking of characters! There was some character development, but nothing out of this world. The most was seen for Juna and her boyfriend Tokio...and...yeah...I wasn't left hating any characters by the end, which is saying something because there was a girl who I wanted dead on that show. All of them were true to their personalities. I thought Juna's development from well-grounded spunky teenage girl to Avatar of Time was very good. Not at all like most shows in this genre where the girl gets powers and suddenly they're full of confidence and joy or whatever. That's about it for characters, go Chris!I'll admit, this show is NOT FOR EVERYONE. You will love it or you will hate it. I can't be responsible for either one. xD I recommend watching at least up to episode 4. Episode 4 is almost like a trial...if you can make it past that episode unscathed (I'm exaggerating, it's not bad) then you will most likely enjoy the rest of the show. I myself love it because the entire thing to me is just so beautiful. I'm a nature-loving girl, so this was just an anime after my own heart. Even if you're not too big on the whole nature deal, I suggest you give it a try anyway. Just remember to keep an open mind and enjoy it for what it's worth. This show should not be overlooked without at least a first glance. I refuse to post spoilers, but a good majority of the show is about Juna's 'education' you could call it.

This show should not be overlooked without at least a first glance."", 'I tried giving this a chance. I really did. The story was great, the characters were relatable, the art was pretty amazing....but then it just turned horrible. It was like a ""Go Green!"" anime. Maybe good to use in a science class, but for personal enjoyment I would not recommend it. ', 'Looks like I\'m adding another show to the \'visually interesting anime of the early 2000s\' list. Otogizoushi came to mind almost immediately when I started this. So anyway, yeah, on the surface this is basically an environmentalism propaganda piece, but (and this is unusual) I wasn\'t  turned off by it. Does it get preachy at times? Maybe. Is that a problem? Not at all. I think it works because all of the opinion spouting somehow meanders its way into, and melds with, the overall aesthetic of the anime. In other words, the message is an integral part of the experience; coupled with the imagery,...nothing feels out of place. Because of this I see this as more of a mood piece than an \'An Inconvenient Truth,\' ""here are the facts"" kind of thing. In this sense I don\'t think \'agreeing\' with everything (or anything, for that matter) plays an important role in getting enjoyment out of this series. This is probably accomplished due to its above average writing and direction. And in the end, I don\'t think it is as quite propagandistic as a surface viewing would lead you to believe.As happy as I am that they did it that way, anyone actually interested in environmental issues is probably going to find fault with the execution: 1) There are no facts, spirituality trumps science in this one. Think, \'we are one with the planet\' kind of stuff, which works well for the mood and art but not so much for compelling propaganda. Hell, some stuff they say seems like complete fiction, but I\'m no expert.2) There is nothing concrete, other than vague references to pollution (everywhere and everything), nuclear power (of all the things to go after) and the usual anti-capitalism (and a lot of flashing imagery to go with it) one can definitely feel some disconnect from this anime world and our real one. Because it doesn\'t try to tackle any one specific, pressing, environmental issue it eventually drowns in its own cynicism; thumbing its nose at almost everything we do in modern society.What this amounts to in the end is,  \'all complaints, no solutions.\' At least it\'s somewhat self-aware, our pal Tokio, after hearing Juna complain constantly about city life, eventually asks (paraphrasing obviously) ""how the hell are we supposed to live?"" Juna gives what amounts to a non-response: ""live like that old guy we met in the mountains."" That\'s something only a person living in the First World could say, which is ironic considering that those who suffer in poverty are shown sympathetically (as victims of the sick Earth). I guess they\'re trying to make a distinction between self-imposed and involuntary poverty but I never think is the best answer for this kind of stuff.And some of this is tempered in the end anyway where we see a little bit of optimism, all without Juna needing to re-evaluate her principles or compromise what she learned.Despite some complaints, I DO like how the anime tries to get its message across. The interplay of well-written dialogue and imagery are effective, moving, and interesting from an artistic perspective. Stuff like Juna being able to see herself in the food she is about to eat is a good way of getting the (little) idea across that what we eat becomes a part of us and that we should care about what we put in our bodies. Sometimes the little ideas go over better than the bigger picture. In this regard the quality of the message in the anime is more than the just the sum of its parts. In the end, this imagery ALSO finds its way into the bigger picture. Thus, I would consider this anime to have depth. And we are made aware of this depth in a compelling and organic manner.And I think if we detach ourselves from the message even more it is easy to see how important the radicalism is for the overall feeling of the show. Character opinions are simply character opinions, of course, but even beyond opinions, the dialogue is also there to put forth general philosophical ideas that require a bit of authority and directness from the characters to be effective. But what is the message, really? I think there\'s a lot there, the main thing being the idea that we are, as living things, a part of the universe as everything else is. To find happiness as humans then is to live as parts in harmony, like the rest. The idea is,  that our trying to dictate our own roles in the the universe, according to our own whims, is what is making the world imbalanced. A simple life then, is to live the way nature dictates, and to live this way we need to come to an understanding about what we NEED. Coming to such an answer requires a sort of philosophical journey that can only be achieved via becoming intune with the earth itself. The anime is calling on us to try and learn from nature, ask questions about what we need to survive, what we really need for happiness.  Live according to principle. Definitely, biologically deterministic.  I\'d say the anime has an aura of stoicism around it.To summarize: To understand ourselves at the most basic level, is to understand the world.There are two ways of looking at it, maybe it really isn\'t so ""propagandistic"" after all, and all of the \'complaining\' is just to get us to that one simple truth. (In the end,this is how I see it).Conclusion of this part: watch this series as you would an art film, detach yourself from the politics of the message and let it impact your emotions not your rationality.Despite what the synopsis tells us, this is a character driven, dialogue heavy, and not an action or plot driven show (thank God).  Juna and Tokio are great characters. The show gives them a relationship and makes me care about how it turns out, in fact I\'d say their relationship and interactions make up about 80% of this anime (which I was pleasantly surprised by). A long conversation between them feels just as natural as a diatribe about our place on the planet. Not only is it a journey for Juna, and her understanding of life on earth, it is also a journey for her and Tokio\'s relationship. We really see how it effects them, and of course, how their love for each other effects the journey they take together. They really are a great couple.To put the importance of the ""plot"" into perspective, despite putting a lot of effort into making you think this would be a typical combat/magic based series in the first episode, we get two episodes of Juna and Tokio hanging out with the aforementioned old guy in the mountains (great episodes by the way). What might be the meat of the plot for any other series takes a back-seat in this one. This is a good thing because the Raaja stuff isn\'t all that interesting.However, Juna\'s psychological and philosophical journey IS interesting. In the end coming to terms with a truth that has been fluttering around in her mind (as we see) since the first scene of the first episode.The pacing also really got me. I already have a weakness for slow-moving, atmospheric shows and this one manages to maintain a consistent pace the entire run-time. Irregular episode lengths allow for some episodes to accomplish more without having to speed anything up.Wish i had the vocabulary to describe the art and visual direction. Let\'s just say it really works well.I think a lot of what is great about this show needs to be experienced. And I am writing this review because I think the overall low score is due to people  literally WATCHING IT WRONG. Hopefully with the right perspective a new audience on this site could appreciate this anime a little better. Because if nothing else, this is absolutely an above average series. If I\'ve managed to point out what to keep an eye out for, I think this review has done its job. (Also this anime is an instant favourite for me). nothing feels out of place.

The theme behind the entire plot is an attack on intellectual thought, and a vitriolic tantrum demanding a return to the ignorant bliss of an agrarian society. It fails to support any claim it makes despite presenting pathetic straw men arguments that it pretends are the only refutation of the tired nonsense spewed throughout the show. Characters exist solely to deliver these one-off lines of dialogue in the interest of avoiding an actual counter, and this on its own deserves contempt. In addition, when they do make a claim...it is simply untrue.A pro-environment message would have been fine, but this show is a celebration of the banal tropes of the intellectually bereft.

The art actually reminded me of something from ‚ÄúTenchi Muyo!‚Äù but it‚Äôs a bit more messy than it. Plus, you can tell that the CGI didn‚Äôt age very well but it‚Äôs not detrimental of the story. It felt very much like it‚Äôs imcompleted, somehow but the landscapes are from from that. The landscapes are breathtaking and gorgeous and really pops out from the actual characters.Going...by the first episode by itself, it goes into it immediately along with the action of her powers, even if she‚Äôs not ‚Äútruly‚Äù woken up. But the episodes after that seemed to grind to a halt; it‚Äôs mostly because Chris, the person who saved Juna‚Äôs life from death, who is gravely ill and disabled ‚Äì when he fights, he doesn‚Äôt fight physically. Instead, his spirit seems to leave his body at will and fights for him. He‚Äôs also a telepathic and has a young girl, Cindy, to translate for him because he can‚Äôt talk on his own.The thing is ‚Äì Juna keeps misunderstanding him. She, including the audience, assumes that by stopping the Raaja, she has to kill them.Raaja are demons from the earth who, after a period of time, cannot handle mankind‚Äôs pollution anymore so it retaliates by attacking the humans and whatever it is that‚Äôs hurting the planet. Juna‚Äôs job is to, really, retain these demons from causing anymore harm on the earth rather than actually killing it. However, she needs to understand why she retains them instead just of using the arrow and besides the obvious answers of protecting the earth and her loved ones.Along for the ride is Juna‚Äôs boyfriend, Tokio who is a typical rich kid and will follow Juna to the ends of the earth. The series mostly focuses on their relationship as Juna‚Äôs powers prevent her from doing the normal teenage stuff they used to do before (mostly eat hamburgers or consume junk food). He really doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on and truly does love her but it‚Äôs hard for him to understand. Even if Juna attempts to explain it to him, it‚Äôs just gets lost under the muddle.But truly, her powers are hard to explain if you don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so important for the Avatar of Time to defend the earth and it‚Äôs important to understand why the Avatar of Time to defend the humans.Unlike most series, this one goes really hard and seriously goes all out to make Juna and the viewer to understand that: all life is important. In one of the episodes, they talk about babies and hearing their voices before they‚Äôre born. Juna‚Äôs older sister, Kaine, whom Juna already has a strained relationship with, is pregnant and Juna tries hard to convince her not to abort the baby; but only because Juna could hear her son within her sister.A lot of the side stories and characters remain open ended and up for interpretation but for good reason. Something like this does not need a definitive answer from the side characters because the side characters are also real life human beings. Juna may have convinced her sister to keep the baby or maybe not. She never took away her sister‚Äôs agency to abort but only gave her a different train of thought ‚Äì there‚Äôs an unheard baby in all of those who can conceive them. We may or may not be able to hear it but it‚Äôs really up to you what to do with it.Usually in magical girl anime, there‚Äôs a always some form of focus on the relationship. This anime does just that. A lot of it is introspection about the world around us, true, but it also focuses on the relationships Juna had or have. In the case of her father, he ran off with another woman and chose to stay with her because it was easier than facing her mother about the affair. Sayuri loves Tokio and even though she loves her friend Juna, she couldn‚Äôt help but strain that friendship because of Juna‚Äôs sudden shift in personality. Her feelings towards Tokio were just that much stronger and especially since Tokio was having trouble coping with Juna. Juna‚Äôs relationship with her mother and sister are so very important ‚Äì after all, your mother is the one who kept you safe in her womb and your sister is your blood relative. If we are all connected, then it‚Äôs even more so important to consider your relationship with your family.SEED are those militant environmentalists that help people like Juna, Chris, and Cindy protect the earth from pollution, world hunger, and all those very important issues but they‚Äôre mostly put in the back burner since this is more about Juna‚Äôs awakening. They‚Äôre a great addition, nevertheless, and also add to the dire importance of Juna realizing the message sooner before anything worse could have happened.One of the things I really liked about this anime is that they mixed in a variation of live action and animation (however messy and out dated it actually is) to really drive home the point about saving the earth and how we‚Äôre all connected to everything and everyone around us. For some, this could be really out of place in regards to the tone of the anime or the current episode but it‚Äôs still really important. If we don‚Äôt make that connection and if we don‚Äôt truly understands what is the point of Juna even bothering saving the world, then there‚Äôs not a lot at stake. The stakes are not placed high enough for us, the audience, to fully understand why this earth is crumbling and dying a painful death.Juna, though, is still very much a high school girl and she‚Äôs very much still a human. She pushes Tokio away in an effort to protect him from danger but even with her own insistence, she just can‚Äôt leave him alone. She loves him so very much but she does not want him to put in danger because of her.Granted, there‚Äôs not a lot of action sequences in this anime that people can marvel at but that‚Äôs the whole point: what is Juna fighting for? Why is she fighting them? Why is she protecting them? Why is it so important that Juna knows how food is made and where it came from?Why do you kill?That‚Äôs the question that Chris always asked Juna and with Juna, the audience is just as annoyed and angry about its meaning until the very last episode. But because the audience is angry, it means that they‚Äôre thinking. It means that they‚Äôre considering everything that they‚Äôve done ‚Äì eating out at McDonalds, throwing away a meaningless piece of plastic on the ground, the boring rituals we do every day to make us think we‚Äôve done a job well done. That‚Äôs not to say everything is fruitless and has no meaning. There is meaning in what we do. Maybe it‚Äôs not as deep as we liken it and maybe it isn‚Äôt. However, everything we do and don‚Äôt do is important in the grand scheme of things.Granted, this anime is extremely preachy when it comes to the environment of the earth but the message really is clear: we are one. We are one. The more pollution we put into our bodies, the more pollution we produce. We lose our meaning when we push aside our feelings and emotions for the sake of something mass produced. Maybe there‚Äôs a temporary joy in material items but, essentially, we‚Äôre not communicating with one another not because of technology ‚Äì because we forgot that we are all one and the same.And it‚Äôs so important for Juna to understand that so she can protect those who are still alive from ourselves.(Part of Project Magic!!) by the first episode by itself, it goes into it immediately along with the action of her powers, even if she‚Äôs not ‚Äútruly‚Äù woken up. But the episodes after that seemed to grind to a halt; it‚Äôs mostly because Chris, the person who saved Juna‚Äôs life from death, who is gravely ill and disabled ‚Äì when he fights, he doesn‚Äôt fight physically. Instead, his spirit seems to leave his body at will and fights for him. He‚Äôs also a telepathic and has a young girl, Cindy, to translate for him because he can‚Äôt talk on his own.The thing is ‚Äì Juna keeps misunderstanding him. She, including the audience, assumes that by stopping the Raaja, she has to kill them.Raaja are demons from the earth who, after a period of time, cannot handle mankind‚Äôs pollution anymore so it retaliates by attacking the humans and whatever it is that‚Äôs hurting the planet.

There is some action but most of the anime deals with a young teenage girl's feelings and growing awareness towards the environment.  In a way it also teaches the viewer about the environment and what's being done to the planet as well as gives hints on what we can do...to prevent what can be called at some point environmental disasters. to prevent what can be called at some point environmental disasters."", ""I don't have much experience with the magical girl genre, and the magical girl anime I have seen aren't your typical magical girl anime. However, the few magical girl anime I have seen, I do not like very much, and Arjuna is no expectation.Works that try to make someone care about a world issue, like the environment, are typically pulled down by the fact that it's very tough to get people nowadays to relate to it. I mean, sure I'm slightly concerned about pollution and stuff, but it doesn't directly affect me, so why should I do anything to stop it? Sure people are chopping...down trees, but I'm not an animal living in a forest, so how does it affect me? I'm not a plant, so how does putting insecticides and other stuff like that on there affect me? If you can't relate to it, then you can't really care about it. I believe that the goal of an environmental work, or any preachy work for that matter, is to try and get the normal person to relate to whatever environmental problem there is, as these problems don't affect the lives of most people. The only thing I have ever seen do that right is the Ghilbi movie Pom Poko, which managed to get you to relate to the problems by showing you how the animals see things. How does Arjuna try to get you to care about the environment? It preaches it you.Arjuna stuffs its morals down your throat instead of letting them sink in. Instead of showing you exactly how insecticides affect plants, it will put a dull four minute rant at the end of the episode about the episode that has little to do with the rest of the episode (which it does, like, three times.) And even when Arjuna does attempt to show you how we're harming the environment, its by having the main character not be able to eat fruit juice as it was processed. No, really. According to this anime, you can't eat anything apparently as it had something done to it to make it not natural. You can't even eat fruit you buy at the store as that has chemicals used on it. And guess what? Arjuna has more excellent morals to tell you along the way besides ones about the environment! Did you know its wrong to have babies in hospitals (*cough* Clannad After Story. By the way, this episode also shows an incredibly hilarious scene of a baby being born in the middle of the ocean and then somehow floating up to the surface. Yes, this is as dumb as it sounds/)? No? Well, how about how talking pulls us further apart? How about the evils of medicine? (and the next episode, they then proceed to go on a life-threatening journey to get some medicine. No comment.) I have a feeling that if we followed all of the side morals Arjuna offers along the way, we would all be dead.But once you get past the ridiculousness of what this show is trying to tell you, shall we look at our plot? Plot? What plot? Well, okay, maybe the Rajaa do tie this show together barely, but for the most part, this show is an episodic show! With lame episodic plots that typically evolve Tokio and Juna arguing somewhere in there and of course Juna's best friend has a crush on Tokio and of course Juan sees them together at McDonalds and suspects the worse, as we all know that anime boys can't hang out with other girls without cheating on them! And when this show isn't throwing cheesy morals at you or offering your typical cheesy shoujo romance drama (of which I hate, by the way), it's offering some confusing rant by one of the characters with no point or a fight or just some mystery surrounding everything. And when the plot starts picking up in the final three episodes or so, it manages to be a total mess that makes no sense whatsoever, leading to a rather dumb ending that will have you shaking your heads to how dumb it is! Hooray!Speaking of characters, they're very... Annoying, Juna just wants to know what's going on, is tomboyish, and is somewhat relaxed too. Tokio is an idiot who doesn't care about the environment and gets sick fast of Juna's inability to eat anything on this planet. Cindy is stuck-up and only cares about Chris, but has a sweet side to her, and Chris is just plain mysterious. All development is forced and doesn't feel very natural and several of the characters are a slight annoyance, like poor Tokio, who really wants to get transferred to a different anime. He's the one I relate to in this.However, it is not a lost cause fully! The terrible plot and characters are slightly redeemed by two things! One- This show looks awesome. It has awesome animation and the character designs are the character designs I tend to lean towards liking more, ones without much detail around the hair and clothes but still look wonderful. Everything moves beautifully and fluidly. Two- This show has an awesome soundtrack by Yoko Kanno! Filled with beautiful vocal songs and an ending theme that changes often to make up for the fact it lacks an opening theme (which did kind of bother me as I like opening themes a lot and listen to several outside of when I'm watching anime),and the voice acting is decent enough too! This show has a budget! ‚Ä¶ If only it can get better writers.All right!

But in the twilight of death, she saw a vision of the future, of the barren earth destroyed by something call the Raaja, and was offered a second chance at life if she would help stop them. Now she must learn to cast aside her thoughtlessly destructive ways and face her destiny as the Avatar of Time, the one being who can decide the fate of the planet.If you can't tell by the description, you'll know it within the first couple of episodes...of the show, but the series makes it blatantly obvious as to what the message is, to take care of nature and not carelessly intrude on it and pollute it with human made machines. It feels like a first year philosophy class, and the show shoves it down your throat by the end of it. You don't have to be subtle to get a message across, but it would have been nice if the whole thing had been a little less in your face.On top of that, the whole thing feels weirdly edited, like a lot of ideas had to be cut down to fit 13 episodes.

I guess CGI had to have some growing pains, but CGI from that time in anime just makes it look a lot worse.There is a decent idea here, but it's buried entirely under a mediocre execution.

It has many glaring flaws, which will be mentioned below, but despite these, I resoundingly adored it. If you like environmentalism, Hinduism, or ontology (in that order), then you should try this anime. The basics of this show have been discussed elsewhere, so instead I'll focus on THREE of its most important elements that catapulted this anime unexpectedly into my favourites list.FIRSTLY: The obvious, Arjuna's most polarising feature is its very overt and nuanced environmentalist message. I am in the camp that sees this as its greatest strength. It acknowledges that there is no way out of our...wanton disregard for the Earth's well-being without there being either mass human suffering if we were to go down the path of suddenly halting all environmentally destructive behaviour, or, phasing this out slowly and being faced with continued ecological degradation over the coming decades, resulting in a mass extinction event (in the real world we went with option two). This is a mature take on the problem, and surpasses other media of its kind with their unfounded optimism.SECONDLY: Its (albeit too brief) exploration of non-dual philosophy, especially in episodes 4 and 13. Juna's discovery of mindfulness meditation and Indic non-dualism (NOT monism, crucial difference!) play an important role in the journey of any spiritually inclined environmentalist. Ecosystem destruction is not only harmful to humans insofar as it will cause the disruption of a complex web of biological networks that must be maintained in order for civilisation to exist, but also because, at the end of the day, we are not separate from nature. Babies do not possess the same ego-else dichotomy that adults do, and rather than developing this feeling more strongly to live in harmony with the universe, as we should, we choose instead to crush it in favour of pursuing a misguided mastery over an 'otherised' Earth. I think the anime does a good job of representing the three possible divergences from this idea; the 'normies' who do subconsciously see humans as above nature, the ecoterrorist who sees modern civilisation as unredeemable, and the old man who finds the middle way.THIRDLY: Juna's experience with being unable to eat meat had a strong impact on me personally. It depicts the struggle of trying to go vegan in a meat-oriented society quite well, though with the usual anime peacocking lol. [MILD SPOILERS] Tokio's reaction is quite authentic as well, and is reminiscent of conversations I've had with friends on the same topic in similar circumstances. It's hard to give up meat, but it's the right thing to do, and Juna can't seem to understand how anyone can continue to eat it even after they know how factory farms work (nor I, truth be told), so in this sense, her reaction is also quite understandable and human [END SPOILERS] I loved Juna's and Tokio's character and relationship growth, to my mind, they echo the conversations that we have with ourselves when we learn about these issues.Ultimately, I agree with most of the criticism: the animation is rough around the edges, Chris is a bit irritating, and some of its more scientifically controversial takes leaves a sour taste in one's mouth, BUT, despite all these, again, I loved Earth Maiden Arjuna. I am the exact type of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy loving, acid dropping, environmentalist hippie that this anime was made for, and despite its low rating here on MAL, it is a truly heartfelt and tasteful work of art, unfairly maligned. wanton disregard for the Earth's well-being without there being either mass human suffering if we were to go down the path of suddenly halting all environmentally destructive behaviour, or, phasing this out slowly and being faced with continued ecological degradation over the coming decades, resulting in a mass extinction event (in the real world we went with option two).

Its prime directive is to teach the target audience how to respect nature and the basics of ecology. It‚Äôs also moralistic with long serious monologues which can easily pass as preachy. Learning stuff through anime can be fun but not when the characters are telling you to open your textbook on page 123.It‚Äôs fairly unorthodox as a mahou shojo, since the lead girl‚Äôs magic powers are not used on every episode, she has strange-looking clothes, and her prime weapon is a bow.

Not many anime care to deal with socio-political issues since they are usually targeted at the shounen/shoujo demographic who expect ballistic action sequences, gripping drama or cute endearing romedies. EMA tries to incorporate some of these elements to keep its audience base entertained. It has a bit of action and high school teen drama too. Its central theme however, is a critique of the modern way of living and its consequences. A very admirable premise dealt with sharp witty sarcasm. Despite its good intentions,...the show falls prey to directionless story-telling and largely annoying characters. It's made only worse by trying to include action and high school drama to attract the general audience. As a result, the show is a sloppy mess until the last 2 episodes where it elevates slightly to make a decent ending. In my opinion they were better off making a feature film instead of a 13 episode long series. Considering only the plot and characters I'd give EMA only a 6/10.However, Its Art and Animation department is outstanding done with great style. I even liked how they included a few live clips to reinforce realism when required. the few action scenes look gorgeous. I couldn't believe this obscure anime had such exceptional visuals. As for music, it is one of THE best I've heard. Yoko Kanno never fails to disappoint me. Not many composers can bring out the soul of an anime in its music like Yoko does. IT is splendid  and you gusy should check it out even if you drop this anime.It has its flaws, but if you are concerned about the environment, which you should be especially now, do give this one a watch... and maybe bea bit patient with its flaws. the show falls prey to directionless story-telling and largely annoying characters.

The show is interesting at points and it can be thought provoking, but the whole story kind of just feels confused to me. It could be because it wasn\'t what I wanted it to be or that the first 2 episodes may have put my expectations out of whack but I was expecting this to be some kind of superhero globe trotting adventure show where Tokio, Juna and the SEED orangization go on adventures together defeating Raja and then some lesson and points about enviromentalism would be brought up while it was going...on. I was expecting this to be some kind of monster of the week with an underlying over arching plot which would slowly reveal itself.But it was ultimately a slice of life show with heavy enviromentalism themes with the show occasionally reminding you that Juna has superpowers. Juna would be struggling to live her day to day life and has that weird love triangle while problems around the world were happening and Seed was dealing with that. The latter was more interesting to me, and I care more about that because it felt bigger and more important then Juna\'s family problems or whether or not she still has the ability to eat ""manufactured"" food. I also got annoyed by the character of Chris and his endless philosophical ramblings and him constantly telling Juna that she ""doesn\'t get it"" throughout most of the show. The best way I can say it is, I wish the show had thought provoking themes and all that enviromentalism talk while also having a plot that was more engaging.

Enter Shoji Kawamori of Macross and Escaflowne fame, who was reading Time Magazine or The Economist or whatever that were saying how bad things are gonna be in the 21st century coz of Global Warming, overpopulation, etc., and he said, ""time to yell at everyone to do...better"".

Happy Sugar Life,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37517/Happy_Sugar_Life,"[""It‚Äôs only stupid if it doesn‚Äôt work.Nowadays, the shows I fight to defend are highly misunderstood because their appeal is too specific, causing the general audience to flaunt their standards around like they‚Äôre supposed to mean anything.  Past examples include Mahou Shoujo Site, Jashin-chan Dropkick and Hand Shakers.  Yet, Happy Sugar Life is a different sort of‚Ä¶ thing, whose plot setup is about as logically sound as riding a lawnmower during a hurricane, seemingly leaving not but a select, niche appeal for the sickos like me.A high school girl is basically holding a little girl hostage in a populated apartment complex; she hides...this among her normal daily life of going to school and working part-time jobs.  You know, like all teenagers do.  If this is your first time reading the synopsis, then you‚Äôre probably asking a lot of questions like ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  because the basic rules and structure of society suggest that this shouldn‚Äôt even be possible.  And for me, knowing that much is what made this story interesting--HOW these characters are living such lives, and what will happen when it inevitably shatters.  Because there‚Äôs just no way it won‚Äôt--and the very first scene of the anime suggests that it very much will.Happy Sugar Life makes use of its own flaws.  The sugar-coated scenes of the main characters in their unnatural habitat are not just for show; they‚Äôre presented as a true illusion from reality.  The conflict is all the outsiders learning more about their lives and trying to tear it down, a plot that snowballs as the situation becomes more and more complicated.  A situation known as ‚Äúreality‚Äù.What‚Äôs more, is that the aforementioned little girl doesn‚Äôt even seem to be a real character.  Shio Koube lives and breathes, but her actual personality is baffling.  She‚Äôs constantly happy and cheery and trying to do the best she can to help her caretaker.  She doesn‚Äôt question the life she lives or the outside world she‚Äôs prevented from seeing.  She is simply ‚Äúa daughteru‚Äù:  the ideal child anyone would want to have--no, scratch that.  Megumin and Chtholly are daughterus to me, but that‚Äôs because they actually seem like real characters, because real characters have flaws.  Shio Koube does not.  Shio Koube is not a real character, nor a daughteru--she is a pet. A Shia pet, if you will.  She exists to be cute and fluffy; you feed her and play with her a bit, and if you can do those two things, then she‚Äôs not gonna be a bother to you outside of the occasional natural fuck-up.  That‚Äôs cool and all, but that‚Äôs not how a human child actually acts.But what‚Äôs smart about the anime is that it actually addresses this.  Shio‚Äôs personality is the result of past trauma that‚Äôs she‚Äôs forgotten; and as she learns more and more about herself, it starts to crack a little.  By the end of the series, Shio outright states that she‚Äôs meant to be more than a living object used to draw mental security from, practically breaking the fourth wall by stating she‚Äôs a real character who has a functional and realistic train of thought that accurately feeds into her personality.In other words, Happy Sugar Life was only pretending to be retarded.Because, with the way it handles its plot by addressing its flaws and nailing its appeal with few problems, I can‚Äôt help but think that Happy Sugar Life is actually pretty clever.  As dumb and over-the-top it may seem, it was in full control of itself and did what it set out to do.Suffering, violence, trauma and psychosis.  Of course an anime called ‚ÄúHappy Sugar Life‚Äù would be about anything but.  Characters have very specific, intricately detailed mental issues, so much so that I can‚Äôt guarantee the anime doesn‚Äôt take place in some sort of high-tech asylum that simulates society as therapy for its patients.  The way they‚Äôre presented are interesting on their own for what they are, but the main character herself acts in a surprisingly grounded manner.In the first episode, she verbally beats down her employer over a payroll cut, explaining how she was fully aware of the manager‚Äôs schemes but played along for the sake of being nice, only to still be punished.  She completely dismantles this person mentally and challenges her, but her tone of voice is what sells the scene.  She doesn‚Äôt scream or shout, the soundtrack is dark but sparse with details, and the visual direction is simple but effective.  It‚Äôs not dynamic, over-acted, or over-the-top.  This scene could‚Äôve easily been a screaming match between two idiots, but‚Ä¶ that would just be silly and unnecessary.  Quiet words speak louder than loud words.  That‚Äôs totally how the saying goes.Satou Matsuzaka, aka ‚ÄúHoly Shit Is That A Motherfucking Mirai Nikki Reference???‚Äù is fully in control of herself, able to function like a normal person in most circumstances.  And by ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù, I mean she seems to be keeping a deeper anger pent up within her, choosing not to do any more than what‚Äôs necessary.  It‚Äôs a contrast from the manager in episode one, who fights back with shouting and more body language, among other characters that I‚Äôll get into later.  The stability of Definitely Not Yuno‚Äôs mental condition is part of the snowballing conflict--as her Title of The Anime becomes harder and harder to keep, her psyche decays, and as her psyche decays, she becomes more and more dangerous.Basically, if you know what the fuck a yandere is, you know what‚Äôs up.Watching Pink Yandere fall further into despair as the story progressed, as well as her drastic shifts in attitude, are a blast to watch.  Hana Kanazawa delivers one of the best performances in her incredibly prolific career, at times sounding completely unrecognizable to me.  She‚Äôs not just using her Akane Tsunemori serious drama voice, she‚Äôs speaking in a tone FAR lower than almost every anime she‚Äôs been cast in.  And, as a huge fan of Mirai Nikki, you bet your ass I loved episode 11 when she tied her hair back to look exactly like Yuno.  Praise be.The other characters in the series are in various stages of sanity, for better or for worse.  The most notable is Satou‚Äôs Aunt, who hoardes trash and lets weirdos beat the shit out of her for pleasure.  You know, like all loving aunts do.  But, like Satou, she‚Äôs fully in control of her actions.  Rather, this is a matter of one being so deluded of themselves that they believe their behavior to be healthy.  AILF (aunt i‚Äôd like to fuck) even convinces herself to have a fulfilling role within society, accepting hostility and fucking it out of them.  She is indeed quite over-the-top, but the long dialogues she provides make her believable enough to be enjoyable.And then there‚Äôs the lolicon guy‚Ä¶ oh boy.  This fuckin‚Äô guy.  As a result of things happening that cause him to distrust adults, he becomes so fully attached to Shio that he takes passionate inhalations of her missing poster flyers.  THIS is the over-the-top character that you‚Äôd expect to see from a full edgelord show, and really, your opinion of him just depends on how much you‚Äôre into that kinda stuff.  To me, this character is no more than a punchline--more like a punching bag, actually, given all the shit he goes through.  A full display of maximum disparity and lack of self-control, his actions are so cartoonish and ridiculous that all he ends up doing in the series is suffering. A lot.  He‚Äôs just a dumping ground for all the negative consequences brought on by the other characters.  Overall, not a character to be taken seriously; he stands at the border between Happy Sugar Life being a completely serious drama and a goofy, edgy comedy.  I like the mixture of both worlds.But the crowning jewel of this anime are some of the more psychologically-based scenes.  For as weird and silly as the anime can be, there are scenes of actual genius scattered throughout--most notably, the first half of episode eight.  It explores the backstory of Satou‚Äôs and Shio‚Äôs apartment through the eyes of its former resident.  All of it is in first-person view with no music, and the resident never speaks.  Instead, their moments of ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù are replaced with a glitchy audio clip over a fluctuating black line.  The pauses before these clips make noise and their varying intensity fill in the blanks of Satou‚Äôs conversations perfectly.  It‚Äôs a tremendously well-done scene that I would recommend to anyone, even if you haven't seen the rest of the anime.Sound manipulation is a motif in this series; characters‚Äô voices will become static-y and distorted in key moments to intensify their dark expressions.  Several different visual tricks are used for similar reasons--glowing eyes, static, reflections, scratchy lines, lighting, shadows, tactful shot compositions and other things are all deployed for the show‚Äôs depraved, depressing and dark moods without overdoing any of them.  Meanwhile, happier moments are shown with sparkles, bubbles, clouds and bright, poppy colors; so corny that they‚Äôre almost vomit-inducing, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Happy Sugar Life doesn‚Äôt necessarily excel with animation, set pieces or character designs, but the various tricks it uses to communicate its feelings are excellent.Similarly, the soundtrack doesn‚Äôt particularly stand out, but the sound design is quite good, I‚Äôll say again.  Rising violins, static, vocal manipulation and prestigious voice acting get the job more than done.  The OP is one of my favorites of the entire year, using a song perfectly toned to this anime with its siren-like guitar riffs and optimistic, upbeat tone, shifting in and out of muttered, paranoid passages.  Bizarre, photographed objects float about in the background; a Shio-like angel flies over shadowy figures of the characters, and various trappings by glass jars and thorns lay over Satou as the video glitches with inconsistent timing.  It‚Äôs easy to see what‚Äôs going on in the OP based on a few episodes of the show itself, but it‚Äôs communicated in so many incredible ways that the OP never got skipped.  The ED is good‚Ä¶ for an ED, that is, which is to say not much, but the animation of Satou and Shio is cute, and the song itself is quite touching.If you‚Äôve read my reviews before, you know that I‚Äôm completely and 100% serious in all of my reviews, and I never make any jokes whatsoever, so when I say this is a 9/10 anime, I mean that it should be watched by all eyes, no matter what.Now, if you‚Äôve ACTUALLY read my reviews before, you‚Äôd know I like to play around, that I don‚Äôt really care about ratings, that I‚Äôm not all that interested in seeing a fully-serious, masterfully-crafted story.  But with its combination of surprise turnarounds, smart directing and just the right amount of silliness, I‚Äôd truly say that Happy Sugar Life is a quality anime; not just by my standards, but for drama and psychological anime as a whole.  Indeed, it is not perfect--some people will be unhappy with some of the characters or not be willing to see how the anime fixes itself down the line.  In fact, I myself have room to complain about the teacher not having any real exploration to his character, as well as some scenes that simply would not happen in the real world, such as Satou's Aunt seducing the police officer, as good as it was.  A lot of it is conveniently written.  The characters aren‚Äôt particularly deep and more idealized than realized.  But, overall, Happy Sugar Life is FUN.  It is an exciting series that takes little time to light its first match, and once it gets going it doesn‚Äôt let up until it has burned everything down.I dearly recommend this anime to anyone who‚Äôs into not just edgy comedies, but anyone who‚Äôs interested in a kinda wacky psychological drama that even manages to unnerve you a little bit.  Perhaps it is not the most effective at what it is, but it is, nonetheless, effective.Story - 8/10Art - 8/10Sound - 8/10Characters - 7/10Enjoyment - 9/10Yandere - 10/10Overall - 9/10Favorite episode - 8Favorite character - Satou.

And for me, knowing that much is what made this story interesting--HOW these characters are living such lives, and what will happen when it inevitably shatters.  Because there‚Äôs just no way it won‚Äôt--and the very first scene of the anime suggests that it very much will.Happy Sugar Life makes use of its own flaws.  The sugar-coated scenes of the main characters in their unnatural habitat are not just for show; they‚Äôre presented as a true illusion from reality.  The conflict is all the outsiders learning more about their lives and trying to tear it down, a plot that snowballs as the situation becomes more and more complicated.  A situation known as ‚Äúreality‚Äù.What‚Äôs more, is that the aforementioned little girl doesn‚Äôt even seem to be a real character.  Shio Koube lives and breathes, but her actual personality is baffling.  She‚Äôs constantly happy and cheery and trying to do the best she can to help her caretaker.  She doesn‚Äôt question the life she lives or the outside world she‚Äôs prevented from seeing.  She is simply ‚Äúa daughteru‚Äù:  the ideal child anyone would want to have--no, scratch that.  Megumin and Chtholly are daughterus to me, but that‚Äôs because they actually seem like real characters, because real characters have flaws.  Shio Koube does not.  Shio Koube is not a real character, nor a daughteru--she is a pet. A Shia pet, if you will.  She exists to be cute and fluffy; you feed her and play with her a bit, and if you can do those two things, then she‚Äôs not gonna be a bother to you outside of the occasional natural fuck-up.  That‚Äôs cool and all, but that‚Äôs not how a human child actually acts.But what‚Äôs smart about the anime is that it actually addresses this.  Shio‚Äôs personality is the result of past trauma that‚Äôs she‚Äôs forgotten; and as she learns more and more about herself, it starts to crack a little.  By the end of the series, Shio outright states that she‚Äôs meant to be more than a living object used to draw mental security from, practically breaking the fourth wall by stating she‚Äôs a real character who has a functional and realistic train of thought that accurately feeds into her personality.In other words, Happy Sugar Life was only pretending to be retarded.Because, with the way it handles its plot by addressing its flaws and nailing its appeal with few problems, I can‚Äôt help but think that Happy Sugar Life is actually pretty clever.  As dumb and over-the-top it may seem, it was in full control of itself and did what it set out to do.Suffering, violence, trauma and psychosis.  Of course an anime called ‚ÄúHappy Sugar Life‚Äù would be about anything but.  Characters have very specific, intricately detailed mental issues, so much so that I can‚Äôt guarantee the anime doesn‚Äôt take place in some sort of high-tech asylum that simulates society as therapy for its patients.  The way they‚Äôre presented are interesting on their own for what they are, but the main character herself acts in a surprisingly grounded manner.In the first episode, she verbally beats down her employer over a payroll cut, explaining how she was fully aware of the manager‚Äôs schemes but played along for the sake of being nice, only to still be punished.  She completely dismantles this person mentally and challenges her, but her tone of voice is what sells the scene.  She doesn‚Äôt scream or shout, the soundtrack is dark but sparse with details, and the visual direction is simple but effective.  It‚Äôs not dynamic, over-acted, or over-the-top.  This scene could‚Äôve easily been a screaming match between two idiots, but‚Ä¶ that would just be silly and unnecessary.  Quiet words speak louder than loud words.  That‚Äôs totally how the saying goes.Satou Matsuzaka, aka ‚ÄúHoly Shit Is That A Motherfucking Mirai Nikki Reference???‚Äù is fully in control of herself, able to function like a normal person in most circumstances.  And by ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù, I mean she seems to be keeping a deeper anger pent up within her, choosing not to do any more than what‚Äôs necessary.  It‚Äôs a contrast from the manager in episode one, who fights back with shouting and more body language, among other characters that I‚Äôll get into later.  The stability of Definitely Not Yuno‚Äôs mental condition is part of the snowballing conflict--as her Title of The Anime becomes harder and harder to keep, her psyche decays, and as her psyche decays, she becomes more and more dangerous.Basically, if you know what the fuck a yandere is, you know what‚Äôs up.Watching Pink Yandere fall further into despair as the story progressed, as well as her drastic shifts in attitude, are a blast to watch.  Hana Kanazawa delivers one of the best performances in her incredibly prolific career, at times sounding completely unrecognizable to me.  She‚Äôs not just using her Akane Tsunemori serious drama voice, she‚Äôs speaking in a tone FAR lower than almost every anime she‚Äôs been cast in.  And, as a huge fan of Mirai Nikki, you bet your ass I loved episode 11 when she tied her hair back to look exactly like Yuno.  Praise be.The other characters in the series are in various stages of sanity, for better or for worse.  The most notable is Satou‚Äôs Aunt, who hoardes trash and lets weirdos beat the shit out of her for pleasure.  You know, like all loving aunts do.  But, like Satou, she‚Äôs fully in control of her actions.  Rather, this is a matter of one being so deluded of themselves that they believe their behavior to be healthy.  AILF (aunt i‚Äôd like to fuck) even convinces herself to have a fulfilling role within society, accepting hostility and fucking it out of them.  She is indeed quite over-the-top, but the long dialogues she provides make her believable enough to be enjoyable.And then there‚Äôs the lolicon guy‚Ä¶ oh boy.  This fuckin‚Äô guy.  As a result of things happening that cause him to distrust adults, he becomes so fully attached to Shio that he takes passionate inhalations of her missing poster flyers.  THIS is the over-the-top character that you‚Äôd expect to see from a full edgelord show, and really, your opinion of him just depends on how much you‚Äôre into that kinda stuff.  To me, this character is no more than a punchline--more like a punching bag, actually, given all the shit he goes through.  A full display of maximum disparity and lack of self-control, his actions are so cartoonish and ridiculous that all he ends up doing in the series is suffering. A lot.  He‚Äôs just a dumping ground for all the negative consequences brought on by the other characters.  Overall, not a character to be taken seriously; he stands at the border between Happy Sugar Life being a completely serious drama and a goofy, edgy comedy.  I like the mixture of both worlds.But the crowning jewel of this anime are some of the more psychologically-based scenes.  For as weird and silly as the anime can be, there are scenes of actual genius scattered throughout--most notably, the first half of episode eight.  It explores the backstory of Satou‚Äôs and Shio‚Äôs apartment through the eyes of its former resident.  All of it is in first-person view with no music, and the resident never speaks.  Instead, their moments of ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù are replaced with a glitchy audio clip over a fluctuating black line.  The pauses before these clips make noise and their varying intensity fill in the blanks of Satou‚Äôs conversations perfectly.  It‚Äôs a tremendously well-done scene that I would recommend to anyone, even if you haven't seen the rest of the anime.Sound manipulation is a motif in this series; characters‚Äô voices will become static-y and distorted in key moments to intensify their dark expressions.  Several different visual tricks are used for similar reasons--glowing eyes, static, reflections, scratchy lines, lighting, shadows, tactful shot compositions and other things are all deployed for the show‚Äôs depraved, depressing and dark moods without overdoing any of them.  Meanwhile, happier moments are shown with sparkles, bubbles, clouds and bright, poppy colors; so corny that they‚Äôre almost vomit-inducing, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Happy Sugar Life doesn‚Äôt necessarily excel with animation, set pieces or character designs, but the various tricks it uses to communicate its feelings are excellent.Similarly, the soundtrack doesn‚Äôt particularly stand out, but the sound design is quite good, I‚Äôll say again.  Rising violins, static, vocal manipulation and prestigious voice acting get the job more than done.  The OP is one of my favorites of the entire year, using a song perfectly toned to this anime with its siren-like guitar riffs and optimistic, upbeat tone, shifting in and out of muttered, paranoid passages.  Bizarre, photographed objects float about in the background; a Shio-like angel flies over shadowy figures of the characters, and various trappings by glass jars and thorns lay over Satou as the video glitches with inconsistent timing.  It‚Äôs easy to see what‚Äôs going on in the OP based on a few episodes of the show itself, but it‚Äôs communicated in so many incredible ways that the OP never got skipped.  The ED is good‚Ä¶ for an ED, that is, which is to say not much, but the animation of Satou and Shio is cute, and the song itself is quite touching.If you‚Äôve read my reviews before, you know that I‚Äôm completely and 100% serious in all of my reviews, and I never make any jokes whatsoever, so when I say this is a 9/10 anime, I mean that it should be watched by all eyes, no matter what.Now, if you‚Äôve ACTUALLY read my reviews before, you‚Äôd know I like to play around, that I don‚Äôt really care about ratings, that I‚Äôm not all that interested in seeing a fully-serious, masterfully-crafted story.  But with its combination of surprise turnarounds, smart directing and just the right amount of silliness, I‚Äôd truly say that Happy Sugar Life is a quality anime; not just by my standards, but for drama and psychological anime as a whole.  Indeed, it is not perfect--some people will be unhappy with some of the characters or not be willing to see how the anime fixes itself down the line.  In fact, I myself have room to complain about the teacher not having any real exploration to his character, as well as some scenes that simply would not happen in the real world, such as Satou's Aunt seducing the police officer, as good as it was.  A lot of it is conveniently written.  The characters aren‚Äôt particularly deep and more idealized than realized.  But, overall, Happy Sugar Life is FUN.  It is an exciting series that takes little time to light its first match, and once it gets going it doesn‚Äôt let up until it has burned everything down.I dearly recommend this anime to anyone who‚Äôs into not just edgy comedies, but anyone who‚Äôs interested in a kinda wacky psychological drama that even manages to unnerve you a little bit.  Perhaps it is not the most effective at what it is, but it is, nonetheless, effective.Story - 8/10Art - 8/10Sound - 8/10Characters - 7/10Enjoyment - 9/10Yandere - 10/10Overall - 9/10Favorite episode - 8Favorite character - Satou.

But as the saying goes, ‚Äúone man‚Äôs trash is another man‚Äôs treasure‚Äù, and it looks...like I‚Äôve found my\xa0treasure in the trash that is Happy Sugar Life.First and foremost, let me be clear with you this exact brand of trash was thrown aside just so a degenerate with the exact perversions as myself could crawl by and fish it out of the muddy gutter. If you aren‚Äôt messed up in the head in the exact same manner as I am, then you should stay as far away from this embarrassing train wreck of an anime as you possibly can, so I‚Äôll just cut to the chase. If you don‚Äôt like yuri romance, age-gap romance, moe girls, lolis, or Stockholm Syndrome fetishism, then take your leave immediately for your own sanity‚Äôs good. This show is abjectly terrible, so just save yourself while you still can. But if you are into that shit, then let‚Äôs dive in.Happy Sugar Life is in the ‚Äúhorror comedy‚Äù genre of anime, anime which are technically horror thrillers, but anime which are so bombastically bad at being provocative they just become funny. Everyone and everything is comically over-the-top edgy for no reason. There‚Äôs murder, rape, extramarital affairs, any overused bullet point on the edge checklist gets checked. Everything looks ugly as sin, the animation is god awful, the character designs are beyond basic, the OST is either boring or actively unfitting, the cinematography is almost exclusively flat-panning shots with 70% of every episode being still frames, and I could honestly keep going because this is a bottom-of-the-barrel production from a nobody studio and staff which looks and runs terrifically bad.That said, the main character is a cute yandere girl with pink hair, buns, and is somehow voiced by Kana Hanazawa who is in love with an elementary school loli with whom she shares a home, bath, and bed. I am fucking sold. This show may as well be perfect. Watching this week by week was hysterical. The show is worst of the worst, but I got to be reminded there is a real show, actually being made in real life, which features a yuri age-gap romance about a psychotic sex-craved schoolgirl who murders and blackmails anyone who threatens to interrupt her life living with a loli she literally kidnaped and locked in her apartment. I don‚Äôt need to elaborate on the concept because only one single thing of note happened throughout the entire show, and I don‚Äôt think just because there‚Äôs a decent five minute scene at the end of episode nine you should go and watch the whole show, because the remaining two hundred and fifty nine minutes were pure garbage. Any mature person who happens to come across this review can see this show is nothing but mindless self indulgence, so if it sounds like something you can indulge in like I did, give it a watch.That‚Äôs it. Done. Ten out of ten, would watch again.Thank you for reading. I know my other reviews are more serious than this, but this show was just far too much for me to handle sober and with a straight face. like I‚Äôve found my\xa0treasure in the trash that is Happy Sugar Life.First and foremost, let me be clear with you this exact brand of trash was thrown aside just so a degenerate with the exact perversions as myself could crawl by and fish it out of the muddy gutter.

It went so overboard and above what is acceptable that it became nothing less than great series to watch, and in the mean time, managed to offend lots of people -- which is always a plus. I expected the same from Happy Sugar Life, and while it hasn\'t been exactly as over the top nor has it managed to make people lose their self-control in similar fashion, it did deliver.Our story focuses around two characters: Satou Matsuzaka, a psychotic lesbian pedophile, voiced by Hanawaza Kana (Hype, ikr). And this assumably 4-5 years-old...child. Satou used to be into guys and also didn\'t suffer from several different mental illnesses back then. However, now she is really into this 4-5 years-old girl with whom she lives with (and whom she kidnapped), and they together form this supposedly pure and innocent lesbian romance. Real haato waamingu stuff.However, there is more to life than living in a relationship with a 4 years-old child. At day time, Satou is a working-class citizen, doing real normo shit. In this series universe, normo shit includes reverse-raping men, bullying co-workers, threatening people with murder and torture and of course, serving customers in a restaurant. I know, pretty sick stuff, yuck!The series values the comfy and aesthetic side of life -- with what I identify personally pretty hard with. My favorite scenes include stuff like Satou decorating the house. Who needs paint and a brush, lol only nobs use such things. Machete and a living person, do some well timed choppity chops and oh my, the walls look like new. Such a pretty look to it. Definitely a real home feel right there. I have heard the saying ""paint the mirrors black"" but I guess ""chop the walls red"" isn\'t too bad either.The OST consist of nothing but fantastic decisions. Practically these are songs that sound a lot like any random piece from Youtube audio library which people can use for free in their videos. Practically any of the songs could be used by a random content creator who makes guides on how to change a light bulb to your microwave. Imaging this has only added to the experience.As a conclusion, this is not a series I would recommend to just anyone.Those who have the tendency of finding beauty from stories that were inspired by madness, will have significant chances of liking Happy Sugar Life there were other will only experience bitterness. heh pun child.

Throughout this show, contrasts are stressed and found in every way possible as I will be discussing throughout this review.Art 8/10: One of HSL\'s best attributes.Studio Ezœåla has opted for a pretty basic art style for this Anime. The surroundings or backgrounds are simple, but never feels fake or takes away from the original style, so no points deducted from that. This is the best example of where you can see contrasts being used. In happy or cheerful scenes, the colors used are extremely bright and sparkly. The color...scale also shifts more to red to give that ""alive"" and ""warm"" feeling. And on certain scenes the art turns extremely dark. The entire scene gets washed in a blue like hue to give of this ""dead"" and ""cold"" feeling. HSL also uses the ""eyes are the windows to the soul"" saying to its fullest. In some scenes, the eyes of the characters change drastically to reflect their inner struggles. Subtle things like the eyes giving of a burning sensation when the characters are engulfed in anger is a nice touch and is sometimes pretty hard to see unless you look carefully.There is almost never really on-screen violence in the Anime. The Anime uses visual hints as well accompanying sound effects to make you visualize those scenes for yourself. Which is what makes this Anime a truly psychological Anime.Sound 8/10: The Opening explores this contrasts theme a bit more. The OP begins with an innocent voice and a happy sounding tone. The Opening then switches to a more deep tone and the singer (Akari Nanawo) sings in a more intimidating tone.The Ending has an overall calm tone to help with pressure release and the end of the episode.The OST is subtle but effective, builds tension when it must and sets the overall tone for the scene when needed. In some stages the lack of an OST is also used to give a false sense of security to the viewer before taking you by surprise.The special insert song used in its respective episode was used to support the visual metaphor of the arc as well as support the feelings of the character the arc focuses on.Characters 9/10: The characters are all introduced as normal people. On the surface they all look trustworthy. All the characters are in respectable positions and are in some cases even idolized, but then their insanity meter gets turned up to 11 if they are pushed overboard. Contrasts are once again used here, down to the names of our two main characters, Satou (sugar) and Shio (salt). On the topic of names. The names of the characters all have a meaning to what they provided or represents in the Anime. If you are done watching the Anime I would recommend searching the meaning of their names. The characters feel real in the sense that they all have the inner struggles that we as humans are fighting everyday. The only part where this subtracts from realism is the fact that so many characters snap around the main character.Story 9/10: The story is pretty dark. Themes are explored which is not really that common in some Anime. Which once again brings it back to the contrasts. All of the characters are looking for their ""Happy Sugar Life."" Yet they don\'t see that by searching for this happiness they keep on leaving despair and once they find this ‚Äúideal‚Äù life, they are confused as to why they are not happy. The story intentionally makes you empathize with the main character. Which I would say is hard to do as if you take the character out and place them in the real world, this member would be hated. The story does a great job in making you root and care for a really repulsive being. The pacing is not something to complain about. Not too fast and not too slow. The ending was a bit abrupt and for many was a bit distasteful.Enjoyment 10/10: Why I liked it: The use of all the above discussed means to tell a pretty dark story was something I enjoyed a lot. The overall usage of contrasts was also something that I liked a lot. Studio Ezœåla did a pretty fine job in their first Anime and I am looking forward to more of their work if they are to pursue more titles in the future. I have since then bought the Manga for this and the adaptation done by the Studio was pretty good. The ending was also fully original as the Manga stopped around episode 11.Why You might not like it:The story is not a Happy Sugar Life. It is a psychological horror that keeps you asking ""Is this really OK?"", ""Are we the baddies?"" and ""Why am I rooting for this person?"" Even though there is never really that much on-screen violence. The Anime keep hinting towards what happened and the means in which this violence occurred. The ending was for some a bit distasteful. The story is about a relationship between a child and a high-school student. I think those are the main reasons you would not like this Anime. I would also not recommend this as a first Anime for someone just starting out, unless they like Horror or similar shows to this.Overall 9/10: I was really impressed by this Anime. With a totally new Studio and a director which has only directed a few Anime in the past, my expectations for HSL was pretty low. But as the story progressed I could see the effort the director and the animators put in to make this first project a huge success in my opinion. scale also shifts more to red to give that ""alive"" and ""warm"" feeling. And on certain scenes the art turns extremely dark. The entire scene gets washed in a blue like hue to give of this ""dead"" and ""cold"" feeling.

She seemingly had no goals in life with a rootless understanding about love. Sleeping with guys and not truly knowing what her life is about, she didn‚Äôt know if there was a place to belong. Wondering around the end of abyss of life and not knowing who she can really be with. Then, a child appeared. An innocent child with a face full of life and sugar. Is this a chance to truly discover love? Is it a chance to live a happy sugar life?As a show that combines elements...of psychological horror, suspense, and thriller, Happy Sugar Life looked deceptive at first glance. Now I admit, I‚Äôm a bit of a sucker when it comes to shows where we have an anti-hero protagonist. I mean, the first episode speak for itself once you realize Matsuzaka Satou‚Äôs personality. She is essentially living a double life ‚Äì one that is of a normal girl and other being overly obsessive of Shio Kobe. This devotion to Shio is so strong that she is willing to kill others to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù her from harm. In Satou's mind, being with Shio equates to happiness.Despite the complex nature of the plot, the setup of the story is actually very simple. We got Satou who pretty much takes Shio as a partner and isolates her in a place where she feels is safe. It‚Äôs an apartment that looks normal on the inside and outside until you realize there may be something much darker going on behind the scenes. The first few episodes is rather cryptic about Satou‚Äôs actions including parts where she takes questionable content in and out of the house. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs definitely character chemistry going on between Satou and Shio. The duo shares an innocent love chemistry and ritual-like marriage ceremonies on a frequent basis. On most parts, the show seems fluffy during those segments while masking the suspenseful thriller storytelling. Throughout the series, we discover just how far from normal Satou actually is. The show also makes it clear that she will go to any length to protect Shio even if it means murder. Anyone who is familiar with the term ‚Äòyandere‚Äô will easily dedicate her character as such. In essence, Satou is a complex character who sees her idea of love in a twisted way. Regardless of consequences, she will do anything to protect that love. This puts Shio on the opposite end of the spectrum as she is an innocent child. Despite that, she seems to adore Satou and always values their relationship. It‚Äôs the sort of child behavior you‚Äôd expect from this show.The more I watched Happy Sugar Life, the more I realized how this show depicts human behavior in some of the worst ways possible. Characters such as Taiyou displays borderline pedophile behavior towards Shio. Others such as Daichi and Satou‚Äôs aunt also demonstrate their psychological tendencies in several episodes. With the exception of Shio, only one other character came to my mind who I can say is normal. Her name would be Shouko Hida but I wouldn‚Äôt get attached to her easily. In fact, try to refrain from getting attached to most of the characters in this series because their real personalities are incredibly disturbing. Another reason is that some characters will not make it alive. I‚Äôm not going to mention it as it‚Äôs spoiler but let‚Äôs just say that death isn‚Äôt uncommon in the story.As the majority of the series adheres to psychological horror, it‚Äôs hard to really root for any single character. The characters Satou deals with are often evil as she is with some being even more twisted. However, I think some of her past can be sympathetic. Satou wasn‚Äôt born with evil intentions but events shaped her to become what she is now. The past explores her character in depth and there‚Äôs even one episode that explains how Satou ends up where she is now. Narratives in this series is incredibly important as it fishes out a character‚Äôs personality to the fullest. Satou is the primary example of this as we see a journey to understanding love in her words. There‚Äôs also a character named Asahi Koube in the show with a deep desire to reunite with Shio as a family. But unlike Satou, he doesn‚Äôt go to measures such as killing to achieve his happiness. It‚Äôs a bit sugarcoated but he is more of a hero than Satou will ever be.By the time you reach the conclusion of the first episode, I think it‚Äôll become obvious whether or not it‚Äôs worth following this anime. Are you the type that love suspenseful horror? Do you favor a story with twisted inhumane characters? Do you want to see if characters such as Satou or Shio really find love in each other in the end? If these are some of the questions in mind, then definitely give this anime a shot. Otherwise, it‚Äôs going to be a sluggish ride as every episode builds more and more into the suspense. I personally find this anime unique in the sense that it isn‚Äôt truly deceptive yet always makes me anticipate on what to expect next. The character cast wants you to hate them and they succeed without jeopardizing the plot. And to me, that‚Äôs a feat that I admire.Like the title suggests, Happy Sugar Life has a sugary and sweet coloring to its animation style. Studio Ezo‚Äôla (one that I never heard of before until this series) bought out its ideas to fullest. It‚Äôs vibrant and full of life during moments when we see happiness. Then, there are those dark eerie scenes that brings out the horror of the story. It‚Äôs often moody especially in Satou‚Äôs apartment where questionable content lies in the dark. As you should expect, this show contains violence that includes murder. The TV version seems to have tone it down a bit as some of the graphic content is done behind the scenes rather than shown directly on screen. Satou is the main culprit of this but there are some other characters that commit sinful deeds. Oh and be prepared for some uncomfortable scenes from the main cast. Taiyou is a guy that I deeply regret watching for his pedophilic tendencies. Good God, erase him from the show. Other character expressions in the series are disturbing to watch such as with Satou‚Äôs red predatory eyes or her aunt‚Äôs mentally unstable behavior. The light in the dark tunnel is Shio as she brings in sugar, spice, and everything nice.If you want psychology in this series, you need the characters to be convincing. Thanks to the modern talent of Kana Hanazawa, that is achieved. She‚Äôs known for a variety of heroine roles and to play a yandere in this series truly bought out her talent to full. Misaki Kuno is also able to step into the shoes of a child to portray her character‚Äôs innocence. The theme songs contain an upbeat mood that contrasts with the tone of the show. It‚Äôs very playful and bubbly while the ED theme contains a more melodramatic feeling.Happy Sugar Life tells the tale of love that isn‚Äôt the typical romantic story you‚Äôre familiar with. Instead, it crafts psychological horror with a cast of degenerate characters. There are some that you‚Äôll find to be abominations of our society. Yet, this series is far from an abomination. It‚Äôs a psychological horror done right with a clear set of intentions at its heart and soul. of psychological horror, suspense, and thriller, Happy Sugar Life looked deceptive at first glance. Now I admit, I‚Äôm a bit of a sucker when it comes to shows where we have an anti-hero protagonist. I mean, the first episode speak for itself once you realize Matsuzaka Satou‚Äôs personality. She is essentially living a double life ‚Äì one that is of a normal girl and other being overly obsessive of Shio Kobe. This devotion to Shio is so strong that she is willing to kill others to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù her from harm. In Satou's mind, being with Shio equates to happiness.Despite the complex nature of the plot, the setup of the story is actually very simple. We got Satou who pretty much takes Shio as a partner and isolates her in a place where she feels is safe. It‚Äôs an apartment that looks normal on the inside and outside until you realize there may be something much darker going on behind the scenes. The first few episodes is rather cryptic about Satou‚Äôs actions including parts where she takes questionable content in and out of the house. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs definitely character chemistry going on between Satou and Shio. The duo shares an innocent love chemistry and ritual-like marriage ceremonies on a frequent basis. On most parts, the show seems fluffy during those segments while masking the suspenseful thriller storytelling. Throughout the series, we discover just how far from normal Satou actually is. The show also makes it clear that she will go to any length to protect Shio even if it means murder. Anyone who is familiar with the term ‚Äòyandere‚Äô will easily dedicate her character as such.

""You\'re less stable than the other girls. I\'m an adult. I\'m sure I can help you."" This is a literal line a character has delivered in this series. Not only does composition repeatedly get dumped in our faces, it has to be in the most awkward ways imaginable.Happy Sugar Life is anime about a girl named Satou. She had...a past of banging random fuckboys and until she stumbled upon a rare wild loli. She caught it and now she oughta protecc it and attacc random badly written losers from capturing it, but most of all, she doesn\'t give a fucc about everyone else.

Each character is constantly forced to state their true nature in the most cringe-worthy ways possible. Now I know anime shouldn\'t be viewed as film, but this anime just buries the \'Show not Tell\' rules in ten meters of diarrhea. One of the characters (NO SPOILERS) is a borderline pedophile, but instead of revealing his nature by his actions they have him immediately drool over the loli\'s picture without any buildup. Although his way of handling is eventually shown, it gets completely destroyed with crank ass straightforward monologue that makes everything feel cheesy and overexaggerated.This is something you\'d see frequently in a Thomas the Tank Engine episode since the mono- and dialogue is that bleak. If you play around with ADULT themes like these, write this series in a way ADULTS can enjoy (and no, I\'m not talking about you angsty teenagers).What did I miss..? Oh yeah, the main female character is a joke. We get it, she is a strong deranged woman who don\'t need no men. No need to make her constantly repeat that. I can\'t believe they wasted such a good voice actress like Kana Hanazawa for this bullshit.The teacher is a plain imbecile; how does that impulsive moron still have a job and isn\'t locked up somewhere. I guess the loli is the only character that isn\'t so hyperbolically written. Well maybe because it is a child, but I can give the writers some props for her.But then again, every character is written like an incongruous child.Misc - Art: 6 | Sound: 5Animation-wise, it\'s plenty for whatever this series requires. The art and character design, namely the combination of grey tones and vibrancy, decently manage to convey the offsetting atmosphere this series is trying to portray -- nothing wrong with those. Its opening animations and song are probably the best assets this series has to offer. Apart from the opening song, the OST is pretty mediocre.Enjoyment: 5Aside from the bruises on my forehead I constantly get from slapping it, this series is somewhat enjoyable. It still has you questioning yourself what the fuck will happen next with these poorly written chunks of clay characters my 7-year-old cousin could replicate (figuratively speaking).(tl;dr)Overall Final Score: 3The audiovisual aspects maybe great, but the context of its plot just pisses me the fuck off. I firmly believe that this series just presents character tropes instead of actual characters. The writers misrepresent real mental disorders to make this show seem as edgy as possible.

BUT you have to like these kinds of stories if you don\'t just pass it. Because I only have seen the first episodes, so let\'s see if the story stays interesting.The art is a mixture of bright colors with a gloomy shadow over it. That creates an atmosphere of unforeseeable darkness, which is only broken up in a few moments of ""Happiness"".The sound fits most of the...time, but there are moments where there should have been any BGM or better BGM.Well coming to the characters, you currently only have to remember the two mains, the rest is at the moment not really interesting, but they all are pretty much corrupted in their behavior and doing.I personally am enjoying ""Happy Sugar Life"" very much, because like I mentioned before I like these kinds of stories and what happens next is unpredictable, because it can be almost everything.Overall ""Happy Sugar Life"" is not happy, it is more horrifying and disturbing, so it leaves you with the feeling of ""what has just happened and why?"". But it is addicting and you want to see more of it until there is a moment, which will maybe satisfy you. time, but there are moments where there should have been any BGM or better BGM.Well coming to the characters, you currently only have to remember the two mains, the rest is at the moment not really interesting, but they all are pretty much corrupted in their behavior and doing.I personally am enjoying ""Happy Sugar Life"" very much, because like I mentioned before I like these kinds of stories and what happens next is unpredictable, because it can be almost everything.Overall ""Happy Sugar Life"" is not happy, it is more horrifying and disturbing, so it leaves you with the feeling of ""what has just happened and why?"".

Don\'t listen to all the "" This Anime is for edgy 12 year olds"" etc... spam. They are obviously the immature ones (with awful taste I might add...). This Anime is a perfect blend of Mystery/Suspense/Horror with warm cute shoujo.

Like this anime will touch your soul and put a lot of dark stuff inside. I have no idea why all previous reviews gave so low scores. It is like people watching ""Chernobyl"" (a series for the largest tragedy in atomic energy known to man) and expect it to be fun? It is not fun, neither is this anime, but gosh it is so GOOD!Art & Music: 9Story & Characters: 10The first thing I must point is the professionalism this anime is implemented....The topics it focuses on are not only domestic violence, murder, but also pedophilia, sexual harassment, kidnapping, etc. Using my experience in anime, I would say there is plenty of points where unnecessary sexualism (i.e. fanservice) could be inserted, completely destroying the seriousness of the topics, but luckily the staff members did not do that. (I did not read the manga, though so no idea if it is told with the same seriousness as anime).The second thing to point is that while it is SERIOUSLY DISTURBING, the scenes of violence and sexual harassment are conveniently moved as a side point. This disturbing events in this anime are told in a way that the viewer should understand what\'s happening without everything being explicitly graphic.And now to the story and characters. No character in this anime is normal. And by not being normal, do not expect someone that just stands out. For example, the main protagonist Satou (female) is in love with a little girl, and ready to (and actually do it) kill in order to protect their love. Her craziness is in counter-position of her love for Shio. But where does craziness comes from. From the first episode we can see how one of the main characters develops fear of older woman which causes his pedophilia, due to being victim of rape by his female manager. And here is where this anime present this as disturbing and not enjoyable. Even for a male, a rape by older woman can really break your mind and soul. The craziness is not something your are born with (not always at least), but something that you can get from other crazy people.And so we have a story which involves a series of victims domestic abuse, violence, sexual harassment, child abandoning, etc. Each of this twists the mind of the characters pushing them to do stuff, we (the normal people) find SERIOUSLY DISTURBING. But this is where the story becomes beautiful. All this crazy people search for is LOVE - the innocent love they were denied from their parents who beat them or the innocent love that is torn away by a slutty woman. And the desire for love can have CONSEQUENCES, a dark and disturbing consequences. While you watch how the events unfolds, if you have any heart, you cannot help but vouch for Satou and Shio to discover happiness away from all other victims.As you go through this 12 episodes introduction of the dark world of people with unhappy families and how they individually discover happiness, one of the best and most beautiful thing you can see is the ending. You know this story would not have happy ending, but at least it would be beautiful, and yet you feel this bitter taste in your mouth. It shows what happy sugar life Satou and Shio would have if the events did not end tragically. At this point, for the first time I shed tears for serial killer female pedophile.So how can you enjoy such an anime? Well, it depends whether you are a normal person, or you are under the influence of some seriously disturbing event in your past. In case you are a normal person experience some love issues, this anime could be a wake up call telling you  ""you know nothing about love issues"". If you are not normal... (sorry)... I hope this anime gives you a glimpse of hope and happiness.In conclusion, watching this reminds you that bad things can happen in the world. And for some, the bad things happen in their own homes. This anime reminds us for all those taboo subjects we are aware of, but we do not speak about.P.S. The OP really cuts it for this anime. While it is nothing special, it completely resonate with the anime. The song is super cute, until suddenly become just a mumble-jumble of world in a voice that reflects the craziness perfectly. Then it returns being a cute song again.

Many reviews look at it at face value, when it should be analyzed for what its trying to say.Nearly all the characters in the story are phycologicly scarred and 'twisted', which turns some people off, most of them are not seen after their introduction and are presented in a morally open way. Such characters are shown to have a multitude of faces, and their role in the narrative primarily comes down to the idea that more people than you know have had a painful past and that more people have morally...inappropriate hobbies than it would seem at first glance. The characters presented, in the end, serve as a reflection of societies hypocrisy (as the show says itself multiple times).While many classify Shio Kobe as a 'loli' she is in the story just a child; there are no sexual urges or relations to her in the story. It might be perceived that Mitsuboshi has some, but its not made evident as what is said is that he wants Shio to 'purify' him (after getting sexually abused by an older woman) and thus just wishes to regain his innocence (just in a overzealous perverse fashion), and by experiencing her innocence regain his.As hinted at the show makes no moral claims on the characters or actions and presents them in an open, if not inviting, way. This presentation leaves more room for analysis on the shows primary thesis : what is love; and how these actions reflect love.Analysis aside the juxtaposition used from one scene to another is done fantastically and scene transitions are creative and add to the work and animation. The art and animation completely convey emotions and tone intended for each scene with everything feeling well thought out. The character drawings do feel outdated by modern standards, but isnt overly evident with the animation and color usage.I would not classify this in the horror genre like others have but more in suspense, slice of life, thriller, romance. inappropriate hobbies than it would seem at first glance.

It was hard to find a story that offers a unique perspective about life or about anything at all, just a horde of formulaic entertainment that\'s ""good enough"" to keep you... entertained. And ""good enough"" was just not good enough for me. I wanted exceptional.Welcome to exceptional.Plot: 9Happy Sugar Life is an anti-romance story that really digs its nails deep into the more taboo meanings of love and what it means to different individuals. The premise would turn...off most people satisfied with a ""normal"" story: ""A high school girl, Satou Matsuzaka, has fallen in love with a young girl named Shio Koube. She struggles to overcome numerous obstacles that threaten to take that love away."" Psychotic yanderes with a twisted form of love is nothing new, but what Happy Sugar Life does differently is by really sticking with its main theme of unconventional love and explore how this (usually) superficial thing called ""love"" can truly mean a lot of different things to everybody.To explain what I mean, the forms of love explored in this anime are as follows:1. Love for a small child2. Love for young boys3. Parental love4. Brotherly love5. Masochism6. Self-loveSatou isn\'t the only psycho in this anime as there are so many other individuals here with their own pursuit of love. And while some of these are forms of lust as opposed to the so-called ""true love"", people in real life often confuse the two anyway so why shouldn\'t anime characters? However, while the series spends a sufficient amount of time explore individual characters, the main focus here is still Satou and her journey to discover what it truly means to love another person. And therefore, it\'s a good time to talk about...Characters: 9Satou starts out before the story with her heart feeling empty. It wasn\'t \'till she discovers Shio through a chance encounter that she felt meaning in her life as she began devoting herself to ensuring Shio\'s safety and happiness in their little castle of glass (a cosy little apartment). As she works hard for the sake of her newfound love, Satou comes across different individuals trying to push their own ideals of love onto her in various ways, intruding in her happy sugar life with Shio. But surprisingly enough, there\'s really not much in the way of violence in how Satou deals with her problems (in most of the episodes anyway). Unlike a true yandere like Yuno from Mirai Nikki, Satou is a far more calm and collected girl who comes up with more civilized forms of strategies to remove people from her life. She also properly reflects on her own ideals and even questions whether if her ""love"" is the right kind. So altogether, not that unrealistic of a character to be fair.But what ultimately keeps the show going is the other characters that also had their perspectives shown to us, along with why they felt like their form of love is justified. Usually, in an anime with a shocking premise like this, it can all too often go downhill in pacing after the first shock-factor episode (Promised Neverland), but Happy Sugar Life keeps the audience engaged using a ""psycho of the week"" formula, allowing you to journey with Satou together in exploring love and all its meaning.And in case you feel that these ""lovers"" are way too weird for your taste, there\'s even a normal girl in the mix here. Satou\'s best friend at work, Shouko, is the straight man in all this craziness, trying to do her best to be the best kind of friend Satou could have. She\'s loyal, compassionate, and not insane, so it helps to balance out the story and also helps the audience to connect with an anchor of normality. She\'s one of my favourite characters in the story, and possibly also the most tragic one by the end.In spite of being a clean squeaky clean girl, Shouko and a number of other characters are written realistically flawed instead of being an ideal stereotype. Morally right or wrong, there is always ambiguity in their personal ideals to be found, thus further fleshing them out into very interesting individuals. Even Satou, whom I was close to hating after she crossed a line in a later episode, I found myself understanding her and Shio\'s perspective, along with why they are so firmly rooted in their beliefs (abnormal or not) and fighting so hard for them, no matter what it takes.Enjoyment: 8I\'d be lying if I didn\'t admit that even an anime like this has gotten me bored at a few points in the story when it came close to being reduced to yet another conventional thriller. Thankfully, the anime manages to throw new and unexpected surprises that not only serve to shock (which would be shallow on its own), but also add new layers to the characters and subverting your expectations about them. For the parts of the story that try to show what a sweet life Satou and Shio have made for each other, I encourage you to be patient and experience those moments as you would experience a joyous moment with your loved one; those do pay off by the end and resonate the kind of strong and deep bond Satou and Shio share with each other.At the end of the day, go into this anime with an open mind and forget about your sense of normality for 12 episodes. Then come tell me what you think of Satou and Shio\'s perspectives and whether if you feel those two lost souls are justified! I would love to hear from you.Edit:I noticed a lot of errors in this review, and after seeing the support the community has given through the 60+ ""Helpful"" feedback, I\'ve decided to rewrite this piece for better clarity.

Thanks for the support!', 'So where to start?Happy Sugar Life (HSL) fails as a psychological horror.That is fine.Don\'t go in thinking this is going to be a psychological horror, instead look at this more as a mystery drama.It\'s not a standard ""Problem = Mystery"" style mystery, but instead it\'s got that sort of Another style mystery where you have a problem, but then the interest is figuring out who the characters are, what\'s happened leading up to here, etc.It\'s a drama because everything is a drama. Drama is that blanket term for ""things happen, they\'re not neccesarily fighting, they\'re not always romance, they\'re not always [Blank], but they are...sometimes"".This Anime is about our main protagonist Satou, and our macguffin/second-protagonist Shio. By some means our MP has found Shio and is currently living with her despite the fact that she is an actively sought-after missing person. Satou\'s main drive then obviously is keeping her as a missing person while they have a romantic relationship.Yes, The lesbian pedophile has a girl locked in her appartment, but the girl doesn\'t seem to mind.That\'s literally as much plot as I can go into without spoiling this, so let\'s talk actual meat and potatoes.This is a modern-day japan with normal life, but populated entirely by morally wrong people. Everyone\'s hiding something, everyone\'s an asshole. Our macguffin, in one way or another, seems to bring these assholes together and, as they do, they end up having confrontations. All the while you\'re going to be fed crumbs of information into the actual story, either through flashback, literal digging, or just someone\'s psychotic episode that leads to them no longer repressing some memories.All these crumbs of plot start filling in the blanks for the mystery, but then just add more questions ontop of that and bring in more morally questionable situations for you to judge. All up until a breaking point where the current story kicks into high-gear and the mystery is essentially finished so you can wrap up the series and characters that you\'ve spent the past episodes learning about and either loving or hating all with the final drama.Yeah, I\'m vague. That review is boring. Just watch this anime, as much shit as it sounds like I\'ve given it, it\'s amazing. You\'re going into an anime where the writers dive into a psychopathic main protagonist and I know how much we all love those when they\'re not written as high-school vampire scene girls. You\'re not force-fed psychology 101, you\'re not shown a murder then beaten over the head with how wrong it is. You\'re just shown a bunch of relatable human characters who\'re pushed past relatable at times because you don\'t want to relate to their fucked psychology.And just ignore these dudes who watched 3 episodes and started screaming ""IT\'S EDGY, WHY IS THERE A LOLI, THIS IS GROSS, I\'M OFFENDED"" because they wanted to voice their opinions on an unfinished anime they decided to immediately wall themselves away from. Watch it and make your own call. It\'s not like we don\'t all sit around for 6-12 hours straight binging whole anime series on the weekends anyways. sometimes"".This Anime is about our main protagonist Satou, and our macguffin/second-protagonist Shio.

It contains layers of dark stories and disturbing action done mostly everyone. If you\'re into things being out of the normal range of human behaviour, this is the anime for you. Bonus points if you like yuri or lolis.What I found this anime being fun is mostly from the protagonists\' ability to do evil things. A cute girl who has a dark side waiting to be discovered by the viewer; all to protect her loved one with anything, but...with responsibility and sanity of her own to try to avoid trouble. It builds up with her punishing ""terrible"" people one after another, even if they used to be friends or coworkers she\'s met with her ""normal"" daily life outside, and dropping it with even darker and darker actions as the anime goes on. I seem to be obsessed with the idea that things get twisted just for maintaining the protagonist\'s relationship.10/10 because most parts of it are fun, interesting, and gratifying to watch. The music fits the story and the art style is sweet to the eye. Most importantly, they work together to make the atmosphere fit the storytelling beautifully. with responsibility and sanity of her own to try to avoid trouble.

But once you get to episode 5 and you start learning about Shio, you learn all those layers they built into this child and how she\'s more than just an innocent and caring child.Satou has a lot to her as well, not being a teen who kidnapped a child cause they love them sexually, but a true love for this girl who brought her happiness when she never received any...to begin with; but I do wish they would delve into more of both her past with her aunt and her love for Shio.The supporting characters are very interesting as well, from Hida and Taiyo to Sumire and even Shio\'s mother; but they do need more of a backstory, so maybe some OVAs for the characters will do some justice.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch horror but want minimal amounts of blood and murder since this is more on the mental and emotional aspect rather than gore. This is obviously not for those who aren\'t able to fully understand the true story behind this anime and explore the many layers past a teen and child romance.Even though the ending was very conclusive and overall perfect, I wouldn\'t mind a second season; maybe with different characters in this similar dilemma, like maybe men where the younger of the two murders to protect his lover.I overall highly praise this anime and recommend this to newcomers looking for a ""little blood as possible"" horror anime. to begin with; but I do wish they would delve into more of both her past with her aunt and her love for Shio.The supporting characters are very interesting as well, from Hida and Taiyo to Sumire and even Shio\'s mother; but they do need more of a backstory, so maybe some OVAs for the characters will do some justice.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch horror but want minimal amounts of blood and murder since this is more on the mental and emotional aspect rather than gore.

I will try to avoid spoilers as much as I can.STORY: OutstandingOf all animes I watched, this one must have one of the more unique plots I have seen. I would go as far as saying this is a ""high art anime"".The first chapters introduce Satou\'s life, a hardworking girl who is in ""love"". Her koibito is Shio, a kid that she apparently kidnapped and locked in her apartment. That\'s all I will say about the plot, read the synopsis if you want...more info.This show is a roller coaster, with lots of thrillers, twists, lies, and a some horror scenes. I think Ezœåla (HSL is the first anime of the studio) did a very good job pacing and keeping consistency, I have only found very small plot holes at the end. It mixes very well unrealistic actions with very realistic behaviors (confusing huh? I never experienced this before). In some instances the most ""normal"" guy will look the weirdest. I also liked how they treated stuff like domestic violence, work harassment and male rape.ART: OutstandingTypical art style that you would find in a slice of life show, round faces, big round eyes, lots of blur, etc. I think this makes a horror show ""darker"". Overall I think this show\'s color palettes are very well chosen and beautiful. The cute and happy scenes looked very vibrant and heartwarming, where the creepy scenes were dark with glowing yandere eyes. I also love the faces in this anime, in fact I have a folder with 35 screencaps of face expressions (this is the first time I screenshot while watching anime).SOUND: GreatLoved OP and ED. Also random Bleach OST. HanaKana, Kikuko Inoue.CHARACTER: OutstandingI will just say that I missed shows with good character development. This show does it greatly. Every character feels alive, has its own issues, pasts, and evolution through the series.Loved MC\'s personality, I usually don\'t watch yandere shows, but her character felt very credible (? can\'t find the exact word). She keeps thinking rationally most of the time, and has real affection for his close friends (sadly they don\'t). She also doesn\'t go berserk randomly (killing is her very last option). Much more enjoyable than, for instance, Yuno.I ended up writing a lot, ups. Overall this was a very refreshing show (I was tired of cliches and forced plots). Binge watched it in one sit, while usually I don\'t watch anime this way.The ending was perfect, I would have liked another one (crowbar should have fallen, stapid ring), but it\'s the most appropriate for the show.Nearly perfect score for me, 9-10. I wouldn\'t recommend this to ""everyone"", I\'m sure most people would hate Happy Sugar Life and feel uncomfortable watching it (violence, harassment, rape, murder, kidnapping, lolicons, etc.). And that\'s fine, this show is very special (hence the ""high art anime""). more info.This show is a roller coaster, with lots of thrillers, twists, lies, and a some horror scenes.

I also liked how they treated stuff like domestic violence, work harassment and male rape.ART: OutstandingTypical art style that you would find in a slice of life show, round faces, big round eyes, lots of blur, etc. I think this makes a horror show ""darker"". Overall I think this show\'s color palettes are very well chosen and beautiful. The cute and happy scenes looked very vibrant and heartwarming, where the creepy scenes were dark with glowing yandere eyes. I also love the faces in this anime, in fact I have a folder with 35 screencaps of face expressions (this is the first time I screenshot while watching anime).SOUND: GreatLoved OP and ED. Also random Bleach OST. HanaKana, Kikuko Inoue.CHARACTER: OutstandingI will just say that I missed shows with good character development. This show does it greatly. Every character feels alive, has its own issues, pasts, and evolution through the series.Loved MC\'s personality, I usually don\'t watch yandere shows, but her character felt very credible (? can\'t find the exact word). She keeps thinking rationally most of the time, and has real affection for his close friends (sadly they don\'t). She also doesn\'t go berserk randomly (killing is her very last option). Much more enjoyable than, for instance, Yuno.I ended up writing a lot, ups. Overall this was a very refreshing show (I was tired of cliches and forced plots). Binge watched it in one sit, while usually I don\'t watch anime this way.The ending was perfect, I would have liked another one (crowbar should have fallen, stapid ring), but it\'s the most appropriate for the show.Nearly perfect score for me, 9-10. I wouldn\'t recommend this to ""everyone"", I\'m sure most people would hate Happy Sugar Life and feel uncomfortable watching it (violence, harassment, rape, murder, kidnapping, lolicons, etc.). And that\'s fine, this show is very special (hence the ""high art anime"").', 'Happy Sugar Life is a psychological horror starring Satou Matsuzaka as our main heroine. It is revealed early in the first episode that she lives with Shio Koube, who Satou considers to be her ""special someone"". Satou did horrible things to live with Shio, and as you might have read already on MAL\'s synopsis, Satou will do everything in her capabilities to protect her life with Shio, her Happy Sugar Life. Of course, Satou and Shio are not the only characters here. This anime is one to watch if you want to see a lot of psychologically scarred characters.A theme going on in the anime...is about \'love\' and the characters\' different \'love\'. The story is centered on Satou and Shio\'s relationship with what Satou believes is pure love. The atmosphere usually changes back and forth between Satou\'s sugar life and all the bitterness of the outside world. Scenes showing the sugar part of Satou\'s life will mostly be when she is alongside Shio. The bitterness is from characters that threaten Satou\'s status quo. Satou prefers to not interact with anyone else, but that is not possible. She has to work to support her life, keeping facades in school and her workplace. This leads to her feeling bitter when other characters are intrusive with their \'love\'. Examples of this are when Satou started getting trouble from the likes of her manager and her teacher early in the show.Happy Sugar Life handles their characters very well. Most of the important characters are introduced early in the show, leaving time to explore them and for character development. There are only a few characters who feels like \'disposable characters\'. Most characters are also screwed up in the head, almost everyone has some trauma or psychological disorder. This leads to interesting interactions between the characters, or rather psychos. With each characters comes different interactions, with Satou taking different approaches to keep them away from her relationship with Shio. Furthermore, every character does get their own bit of spotlight, showing their motives, their past, or how they got traumatized.The story relies heavily on mystery and suspense. Feelings of unease can be felt during the calmer parts of the show. Satou\'s expressions are not always clear, leaving you wondering on what she might do. You are left not knowing most of the truth, and it keeps making you curious about what will happen next. When you thought you know what was going on, the anime revealed a different answer, and you are back in the mystery. Even during the \'sugar\' scenes, just not knowing what is brewing without you knowing is enough to keep the suspense going. The music (or lack of) supports the atmosphere really well. All that said, some situations are so weird and absurd, you might feel disgust or get a chuckle out of it.Overall, Happy Sugar Life is an anime filled with mentally scarred characters, with Satou and Shio in the middle bringing these characters inevitably bumping with each other. Happy Sugar Life uses its characters well without freely disposing them. It also does a good job delivering suspense. Scenes switch around \'sugar\' and \'bitter\' parts, with the suspense still intact. On the bad side, at times, it feels like the anime is just dragging out the mystery, and the situations might seem too unrealistic. is about \'love\' and the characters\' different \'love\'.

I mean this in both literary and quality terms. Despite how interestingly and enticingly crafted this tragic tale is, and how effectively some of its presentation is, this show has one fatal flaw: overemphasis. One wouldn‚Äôt think that this is so catastrophic, but Happy Sugar Life proves why ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù is a thing.There are two forms of this devastating lingering. The first one is the monologuing. This is what damages Satou as a character and drags this anime down and out beyond belief. Her personality is interesting, almost as if you put a mary sue and a yandere...in a blender and watched them eat away at each other in the process of having an overprotective pedo lesbian try to keep her image and ideal life intact. It‚Äôs hard to care when the majority of her screen time is spent in her headspace, as she monologues about damn near everything. Regardless of what anyone thinks of this tragic hero on a moral level, it‚Äôs easy to see how this can feel grating and unnecessary. These scenes of her expositing her thoughts on any given situation can go on for minutes on end when almost every single time, her expressions alone are enough to tell us next to, if not everything she is thinking and feeling.Shrinking it all down to a sentence or two maximum to clarify something or truly encapsulate a scene for her, and letting the visuals do the rest would have been far more rewarding. It would have truly taken advantage of the imaginatively disturbing directing and presentation, both making Satou a far more interesting lead to follow, and making several scenes to be far more impactful and dramatic. It would have also kept a myriad of scenes from dragging out to more than double the length they needed to convey everything properly. Keep in mind that this applies to several scenes from several characters later on as well. You could cut down entire episodes worth of monologuing and probably improved the pacing dramatically, both in terms of an episode structure and scene-by-scene basis. The worst part of all is that the show understands this to an extent, with some of the most critical and stylistic scenes in the latter half of the show truly showcasing how powerful this approach can be.The second devastating, drawn-out form of overemphasis is a more gratuitous, self-indulgent kind. It‚Äôs what destroys practically everyone else in this show. It‚Äôs no secret that the vast majority of the characters in this show are damaged, mostly reprehensible people. You can show that off while keeping the audience engaged and disturbed in a proper way. This show takes the worst approach possible with this. Whenever a character is established doing something fucked up, we linger on them licking something, drooling, and/or panting after sniffing something for extended periods of time or interacting with their target in some way. At that point, it‚Äôs more tiresome than creepy, and more aggravating than repulsive. It‚Äôs even worse when the show constantly reminds you of this with small moments and scenes that add nothing and could be cut out entirely. It‚Äôs bad enough that the progression of certain characters‚Äô descent into pedophilic or stalker-like madness is utterly nonsensical, but when that becomes their defining trait, and when the show just lingers on about it, it becomes a nightmare to sit through for the worst reasons imaginable.To really paint a picture of how bad this can get, a male police officer is sexually assaulted for minutes on end, with several characters watching, and it takes his partner so long to intervene. On top of that, all they do is leave, rather than arrest the perpetrator or do anything for committing a crime of sexual assault on an on-duty police officer. It‚Äôs beyond wild how bad the gaps in logic are, and how much this show just wants to linger on the more disturbing elements for its own self-indulgent, narrative and character-damaging purposes. I‚Äôm not sure if any of this was the fault of the material, the director/screenwriter, or both.It‚Äôs a pity, really. Outside of all of this, there‚Äôs an interesting, enticing tragedy at play, with some truly potent moments, both sweet and sour. The reveals are paced out well and tend to be brutal. The core narrative is theoretically engaging without too many glaring issues in terms of logic or consistency. On the audiovisual side, the visuals by newcomer studio Ezœåla can be incredibly imaginative, even if their background and CGI endeavors are sometimes distracting and needless. The disconcerting feel the directing and imagery go for is a sight to behold. The music is generally good at bolstering emotional scenes with their own melancholic and beautiful tunes. The ED theme -""SWEET HURT"" by ReoNa- deserves special mention in that regard. If the show just showed more restraint and used its artistic flair to more consistently tell its story properly, I genuinely believe this would have been one of the better shows I‚Äôve seen all year. Alas, the sweet that interested me was a tad too bitter. in a blender and watched them eat away at each other in the process of having an overprotective pedo lesbian try to keep her image and ideal life intact.

Alas, the sweet that interested me was a tad too bitter.', 'Happy Sugar Life flirts with two core audiences that it fails to deliver to.The first audience is those looking for a dark, mature story about irredeemably flawed characters being punished for their sins. Happy Sugar Life sets itself up as though it may be that kind of story, but it doesn\'t have the teeth to commit, nor does it actually condemn the main characters.The second audience is those looking for a cute, twisted romance between a yandere lolicon and the object of her affection. Happy Sugar Life doesn\'t seem at first, to court this audience genuinely, but if you keep watching, you\'ll probably come to...the same conclusion as I have: This is the true core of the story, but it fails in execution.Happy Sugar Life is a really, really poorly told love story. It is the story of Satou, a high-schooler in search of the meaning of love, and Shio, the little girl who teaches it to her. It\'s the story of two girls, victims of their own unique abuse, with deeply concerning ideas of what a relationship is. And, despite their traumas and their complexes and their immaturity, their relationship IS somehow perfect. There is no apparent condemnation of their age gap, and the major structure and climactic dialogue all compound the message at the core of their relationship: Their love is the only thing in their lives that matters. Without it, they are empty people, and no amount of connecting with other people or going to therapy can fix them. The only hope they have is each other.The love story between Satou and Shio, (which, I stress, is what the writing clearly treats as Important and Good) is interrupted, strained, and broken up by poorly-realized adult themes and juvenile edge-for-the-sake-of-edge. Child predators, rapists, and stalkers roam every corner of Satou\'s city, for the express purpose of interrupting her life with Shio, and providing ""fair game"" for her manipulative and murderous tendencies. But, and this bears repeating, the story is not really ABOUT these darker things. They are simply plastered on top of the obvious focal point - the romance - for the sake of introducing conflict and appearing mature and morally complex.The views of human nature expressed by Happy Sugar Life are bleak and immature, as is the eventual ending. The writers believe that people can be broken, and not fixed, and simultaneously that there are no emotions worth living for besides full-hearted devotion to your love. There are no characters with pure intentions except for Shio, and, if you take the side that the writers take, Satou as well.(PLOT SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH)You see, the major, important twist of the story is, ultimately, that Satou is ""innocent."" Not that she never does terrible things, but that all of these things are, ultimately, justified. They are all self-defense, for the sake of protecting Shio, or done to people who ""deserve"" it by the metrics applied by the writers. Satou is not a serial killer, nor is she a kidnapper. She is a child, backed into a corner, who does what she has to for the sake of the one thing in the world that is considered Good and Pure. The ultimate climax, and the unwinding of the plot, hinges on Satou being driven to finally kill someone who doesn\'t ""deserve"" it like the others do.=====TL;DR:Before you decide to watch Happy Sugar Life, ask yourself why:- If you want a mature story about Bad People receiving their Divine Punishment, you should find another anime.- If you want a twisted love story about a yandere lolicon being driven to her limit, stop watching after episode 11. It makes a much better ending, and you can fill in the gaps however you wish. Episode 12 will only ruin what little Happy Sugar Life has going for it.In the end, Happy Sugar Life is a deeply flawed and poorly executed idea, with no courage to stand by its morals and an immature desire to play at ""tragedy"" without meaning. the same conclusion as I have: This is the true core of the story, but it fails in execution.Happy Sugar Life is a really, really poorly told love story.

The title of the show is very misleading (just like Asobi Asobase, only more darker and sinister), but it creates a good context for all of the characters who are broken and/or blind-sided in many ways:Matsuzaka Satou, the pink-haired Yandere, voiced by the goddess Hana Kanazawa (and damn does she ever do a great job defining Satou\'s character). Spoilt out of love in her own family, which consists of her brain-washed of a wreck aunt, Satou has been mislead growing up, and asking about the concoction of love, to which her aunt shows her that love is everything of pleasure and desires, if she so wishes. And to that, her own experience of messing around and sleeping with boys serve as the catalyst of ""Do I really want to keep this love?"", and to that, her own heart is like a sweet, sweet jar, the happiness-filled jar that was once full is shattered into pieces, and in order to retain her love, she\'ll stop at nothing to make sure that she sees this towards the end.The Koube family, of Shio and Asahi. Ah...the family conflict, someone gets drunk and accuses the significant other of upbringing the children in a bad way. Both characters have suffered under the demise of their wrecking ball of a father, so much so that the only link holding them both is their mum, to which her sanity could not be contained further, and Shio was kicked out of the house, abandoned by her mum. It was then and there that Satou found her and their Happy Sugar Life starts from there, maintaining the love jar and filling with sweet memories, while na√Øve that Satou didn\'t kidnap nor harm her in the process, and strives to protect Satou in her weakest. The brother however, is kinda of a bad brother, as both him and Shio part ways to help their mum survive, and now he\'s back to take her home, with the realism that Satou ""kidnapped"" her for her own pleasure. A hidden character always that doesn\'t stand out, he is left to fend for himself.Satou\'s workmate and close friend, Taiyou Mitsuboshi the pedophile and Shouko Hida, the friend who promises of kept secrets and wants the best for everyone. For Taiyou himself, I don\'t really need to explain his character because it is what it is: his madly-deeply driven forbidden love for children that he\'s pretty much a psychopath and a lunatic at that, often taken advantage of in precarious situations. Shouko on the other hand, is pretty much a barebones character who often plays the best-close friend troupe, always concerning for others and helping them in need. If you haven\'t been paying close attention much, she is the ONLY sane character out of everyone, until her demise in Satou\'s vicious hands calls out her presence to save those still in the trap of trauma.Don\'t think for a millisecond that you\'re watching this show just to shit trash on it, its characters will turn you upside down to the point of misconception and stunning acting.Newcomer studio Ezo\'la\'s art and animation really was off-putting to say the least, but for the balance between the real world and the various horror scenes that enclosed the vibes from the manga, it was a pretty good adaptation overall. For once, there were a lot of things going for it, such as the art degradation towards the comic feel (such as the static screens of horror) and the psychological aspect which plays a big part into making this series feel like reality that hits us in the face when we least expected it. The unique feel for the new studio just blew my mind at how the staff directorials punch in what is arguably the best part of the show: the unsteady visuals.The music is also another area that best explicits the foreshadowing of the series to come. Many scenes with the horror vibes are actually used at the correct moments of storytelling in time, and not just for show. Just like Asobi Asobase (yet again, musically), the OST was a definite surprise for me as both the OP and ED nailed at whatever exposition the series storyline has going for it. Not to mention that the ED presents ReoNa\'s debut single, and its heart-warming tonality makes it the perfect ending IMO (and one of the best EDs of the season).Happy Sugar Life, we knew ye, we kinda understand ye. Horror is very subjective, that pertains to your own tastes of how you see it. As for personal takeaway, the real world complications exemplify the need for all of us to have the sense of the ""Happy Sugar Life"" jar in our hearts, even when bogged down by trauma. It\'s the same with trying to understand someone\'s life and what they have went through that culminates the core hypocrisy of all men, and this series did that for me.So unless you have an affinity of finding out what your Happy Sugar Life is, watch this show to find out (and it\'s a recommendation too), ONLY if you\'re a sane person.

Sure it was creepy you can like that stuff, but unlike decent anime I\'ve watched that do give you chills like Higurashi, this was shock value. Pure shock value. It had no weight to it and it was incredibly boring and plain, besides the scenes where she goes scary yandere, I was SO surprised(sarcasm). You never feared that she was going to get caught, she had nothing to lose besides her precious loli that we all knew she would just end up murdering everyone for. Many of the characters were an eyesore, the art had no special qualities, it was stable...but that was all.Characters: They characters were SHIT. Ok, so the loli girl(Shio), was alright. She had what looked like a mental disorder which can explain a few of her actions and made me genuinely sad when I saw her being mistreated. And then, we have our MC. Satou. She was incredibly fucked up, which is not a bad thing in general, but all we see is an emotionless husk walking around, unless she\'s with Shio, or protecting her. I know there can be Villain Protagonists, but I at least want to see her get what she deserves every now and then. She can literally get away with EVERYTHING, because the police in this world don\'t give a shit. She has no personality, and even though it\'s supposed to be a don\'t judge a book by its cover kind of series, when she\'s happy, she\'s cardboard. When she\'s angry, she\'s copy and paste yandere girl. She never is really approached with a challenge, and when she is, she has to refrain herself from MURDERING PEOPLE as a solution. Her relationship with Shio is a love relationship, but I\'m not sure if it\'s a romantic relationship or platonic which gives me an uncomfortable thought every now and then. The fact that she could be in love with a girl who\'s acts under 10 is unsettling. Asahi is a generally good guy looking for his sister Shio, but from what I\'ve seen, is probably going to be killed for wanting her in the first place(just saying). And then literally, everyone else has some sort of edgy backstory and poorly written mental disorder as a plot device, so they will go after Shio/Satou, and Satou will have a \'justified\' reason to kill them, or look like a total badass beating them up. Satou is actually a bit likable, with her intense love for Shio, how she\'s willing to work hard day and night to provide for the both of them, that brought a smile to my face.Story: Ah, where do I begin? There are many questions that never seemed to be answered or given an excuse. This makes the writing seem lazy and boring. Even certain characters are brought up just so that they can get in Satou\'s way, for example the creepy teacher masochist who wanted to molest her, or a generally good guy who wanted to find Shio, his smaller sister. The police are never fucking useful in this world, they practically only exist when needed, and from what I\'ve heard so far, they\'re only used once. They seem to used the abused backstory card, as Satou is somehow justified of her behavior because her (Spoiler)  not gonna say their name** taught her a twisted love. Sure this explains her actions but doesnt justify them. I can\'t say Satou is even on the same page as the world she\'s in, she gets away with everything and the story doesn\'t care because it\'s supposed to send chills down your spine. I had to use the \'anime logic card\' because it was so incredibly stupid. Every time our MC is about to kill someone, it\'s just boom, there dead. We never truly cared about what was happening, because nothing made sense. The concept of kidnapping out of love isn\'t unique, and is dealt with poorly, because all Satou has to do is to place a lock on the door from the outside, and done! Our blind loli hostage can\'t escape. No I don\'t mean the girl is physically blind but just taken advantage over. The story throws happy moments out of nowhere being hooked on the creepy on the inside happy on the outside that it feels really out of character. For example, when she\'s jealous because Asahi had said vows to Shio, she\'s goes a little insane, which is acceptable. But then she just goes happy go lucky because it apparently means her love for Shio makes her jealous, and mentally thanks her for that. It didn\'t evoke any emotion out of me because the story just puts it in my lap and waits for me to go, ""Awwww, cute!"".Art: The art was ok, the opening was the best example of what was supposed to look like a simple moe theme. But for the rest of the show, the characters look half-baked besides Satou who literally looks like a carbon copy of Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki. The backgrounds seemed like any other basic anime, and Satou\'s apartment has no character in it whatsoever. Even in the place they sleep there is no desk with textbooks to describe that Satou is a student, no toys or anything to convey that Shio is a child. Their apartment has no character, and is plain and an eyesore. There is actually one overview shot of Satou sitting at a table in a room, and I can\'t even tell what room it is in because there was literally nothing else but Satou, a chair, and a table. It could have been anywhere. When Satou goes crazy however, it has a decent art effect on her eyes which in my opinion, makes her look cool, rather than scary and insane. The art also does a good job portraying their struggle for money, as Shio\'s meals look just enough to fill her hunger, and are not overly polished. Her character design also do a good job on displaying a small child and an average teenager.Sound: The sound was pretty decent. The songs were average, she being pretty bland, but the OST was actually ok. There\'s nothing remarkable but there was something.Enjoyment: I didn\'t really enjoy it from an analytical standpoint but I did enjoy it when I turn my brain off. Watching Satou nearly murdering people got me excited and seeing the two live happily day to day was heart warming. Unless I looked into it further, I always would see Satou as a cool intelligent schoolgirl who would kick ass. But as soon as I looked deeper, it all went downhill.Overall: If you don\'t care about story and character elements, jump right in, enjoy the shock value. But if you\'ve already seen some messed up creepy horror anime that had genuinely scared you, you might have second doubts, this could be just a boring anime with lame action scenes. If you can\'t turn your brain off, then just find a better show, the characters are hardly enjoyable and the story has lots of giant, gaping plot holes. but that was all.Characters: They characters were SHIT.

I felt so frustrated around the halfway mark. This show tries waay to hard to be one of those ""its not what it appears to be on the surface"" kinda material shows. At first the artwork and character designs drew me in but the amount of pandering to try to seem ""edgy"" and ""dark"" is making me want to quit. Literally every character is deranged in some way or another which makes it infuriating to watch. I\'ll end up finishing it anyway, but at this point its not for enjoyment. Hopefully some questions...get answered before its over. get answered before its over.', ""How far would you go for happiness?Happy Sugar Life is not for everyone. If you have problems watching pedophilia, sexual harassment, murder and psycho characters searching for love in their own concept, this is not for you. However, if you're tired of happy predictable stuff, and you want to feel real tension, fear, while thinking about how much love can challenge your principles and moral, I suggest you give it a try.The Story focus on Satou Matsuzaka, an empty girl who is seeking love to fulfill her soul. Although she can't find it in the boys she hang out, she finds it in an abandoned...little girl, named Shio Koube, that she keeps ilegally in her apartment. You can wrongly think she is a pedophile, but there is no sexual content between these two. It is just pure, unlabelled and reciprocal love. Satou's craziness is in counter-position of her love for Shio.Most of characters are not normal. In contrast, we have Asahi Koube, a sympathetic guy who is looking desperately for his little sister. His dream is pretty simple: to have a normal life with his mom and sister. And besides we have Shouko Hida, who loves Satou and want to be closer to her.What I most like in this work of art is the emotional conflict. We will see very cute scenes of love between Satou and Shio while feeling sorry for Asahi. Personally,  I couldn't ignore Asahi's fight for finding his sister and make his dream come true. My principles says Shio has to go with her brother. However, my heart wants Shio and Satou to be together, after seeing how much they suffered before and how much they love each other now. The fact of Shio being a child is irrelevant, since there is no sexual content. But of course, each person will have a different point of view.Plus, we'll want to know how far would Satou go to protect her happy sugar life with Shio. We don't know how much violent she can be or with whom. We only know she is a psycho who is willing to eliminate anyone who interferes in their precious love relationship. Each episode leaves a mystery, that will be explained later, and it is so unpredictable and full of tension...And so we have a story which involves a series of domestic abuse, violence, sexual harassment, child abandoning, etc. Each of these twists the mind of the characters pushing them to do stuff. But this is where it becomes beautiful. What these crazy people search for is LOVE, the innocent love they were denied from their parents who beat them or the innocent love that is taken away by a slutty abusive woman. And the desire for love can have consequences, dark and disturbing consequences.Happy sugar life is not gore. The director wisely chose to focus on what happens instead of gushing blood everywhere. It is psychological horror, afterall.This anime reminds us that bad things can happen in the world. Unfortunately, for some people, the bad things happen in their own homes.

This review will contain spoilers (obviously) but it doesn\'t matter because you shouldn\'t fucking waste your time with this. I don\'t know how many drugs the directors or producers were on when they approved of this flaming piece of shit garbage but as soon as I finished Happy Sugar Life it just... spoke volumes. First, let\'s start with the story. If you don\'t know how I feel about it already, IT\'S SHIT.They introduce us to a lovely view of an apartment complex on fire, panning to the main characters which consists of...a cute pink-haired girl, looks like she goes to high school or something, y\' know, the typical. And a goddamn, I don\'t know how to explain this while dancing around it so I\'ll say it outright, A FUCKING TODDLER. Pink haired bitch spouts some bullshit over how she doesn\'t know what love is, who cares and then this 8-year-old girl she was holding pushes her off the burning building and end of the epilogue.  Transition and you\'re thrown into presumably the past before someone commits arson and you\'re holding a child. This highschooler, Satou, being asked out by some background character. Obviously, she rejects him cause she\'s better than anyone else, obviously, she\'s the main character how could she ever be near those peasants. She‚Äôs called down by a friend and or coworker (you don‚Äôt know by that point) and she heads to work with her. Same bullshit about love comes up again, this friend asks why she rejects everyone they come in contact with and she responds with ‚Äúbecause she already have a ‚Äòlove‚Äô at home‚Äù which in your mind you‚Äôre just like ‚ÄúOh man! Hope it isn‚Äôt that toddler she was holding earlier haha! (spoilers: it is)‚Äù. Dumb work montage. Whatever. She heads home and she is just tackled by this child. At first, you gather context clues. Earlier she stated that she was living with her aunt, maybe she‚Äôs her little cousin? Which rules out completely because uh hello where‚Äôs the aunt??? Maybe, This is a very tragic story where something bad happened and that‚Äôs her child? No, couldn‚Äôt be because she would have probably mentioned it by now, right? Before you think ‚ÄúOh little sister!‚Äù, This show doesn‚Äôt waste any time in showing them kiss. Now you know what this is. Something that will definitely get you in jail. A. Goddamn. Eight. Year. Old. Kissing. A. Highschooler. They‚Äôre not related in any way. I tried denying it since I saw them kiss. It only got worse from there. What makes it worse is that they kissed. While reciting wedding vows. What the fuck. Anyway. The rest of the episode is her being treated badly by this boss of hers because she wants to work for this kid, she snaps whatever, get this guy she was working with out of this boss‚Äôs closet because she was definitely doing illegal stuff to him and apparently scares her enough to fuck off and give her money. I don‚Äôt remember very well going on top of my head so I‚Äôll just talk about what else I remember. This goes on for like 2 episodes. She goes home. Commits an actual crime by being in love with a fucking child. Goes to school. She finds out her teacher obsessed with her. Somehow scares him enough for him to do her bidding because she‚Äôs so intimidating and she‚Äôs doing this for her child lover. Shit like that. The usual. Find out she murdered someone or just multiple people? Like it was supposed to phase the viewer. Wow! I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just gonna break character and say what the fuck why do people like this anime. Why is it rated to highly. It‚Äôs so fucking bad. What the fuck. So predictable in every way. And very fucking disgusting lol. Anyway. I‚Äôve only grown tired writing this out. The same coworker Satou saved turns out to be a fucking pedo as well and Is in love with this toddler too because she helped him get out of this traumatizing state he was in since he was basically assaulted by his boss. He only found out about her because Shio, the toddler, has an older brother who is looking for her. For some reason, he just didn‚Äôt go to the police to report her missing because fuck adults I guess. The ‚Äúfuck adults‚Äù mindset is a big thing in this story, by the way. It‚Äôs almost like the author was projecting so hard that he wanted to kidnap and diddle kids so bad that he just hated adults since they were, I don‚Äôt know, adults. Uh, the coworker Satou has was actually her best friend? The friend she‚Äôs been with for a long time who she tells everything to but suddenly stopped when she ‚Äúgot a boyfriend‚Äù aka kidnap a child. Her name is Shouko. She‚Äôs actually one of the normal characters of this story. She gets worried, tries to talk to Satou, Satou says fuck you and basically walks away. They show that Shio and her brother Asahi were actually abused by their father. Shio and her mother run away while they left Asahi behind. The mother only came back to actually kill the father so Asahi could come back to her and Shio. But when Asahi does come by, His mother informs him that she, filled with grief, left Shio in an alley because she was a bad mom. Yeah. That‚Äôs the situation put bluntly. All you need to know after that is Satou killed a guy for a spare apartment, made her teacher burn the body parts, Satou‚Äôs aunt is weird. She didn‚Äôt abuse Satou at all. She was just very‚Ä¶ weird. She had a kink of just getting beaten, I guess. Satou just turned out like that because she was just so obsessed with love and she found love by kidnapping a little girl. Normal stuff! By the end, Shouko finds out about Satou hiding this missing girl since she was helping out Asahi. Asahi and Shouko had a forced romance cause why not ya know. Satou has one of her breakdowns and basically kills Shouko. Then she ‚Äúmarries‚Äù Shio. At first, Shio started remembering how she got there and actually yelled at Satou for using her for her sick fantasies but then she suddenly reverses that character development and she wants to be with Satou for all eternity. Dictionary would call that Stockholm Syndrome but why should I say anything. Satou confesses that she killed someone to Shio and Shio is just okay with it? I already stated that this author is using this as an outlet to just say ‚ÄúHEY! I WANT TO FUCK KIDS!‚Äù but clearly he or she doesn‚Äôt know how kids act in general. They should,  I dunno, seek medical help. I am so tired of this shit. Continuing, Satou tells her aunt she also killed someone and the aunt is very supportive and helps Satou out. In the montage, (yes there‚Äôs one of those here for whatever reason) and this is just a personal pet peeve, Satou is clearly shown to be disgusted by her Aunt when it was completely unjustified when she is literally helping her get out of where they live and run off with this kidnapped child? At least be more appreciative, cunt. I really hate Satou Matsuzaka. Back to the story, Asahi finds out where Shio is because his lover who he doesn‚Äôt know was killed took a picture of Shio and Satou just hugging outside and sent it to him. Which is why she was killed. Uh, Satou and Shio try to get out, Asahi is there, They run back to the elevator. Satou‚Äôs aunt starts committing arson for her niece and burns up the whole row where Satou and Shio were living. That‚Äôs right, ARSON. But you probably aren‚Äôt surprised, this shit is already fucked. Shio and Satou head to the top of the apartment complex, But Asahi followed them so, fuck you. They argue, Asahi holds back since Satou makes him think He‚Äôs hurting his little sister. Shio herself just tells him to fuck off. He gets sad, tries to get her again by convincing her that her mom and he loves her and she needs her family more than anything. She considers it, but Satou books it with her. Asahi is left with just a damaged lung since he was in smoke the whole time, the fire is getting on top. Satou and Shio decide to kill themselves, while falling, Satou says ‚Äúill see you in the afterlife‚Äù and uses herself as a pillow to save Shio. Honestly. I wanted the ending to be like ""My mother abandoned me so I\'LL ABANDON YOU TOO (PUSH)"" from Shio finally realizing what this is. and I really wanted it to happen.  But what Satou did worked, I guess, kinda. It shows the news covering what happened. Satou and Shouko were found dead. Satou‚Äôs aunt was arrested for arson. Satou‚Äôs teacher was arrested. Her coworker that was left traumatized was, left traumatized again. Asahi was shown carrying flowers to the hospital, Shio in the hospital bed, She tells him to fuck off and that she doesn‚Äôt want love cause she has already experienced it while she holds Satou‚Äôs ring and bow.The end! Wonderful ending huh? This was so pathetic. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, don‚Äôt watch this. It isn‚Äôt good. It shouldn‚Äôt be compared to other psychological horror anime. Wasn‚Äôt even scary. This was a 12-year-old from Deviantart wet dream who‚Äôs into shipping creepypasta characters. Plus a little pedophile sprinkled in. The story was horrendous. Characters average. Sound average. Although, I liked the opening. The only good thing about this is the opening. The art of the opening is very good. That‚Äôs the only positive thing I can say about this. Don‚Äôt watch this. Please. I beg of you. Whoever enjoyed this, seek help. a cute pink-haired girl, looks like she goes to high school or something, y\' know, the typical.

At least be more appreciative, cunt. I really hate Satou Matsuzaka. Back to the story, Asahi finds out where Shio is because his lover who he doesn‚Äôt know was killed took a picture of Shio and Satou just hugging outside and sent it to him. Which is why she was killed. Uh, Satou and Shio try to get out, Asahi is there, They run back to the elevator. Satou‚Äôs aunt starts committing arson for her niece and burns up the whole row where Satou and Shio were living. That‚Äôs right, ARSON. But you probably aren‚Äôt surprised, this shit is already fucked. Shio and Satou head to the top of the apartment complex, But Asahi followed them so, fuck you. They argue, Asahi holds back since Satou makes him think He‚Äôs hurting his little sister. Shio herself just tells him to fuck off. He gets sad, tries to get her again by convincing her that her mom and he loves her and she needs her family more than anything. She considers it, but Satou books it with her. Asahi is left with just a damaged lung since he was in smoke the whole time, the fire is getting on top. Satou and Shio decide to kill themselves, while falling, Satou says ‚Äúill see you in the afterlife‚Äù and uses herself as a pillow to save Shio. Honestly. I wanted the ending to be like ""My mother abandoned me so I\'LL ABANDON YOU TOO (PUSH)"" from Shio finally realizing what this is. and I really wanted it to happen.  But what Satou did worked, I guess, kinda. It shows the news covering what happened. Satou and Shouko were found dead. Satou‚Äôs aunt was arrested for arson. Satou‚Äôs teacher was arrested. Her coworker that was left traumatized was, left traumatized again. Asahi was shown carrying flowers to the hospital, Shio in the hospital bed, She tells him to fuck off and that she doesn‚Äôt want love cause she has already experienced it while she holds Satou‚Äôs ring and bow.The end! Wonderful ending huh? This was so pathetic. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, don‚Äôt watch this. It isn‚Äôt good. It shouldn‚Äôt be compared to other psychological horror anime. Wasn‚Äôt even scary. This was a 12-year-old from Deviantart wet dream who‚Äôs into shipping creepypasta characters. Plus a little pedophile sprinkled in. The story was horrendous. Characters average. Sound average. Although, I liked the opening. The only good thing about this is the opening. The art of the opening is very good. That‚Äôs the only positive thing I can say about this. Don‚Äôt watch this. Please. I beg of you. Whoever enjoyed this, seek help.', 'All‚Äôs fair in love and war. It‚Äôs an expression that I‚Äôve heard a million times. It‚Äôs so cliche that I kind of just take it for granted. The idea that anything is permissible if you do it for love seems fair enough on the surface. I never really questioned the validity of that cliche until I watched Happy Sugar Life. All‚Äôs fair in love and war feels like it should be right, but if I really think about it I start to run into some problems. What sort of actions truly are permissible in the pursuit or defence of love? If two loves are competing...with each other then which one is just? Do the reasons or justifications behind someone‚Äôs feelings of love matter or is the love defensible regardless? Happy Sugar Life explores all these questions and it does so while maintaining a high entertainment value. The moral questions present themselves naturally in the show through the interesting and compelling actions of the characters and how they conflict with each other. The artstyle of the show helps to enhance the themes, especially the general feeling of dread that persists throughout. Overall, Happy Sugar Life puts my thoughts and feelings in conflict with each other. While I might think certain actions are universally wrong I end up feeling like they are justified in the specific events of the show because they are done for love.Happy Sugar Life is about a pink haired psycho bitch (Satou) who abducts an innocent cute little blue haired girl (Shio) and basically uses her as an emotional support animal. On the surface it might seem like Satou and Shio have a shallow relationship but due to their past traumas we can see that isn‚Äôt the case. The relationship between Satou and Shio is by far the most emotionally substantive relationship that either one has ever experienced in their lives. Their relationship can accurately be described as ‚Äúlove.‚ÄùSatou has spent most of her life up until this point trying to find out what love is. Satou was orphaned as a child and ended up living with her Aunt who is an extreme pleasure seeker. Satou‚Äôs Aunt‚Äôs concept of love is very twisted and extreme. She pursues love through means of physical pleasure. This has lead to her becoming damaged, both physically and mentally. Satou‚Äôs Aunt‚Äôs pursuit of pleasure transcends any sort of common sense. She seeks physical love despite any cost, happily accepting beatings from random men.Because of Satou‚Äôs upbringing she didn‚Äôt have a good understanding of love. Satou ended up spending a lot of time engaging in sexual relationships with men however she did not derive pleasure from these relationships. The relationships were very shallow and focused in physical pleasure only, this did not satisfy Satou‚Äôs deep rooted emotional needs. Satou tolerated these shallow sexual relationships because they offered her a place to spend the night at a time when she was trying to escape her Aunt‚Äôs putrid apartment. Satou was alone in the world and had to use her own wits to survive.Unlike Satou, Shio could not survive on her own. Shio is an innocent cute young girl who is filled with boundless energy and a childlike optimism that is cheerful and inspiring. Despite all that, she was treated terribly by her mother. Shio‚Äôs Mother was heavily abused and the trauma from the abuse lead to her becoming extremely paranoid and eventually hostile towards Shio. She ended up abandoning Shio on the street, running away her responsibilities as a mother, leaving Shio alone to suffer.On the night that Shio was abandoned she ended up being found by Satou. Satou took her in. Shio‚Äôs presence had a calming effect on Satou. Satou was experiencing a happiness like she never had before. Perhaps she didn‚Äôt yet realize that this feeling was love. Satou‚Äôs boyfriend at the time had never seen her so emotionally satisfied before. As his extreme jealousy of Shio boiled over, he attempted to strangle her to death. This lead to Satou committing her first murder.Satou‚Äôs first murder was defensive in nature. It wasn‚Äôt premeditated, it was simply a spontaneous and necessary action to defend Shio. Unfortunately this murder would lead Satou down an irreversible path, where anything to protect Shio is permitted.This is the point that the first episode starts at. Our first introduction of Satou and Shio is of them living alone together in secret. Satou goes to school during the day and works in the evening. She puts on a facade to get through the day. Shio stays home alone in their heavily locked apartment. When Satou returns at the end of the evening she is greeted warmly by Shio and they spend the night together. Satou is shown to be completely obsessed with Shio. Every action she takes is for the purposes of protecting her status quo situation with Shio. When other people threaten to interfere with Satou‚Äôs lifestyle, whether intentionally or not, she deals with them decisively. She uses various immoral tactics including deception, blackmail, and even murder. These tactics are relatively successful when dealing with isolated incidents. For example in the early episodes we see Satou successfully quashing love confessions, coercing her boss into actually paying her properly, and turning an attempted rapist into her loyal errand boy. Unfortunately these isolated successes don‚Äôt prepare her for what‚Äôs coming next; a focused effort from Shio‚Äôs brother (Asahi) to find Shio.Asahi‚Äôs persistent search for Shio serves as Satou‚Äôs biggest threat. From Asahi‚Äôs perspective, Shio is a missing child. He searches tirelessly for her. He has a weak disposition and is often ignored, and even beaten, when trying to pass out flyers. Asahi presents the major moral conflict of the show. Is Satou right to be holding the custody of Shio? Through Asahi we see that there are people who care about Shio. It becomes clear that Satou is not in the right for hiding Shio from the rest of the world. Although Satou‚Äôs intentions to protect Shio might be good they are having unintended consequences.Shio in not mentally stable. While Satou is out and about all day, Shio stays alone in their apartment. Shio is shown to have an unclear memory, distorted due to the trauma she faced. Shio is shown drawing an effigy of her mother on a closet wall despite repressing memories of her. Shio‚Äôs mental instability is heightened when she is alone.Shio‚Äôs situation touches on some moral conflicts. Shio is clearly better off with Satou than she was with her mother. Satou provides a motherly presence for Shio that her actual mother did not. However Satou isn‚Äôt capable of healing all of Shio‚Äôs wounds, and there are even some that she doesn‚Äôt know about. Is Shio truly better off being with Satou? Would Shio be better off with her brother or some other caring guardian? Is Satou‚Äôs protection of Shio a selfless act to protect Shio or a selfish act to satisfy her own needs and desires? These aren‚Äôt easy questions to answer and that‚Äôs part of what makes them so compelling.The moral conflicts of Happy Sugar Life are very interesting and they make me want to think. However, thoughtful and difficult moral questions do not make an anime good by themselves. The art of Happy Sugar Life add a lot to the emotional element of the show. Below, I will discuss some of my favourite motifs and symbols that forced me to feel.One of the main visual motifs and symbols is the jar full of candy. This jar is shown in varying states. Sometimes the jar is full of candy and the characters eat from it. Sometimes the jar is spilled and the candy is absent. The symbolism here is obvious but powerful. The candy represents the positive emotions associated with the concept of a ‚ÄúHappy Sugar Life.‚Äù The jar represents the capacity to maintain these positive emotions. It‚Äôs important to note that the jar is made of fragile glass. The characters need to put in a concerted effort to maintain the wholeness of their jar. Even if the jar is completely empty and devoid of candy the presence of the jar itself is evidence that the capacity for a ‚ÄúHappy Sugar Life‚Äù still remains. Satou has to work to make sure her jar remains intact. She doesn‚Äôt want to end up like her Aunt, whose jar is described as being broken, which can help explain her bizarre behaviour and general insanity.Every night Shio and Satou perform a wedding ceremony. Shio drapes a white bed sheet over Satou‚Äôs head as a veil and they recite matrimonial vows. This nightly ritual serves not only as an affirmation of their love for each other but also as an act of purification for Satou, who uses morally questionable tactics to maintain her status quo relationship with Shio on a daily basis.During a particularly brutal and emotional scene, Satou ends up with scars on the back of her hand. The scars are left as the last attempted resistance of one of Satou‚Äôs murder victims. The scars on Satou‚Äôs hands serve as a reminder to Satou of the lengths that she has gone to to preserve her secret relationship with Shio. They are simultaneously a reminder of her regrets and of her conviction. The scars reminded me of the ‚Äúdamned spot‚Äù that stains the hands of Lady Macbeth. After feeling guilt and regret about her decision to commit murder, Lady Macbeth hallucinates a blood stain on her hands. She cries ‚ÄúOut, damned spot! Out, I say!‚Äù as she frantically tries and fails to wash the imaginary blood from her hands. Satou does not react to her hand‚Äôs scars in same way as Lady Macbeth but the similarity between the two remains. They both have an uncleanable permanent stain on their hands. One that appeared there due to their own decisions and actions. One that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.Throughout the entire show the art is underscored by this unsettling and horrifying theme of contrast. When Satou and Shio are alone together the colours are bright and vivid. The presentation seems happy and carefree similar to something from a cute girls slice of life anime. But unlike those cute girls shows, the happy artstyle here is chilling due to the stark contrast with the rest of the show. The rest of the show has a very drab artstyle which is a lot more in line with the darker and more morbid themes of the show. This contrast between happy and carefree with drab and morbid is what makes the show horrifying for me. This contrast makes everything unsettling. The parts that are happy and carefree feel like they are on an island, surrounded by violent waves of morbidity. The happy parts feel like they don‚Äôt belong and they feel like they could be swallowed up by the ocean of morbidity at any time. The characters act in ways that corroborate this theme which helps to enhance its effect. Satou is cold and calculating when she is in the outside world but when she is alone in her apartment with Shio she is warm and loving and kind. A lot of Satou‚Äôs actions can be viewed as her protecting Shio from the cruel outside world.Overall I think the art direction does a great job at complimenting the themes of the story. The symbols and motifs are quite potent and the general tone and style of the art helps accentuate dark themes and makes dramatic moments more impactful. The actual themes themselves delve into deep moral questions. The moral questions are not forced down the audience‚Äôs throat but rather they present themselves naturally through the interesting and compelling actions of the characters and the conflicts they have with each other.Happy Sugar Life had an interesting effect on me. While individual actions by Satou are pretty clearly objectively reprehensible I still end up with this feeling like she isn‚Äôt wrong. This conflict between my thoughts and my feelings is at the core of why I like this show. This show took a character who does bad things for an arguably unjustifiable motive and it made me like her. Satou is damaged and flawed and I really think that I shouldn‚Äôt support her but I can‚Äôt help it. Her fight just feels right to me because she is fighting for love. So while ‚Äúall‚Äôs fair in love and war‚Äù can be picked apart with logical arguments, it still just feels right. Maybe not everything is fair in the pursuit or defence of love but in Satou‚Äôs case I feel like she is good. And if I‚Äôve learned anything from this show, it‚Äôs that good things are worth fighting for. with each other then which one is just?

In this mix of horror, shitty writing, and an overload of edge we follow Satou and Shio, the Yuno and victim respectively as they try to avoid any and all uneccasary contact with people other than themselves. What makes this edgy though? The fact that we can\'t go two minutes in the first three episodes without encountering, a new pedophile, blood/murder, obscured mental trauma, rape and related thoughts, and the most important one, kidnapping. All...of this comes together to make a laughably over the top horror setting, that was executed very poorly. Next we just add the shitty writing and bam, Happy Sugar Life.Plot - I basically already described the basic plot which I\'m sad to admit is probably the best part of this show. Edginess runs rampant as Yuno Gasai has to keep her loli confined like an unused pokemon. That\'s about it. The show does get more fucked up though and tries to give the characters some backstory and even incorporate some philosophy. However it all goes down to drain since whoever wrote this is straight incompetent. Only good backsotry goes to the loli who was abused by her family, and she is the not-fucked up character who somehow has the worst backstory. The show plays with the question ""what does it mean to love someone"". Thankfully the show gives us an answer: completely controlling who you love like a dog. Thanks for the great philosophy that was injected into every piece of dialogue in the show as if we didn\'t know already.Characters - Now this is the fun part. Pedophile #1, Pedophile #2, Pedophile #3, Pedophile #4, Pedophile #5, loli, and ONLY 2 normal people. Well you\'ve now seen all there is to see for characters, move along. Jokes aside, these characters were horrible and yes, there really were 5 pedophiles in the show. Every character is a shitty, cringy edge fest trying to hard and there is also a loli with an annoying voice actress. The only way I see the characters being good, is if the viewer doesn\'t have any problems with pedophilia. I don\'t know, maybe I\'m the only one to be against the idea of an eighteen year old kidnapping a five year old and trying to marry it. Who knows? I\'m also not a fan of seeing a pedophilic Yuno Gasai clone, an already shitty character. Her name is Satou and she even has pink hair! There is also a dude who is a rape victim but instead of seeking counseling, turns into a pedophile himself and begins to literally drool over the probably hundreds of missing person posters of Shio. Great character writing I know. As for the loli, there isn\'t anything particularly wrong with her, but she\'s just a loli with an annoying voice actress so who really cares. The two normal people don\'t have anything going for them either. They\'re the only not edgy characters, but they also don\'t have much of a personality either. I think the worst character would have to be Satou, the Yuno Gasai clone I mentioned earlier. The show has the need to constantly remind the audience that she loves a child and is crazy, as if we didn\'t know already. Her backstory is also so basic, her aunt took poor care of her, Big deal. I have a cousin like that but they do\'t go around kidnapping children. The characters are some of the worst I\'ve seen if not the worst. This show feels like a joke but I unfortunately know it isn\'t.Aesthetics (art, animation, sound) - Sound was pretty basic, not much else to say. The animation though, damn. The whole budget was put into the opening theme. Everything else looks like shit. I remember a scene where a kid was punched by his father in a flashback and the hand straight up missed but the kid fell over anyway. Only fun part of the show was that. The art style is basic and not as cheery as I think the director\'s could\'ve made it.All-in-all, this show was horrible. Poor character writing, constant edginess, and pedophilia take presedence over an actual story and results in the shitfest known as: Mirai Nikki 2 - without future diaries.

I consider the story a bit exaggerated. Also, I cannot understand how some can highly praise the series after criticizing Eromanga sensei, Citrus, School Days to name some.For example, several spectators cannot stand Citrus' assault. However, they can accept a teenager that has committed murder and locks a young girl of no more 6 ‚Äì 8 years old in an apartment. They accept many other cases of abuse and assault portrayed in this series. Additionally, the series introduces the denigrations of society...but in a way where almost all the cast is ill and pervert under the flag ‚Äúthat is love.‚Äù I forgot the pedophilia references but it is not a taboo in this anime in comparison with other series. The audience accepts it because the series has the psychological, horror and shounen tag. In my case, I only have a word for this, incoherence. In this fantastic world, all the antisocials, ill persons, demons, converged. I think the author forgot recreating some demonic ritual to add more emotion to the plot.The plot 4/10The plot is very easy to follow and too fantastic to digest it. We have a little girl called Shio, who is the center of all the story. She has a rough past but irradiates the purity of a young person free of any illness of the evil world, and she is a beacon of hope. One day a teenager, Satou, finds her and magically fallen in love with her (it is called a psychological twist‚Ä¶no, it is called incoherence). However, Satou that felt empty now is a complete person and will do everything in her hand to be with her beloved, but the deprivations of the world already contaminated her mind, and Satou‚Äôs actions are total madness and too fantastic to be accepted. The rest of the story is a rollercoaster where the author adds more and more suffering to entertain the audience and several bitten it. Ironically as it looks, in this unreal story, the little girl knows and understands the meaning of love more than the rest of the cast, and I consider it an interesting outcome. For me, the plot fluctuates from average to acceptable with some minor high peaks at the end. Also, the lack of reality in a psychological narrative is a huge mistake because some will interpret the plot as absurd and comical. One of the most important factors in horror and psychological thrill is the reality contrasted with the unreality, but this show is unreality contrasted with unreality the result is a series with some useless scenes where the characters are wasted and distorts the plot development.The characters 5/10Almost all the characters are generic. Yes, the face and the madness is interesting, but almost ALL the characters are the same. They are ill silhouettes with a different perversion or suffering. Only two of them have a credible background the rest are a pit of emotional sickness. One positive point is how the author maintained Shio‚Äôs personality. She is the most mature character in a nest of failed characters (Mitsuboshi) and wasted ones (spoiler). Also, she is the character that has a healthy progression, but for her age, some can think that it is a sci-fi achievement.  On the other hand, the relation between Shio and Satou gives the impression of a relationship between a mother and a child, but in the last episodes, the relationship has a significant evolution that could have appeared early in the middle of the story.The art and the sound 7/10The series creates a normal contrast between a colorful world and the pervert and sick one. However, that variation is basic in any horror and psychological film or series. Also, there is good camera management. Sadly, some parts of the art are rough and are not finished correctly. Some angles are very ugly and with wrong proportions.The sound and the OST are normal. The OP is a mix of soft and hard sounds to create the sensation between good and mad.The verdict is very simple; you should skip this show if you cannot handle an inconsistent plot, pedophilia, and irrealistic horror treatment because you could end complaining of the outcome.Extra informationSeason rank 337 (246 points) in Japan but in a way where almost all the cast is ill and pervert under the flag ‚Äúthat is love.‚Äù I forgot the pedophilia references but it is not a taboo in this anime in comparison with other series.

This anime in particular deals with plenty of themes that stray from the path of God including homosexuality, killing, affairs, pedophilia, probably rape, but so what? In the end it doesn\'t make any sense.If I had to guess the train molestor manga artist who came  up with this story was trying to convey the idea that people are all fucked up by writing in characters who lead somewhat normal lives with an intense perverted quirk about them, like BnH for pedophiles. I don\'t think it works, their backstories aren\'t fleshed out...enough to derive a definitive conclusion at this point, but from what I\'ve seen up to episode 5 is that their deviancy doesn\'t come from strong enough of a place.The formula thus far has been to introduce another freak in each episode and you have a too many cooks in the kitchen situation that could be seen as a interesting and interwoven plot but none of that matters because from the set up you can already see the ending. The mystery box fails to contain its self and the plot is tracked on a cliched line where all the twists were noticed from the end of the first episode.Also there is no real suspense each episode follows the same basic punches, you get a cliff hanger moment that gets resolved with no consequences, then the ""sweet"" portion, then they introduce another degenerate, then there is the ""bitter"" portion which ends with a cliff hanger that gets resolved immediately in the next episode.Anytime there is momentum it gets immediately torn away and you get 15 minutes of boring daily shit that has no purpose seemingly, all the resolutions are nonsensical like the author didn\'t think of them before introducing the problem and just needed to submit some shit before the deadline. I guess I\'m just trudging along at this point because the original premise was interesting but this anime actually just sucks.4/10 enough to derive a definitive conclusion at this point, but from what I\'ve seen up to episode 5 is that their deviancy doesn\'t come from strong enough of a place.The formula thus far has been to introduce another freak in each episode and you have a too many cooks in the kitchen situation that could be seen as a interesting and interwoven plot but none of that matters because from the set up you can already see the ending.

In Happy Sugar Life, this subject of matter is greatly reflected, whether in the anime community or inside the story. Generally speaking, people think this anime is trying to hard to be edgy. However, this anime isn\'t a straight edgy anime, which gives you a lot of death or violent scenes. This anime is kinda dark in another way around on the characters conflicts and the atmosphere, which is better than most dark anime in my opinion.+Great...character interactions+Descriptive character stories+Interesting story followed by mysteries+The atmosphere is kinda well-built-Slow paced-the plot is built on an unrealistic settingTo begin with, this story is built on an unrealistic setting, which may bother someone around. Like ""Satou love a little girl called Shio and Satou\'s aunt is sick"", but let me tell you, this anime is intended to be like this because it\'s supposed to be a dark anime and like I mentioned just now, this anime is better than most dark anime, because Happy Sugar Life isn\'t built on death scenes. If you are sick with dark anime, which gives you violent scenes directly. This is an anime for you, so why would Happy Sugar Life being called as a dark anime? This is because the atmosphere is built on characters solely. The relationship built up is based on some wrong perspectives or past events. The reason why Satou like Shio and they love each other is mainly because of their tragic stories and they found their own love, although in general public we think they\'re definitely wrong, but I think this is what the writer want to reflect on. This anime doesn\'t need many violent scenes, as it\'s already more than enough.The characters\' stories are presented pretty perfectly, it explains well on their tragic events about their childhood and why would the main characters conclude with this kind of relationship from the scratch till the ending. Including the side characters, they all have their own aims and thoughts, which lately on resulting in large conflicts and it\'s pretty amazing. The inner feelings of the characters are done really well, like they asked themselves whether this kind of action is right or not. It\'s pretty interesting. For those who hate dark twisting anime in general, they wouldn\'t appreciate this anime in this kind of way, as they already dislike the setting in general, so you should consider on your preference whether you would accept this kind of storytelling or not.The only issue I have in this anime is it\'s kinda slow-paced, as it solely focus on the characters, the plot doesn\'t really move, it can be the whole episode talking about characters\' inner feelings and past events, while the present events don\'t really move a lot, which someone may feel bored occasionally for people who are looking for thrilling events, but it doesn\'t affect much to the storytelling, as I generally enjoy what I have watched from Happy Sugar Life.In short, Happy Sugar Life isn\'t a typical dark anime, it\'s a dark anime built on characters relationships, what this anime is lacking of is the pace control, which I think personally this anime could insert more story events, but if thinking from the characters aspect, this anime has already done more than enough. The journey is enjoyable and interesting.I think the animation is done pretty great, it fits the dark elements pretty well with gloomy textures and shadowing, but the character designs look kinda identical, same eyes drawings, similar face shapes, maybe it\'s because of the authors\' style preferences, but personally I think they could make it a little bit different, so that each character looks more unique. The sound effects are done pretty good, many background music and sound effects are used. Though, I think they could insert more throughout the scenes and events. The op and ed gives me the feeling of the dark atmosphere, which are pretty well-themed. Voice actors are pretty awesome too, Hanazawa Kana is in this anime voicing as Satou, which anime fans can\'t miss this out.If you are sick of the ordinary dark anime, this is a refreshing option to you, but if you dislike dark anime in general, you shouldn\'t consider this anime, because this anime is built on an unrealistic setting that you may bother with. Whether you agree with my points or not, it\'s up to you, but I just want to tell you that this anime is great in my opinion, that\'s all.Story: 8/10 (A)Animation: 8/10 (A)Sound: 8.5/10 (A+)Characters: 9/10 (S)Enjoyment: 8/10 (A)Overall: 8.3/10 (A) character interactions+Descriptive character stories+Interesting story followed by mysteries+The atmosphere is kinda well-built-Slow paced-the plot is built on an unrealistic settingTo begin with, this story is built on an unrealistic setting, which may bother someone around.

(I will be posting some spoilers throughout so keep that in mind if you read on.)Happy Sugar Life was an anime of the 2018 Summer Season that caught my attention in the first couple of episodes. It was something that gave me almost School Days like vibes with the way it presented itself. This isn\'t necessarily a bad thing as I am one of the fans of how that series portrayed itself as almost a deconstruction of the harem genre.This however, crumbled into a real mess as the show progressed and I put it on the back burner as I...wasn\'t really enthralled to watch the series. The first couple of episodes were pretty good and set an initial tone to the show which I actually enjoyed. Seeing Satou and her ""Yandere"" moments early on were some of the interesting moments of the show.I\'ll section this into categories from here.Story: 3/10As I said, the initial couple of episodes were actually pretty decent and set a dark tone without going overboard on the whole creepy side. As the show continued it became a series with very little substance. If I had to name it, you could almost call it Stockholm Syndrome the anime. Shio is essentially under house arrest by Satou and locked away from the outside world all day until she comes home. She is so naive that she doesn\'t seem to notice anything wrong with this situation for a good long time. Just when you think she is going to rebel against Satou because of this, she then reverts and accepts everything, even the fact that Satou has killed someone in the apartment while she was there. The best character and the main source of reason was easily Shoko who provides moments of normalcy throughout the plot. However when she is killed off for what almost feels like shock value after triggering so many death flags, the story becomes damn near ridiculous. The finale was honestly something I was looking forward to as I was genuinely hoping for Satou to truly suffer for the pain and anguish she had caused the rest of the cast. Instead she got hit once and was able to die the happiest she has ever been. At least School Days has a satisfying conclusion in comparison and he got what he deserved. Satou did far worse than Makoto ever did and she got so much more leniency. The final scene with Shio was genuinely creepy and it feels like Satou had managed to perform one last despicable act in screwing up someone else\'s concept of love to the point where it will probably hurt others as she did herself.Art: 4/10The art was fairly bland and certainly nothing special. The expressions were pretty good but outside of that there was nothing of particular note. I was watching it on stream and the scenes with black and white scrawlings over the screen played hell with the buffering. I understand why they were there but they felt lazy. Add to the fact that most of the anime was still frames, it made it feel half-assed and lazy. Almost like they were hoping the shock value of the plot would cover up any discrepancies.Sound: 4/10There were no stand out moments in the soundtrack. The OP and ED were fine but certainly nothing special. Certainly not on my download list or anything like that.Character: 4/10This is probably the main point of contention as this was the focus of the anime all in. Character traits were taken to extreme levels to the point of being totally unbelievable.Satou couldn\'t find love until she kidnapped an elementary school loli who just happened to smile nicely and hold her hand.Shio is honestly hard to make heads nor tails of. She was essentially Satou\'s prisoner for weeks/months and eventually rejected everyone else just because Satou ""loved"" her. Watching her turn against her brother in the final episode was honestly rage inducing.Taiyou was downright creepy and as much as I find lolis cute, this guy was one step off plucking a child off a playground just to sniff her hair. It was distressful to watch and his fate was one I didn\'t mind as it honestly served him right.Shoko as I said was the main saving grace of the show and kept some semblance of common sense throughout the characters during any time she was on screen. Her interactions with Asahi were honestly the highlight of the show and I won\'t deny there had to have been a ship out there for them among the fanbase.Asahi was the real tragedy of this whole series. He spends his life trying to reunite his family and goes from getting the crap beat out of him by random guys he meets to being rejected by his sister after finally finding her. I genuinely felt for him as the plot was so against him for the whole show.Enjoyment: 5/10It was fun, in a cringy way, the first couple of episodes were nice and interesting to watch, however as the show progressed I found it harder and harder to enjoy as things kept getting more screwed up. Seeing another ""fingernail"" scene reminiscent of Higurashi was absolutely horrifying for me and I found it very difficult to maintain my focus on the show for the remainder of that episode. I would have enjoyed it more had the series had a satisfying payoff but sadly it didn\'t deliver.Overall: 4/10So yeah we got a show with rage inducing moments like School Days, however this doesn\'t have nearly as memorable an ending as the former and will no doubt fall into obscurity like a lot other ""horror"" anime. It\'s a shame too as it had potential at the start. wasn\'t really enthralled to watch the series.

However, I still find it disturbing people not only enjoy this series, but even defend it not as an amusing trainwreck, but some kind of genuine masterpiece. I seriously tried to see any of the redeeming qualities people are writing about... And they\'re just not there.This series is not a good psychological anime. All characters are absurd, obnoxious caricatures that you can\'t relate to or be genuinely intrigued by. Hida is maybe the only exception ‚Äì I actually somewhat bought her behaviour (it...was nearly human-like!) and her demise was quite gruelling. And that was literally the only moment this series caused any other emotion than disgust with how dumb it is.This series is not a comedy. Calling it such gives it way too much credit: it might be comically over-the-top, but I saw no hints it doesn\'t treat itself dead-seriously and the way is was exaggerated was obnoxious rather than funny.This series does not have a good story. It actually barely has one ‚Äì it\'s a slightly-disguised slasher movie plot with pseudo-psychological mumble on top of it. Until the literally last two episodes, the only plot progression is people you don\'t give a shit about dying for stupid reasons.The one thing is potentially has going for it is the visual and sound gimmicks ‚Äì basically different forms of distortions symbolising traumas and repressed memories. There are some unusual switches in perspective and ""experimental"" sequences. I could even enjoy some of them if the story and characters weren\'t this pathetic.Of course, it\'s a relatively high-budget production, so it sounds and looks quite good. The actual content, however, is empty at best and offensively stupid most of the time. And unlike the shows I could consider ""so bad they\'re good"", it has the audacity to pretend it\'s about something and has some kind of message.

Men are shown as sick pedophiles, but main heroine is not. Matsuzaka Satou is shown as a villain, but authors sympathise this bitch on her way to ruin the life and personality of much younger Shio. If you think that Matsuzaka is not sick as she is also kid, you loose your site of the fact that Matsuzaka is much more older than Shio and have more opportunities in life, is much more educated and has power over her. Actually Satou leaves no chance for Shio to grow up...the normal way and develop, recieve proper education. Yes, Satou is traumatised, but almost all the other characters are traumatised too and that differenses in representation are so appaling.The `love` of main heroines is as horrible thing as `love` of Shio`s brother or that pedo teacher or aunt. All disgraceful ways to show off the feellings of characters are shown in right way but not Matsuzaka`s. And that`s a fatal mistake of perverted anime producers as `relationships`between Shio and Satou is the main theme of this anime. the normal way and develop, recieve proper education.

None of the characters are likable and it tries to be really edgy and shocking but ultimately fails and looks like something I\'d see on flip note in 2009 on DeviantArt.   I\'m baffled how people even like this anime and just compare it to something like Elfen Lied.  The only thing I\'m glad about is how the start of the show does that dumb ""End before Start"" scene so I know how the fucking thing ends.TLDR: waste of time ', ""After reading the synopsis about a psychopathic murderous lesbian pedophile loli girl who is in a relationship with a 4 year old child. My first reaction is.Yea..no..yea..no..yeaaa!Happy sugar life is the new addition this season that currently have only 6 episode released as of this moment. And I already watched them all.The main character Matsuzaka Satou, voiced by Hanazawa, Kana is a freshman highschooler that works at a cafe to finance her life with Shio Koube a 4 year old child(approx).Story revolves how she maintains a nice appearance with people around her at school and work until her relationship with Shio Koube gets challenged.

Every scene would appear to be predictable but the very intricate execution of the feelings of the character and how it's drawn and presented makes it feel really unique and stimulating. And the moments of what she called happy sugar life brings out a different aura on the scenes that makes it refreshing.The darkness of the plot will keep you glued in anxiety hoping that everything would work out but obviously wouldn't. And the kind of questions that arouses every episode will keep me hanging and waiting for more to come.Overall this is a very unique genre and obviously not for everyone. But if you enjoy dark plots with a twist of eye gouging and pedo kissing then this is for you.The only problem I have is that it feels like everyone here has a mental disorder but yeah I still enjoyed the show. yeah shit will hit the fan.What would a psycho do out of pure love?

I am one of those. So when I first saw the cover and title of this anime I ignored it bc it seemed like a shitty SoL cutesy kids show. But I finally got curious and read its summary and holy shit I was dead wrong. Basically there\'s this Highschool girl named Satou who fell in love with this abadoned little girl and took her in. That little girl faced trauma and lost a bunch of memories (I believe). Satou then decides to protect her whatever the cost,...even if it means committing a crime or killing someone.This anime has probably not a single normal character and i\'m not even kidding. There\'s probably one mentally sane person in this whole anime. The MC is a yandere yuri pedophile. The little girl has ptsd, some other weird mental issues, and stockholm syndrome ig. There\'s a blonde who is a pedophile. There\'s the little girl\'s older brother who goes crazy when his father dies and some other weird shit. There\'s a teacher who\'s a masochistic creep. In short no one is normal and it\'s absolutely amazing. The MC is p smart and finds ways to deal with threats to her everyday life with discreet tactics. When she goes yandere mode it is just so exciting and intense. The music, art, and sound effects makes it so much better. The art in this anime at times can be so cute and fluffy while at other times will be very scary, horrific, and eerie. Each episode is a thriller with introductions of new fucked up characters that each have a role in the anime.One critic of this anime i see from many people is how unreasonable the MC is at times and it pisses them off. I do have to agree to a certain extent there, she definitely goes too far despite not needing to all for the sake of ""just in case"". Also biggest critic: the ending absolutely sucks. It was a horrible way to end it and it also made absolutely made no sense whatsoever and did not close any areas that needed closure.I rate this anime a 9/10 because I absolutely loved it. This anime is definitely not for everyone but I still highly recommend. This would be good for someone who wants to see a really fucked up anime and if you\'re gonna watch it I suggest not taking it too seriously but anyways yeah that\'s it. even if it means committing a crime or killing someone.This anime has probably not a single normal character and i\'m not even kidding.

See Satou is someone who has a corrupted view on what love is as she never knew what love is and her experiencing love in the real world had been fruitless to say the least until she found that happiness,...that sugar that fills her jar that being Shio and she\'ll do ANYTHING to keep her secret life, secret from everyone. The thing the majority of the cast have a screw loose, deriving from their desires in some of the more extreme ways, such as Daichi Mitaumekawa voiced by Kaito Ishikawa, a womanizer, even though he\'s married and has children but he wants that ""thrill"" of not getting caught and the pleasure of it all which his drives lustful desires, Taiyou Mitsuboshi is also one though not at first, wanting to be pure through Shio due to his extreme phobia of older woman and like Satou will do anything to see Shio.If Happy Sugar Life is telling anything is looking into society and how it expects everyone to be ""normal"" but sometimes people wants to break away from that conformity and find their own ""happiness"" their own way and sure some of these characters are unhinged to the point of absurdity but the thing is, LA thinks some of these cases of madness some of these characters go through have some level of relatability towards them especially looking at Satou\'s views on happiness and love (of course not her...killy killy side).Happy Sugar Life at a first glance looks like something you\'d stay far away from it\'s premise especially with Satou and Shio\'s relationship but diving deeper into Satou\'s mindset as well as what it\'s other unhinged minor characters brings us to the table, Happy Sugar Life is more or less telling of what it takes to gain your happiness and what the lengths people will do to keep that ""happiness"" from disappearing. Yeah and the thing is if you think Shio is all pure due to her being a kid...well think again, by the end of the anime, LA thought that they SHOULD be together considering how fucked up both of them were, almost like society itself has pushed them to be together and all the more better for that in LA\'s opinion. The only two characters LA thought had some semblance of normalcy were Shouko Hida voiced by Aya Suzaki, Satou\'s friend and colleague at work as well as Asahi Koube voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, Shio\'s older brother who\'s looking for her, but the only one to succumb and get batshit insane became Asahi, almost becoming his own worst nightmare as to what HE was trying to achieve in order to do it.The animation done by Ezo\'la was actually pretty good, from the character designs to the typical background work, but where Ezo\'la\'s animation shines is in it\'s psychological take on Satou and Shio\'s mindset and how they visualize as it gets into some very creepy and psychologically damaging visuals and considering the viewpoint and narrative focus is mainly on Satou, the animation work done to visualize her psyche was amazingly done well, be it the symbolism of her ""sweets jar"" or how her psyche gets more and more corrupted as Satou does increasingly irredeemable things is telling of how the good animation is on that front. Ezo\'la really outdid themselves really.In terms of voice acting, well we have LOTS of playing against the type roles, from the first one LA can think of being Yumiri Hanamori crossdressing role as Asahi Koube to Aya Suzaki as Shouko in a fairly laid back role (where she was usually typecasted into a genki role). MVP\'s easily goes to Kana Hanazawa as she easily holds this anime from her cutezy moe vocals and instantly change to a menacing, bloodlustful murderer the next, Misaki Kuno was amazing as well, in doing sure, some of her typical typecasted roles, but this time as an unhinged and psychologically damaged little girl that is more than she seems, as considering she had the same amount of screentime as Kana Hanazawa, Miskai Kuno had some great chemistry with Kana in the process, lastly would be Yumiri Hanamori, no not only because of her crossdressing roles but how much of a ""playing against the type"" role she played as Asahi, both appearance AND personality wise as to how he was near the end of the anime, how she HAMMED it up to acceptable levels. Happy Sugar Life really casted some great voice actors into Happy Sugar Life and really got them out of their comfort zone (well maybe except Kana Hanazawa) and it bloody shows through it\'s entire cast!Happy Sugar Life is an invariably deep look into ""happiness"" to the most extreme degree and how people will do to get it. Satou and Shio\'s relationship is the focal point of this entire anime and the relationship itself is point of contention to Satou and Shio both as characters, Satou for her corrupted views on happiness and her will and devotion to get it no matter to the point of murder, Shio with her family backstory and how she got to where she was and sure at first being oblivious to what is going on, but soon showing that not even Shio isn\'t as pure as she is though not of her own volition as it shows that even society can poison the most purest people. But nonetheless Happy Sugar Life\'s view on society of how people thinking everyone is pure is an outright lie, that people deep down have corruption hidden in them and sure Happy Sugar Life shows this to the extreme but Happy Sugar Life\' social commentary of this is nothing but impactful at large when concerning Satou and Shio\'s relationship and how society shuns their happiness, be it for not ""being normal and conform"" or individuals wanting to steal their happiness away. Really LA was expecting much more of a gorefest from Happy Sugar Life, but LA got more of a psychological dive into a mind of person who wants nothing more than happiness in ANY ways possible to get it and by all means Happy Sugar Life delivered it with conviction and great execution (no pun intended) to display it, Happy Sugar Life was crazy, psychotic and psychologically relatable hell of a ride and LA loved every moment of it...LA\'s jar feels empty now since Happy Sugar Life finished..LA needs more sweets... that sugar that fills her jar that being Shio and she\'ll do ANYTHING to keep her secret life, secret from everyone.

What I particularly liked about this animation was the excellent portrayal of the emotions of each character. There were several moments while watching the animation that gave me goosebumps, especially in key scenes where the appropriate background music and special effects were unparalleled. Furthermore, the spine-chilling performances of the voice actors suited this animation perfectly and made it...even more immersive.Although there may be a slight loss of coherence in the story due to some omitted details towards the end, it's worth considering that the original manga delves deeper into these aspects, so if you enjoyed this animation, it might be worth checking out the manga to fill in those gaps. even more immersive.Although there may be a slight loss of coherence in the story due to some omitted details towards the end, it's worth considering that the original manga delves deeper into these aspects, so if you enjoyed this animation, it might be worth checking out the manga to fill in those gaps."", 'it is a masterpiece , i cant understand how its score is 6.9 it is the best psychological horror anime ever in the horror and the brain f*ck aspect.My guess is that people got so brain f*cked and gone mad and that is why this has very low score.you getting fucked in your brain doesnt mean that the show is bad.story: they give you the background of the characters  in backwards, you learn every thing about the characters after you finish the last episode. the story and the events will never get you bored or get you out of the unease and the painful...mental state it is like a mix of emotions, the closest thing that I can think of is that it is like watching citrus and future dairy at the same time.you have to take a break after you finish the show before you judge it, if i would to rate it in the middle of watching it i would give 1/10 for how much i suffered watching this fucked up show.story 10/10 because it did its job as a psychological horror of fucking my brain.art: the only ""issue"" is that the art is not *perfectly* matched with the story, if it was less colorful and more like (shiki, another, monster, jigoku shojo)\'s art it would be a perfect complete masterpiece. the animation is amazingart 8/10 it is still wonderful but could be a little more better.sound: didnt really notice the sound effects or the music, it was not that memorable but it definitely got me into the atmosphere, it is good i guess .sound 8/10the characters : they are the best thing about the show very memorable and unique characters with each one having a similar fucked up background and almost all of them are sociopaths, except for Hida, and all the characters had perfect voice acting.characters 10/10enjoyment: 7/10 only because i cant really say that I enjoyed it, i think i need a therapist after this emotional r*peoverall: 10/10 wouldnt watch again go ahead and rewatch it if you are a masochist for me it was a good one time experience now i need something chill and cute to brain wash me out of this. mental state it is like a mix of emotions, the closest thing that I can think of is that it is like watching citrus and future dairy at the same time.you have to take a break after you finish the show before you judge it, if i would to rate it in the middle of watching it i would give 1/10 for how much i suffered watching this fucked up show.story 10/10 because it did its job as a psychological horror of fucking my brain.art: the only ""issue"" is that the art is not *perfectly* matched with the story, if it was less colorful and more like (shiki, another, monster, jigoku shojo)\'s art it would be a perfect complete masterpiece. the animation is amazingart 8/10 it is still wonderful but could be a little more better.sound: didnt really notice the sound effects or the music, it was not that memorable but it definitely got me into the atmosphere, it is good i guess .sound 8/10the characters : they are the best thing about the show very memorable and unique characters with each one having a similar fucked up background and almost all of them are sociopaths, except for Hida, and all the characters had perfect voice acting.characters 10/10enjoyment: 7/10 only because i cant really say that I enjoyed it, i think i need a therapist after this emotional r*peoverall: 10/10 wouldnt watch again go ahead and rewatch it if you are a masochist for me it was a good one time experience now i need something chill and cute to brain wash me out of this.', 'Our heart is like a jar, it can get filled in with sweetness, it can get emptied out by bitterness, and it can eventually break. Once it breaks though, it can\'t be fixed since it\'s made out of glass. But having an empty jar doesn\'t mean having a broken one, it still can be fixed somehow, it can be renewed and filled in with all sorts of sweets.Happy sugar life, an anime that revolves around the true meaning of love, how everyone has their own understanding of it, their own way of filling in their empty jars. But achieving fulfillment doesn\'t necessarily have to involve...doing so in a right way.Let me talk about the main story here, a highschooler Saotou and her love for young Shio ends up getting dark and unhealthy.The obsession that Saotou has in feeling fulfilled and having the perfect happy sugar life ends with her sanity, she now relies on the sweetness of Shio to survive the bitterness filling her up every day. Yep, you guessed it, yet another pink-haired yandere. Saotou, making Shio believe she is ""protecting"" her from any outside dangers, manages to keep Shio captive in her house, forbidding her to go outside ""for her own safety"".Coating the presented dark themes with sweetness and brightness just does the horror part for me. I ended up really enjoying the twisted mindsets and stories presented in both main and side characters.The drastic color changes found in this anime help to create a different mood in each scene. Starting with a variety of soft and bright colors that would make the scene joyful drastically changing into darker tones creating a much darker mood as well.I like to look at this story as if it was any food advertisement, it intends to make us think the food shown is perfectly cooked but actually, the appearance shown in the ad is far from reality. Appearances never are what they seemed to be and the same thing happens with the characters in this anime.The characters are presented as normal people, some even admired. But then again, this all seems to be a mask covering up the ugly reality they\'re living in. When their twisted mindsets are revealed you know the good shit\'s started. The inner struggles they all have make the story even more realistic for me. Although some behaviors like Shio\'s in particular situations just seem unhuman to me.Overall I think this is an anime that involves a very well thought story which I very much enjoyed, so if you like a good psychological horror anime, this is definitely a good one to go for. doing so in a right way.Let me talk about the main story here, a highschooler Saotou and her love for young Shio ends up getting dark and unhealthy.The obsession that Saotou has in feeling fulfilled and having the perfect happy sugar life ends with her sanity, she now relies on the sweetness of Shio to survive the bitterness filling her up every day.

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU HAD BEEN WARNED!<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<WARNING>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>The story is unique. I watched many anime with yanderes (only Mirai Nikki and SHIMONETA) but I think this anime is one of my favourite yandere story.The characters were written well and all of them had a reason to their actions even if their actions were justified or not. I could feel a connection to Asagi, to Satou, to everyone. I too struggled with love and lost just like everyone else.I love the art so much! Especially during the bad memories! The part where Satou and the artist was talking....was brilliant! I...love it, it was so creative, the fact we cant even hear what their voice sound like and we did not see their face. I love the heart rate monitor effect!The sounds was excellent especially in the bad memories, it sound so strange, so alien like, so out of the world!The only reason why I did not rate enjoyment as 10 but only a 7 because of me, it was not the anime...me being conflicted lowered the rating.The ending.....I have love hate relationship with it, my emotions, my feelings and my thoughts are now at war because of it. A part of me want Satou is be in jail for her horrible crimes, and for Asagi to be happy with his little sister...and another part of me love the ending....But I know for sure that all of me hated the scene where Taiyo got abused.....again.Yet....maybe Satou dying without Shio....is her way paying for the horrible crimes she committed...I dont know what to feel about the ending!.....I am a person who want everyone to be happy...even though that is not possible.I am the person who will keep replaying the same mission section in a game again and again and again until I save the most people I can!Lets talk about the characters...Satou, she is so pretty...but evil....I can see why she killed those thugs and the artist, that are justified...but did she really needed to murder Shoko Hida.....? Maybe, maybe not....she could just ran away with Shio farrrr away from this place without killing Shoko. She did got away with her murder of Hida, which is driving me crazy...but yet...maybe her dying without Shio is her justice for her crimes. She realized that Shio was just a kid who have her full life ahead of her, so that is why I think she kept Shio alive. I knew Shio was going to live, she was atop Satou.Taiyo, hmm, he is kinda yucky....yes, he was abused by a older woman...I sadly know many people who were......but him being obsessed with Shio is still yucky....Shio, I can feel her pain...I was not abused as a child, but I know people who were...but I can relate of being lost with the topic of love.Shoko Hida...the saying ""curiousity kill the cat"" fit her case perfectly, her stupidity and curiosity got her killed.Asahi, He is as bad as his abusive father, thats all I will say.Daichi? I have nothing to say about this disgusting person. He is what I hate the most!Episode seven got me so mad because the cops were so stupid! They ignored the bandages all over Satou\'s aunt, the trash in her apartment, and female cop did not stop Satou\'s aunt from sexual assaulting her partner UNTIL 2 minute that had passed...I normally dont write reviews this long..but I love this anime so much, so yeah!The weird part that I watched the first episode so along ago...and I swear to god that Satou found Taiyo or some blonde haired guy in a closet in her Manager\'s office, and Satou recorded her saying criminalizing stuff about it...... love it, it was so creative, the fact we cant even hear what their voice sound like and we did not see their face.

Starting with the opening, the main yandere heroiness (which is arguably a Yuno knock-off, but much more developed), the personalities of the side characters (everybody is messed up in one way or the other), the storytelling, the animation style (if you like the creepycute stuff then you\'ll love its visuals). In one moment you melt away from cuteness in the next you are thrown into the middle of the most brutal creepy psycho horror. This dissonance made my skin crawl the whole time. This show is among the best psychological horror shows, but be warned the plot is basically...a pedophilic\'s wet dream (imo this makes the whole show even more horrific)... If you can\'t turn a blind eye over this fact, then you\'ll be triggered in an instant.Although if you are willing to turn a blind eye over the pedo part, you will be greated with extreme emotions, varied instinctive urges, variety of mental illnesses and different forms of (domestic)violence. This show is really hard to digest. You will ask yourself: ""why did I do this to myself?""Funnily, in this show there is a real gender equality (in the worst possible way). There are also women and men who uses their position of power to abuse the others. It was interesting to see (or rather I would say freigthening) how a young men broke mentally, because he was harassed and violated by an older women. This point of view about the topic is rarely screened in any shows.This show is all about why mentally ill people became mentally ill. There is always a trauma which pushes the people over the edge which breaks them. The infinite cycle of trauma inheritance (from parents usally). What made the whole show even more freigthening is the fact that these could happen with everybody (if it didnt happen with you, you are lucky and you born in a good family). However the scariest part is even the sickest characters function in society while maintaining the appearance of perfection.On the more positive side, the show raises some thoughs about the love. It would be a universal feeling, or everyone would experience a subjective version? There is a love which is more real than the other? Moreover the show touches on the subject of the parenting. How long and at what cost can a child\'s innocence be protected?The storytelling was near perfect imo. Except the last scene in the last episode, which was so out of place I couldn\'t really comprehend.

However it\'s a really good anime, and I don\'t get it how the hell this could have so terrible rating. I guess it triggered a lot of people, and they didn\'t bother to watch it carefully. Anyway, do I recommend it? No, not really, except if you are eccentric enough to love creepy and f*cked up stuff with a deeper meaning. a pedophilic\'s wet dream (imo this makes the whole show even more horrific)... If you can\'t turn a blind eye over this fact, then you\'ll be triggered in an instant.Although if you are willing to turn a blind eye over the pedo part, you will be greated with extreme emotions, varied instinctive urges, variety of mental illnesses and different forms of (domestic)violence. This show is really hard to digest. You will ask yourself: ""why did I do this to myself?""Funnily, in this show there is a real gender equality (in the worst possible way). There are also women and men who uses their position of power to abuse the others.

HSL is perfect for that, all the characters have at least some problems in their mind when they are not crazy af. The plot and the characters are so well written. It makes you feel a lot of emotions, and ask yourself many psychological and philosophical questions.For example, one of main pupose of the anime is to talk about love. And there are a lot of questions about it that are implied like ""Is there several forms of love ?"" ""How far someone...could act for love ?"" ""What is true love ?"" And many more about love or other things.However, HSL is not meant to be watched by anyone. First of a all for age reasons. I would say you could watch it if you are around 15 years old (I\'m aware of the 17+ warning). But mostly because it depends a lot of your tastes and sensivity. If you don\'t like animes as i described earlier, don\'t watch this. At least you won\'t like it and in a worst case you could be shocked.I can also understand why some people didn\'t like it. They say it is ""awkward"" or ""edgy"". I think they misunderstood the purpose of the show. Of course the story, the characters,the situations, are often weird and disturbing but there is a will to deal with serious subjects and mental health issues in this anime. And I personally love it.Time to grade as a conclusion :Story/plot: 10/10Characters (writting and development): 10/10Art:- chara design: 9/10- animation: 9/10- backgrounds/scenery: 8/10- directing: 10/10Sound:- opening: 7/10- ending: 10/10 (ReoNa is my favorite jpop singer,please listen^^)- music: 7/10- sound-design and sound effects: 9/10- seiyu performance: 9/10overall: 10/10Thanks for reading, hope this wiil be useful. :) could act for love ?""

Personally, i found the entirety of this anime very alluring. I couldn't wait to finish the entire series as each episode came out, and I really liked it.The story is unique, in that the situations and characters presented are portrayed in a way only comparable to the best of other anime like this, like Madoka Magica, or Higurashi/Umineko. The plot moved at an appropriate pace, showing development in an ever-increasingly tense situation that captures your heart in a very exciting way.The art is very similar to those of anime of its year, and is, as is the art...of most anime, personally acceptable and not something notably bad, like My Sister My Writer or Marchen Madchen, or bad in general. The art portrayed the story well enough to captivate the viewers, and I found the art acceptably dark and intense for the appropriate plot.The music and sound effects used in this anime is just acceptable. It fits the theme of the story very well, kept me captivated for the 6-hour binge watch on my fifth rewatch, and made the flow of the story very well-paced. The sounds used was able to magnetize me to my screen and helped to portray the events very well.The characters are all exquisite. At first, I thought of the characters as just being used and shown for progression of plot, but I found the continuous involvement of all of the shown characters, excluding minor/background characters, very exciting. With my knowledge of the plot and story of different characters from completely different, yet excitingly related, I found the actions of the characters to be very helpful towards my enjoyment of the anime, and the characters have a deep background and involvement in the overall story, considering the brevity of this standard 12-episode, 24-minute anime.I enjoyed this anime so much, despite my general hesitation to watch something of such a dark nature. The unique, individual aspects of this anime made me like this anime, and watching this entire thing felt very quick, yet changed my perspective on so many things so quickly. The relationships between the characters is very attractive to me, and the way how the relationships develop and change over the course of the anime is very heart-rending. The main characters, especially, appeal to me sooooo much.Overall, I must recommend this anime. Though it might not meet certain people's expectations, or is not something certain people would enjoy, i found it a good use of time, and I cannot stress enough just how good of an anime this one was. I understand if people disagree with me, or if people won't like this anime for certain reasons, but I must recommend it; at the very least, watch this through to the end, without skipping anything. I say that this anime is worth the time, and worth the watch. of most anime, personally acceptable and not something notably bad, like My Sister My Writer or Marchen Madchen, or bad in general.

How that little girl because of unstable household find happiness in another abusive environment, because she doesn't know any better, that her life is better if she had foster parents who sent her to school and make friends with kids of her age, the main character is absolutely truly a mind of a psychotic person, where she kills someone a moment and happy in another.It's so weird and f up. It's sad people like children...have assessed this anime as something that is trying to promote pedophilia. It's sad seeing this anime with such a low score. I was going to give it an 8, but seeing the low score of 6 I had to do my part to raise the average of this show.Like literally most of the criticism of this anime is so childish. No one cares about the story, its all about that this anime is trying to be cool by touching a taboo topic. have assessed this anime as something that is trying to promote pedophilia.

I\'m sorry, this show is not for you. In fact, its characters are anything but realistic. They\'re horrible, one-dimensional and mostly pedophiles. But there is love that can\'t be described with words alone. In an attempt of conveying love, it needs something aggressive, determent, delusional or flat out crazy. That\'s why I love Happy Sugar Life to death and this review is my way to fight for it.For a psychological, the basis story is quite simple. Satou Matsuzaka on the outside is...an ordinary high school girl. Or maybe she stands above the rest a bit, she\'s beautiful and talented. Seemingly, there\'s nothing this girl can\'t do if she really tried. But she has always wondered the same old question human has asked since their existence: ""What is love?"". No matter how she tried, the answer has yet to shown until one faithful day. A little abandoned angel with the name of Koube Shio appear in her life, for the first time ever, she loves with all her heart. And whoever stands in her love, be careful, she\'s coming for you with determination.With such silly premiere, Happy Sugar Life is surely an character-driven anime. And luckily, it has a capable female lead to carry this horrendous show. Satou Matsuzaka is the best yandere I\'ve ever seen in anime. She scary, intelligent and ruthless but above, she can keep her composure. She never displays her anger visibly, always find a better way to get out of her trouble. In such a messed up way she was raised, it\'s understandable for the way she is. Along with Shio, the lovely couple is the saving grave, make the experience watching this anime unforgettable.The rest of the cast as I mention is one-dimensional, serving as a plot-device helping the story progress. And I\'m fine with that. The directing  of this anime is brilliant, carving the craziness of each characters, especially Satou-chan. One example I would think of is the scene of the conversation between her and the unfortunate sempai. The way they silent the sound of the sempai and playing a glitchy screen, along with the short and easy answer of Satou, it still gives me chill while rewatching it. Furthermore, the tone color change between her different personalities really improve the watching enjoyment.For the animation, it looks kinda cheap but not bad at all. While still frames are used a lot, the movement of characters looks pretty fluid, the color is bright as expected and I quite like the character designs. The music did serve its purpose quite well, but beside the catchy op song, nothing stands out for me.Overall, I think Happy Sugar Life is a case where people misjudge the anime because of the bad first impression and the horrible side cast. You should give it one more chance. an ordinary high school girl. Or maybe she stands above the rest a bit, she\'s beautiful and talented.

What if that dream were impossible? There have been shows with a yandere as a deuteragonist, most notably Future Diary, but this is the first one I've seen with the yandere as the protagonist. And with it comes a psychological angle that few anime can match.The mainstream audience just doesn't get it. This isn't an easy watch. It plays...with the idea that immoral actions aren't done for the sake of being immoral. The characters truly believe that what they are doing is just, and feel that the social system they've tried to adhere to has failed them. It goes into the calculated logic and thinking behind every move. You're not supposed to like Satou. This show doesn't try to influence you one way or another; it just presents everything at face value. Even if you hate Satou the character, and are adamant that no one is above the law, the show makes you respect her thought process and internalization, as well as the psychological conditions of most of the supporting characters. And that's what matters.The sugary moments, juxtaposed with reality, are a work of art. As it's a cat-and-mouse thriller with one continuous story, I won't go into much of the details, but each episode left me wanting more and more. The cinematography during the flashbacks and internal monologues was fantastic. As everything is presented, it's up to the viewer to decide whether to root for certain characters, given their past and present actions.I'd say it'd get more hype if it weren't on Amazon only. A North American physical disc release isn't on the horizon, either, probably due to the subject matter.

Attempts to capitalize more on the fetishes of each introduced antagonist instead of actually writing a compelling story and creating characters that aren\'t so surface-level in both appearance and personality. I\'m all in for some crazy shenanigans involving a Yandere, but this is as basic as it gets, as in, there\'s other anime featuring Yandere that are way more refreshing or at least conceptually alluring than this shallow show.Wow, these characters are crazy! Wow, these characters are crazy! Wow... these characters are... stupid. Yeah, I know, can we get something new?This is not a slife-of-life or...comedy (this anime\'s attempts at humor fall flat), this is a show about a Yandere maintaining her Happy Sugar Life. How sweet. Except there\'s nothing remotely interesting about it. This anime is completely mediocre. The Yandere, Satou Matsuzaka, feels true love for the first time (very original) and decides to kidnap her beloved. Who is a child. Everything then falls into place and for some reason, Ms. Matsuzaka keeps meeting all these crazy weirdos who are surprisingly worse than her and all situations involving them feel contrived and pointless. As I was watching this anime, all I could think about was how can you side with the protagonist? There\'s no one you can actually truly root for.I like the Yandere type of character but this one is just shallow and uninspired. She\'s the sole driving force of whatever happens in the show and the perspective is usually around her but sweet Jesus, 99% of dialogue is stating how crazy she is and how much she dislikes people getting in the way of her love life. ""Bitter, I\'m going to go crazy, You don\'t know what true love feels like,"" is pretty much all she says. And all the other character\'s dialogue is absurd, too. There\'s a scene where a guy gets aroused from a little girl touching his hand, as if he\'s never felt physical contact from the opposite gender before, and I gotta ask. What\'s the point? Why? Why keep introducing all these messed up characters if none of them lack any depth or substance. They\'re personalities are cardboard cut-outs designed for weak conflict. The story is just filled with predictability and is too straightforward for its own good.That said, I\'m fine with the animation and sound. Those two aspects aren\'t much for trouble but they aren\'t the anime\'s saving grace either.All in all, I didn\'t like this. I was bored the whole time. I like trash. You know, anime like Overlord. But at least that\'s entertaining. This type of trash isn\'t. It takes itself too seriously and tries so hard to warrant a reaction from us because, look! Disgusting characters! Wow! And that\'s all there is. Nothing remarkable, nothing that makes it stand out apart from its Yandere-centered premise. Only curiosity could make you watch more.Five episodes have been out so far.

Most people might not agree with me, but from episode 1 i was hooked on this series. The way that this series manipulated the heart and mind is something that i have only experienced with a few series.Story: overall, while this story may not be for everyone, it does stay true to the theme of Psychological Thriller. The way that the story progresses had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.Art: This anime has a similar effect that Madoka...Magica had on me in terms of art. Its so beautifully colorful and bright tied with a very thick dark string. The way the art switches from this light and bubbly palette to a gritty jumble of thread really plays to the series.Sound: The sound just adds to the overall ambiance of the show, the soundtrack lends to the jump of emotions that this show conveys. the opening has a bit of foreshadowing in its tone (going from a cute little start then adding a bit of heavier rock tones)Character: This is where people might have problems? The relationship between that of the main characters could be seen as very manipulative and almost Stockholm esc in the beginning of the story. However, having each individual character have some sort of background that made their world not so pretty is something that really plays to each of the characters.OVERALL THIS ANIME IS AN ABSOLUTE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER OF A GREAT PIECE, i even got a bit emotional at the end. This anime isnt made for the faint of heart however, and i highly recommend if you are going to watch this to take into account that there are some very triggering topics in this anime (abuse being a very big one) However if you are ok with these things then this is a great anime to take the time to watch.

The relationship between that of the main characters could be seen as very manipulative and almost Stockholm esc in the beginning of the story. However, having each individual character have some sort of background that made their world not so pretty is something that really plays to each of the characters.OVERALL THIS ANIME IS AN ABSOLUTE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER OF A GREAT PIECE, i even got a bit emotional at the end. This anime isnt made for the faint of heart however, and i highly recommend if you are going to watch this to take into account that there are some very triggering topics in this anime (abuse being a very big one) However if you are ok with these things then this is a great anime to take the time to watch.', 'Oh wow, this anime is really not good. While I do understand the appeal, it\'s message definitely falls flat on its face. This anime is so ridiculous that I\'ve started referring to it as ""Epstein circle"", since there are FOUR PEDOPHILES which are all going to get the name Epstein.The biggest problem in this anime is that nothing happens, like, at all. Main character girl, Epstein #1, goes outside, does a bad, gets angry for 3 seconds and then happy again after thinking about her kidnapping victim, and comes home to a disgustingly forced child voice. The entire time we\'re subjected to painfully corny...lines about sugar, sweets, jars and other things that might\'ve been interesting the first time, but become dreadful in the last episode. Other characters also don\'t spare you from the awful monologues and their interactions are just cringe worthy.Speaking of characters, they aren\'t anything to write home about. Epstein #1 is just a basic yandere template you see in Yuno Gasai and doesn\'t change at all throughout the story, she remains the same character from episode 1 to episode 12. Her plot armour makes her basically immune to anyone\'s physical attacks since apparently she\'s a fucking medusa and freezes her foes on the spot because she\'s just too spooky! Then there\'s the child she abducted, who\'s voice is so shreeky that it\'s not cute, it makes me want to beat the shit out of her. Although she had only ONE fight with her abductor that could\'ve been interesting, she gets over it in about 5 seconds. Next up is Hida Shouko who is just... there? For most of the anime. She does catch Epstein #1 but somehow gets dragged into the apartment without resistance, where she has a dramatic moment trying to convince the main character to let the victim go...! But wait, we can\'t hear what she\'s saying because the priority was clearly the sad anime background music. Then we have the blonde Epstein #3, who after getting sexually assaulted by his manager Epstein #2, also starts wanting to diddle kids (I\'m pretty sure sexual assault victims would be offended by this character). While it is entertaining to see how much the writers can butcher such a sensitive topic, making him scream and drool like an idiot, I don\'t think it\'s really accurate or relatable to someone who did go through something similar. Another pedo in this circle is the teacher, Epstein #4, who only serves the purpose of smiling creepily and just sits there. And the final notable character is Asahi Koube, who is in comparison to others, the only one who goes through any character development throughout the story. From uselessly putting up flyers for his missing sister (and getting beat up in a park) to taking things into his own hands in the final few episodes. Although he\'s not as 1-dimentional as the other characters, he\'s really not much. I was more invested in the random background extras than any of these shmucks.Now the themes of this anime are quite contradictory. At one hand it says, as clear as day ""Adults shouldn\'t be having relationships with children"", and on the other it portrays what Epstein #1 is doing as something mutually benefitial for the victim and the abductor. Just because the main character is a ""cute uwu psycho girl"" doesn\'t mean its fucking okay to have these relationships with teenagers who know so much more than the child does. If it wanted to say ""pedophilia bad"" then it did a really bad job at it, since I got the opposite impression. Good message, but also pretty fucking common sense.The only way to enjoy this anime is if you view it as a hate-watch, since tying to take it seriously is going to give you face-palm moments like you\'ve never seen, especially since lying in this anime is totally useless because everyone who is immune to plot just has spidey senses as to when someone lies.2/10, not good but its not 1/10 at least.

I genuinely enjoy happy sugar life for it's ability to display a visual and auditory representation of what it feels like to experience trauma, to be triggered and to feel certain ways that aren't typically discussed. Any kind of trigger that one might have is almost guaranteed in here. There's pedophilia, rape, abandonment, physical abuse, mental abuse, murder and way more that I probably just can't think of off the top of my head. If you're someone with traumatic experiences and you can't deal with them being mentioned then I strongly...advise against watching this HOWEVER the representations of trauma are scarily accurate and it's somewhat reassuring to see others go through or have the same reactions.Happy sugar life has an amazing story that is the most true to the horror genera that I've probably ever seen, it's realistic in a way that it could almost pass as a drama. While the art style and animation is mediocre I still genuinely enjoy it. The lining is unique for when it came out and the visual effects as I said before are outstanding despite being relatively simple. The voice acting is amazing and the audio effects they use for emphasis do a great job at portraying certain feelings. The characters are the only thing about this show that I think fall flat. While the designs are cute they are very simple, admittedly like most of the other things in the show besides the story. The characters themselves are somewhat summarized by their traumas which in a way gives them depth but by no means fleshes them out all the way. I personally don't have any trauma but all my friends that have watched this that do found it extremely reassuring when all was said and done but it definitely took a lot out of them for a good while.That being said I enjoyed it myself. This show is not about the lolicon complex or the yuri relationship. This show, in my opinion, is about trauma and having tendencies that are viewed as unacceptable socially. This show is astounding for it's ability to cover topics that aren't typically talked about and in a very tasteful and understandable way.Thanks for coming to my ted talk. advise against watching this HOWEVER the representations of trauma are scarily accurate and it's somewhat reassuring to see others go through or have the same reactions.Happy sugar life has an amazing story that is the most true to the horror genera that I've probably ever seen, it's realistic in a way that it could almost pass as a drama.

In my opinion, when it comes to making the viewer uneasy, HSL is a masterpiece.It treats the psychological drama of its character through the codes of horror, and it does it well as I was always extremely tensed when I watched every episode.But the most impressive thing is that they managed to make a show that doesn't let you breathe at ALL. The comfort-zone of the anime is supposed to be Shio and Satou's castle, but their relationship looks so unreal, both in...its visual treatment than in its nature, that it feels like it can collapse at anytime or turn into something horrific, which make the comfort-zone yet another uncomfortable place.Another thing that I found to be unique is the use of pedophilia as a vector of horror and discomfort. If you had any doubt about it, HSL isn't a lolicon show and there is no place for fantasy or gruesome fan-service here ; nothing is shown but pain and tears. HSL simply figured out there was no need for fantasy to feature monsters. And a lot of them : again, you won't find a character to rely on or empathize with to feel at ease.To be honest, every episode was very hard to watch emotionally for me and I wouldn't feel that good after it. Do I regret having watched this show ? Maybe. Yet it is definitely in my top 10 of the best anime when it comes to originality and top 5 when it comes to the emotional impact. How would I put it ; it's a show I can enjoy for its 'artistic' value, but it's nothing fun and pleasant.

This is what happens throughout the story which is to me makes the story...interesting. It also develops the story arc which can fully change towards the end depending on how the characters act.Although I would want to say more about the story , I wouldn‚Äôt want to accidentally add in spoilers so I‚Äôm just going to end the review here.Overall , the story part of the anime is great and contributed greatly to the anime.ArtThe art of the anime to me can reflect off the story of the anime , the reason why I say that is because the art style can both get off a ‚Äúcute and dark‚Äù vibe to it.

IF YOU DO NOT AN OPEN MIND TOWARDS THESE MATTERS, THEN THIS SHOW AIN'T IT CHIEF.Now for those with an open mind, I would potentialluy crown Happy Sugar Life in the run for Anime of the Year (not including sequels) and what it essentially came down to was the writing of the show for me.To begin, Happy Sugar Life accomplished something that (based on my viewings was few and far in between) is that...it was capable of keeping me on edge on what the story will end with. A decent chunk of the characters (think Satou and Asahi) who had equally just motivations to stay with Shio; so much so that throughout the second half of the series, I was genuienely wondering how it would end.Secondly, Happy Sugar Life manages to evoke an empathetic and positive response to the majority of the characters who on paper, should have been universally on my shame list. The writers were so effective at this that I wanted Satou to have Shio in her arms at the end of it who is the same character that has commited multiple acts of homicide and ya know WANTS TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ACTUAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GIRL.Thirdly, Happy Sugar Life doesn't allow the tropes of Yuri and Large Age Gap  relationship anime to define it. The relationship that grows and flourished between Satou and Shio never devloves into the sexual mess that both realtionships seem to bring with it. It took till the endof the series and writing this review to register that it was a yuri relationship with a large age gap.All in all, I enjoyed the ride this series offered me. My only real complaint about the series is the level of edge the show carries which is minor issue. If this series could be compared to any series I've watched, it would be Scum's Wish, but with the edge and psychological factor cranked up.8.5/10: Would watch again, reccomend to friends, and financially support. it was capable of keeping me on edge on what the story will end with.

Having interesting ideas or main characters' designs don't mean you can bypass any criticizing about your bad directions, horrible story pacing, awful dialogues, nonsensical progressions and back and forth developments. Even though, the ideas and designs alone can make many viewers feeling impressive and satisfy so much that they say this is the best psychology-horror-thriller-action series of the year. This isn't fully wrong by the way. This series is 3/4 bad and 1/4 good. So first, look take a look at the good things that this series can give you some satisfactions before the...criticizing part that will butcher the horribleness of this series later.Main casts both small one and pink hair one are very well presented and designed in a way that can make interesting story progressions and developments. Both characters have very interesting dynamical and back stories along out the entire serie. What the serie want to archive about the love and relationship are extremely successful today. I won't be surprised if someone say they only watch Happy Sugar Life because of these two characters. The sweet moments. The sad moments. The decision moments. The hardness moments. The lovely moments. All of these are the most interesting in Happy Sugar Life. But sadly, there are just only small parts of the series that really show the aspects of relationship between these main casts. Also, family domestic violence and their influences in this serie are very well presented. Some people may say these are also the cringe and edgy parts of the series. But I kind of disagree as if we only discuss about main casts now, these aspects of presentation really do their best in building and creating backstories and personality for main casts. Small one is really good in portraying the role of child who having hard mental issues and nearly go insane, which later meet with pink hair one who also having family issues about anyone treat her only an object. (This is the bad part of the story not because pink hair's role but because other support characters' role) When pink hair and small one meet each others, the dynamical and sharing of love, pain, sweetness, and warmth between these two characters can be seen in such a wonderful way.Others than what I say above, everything in this serie are badly designed, terribly executed and weirdly used. Let's discuss about the things that make this serie completely unwatchable and I don't want to recommend this serie to anyone based my opinion.1.) About the basic plot execution problem such as it doesn't make sense, it just kind of happened and it can tell you but it won't the series. Characters and events are purposely being stupid and hypocrite as much as possible with no sole purpose or reason to do it. This serie has a lot of conveniences for characters and events to meet in order for plot progression without any subtlety. Last but not least, the way mysterious theme work is that it's the type of series where it won't let viewers to know or understand anything until it reach at some point. Viewers don't even need to think and predict anything along out the series. Nothing give any clues and informations at all.2.) Overall, I don't personally like the morals of this series. I feel like this serie is some kind of bias. Everything born and design to be bad. No good deed person or voice of a reason at all in this series. Every plots and scenes have to reflect unnecessary amount of dark story in our societies without any redemptions or ways to reflect the other sides of coins. (good side of the world and society) Also, main morals and stories in each episodes almost look the same for the most of times. The story always begin with MC meeting with some crazy guys, problems occur not so long after that, mystery (plot) begin to reveal with annoying trauma and PTSD sequences and end with cliffhangers where viewer don‚Äôt actually know what are actually conclusions and morals.3.) Around 80% of the dialogues are actually pretty horrible. For instance, these dialogues are annoying and ruin the atmosphere of well directed story pacing. Many characters talk nonsense and repeat what they‚Äôre actually said and think in the previous minutes for no reason. Also these dialogues are pointless and telling nothing important to the story at all. Viewers can easily tell the story even if their ears close but the serie are still needlessly to tell things they notice from the background or presentation or hidden message again which ruin the mystery and complication of the plot later.4.) Repetition of a lot of presentations and storytellings in each scenes and episodes are kind of annoying and irritation most of the time because they‚Äôre telling things viewers already seen and known for so many times with the sole purpose of showing characters and plot tones‚Äô frustration, depression, fear, psychological factors and other negative emotions which later (kind of) destroy the creativity and uniqueness of presentations and storytellings style in both short and long runs. This can be very boring as nothing significantly going on and consume a lot of viewing times.5.) I personally don't like how this serie handle the supporting characters at all. This serie has one of the worst supporting characters‚Äô design during the entire year. Characters‚Äô designs and their roles are so obnoxiously pandering to the maximum limit. Every single one of them are so much stereotypical and born to be bad (or weirdly good) person without any subtlety, building or even a reasons why they are so bad nothing good coming from them to begin with. They are shape-shifting characters where they can be anything in order to satisfy viewers or built the plot in the most convenient way possible. No dynamic. No redemption. Nothing in these characters. Around 90% of the entire casts are useless, has no impact and built significantly nothing in order for plot and story developments and progressions. Most of the cast are there so the serie could have a ‚Äòplot‚Äô for main cast to do something. Cutting them out from the serie would change nothing in the meanings, progressions and conclusions.And that is actually how I feel about Happy Sugar Life. Sometime, it is such a bittersweet feeling for us to actually believe that good main characters like small one and pink hair are ruined by pretty much everything in the series. That is unfortunate. In the end, I can't base the series by two characters alone. I don't watch Happy Sugar Life just for 2-3 episodes in the beginning and in the end. I watch all of them. This will be a useless viewing experience if I watch this series only for those two right ? So in the future, what is the difference between watching this series and reading a fan fiction then ? I think Happy Sugar Life should be Happy Sugar Life. Not Small One and Pink Hair life stories.The final score is 2/10. 2 comes from the two main casts, small one and pink hair one. Cutting 8/10 because those elements of bad directions and terrible designs are unacceptable and ruining my days of enjoying the lovely cringe cliche' and edgy yuri couple. criticizing part that will butcher the horribleness of this series later.Main casts both small one and pink hair one are very well presented and designed in a way that can make interesting story progressions and developments.

Nothing in these characters. Around 90% of the entire casts are useless, has no impact and built significantly nothing in order for plot and story developments and progressions. Most of the cast are there so the serie could have a ‚Äòplot‚Äô for main cast to do something. Cutting them out from the serie would change nothing in the meanings, progressions and conclusions.And that is actually how I feel about Happy Sugar Life. Sometime, it is such a bittersweet feeling for us to actually believe that good main characters like small one and pink hair are ruined by pretty much everything in the series. That is unfortunate. In the end, I can't base the series by two characters alone. I don't watch Happy Sugar Life just for 2-3 episodes in the beginning and in the end. I watch all of them. This will be a useless viewing experience if I watch this series only for those two right ? So in the future, what is the difference between watching this series and reading a fan fiction then ? I think Happy Sugar Life should be Happy Sugar Life. Not Small One and Pink Hair life stories.The final score is 2/10. 2 comes from the two main casts, small one and pink hair one. Cutting 8/10 because those elements of bad directions and terrible designs are unacceptable and ruining my days of enjoying the lovely cringe cliche' and edgy yuri couple."", 'At first I had plans to drop this but for some reason I went against that and decided to finish it anyways, do I regret it? No, but I wouldn\'t say it was worth the time I wasted to watch it.STORY/CHARACTERS:The plot is basically about a pink haired girl named Satou  that is a (((non offending))) pedophile, who kidnapped a small child named Shio that she has groomed into becoming her emotional escape in life. The pink haired girl is also homicidal , has a crazy aunt, and is very psychopathic.Unfortunately, she is not the only character with serious mental issues and she\'s...not even the ONLY pedophile. There are 4 pedophiles in this anime, one is a teacher, one is a manager who raped a teenager who became a pedophile as well, and our anti-hero protagonist.Not a single character within this anime is remotely sane either. This gets really old, really fast. Even the only ""pure"" (according to the anime) character which is the child clearly has behavioral traits similar to developing sociopaths.Many aspects of the story makes it hard for me feel immersed what so ever due to how absurd and unrealistic it is. Almost everything that happens in this would never happen in real life scenario, especially in terms how undetected everything is regarding the murders committed and how it is dealt with along with the behavior of these characters. It is just crazy and in a laughably bad way. I understand this is a piece of fiction but if you can not even make your world believable, then you can not make the viewer feel much at all aside from annoyance of how lousy the world building is.SOUND: it\'s just there, ok? And it\'s like, who cares- there\'s nothing special about it but it is also not intrusive.ART: Super generic modern anime looking. Like the music, there\'s nothing going for it, the character designs are from a million anime you have seen before. You won\'t find anything eye catching here artistically speaking. In regards of its animation, it does its minimal job in showing movement.ENJOYMENT: Barely. I basically watched it like I was watching a car accident in super slow motion. You already know it\'s going to end horribly, but you just want to see how the collision goes.OVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS:I\'m surprised people would call this a \'horror\' anime, as it is not scary at all, just disturbing and unpleasant as we have to watch this yandere pink haired monster get away with murders and keeping a child that she has romantic feelings for inside of her apartment. The real horror is how horribly bad this anime is.There are far better psychological horror anime out there, this is one to give it a hard miss, you\'re not missing anything unless you\'re a creepy pedophile using lolicon/shotacon content as a form of escape, or a person who is very desperate to watch some sort of \'disturbing\' content when the only really morbid thing is the pedophilia which is grossly sugar coated and romanticized (at least from the protagonist\'s view)Watch it if you want to laugh at how bad it is, but that\'s all you should watch it for , really. not even the ONLY pedophile.

How does it look like? How many shapes does it have? Is everything justifiable if it is in the name of love?Everyone has a different answer to the question what love is, based on their entire life. This anime works with this, everyone in this show has another form of love. But the catch is, almost everyone is crazy like shit, and in return has some crazy form of love.The story is simple, our main character is Satou she has pink hair, and if you are familiar with anime then you should know that pink hairs are always the biggest red flag...you can possibly find. She seems like a good and innocent girl, she talks about how happy she is with her boyfriend. But then you get to see that her boyfriend is actually a little girl half her age. We are talking about an 8-year difference, so Satou is 16 and her ""boyfriend"", Shio is 8.At this point, many people condemn this show, but for me, this is where it really started. You would think that this relationship can never function, but the show suggests that it is indeed possibly.Later in the first episode we get to learn that Shio is a missing child. But she does seem happy, she never seems like she is unhappy or even missing her family. So, what happened to her? Is she being controlled by Satou? Is she just pretending or is she indeed not missing her family and is happy with Satou?These were the initial questions that kept me interested in the show. I wanted to know what happens to them, but there were so much more great things about this show, that really had an impact.Many people do not like the majority of the characters, because of how disgusting some of them are. But I think that the inner conflict and mental issues are very good portrayed. Almost every character has a trauma of some kind, and how they work out is very good. Every character has scars, they either they are there from the beginning, or the develop over the course of the show. They are exaggerated, yes, but I think that this is one of the best things in this show. I will go into depth of my favorite character trauma later on, because that would spoil way too much, so you can skip it if you want to.So, what does this have to do with love?Like I said, every character has a different meaning of love, and the show goes all the way out to show all different kinds of love these characters have. But the elephant in the room is with no doubt the love between Shio and Satou. I feel like every person has a different opinion on the question if this can really be considered love. It is a harsh topic, and I will explain my opinion on this topic at the end, with a spoiler mark.But if you accept it, you will think a lot about it. I said earlier that every person has a different answer about love, based on their entire life, this is one of these shows where you start to think about your concept of love, because for me, it definitely was a reason to think about it.Let‚Äôs move on to the music and soundtrack, to cool down a little bit.You know that a soundtrack is great, when you don\'t even notice the music played in the background during an intense scene. It really helps creating a feeling of despair, sadness, or even happiness, when needed. The best example for a great choice of music is episode 9 I would say. Easily a great choice of music in my eyes. The same goes for the opening and the ending, both are very good, and you know what this anime is about just by watching the opening.What I loved the most about this show. *(spoiler)*I recommend you to not read this part if you still need to watch the show, because I will spoil the hell out of you in this part. You can start reading at the end of spoilers mark.My favorite part in this show is definitely Shio and her character development. At first, she didn‚Äôt was a complete character, with a reason. She had a trauma which she forgot, and that made her incomplete. But the more you dive into this show, the more she fights her trauma, and in the end, she remembers everything. She remembers her true family, the reason why she lives with Satou in the first place, and that was the moment I thought she would turn against Satou, but that wasn\'t the case. Her trauma was basically her entire life, she couldn\'t go to school. Her mother wouldn\'t allow her to go outside because of the fear that her abusive father might find her. When she even put a foot outside, she was yelled at, and even got hit. In the end, her mother abandoned her on the streets. In that moment, Shio was mentally completely lost. I mean, she was an 8-year-old that had never seen another person besides her family, and that family abandoned her. But the person who gave her a home was Satou, many people misbelief that Satou kidnapped Shio, but that wasn\'t the case. Satou basically saved her. Furthermore, Shio had the best time in her life with Satou.So instead of going back to her family, she chooses to be with Satou, because why would she want to go back to a family that let her alone all by herself in the rain? Shio is even willing to spend the rest of her life with Satou, and they vow to one another to ever be there for one another. When Shio is confronted with her brother in the last episode, she has completely free will if she wants to be with Satou or her brother, and she still chooses Satou. In the end, there is no escape for the two of them, and in that moment, it is Shio\'s wish to die together with Satou. But Satou sacrifices her life to save Shio, because she doesn\'t want that the only person, she ever truly loved dies.In the aftermath, Shio survived and Satou died, Shio was once again traumatized by the fact that Satou didn\'t let Shios last wish to die together come true. And Shio became a psycho herself, by adopting a lot of Satous character traits, so much that Shios brother didn\'t saw Shio in that moment, he saw Satou, and Satou was definitely a psycho. I think it is safe to say that Shio is the true protagonist, and Happy Sugar Life is the story about her being thrown away by her family, then finding her true place in the world with the only person that really cares about her only to being betrayed once more. Leaving a mentally wreck behind that will most probably go on a killing spree in a few years.So, was that really love? Can you call that relationship love? Like I said, there are more opinions on that topic then I care to count, because for me the answer is clear as day. For me, it definitely was love. Let my quickly explain why. Most people argument that Satou kidnapped Shio, but that wasn\'t the case. Then, Satou never did anything bad to Shio, she did her best to make her happy, and she never laid hand on her ever. And if you get to know Satous backstory, it gets really clear that Satou loved Shio as a person, she wasn\'t a pedo, a common misbelief in my opinion. On the other side, Shio felt the same way for Satou, that is also very clear if you listen to the dialogue carefully. Furthermore, Shio was more happy being with Satou then being with her own family. The only thing I would let slide is that Shio isn\'t mentally mature. But I think if they would been the same age, the story, the message and a lot of other things would go away. And I think that they would still love each other in this scenario. Judge me if you want, I\'ll stick to my opinion. But this discussion if it really was love or not, is something I like about this show too, I like it if you can share your opinions about something controversial like that, these discussions sure are fun and an important part of that show to me.What I missed for a 10/10 *(end of spoilers)*If you skipped the last part because of spoilers, welcome back. You are save now. I will now list a few things that annoyed me in this show. One thing that annoyed me is part of the story, so I will make it clear when I talk about that point, the rest is spoiler free.To be honest, there were only three things that really annoyed me while watching this show. The first thing is that almost every character in this show is insane to some degree. It would have been nice to have more normal characters. The second thing is that the anime skipped a few things from the manga. Normally I don\'t really care if an anime skips over some unimportant stuff, but here it was a lot of details that made a teeny tiny difference. I don\'t really know why, but I enjoyed reading the manga more than I enjoyed watching the anime. Like I said, the anime only skipped a few details, so no big deal, but still. These were just a few minor details, but they made a difference to me.*Spoiler* skip to the conclusion for no spoilersThe last thing that annoyed me the most was that Satou forgot her ring in the last episode. They were about to go away and life their new live somewhere else, but Satou forgot her ring, so they needed to go back. I hated that moment so much, because it is so out of character. Satou values her relationship with Shio more than her own life, and that ring was a symbol of that love, there is no way she would ever forget something that important. Double points for the fact that neither Shio nor her aunt noticed the missing ring.My conclusionI think this is a heavily underrated show. I\'ve seen only a few shows that are capable of really making me rethink some of my perspectives about life, and this is such a show (maybe it\'s just because I\'m a psycho myself, idontknow). I also enjoyed that this show was brave enough to take a taboo subject as his main story, the discussions lead from that subject are very interesting and fun. I can definitely recommend this show to you, but please don\'t judge it just because of the subject the story is taking. If you don\'t like the theme, so be it. you can possibly find.

I can definitely recommend this show to you, but please don\'t judge it just because of the subject the story is taking. If you don\'t like the theme, so be it.', 'As strange as it may seem, Happy Sugar Life is a very important anime to me. Not insofar as relation the main cast, or having a personal understanding of the cycle of abuse or domestic violence, but as one of the first expressions in anime that I had seen and could say ""this holds up"" in comparisons to similar shows or even movies in the same psychological vein. I am a cynic, and I got into anime very late, only around the time this came out in 2018. I didn\'t know what to think of the medium for a long time, but I came across...HSL through a yuri account I was following at the time, and very quickly got swept into the show. Frankly, I didn\'t know what to expect, but what I got was not what was advertised. Happy Sugar Life can be an extremely difficult show to come to terms with on conceptual grounds, as off the top, its very difficult not to see Satou as the immediate bad guy in a bit of hyper exaggerated anime psych horror schlock. But underneath that surface is a a veritable treasure trove, with masterful pacing, a complex and invariably intriguing protagonist, and a show that really commits to the unblemished perspective of its conflicted, albeit exaggerated, main characters.Story: 9As far as I am concerned the story is nigh perfect, mostly because of its pacing. Great pacing can patch over a lot of things, and while of course not every little detail is like, true to life accurate, it really doesn\'t need to be. It needs to work in its context. Now, to the content itself. The central lever of the story is Shio Koube, a wayward child inexplicably left in the care of the unstable and dangerous Satou Matsuzaka, with an undefined romantic element between the two. That is really the entire setup, which off the top presents the audience with the uncomfortably enticing mystery of ""what the hell this is?"". Is Satou a kidnapper, a murderer, a pedophile, unhinged, holding her for ransom? Now a lotta people would say off the top, there It is, she\'s obviously a pedophile, as that\'s the only option that really fits the setup in the wider social context, but those people are missing the point, and disregarding much of the context. But in any case its grey, its a weird and vaguely unethical situation that could not possibly play out positively. In fact that\'s even explicitly shown from the beginning, the very first shot shows that this can end in nothing but tragedy, but while a worse show would probably make it a much schlockier and violent road to the inevitable heartbreak, Happy Sugar Life is very selective with what it exaggerates and what it tries to approach with some nuance. At the end of the day it is not another over the top pink haired yandere massacre show, but a story that really has something to say about interpersonal bonds and cycles of abuse. I only dock a point because you can really tell that the show jumped the manga with the ending, and as a result the character motivations become a little bit muddled heading into the final episode. But its still excellent and poignant.Art: 9I love the look of Happy Sugar Life. It does not have the highest budget, the most creative character design, or the most visually appealing color pallet, but I would argue it has some of the best direction. The show really understands how to get across its points visually, showing emotion and contrast through subtleties within the presentation. Many people peg the show as a psychological horror, but that\'s really not a correct assessment. HSL is not particularly scary, or really trying to be. But at the end of the day it is undoubtedly psychological. While at times it can overuse the psychological static and spirals, I really think the purposeful sickly sweet color coding of scenes with Shio contrasted with the grittier scenes of Satou struggling with bitterness is brilliant. There\'s so much focus on the eyes of the characters, in either their design or their presentation, and the show really plays with different ways to show character\'s states of mind through their eyes. Satou and her aunt are particularly great on this front, there are still shots of the aunt\'s eyes that instill real genuine panic in me. The best thing that Happy Sugar Life does through telling its story through the perspectives of its characters is the visual presentation of their mental states. The four main characters are all psychologically broken, but each have different ways of visualizing the key to normalcy and the ways that their traumas have effected them. Shio will say that she\'s spinning, and the attached visuals will make me feel mentally like I\'m in just as much of a mental tailspin as her, because I have just as much context as she does as to what the hell happened to her. The telling of the story through the character perspective elevates the story through that perspective, as it twists from an overarching plot to something personal, something driven by these characters with reason. You can really feel the conviction and the desperation in the characters through what the show presents from their worldview, its incredible. I saw the show before I did the manga, and frankly their were some scenes of Satou\'s mental state that were so effective visually that I didn\'t even understand how it could\'ve been translated from a source, like they were so well implemented that it felt more natural in animation than it could possibly had been as a manga panel. Its not how the art of Happy Sugar Life looks that makes it stand out, but its in what the show does with it.Sound: 9I will not lie, much of the sound within the show itself is fairly forgettable, the effects, in episode themes, and even ED are fine, not bad, just not much to write home about. The OP, however, is absolutely phenomenal on every front, from music to animation to progression, its basically the platonic ideal of what an anime opening should be. The song itself, One Room Sugar Life by Nanawoakari, is an infectious and darkly energetic banger that 100% stands on its own, and probably one of my favorite OP songs ever. Furthermore the OP song and animation sort of tell the story through their progression, they present an intimate understanding of the show in and of themselves. The ED is a bit bland though, I tend to skip it. Past that, the voice acting is truly exceptional. More than anything else, I feel like everyone really went for it. Taiyo in particular, his character is the closest to being used just for comedic effect, but he sounds genuinely unhinged in his pursuit of Shio, it really heightens the character. HanaKana is surprisingly understated in the role of a driven unstable high schooler, but nonetheless her performance is stellar, and very fitting to the role. Her and Shio have great chemistry, and Shio\'s VA really sells her as just the most adorable angel, its not exactly hard to imagine why all these characters are struggling so hard to reach her, even if all of their intentions are hard to specifically empathize with in a vacuum. Really, if you\'re going to do an exaggerated reality with exaggerated characters, you need your voice actors to ratchet up the performances, and Happy Sugar Life certainly delivers.Characters: 9This is where I think many people would differ. Satou is a very divisive character, you either buy into her conviction and root for her as the protagonist through her faults, or you refuse to see past the fact she kidnapped a child and that\'s that. Personally I love Satou, I think she\'s an excellent and far more realized interpretation of the yandere type than anything else I\'ve seen. She\'s in a constant struggle against her own nature and background, not impulsive, but extremely exact and conniving. For a yandere, her body count is not really that high, and even then its not like she relishes having to take care of business for Shio\'s sake, its really only out of necessity, when her various failsafes have all for whatever reason been breached. She barely understands her own connection to Shio, only that it keeps away the hollow bitterness that permeates all of her interpersonal relationships (which makes the conclusion all the more impactful). Shio herself is barely a character for much of the show, purposefully, as the show understands that she is, to all of her adherents, a tool. Once she realizes that herself, she develops into a character alongside Satou, with the power to make her own decisions for her own motivations. They make a strong pair of protagonists, but past that is a lineup of largely over the top side characters, Taiyo in particular. Him, Satou and Shio\'s brother all put forth different interpretations of Shio\'s value through their actions, and all of them have an even more deranged adult over them that has shaped their own hyperbolic reality. These backstories can be a little bit flimsy, like the case of Taiyo being raped into being a pedophile (sounds like a very strange concept for a character that is the closest thing to a joke the show has to offer, but hey, its used for the effect, not to mock rape victims or something, he\'s at the beginning of his own cycle of abuse), but the main two are strong, and present valid cases against this grey zone of Shio\'s custody. The great thing here is that as the story goes along, there\'s not much reaction from the characters, Satou is actively plotting while the other characters, driven by their own motivations, are seeking their own way to their own objectives. The only character I don\'t particularly like, controversially, is Shouko, as she is both the most normal, and least driven of the central character group. It pains me to see many people rally behind her as a standout, for the sole point of being the most normal in this hyper normal fictional setting, but that\'s outside of the context of the show. Nevertheless it has shaped my interpretation of the character, which leads back to the point of social interpretation at large. As much as art at large is subjective, there is objectivity in everything. HSL exists to tell a grey story, with characters who do immoral things based on their unique worldview, without an overarching narrative voice explicitly trying to take a side. You are supposed to be caught up in their psychological perceptions, the representations of their moral and personal strivings. To utterly reject any of these characters, Satou in particular, for a hasty, overarching judgement of their character in totality for fictional wrongdoings that fit their perspective, is missing the point on an objective level, in my estimation. But I digress. I quite enjoy what Happy Sugar Life does with each of its characters, and the consistency they all hold with their perspectives in their actions.Enjoyment: 10Happy Sugar Life is not the kind of show I would say you have to turn your brain off to have to enjoy, but it is one where I\'d say there\'s a buy in. You have to suspend disbelief and stop asking why anyone\'s not calling the cops, because frankly no one wants to see some kinda lame ass shit where Shio gets put in foster care and everyone goes to court. That\'d make for a real exciting and engaging piece of fiction, no doubt. Anywho, once you buy in, it is a blast. There are very few shows I binge, not because I dislike television, but just because I ask myself what I could otherwise be doing with my time. 12 episodes, or even multiple seasons, is a very large ask time wise, and really has to be something especially engaging for me to say that ""I gotta see the next episode"" after every single one. Happy Sugar Life had me so hooked that I told myself I couldn\'t binge it, and then went back to finish it within like an hour. The pacing is so excellent, leaving you having to know what happens next, where does it all fall apart, WHERE THE HELL IS SHIO, after every episode. Up until the somewhat rushed ending at least, but that\'s mostly the setup, the ending itself is essentially what I what call perfect. Add onto the pacing that the OP is so good you could put it on repeat for hours and never stop chanting along with the chorus, and time starts to fly when Happy Sugar Life gets rolling. But even as it does so, it is not only one 12 episode season, but a fully contained season and narrative. Everything ends in 12 episodes, with minimal (important) loose ends and no unresolved plot lines. I respect a narrative that has the balls to end itself, and Happy Sugar Life holds no designs on stretching its plot as thin as it could for another season. Happy Sugar Life also has one of my favorite episodes of television point blank, specifically episode 8, where context is finally given to Satou and Shio\'s state of living. Its obtuse, its tragic, its eyes-glued-to-the-screen content, and you can drink up every second. Its so good that Satou\'s old flame doesn\'t even have to speak, which in and of itself is a brilliant and memorable to portray the perspective of a character. I love it to death, simple as.Overall:Happy Sugar Life, very strangely, has cemented itself as my favorite show of any genre or medium, a position from which I have tried to dislodge it. I\'ve rewatched it several times, thinking there\'s no way it could live up to my expectations, and get dragged in every time. I think I could literally talk for days on end about HSL and still have it rattle around in my brain, its a show that really grabs you and refuses to let go. At the end of the day, I am thankful. Happy Sugar Life showed me what anime was capable of, and while there tend not to be many shows in its same exact vein, it has led me to exceptional media I never would have touched without it. Happy Sugar Life was my gateway to the entirety of the medium, and for that it will always hold a special place for me. Alongside the fact that I think its one of the best things ever put to animation, but that\'s neither here nor there. Happy Sugar Life is more than a simple lolicon Yuri show, or a pink haired yandere psych horror, or a schlocky shounen murderfest. Give it a shot, go with its flow, and it will reward you. HSL through a yuri account I was following at the time, and very quickly got swept into the show. Frankly, I didn\'t know what to expect, but what I got was not what was advertised. Happy Sugar Life can be an extremely difficult show to come to terms with on conceptual grounds, as off the top, its very difficult not to see Satou as the immediate bad guy in a bit of hyper exaggerated anime psych horror schlock. But underneath that surface is a a veritable treasure trove, with masterful pacing, a complex and invariably intriguing protagonist, and a show that really commits to the unblemished perspective of its conflicted, albeit exaggerated, main characters.Story: 9As far as I am concerned the story is nigh perfect, mostly because of its pacing. Great pacing can patch over a lot of things, and while of course not every little detail is like, true to life accurate, it really doesn\'t need to be. It needs to work in its context. Now, to the content itself. The central lever of the story is Shio Koube, a wayward child inexplicably left in the care of the unstable and dangerous Satou Matsuzaka, with an undefined romantic element between the two. That is really the entire setup, which off the top presents the audience with the uncomfortably enticing mystery of ""what the hell this is?"". Is Satou a kidnapper, a murderer, a pedophile, unhinged, holding her for ransom? Now a lotta people would say off the top, there It is, she\'s obviously a pedophile, as that\'s the only option that really fits the setup in the wider social context, but those people are missing the point, and disregarding much of the context. But in any case its grey, its a weird and vaguely unethical situation that could not possibly play out positively. In fact that\'s even explicitly shown from the beginning, the very first shot shows that this can end in nothing but tragedy, but while a worse show would probably make it a much schlockier and violent road to the inevitable heartbreak, Happy Sugar Life is very selective with what it exaggerates and what it tries to approach with some nuance. At the end of the day it is not another over the top pink haired yandere massacre show, but a story that really has something to say about interpersonal bonds and cycles of abuse. I only dock a point because you can really tell that the show jumped the manga with the ending, and as a result the character motivations become a little bit muddled heading into the final episode. But its still excellent and poignant.Art: 9I love the look of Happy Sugar Life. It does not have the highest budget, the most creative character design, or the most visually appealing color pallet, but I would argue it has some of the best direction. The show really understands how to get across its points visually, showing emotion and contrast through subtleties within the presentation. Many people peg the show as a psychological horror, but that\'s really not a correct assessment. HSL is not particularly scary, or really trying to be. But at the end of the day it is undoubtedly psychological. While at times it can overuse the psychological static and spirals, I really think the purposeful sickly sweet color coding of scenes with Shio contrasted with the grittier scenes of Satou struggling with bitterness is brilliant. There\'s so much focus on the eyes of the characters, in either their design or their presentation, and the show really plays with different ways to show character\'s states of mind through their eyes. Satou and her aunt are particularly great on this front, there are still shots of the aunt\'s eyes that instill real genuine panic in me. The best thing that Happy Sugar Life does through telling its story through the perspectives of its characters is the visual presentation of their mental states. The four main characters are all psychologically broken, but each have different ways of visualizing the key to normalcy and the ways that their traumas have effected them. Shio will say that she\'s spinning, and the attached visuals will make me feel mentally like I\'m in just as much of a mental tailspin as her, because I have just as much context as she does as to what the hell happened to her. The telling of the story through the character perspective elevates the story through that perspective, as it twists from an overarching plot to something personal, something driven by these characters with reason. You can really feel the conviction and the desperation in the characters through what the show presents from their worldview, its incredible. I saw the show before I did the manga, and frankly their were some scenes of Satou\'s mental state that were so effective visually that I didn\'t even understand how it could\'ve been translated from a source, like they were so well implemented that it felt more natural in animation than it could possibly had been as a manga panel. Its not how the art of Happy Sugar Life looks that makes it stand out, but its in what the show does with it.Sound: 9I will not lie, much of the sound within the show itself is fairly forgettable, the effects, in episode themes, and even ED are fine, not bad, just not much to write home about. The OP, however, is absolutely phenomenal on every front, from music to animation to progression, its basically the platonic ideal of what an anime opening should be. The song itself, One Room Sugar Life by Nanawoakari, is an infectious and darkly energetic banger that 100% stands on its own, and probably one of my favorite OP songs ever. Furthermore the OP song and animation sort of tell the story through their progression, they present an intimate understanding of the show in and of themselves. The ED is a bit bland though, I tend to skip it. Past that, the voice acting is truly exceptional. More than anything else, I feel like everyone really went for it. Taiyo in particular, his character is the closest to being used just for comedic effect, but he sounds genuinely unhinged in his pursuit of Shio, it really heightens the character. HanaKana is surprisingly understated in the role of a driven unstable high schooler, but nonetheless her performance is stellar, and very fitting to the role. Her and Shio have great chemistry, and Shio\'s VA really sells her as just the most adorable angel, its not exactly hard to imagine why all these characters are struggling so hard to reach her, even if all of their intentions are hard to specifically empathize with in a vacuum. Really, if you\'re going to do an exaggerated reality with exaggerated characters, you need your voice actors to ratchet up the performances, and Happy Sugar Life certainly delivers.Characters: 9This is where I think many people would differ. Satou is a very divisive character, you either buy into her conviction and root for her as the protagonist through her faults, or you refuse to see past the fact she kidnapped a child and that\'s that. Personally I love Satou, I think she\'s an excellent and far more realized interpretation of the yandere type than anything else I\'ve seen. She\'s in a constant struggle against her own nature and background, not impulsive, but extremely exact and conniving. For a yandere, her body count is not really that high, and even then its not like she relishes having to take care of business for Shio\'s sake, its really only out of necessity, when her various failsafes have all for whatever reason been breached. She barely understands her own connection to Shio, only that it keeps away the hollow bitterness that permeates all of her interpersonal relationships (which makes the conclusion all the more impactful). Shio herself is barely a character for much of the show, purposefully, as the show understands that she is, to all of her adherents, a tool. Once she realizes that herself, she develops into a character alongside Satou, with the power to make her own decisions for her own motivations. They make a strong pair of protagonists, but past that is a lineup of largely over the top side characters, Taiyo in particular. Him, Satou and Shio\'s brother all put forth different interpretations of Shio\'s value through their actions, and all of them have an even more deranged adult over them that has shaped their own hyperbolic reality. These backstories can be a little bit flimsy, like the case of Taiyo being raped into being a pedophile (sounds like a very strange concept for a character that is the closest thing to a joke the show has to offer, but hey, its used for the effect, not to mock rape victims or something, he\'s at the beginning of his own cycle of abuse), but the main two are strong, and present valid cases against this grey zone of Shio\'s custody. The great thing here is that as the story goes along, there\'s not much reaction from the characters, Satou is actively plotting while the other characters, driven by their own motivations, are seeking their own way to their own objectives.

Once Shoto\'s ""Happy Sugar Life"" is threatened, what lengths will she go to to make sure it stays the same?First, let me apologize for the albeit sad excuse of a plot summary. It\'s truly hard for me to think of a way to properly describe this series without giving away too many details. All in all, the initial shock and mystery of most scenes will keep you watching. Secondly, being October, I thought it\'d be appropriate to do a review over something a litte heavier...than a simple comedy or slice of life. Anyways, going back to the review, Happy Sugar Life was amazing. While I am not a stranger to psychological anime\'s, this one truly took me by surprise. Once started, the animation seems so cute and innocent with heinous things lurking just outside of view. This series also focuses on just how interesting it is to see someone clearly not mentally stable justify their actions. And we all get these dark, negative thoughts, but the way they are portrayed here is so raw and true at the same time that at moments you sometimes forget who\'s supposed to be the bad guy. Also, the opening is such an absolute banger, something that\'s always a bonus for me. With only one season comprised of 12 episodes, Happy Sugar Life is certainly something I would\'ve binged in one night if I could.

He\'s also bad. Because he\'s a guy I\'m assuming. Because there\'s almost no difference between him and main-character-girl apart from their gender, so it must be that.In short: ""How can we put as many questionable scenes between a toddler girl and a High-School girl into our Anime? We add other ped0s and call them out for being bad. No one will suspect a thing"" the bad guys, our main character can\'t be, cuz her love is ""just so pure uwu""!Oh, apart from that one teenage guy who, literally, sits in front of the 6 y/o\'s picture drooling and saying how ""cute little girls are"".

It\'s just that this anime is, from its very concept alone, almost actively trying to make you dislike it.And as you all probably know by now, this anime isn\'t a relaxing slice of life anime where the main characters participate in tea parties and look cute while doing household chores. This anime...is a love story between a bubbly 8 year old girl born from a dysfunctional family, and her beautiful kidnapper, a teenage psychopath who will stuff you in a bag and throw you down a river if you present yourself as an obstacle in their ""happy sugar life.""Still with me so far?Oh boy, it gets worse (better). Right off in the first episode, Satou (or as some of you may call it: The Pink Haired Yandere Waifu) gets employed in a cafe where the manager is a deranged young woman who dislikes Satou because of how pretty and likable she is, and straight up rapes one of her male employees just because he had a thing for Satou. She isn\'t an outlier in this fucked up cast of characters; we also meet a masochistic teacher who preys on highschool women, an aunt with a very strange and violent view of love, and last but not the least, the said male employee who now has a deep fear of older women, so of course he takes the only logical course of action and becomes a pedophile.(I was being sarcastic in that last line.)While all of this looks incredibly bizarre on paper, it actually looks sane when seen on scr-Wait, no, that\'s a lie. All of these come out of nowhere, and it\'s riddled with scenarios that are so out of left-field that it would be unhealthy to make a drinking game out of it.This isn\'t a very realistic anime at all. It requires you to suspend all disbelief, grab all the unhealthy snacks in your cupboard, and binge this whole series (It\'s just 12 episodes) while pausing every now and then just to make sure you\'re still awake and that really IS what\'s happening in the story.While it might seem like a mindless violence/edgy/shock-factor/drama-fest at the first glance, there\'s actually something pure about it.This is where Satou and Shio\'s ""love story"" comes in.Yes, Satou is a psychopath, a serial killer, a kidnapper, and maybe-possibly-a-pedophile.Yes, Shio is an adorably stupid, literal 8 year old who doesn\'t have a concept of romantic love in any way, shape, or form.Yes, this is definitely a weird relationship, even by anime standards.But it\'s also undeniably wholesome and fluffy. One could argue that their love is really more familial than romantic (except for the occasional french kiss every now and then, obviously) and it is DEFINITELY NOT SEXUAL. This anime doesn\'t fetishize Shio at all, and she is always treated as a child, not some kind of hypersexualized lolita character who wears smexy costumes and looks at least 21. She wears normal clothes, talks like a normal child (although she can be a little too emotionally mature for her age sometimes), and if I\'m being honest, on the first few episodes I kinda thought she was supposed to be a boy.The same can be said about Satou to some extent. It is implied that before the main story she would sleep with a lot of guys and replace them ""every 3 days,"" but the anime still visually treats her as a highschool girl. She isn\'t made to be a fanservice character, and she doesn\'t have any of those forced beach/sex scenes that add literally nothing to the plot.Hell, even the gore is somewhat tamed down. There are shows for 12 year olds with way more blood than this.That\'s the beauty of HSL. It doesn\'t rely on cheap tricks to seem ""grown up"" and edgy. It\'s a great source of entertainment, and Satou is a well-made anti-heroine, whose casual switching from I-Will-Beat-You-To-Death-While-You-Are-Sleeping to ""Everyone here is beautiful, and they look most beautiful when they are smiling...so please smile for me!"" is genuinely unsettling. She\'s smart, she doesn\'t just go on a killing spree just because she can, and she does her best to make the most out of a problem she runs into. The series can even be a bit experimental at times, like the first half of episode 8, which annoyed me at first but I think it achieved its desired effect well.And honestly, I was rooting for their happy ending.To summarize:This is severely underrated, don\'t let the ""dark"" theme and overly-dramatic tone turn you off, go watch it now.

However, for those seeking a more profound and emotionally resonant experience, ""Happy Sugar Life"" might not hit the mark.', '""Never judge a book by its cover"" whoever said it, said the truth. But in anime language, never judge an anime by its title. Always see its reviews before watching. So I thought it will be some common girly, slice-of-life anime but then one of my friends said that it\'s a really dark anime full of bloodshed and filled with psychopaths and madwomen. I didn\'t believe her but she insisted I watch it so I started watching it. But she wasn\'t wrong. It really was filled with dark plots, Psychopaths, bloodshed, and mad people. So if I try to summarize this whole anime in one...line then it will be ""People with trauma are traumatizing traumatized people."" Yeah, the main theme of this anime is trauma. If you like to see traumatized psychopaths, then this anime is for you. But there aren\'t any hot guys..... line then it will be ""People with trauma are traumatizing traumatized people."" Yeah, the main theme of this anime is trauma. If you like to see traumatized psychopaths, then this anime is for you. But there aren\'t any hot guys.....', 'Happy Sugar Life is a good example of horror, craziness, and is certainly capable of ushering in an age of atmospheric horror and scares just from the characters, and art style alone. I believe it is certainly a step forward for anime that have an emphasis on psychology and mentality.Story (4/10): I don\'t believe I\'m at liberty to say that the story (at least, at this point of episode 5), is in the best shape. Deriving enjoyment purely from the base plot of ""how far would you go in the name of love"" was certainly enough to reel me in. I believe that the story...is most certainly surreal in how it is presented‚Äîeveryone is adapted to common real-world normality. Grow up, go to school, graduate, and move on... but it certainly changes shape here. It appears that every character has something just a tiny bit off, not off enough to make you actually feel scared, but off enough to be bothered. That\'s how surreal horror should be played out. Normality, with tipped scales. The backstory is, well... we can\'t get too much of that. Not enough is presented for me to make good judgement.Art (9/10): The art certainly has an emphasis on reflecting psychological state. The art motifs of pink fluffiness, sweets, and candies are attributed to a state of flow and happiness, and the art motifs of jagged, uneven bolded lines lacking uniform and presenting a deep void of uncertainty follows the more dark sides of this show. I wouldn\'t say that the regular art is anything overly fantastic, but I rated this as a 9/10 as to how it is employed in this fashion. It\'s certainly very unique, you don\'t see this too often.Sound (5/10): I\'d say it\'s... alright. Can\'t say it\'s too bad or too good, but it is... fine. Average.Character (6/10): Let me clear this up. I enjoy this all for the unique personalities, they don\'t seem to deviate or make any exceptions. They are clearly defined and beautiful. Each and every character is unique to some degree, but they lack backstory to reinforce these identities. They laid a strong foundation, but they need to add more substance for this cake! But it\'ll likely be covered in later episodes.Enjoyment (9/10): Despite all that I\'ve said, Happy Sugar Life is certainly capable of making your heart jump. It can make you break into a cold sweat, and make you sit and stay there in suspense. What\'s gonna happen next? What are the next moves? Who is she? What does this mean? You\'ll ask yourself so many questions, afflicted by the art and character personalities just enough to make you yearn for the next episode in search of answers.Overall (7/10): Real good!

However this is but a facade to mask a rather depressed adolescent girl who has never loved anyone before in this bitter world.That is until she meets her one true love Shio Koube, a rather young girl who seems to understand As you better than anyone else.The two gravitate towards one another filling in the holes in their hearts.As you will do anything...to live out a happy life with Shio even if it means the unthinkable.

When I finished this show I was left with a suspicion that I had wasted time watching it (I was right).The animation itself is good, but I sensed there was a lot of laziness employed here. It felt as if a third of any episode was still frames, or still frames that slowly moved around as somebody monologued in the background about senseless crazy shit. The intro was pretty good though.The story line itself is interesting and weird/creepy. I think it does a good job at highlighting a serious problem with pedophilia...in anime and modernity (the archetype of the damaged character that suffered abuse as a child and, therefore, becomes a villain themselves). There was little to no character development in the entire anime. We are never sure of what grade Satou is in, or how she managed to get away with living in a place that undoubtedly has a different name on the lease (?). Speaking of that, the producers NEVER provide any closure on the episode where they explain how Satou got that apartment; the whole point of that episode was to be as creepy as possible and never even hint at who this strange man is that is paying for her to model.Overall, this anime is a cheap thrill. There's only so much you can do with a 12-ep anime but they obviously did not try to do very much. This anime was very hyped up on various platforms as being creepy and weird and even scary. It is not in the least scary, maybe to younger viewers though.

The art is beautiful, I love the use of colors and the way the characters ""glow"" at times. Character design is pretty good as well as assigning personalities although I find most of their personalities to be your typical anime character types (I compliment the way each character fits their personality, most of their personalities I don\'t like however).The story\'s pace was also...nice, except for the main core of the plot which seemed never changing. I liked watching different characters interact with eachother and form relationships.NOW for the bad. (May contain some spoilers but I won\'t use character names)The main plot is slow paced and always seems to be in favor of the character you come to either hate or love (I don\'t understand how people can like this character). It\'s one situation after another where the character always seems to somehow ""win"" and get away with it. Even in the most unrealistic scenarios this character just magically seems immune.Some of the characters come off as bystanders with a personality plainer than bread. Most of which these characters don\'t seem to speak for their selves or have any sense of intelligence (I can think of one). These characters are practically sheep following the plot to make it easier to predict what\'s going to happen next. There\'s really no ""twist"" or change of direction or pace.With that being all said, this anime started off great, but toward the end it left me feeling disappointed with feeling like I wasted my time for yet again your typical yandere anime. Some will tell me ""well what did you expect?"" well yeah, I can\'t expect every anime to have something new or fresh, but I have standards and so should everybody else. nice, except for the main core of the plot which seemed never changing.

It has a little something to trigger everyone!I spent the first half of the show taking it mostly seriously, and the rest of the show watching with sick fascination at its trashy B-movie theatrics.The story... eh... some unhinged 16-year-old girl doesn\'t know what love is until she finds an abandoned 8-year-old girl and falls for her. She then keeps her locked in her apartment. The little girl is fine with this....While I don\'t think it ever got sexual, the way they said wedding vows to each other every night was hella creepy and I was getting grooming vibes. They want this Happy Sugar Life to continue forever, but the world with its pesky laws keeps getting in the way of their love. As expected, the story doesn\'t end well.The characters were what made me quit taking it seriously. They\'re off the chain! I mean, there were two or three (probably) sane characters in the whole cast. Our MC was a sociopathic lesbian (borderline?) pedophile who had a little girl locked in her apartment. Also she murders several people. And she LOVES having inner monologues. Her female boss? Rapist. Same-aged coworkers? A pedo and a lesbian stalker. Teacher? Masochist who LOVES when female students step on his crotch. And her aunt? Don\'t get me started on that piece of work. Add in the little girl\'s family and I started wondering if the government was slipping something into the water of this neighborhood as an experiment. It felt like each episode added a new sicko. No one has ANY chill in this show. I enjoyed the aunt character the most, because she was just so out there. I couldn\'t take my eyes off of her whenever she was onscreen. Oh, there was one sane girl in it, MC\'s friend.Some of the things the characters did were so over-the-top and unrealistic that I felt like I was watching Severing Crime Edge again, except no one had the ""possessed by a haunted murder weapon"" excuse. There are a few priceless dialogues in HSL that make you wonder, ""who the hell wrote this and how much did they get paid?""The art was okay. It had a bright color palette with lots of pinks and blues, and that moe style where characters are cute to contrast with the fact that most of them should be in an insane asylum or prison. The animation wasn\'t that fluid. The best part of the animation was whenever someone shifted into crazy eyes mode: it was chilling, no matter how many times I saw it. And one fantastic murder scene. Now the show got one thing right: atmosphere. Even when it looks sweet and happy, you still feel like something is wrong. A large factor in this are the scribble effects that obscure certain characters\' faces, and the static-y screens when a character starts losing their cool.Speaking of atmosphere, when a character starts blanking out and the urge to murder / freak out rises, the voices distort. These sound effects (and a memorable scene where one character only speaks in an ultra-distorted sound wave) took the show up a notch. Then the laughable, overly-dramatic organ music that played during some ""serious"" scenes took it down a notch so the show broke even. The OP was very fitting, and the ED wasn\'t bad either.Back to the story: everything gets resolved in the most dramatic way possible, with a final scene that was either great or a cop-out.

Well, I haven\'t watched NEARLY enough anime that came out this year to answer this question, but I CAN tell you which one I enjoyed the most! Happy Sugar Life is my pick for this year because it\'s a psychological horror/thriller done right. This series is basically about a deranged girl who kidnaps a loli and forces her to live in her apartment with her without anyone finding out.The story is a bit mediocre (5/10) as it doesn\'t really go far beyond the premise I just laid out, but it\'s the characters where this series really shines. For...example, there\'s one boy in the show who\'s kind of a perv who is obsessed with the loli I mentioned earlier. So why do I kinda feel sorry for him? Because we see how he was physically and sexually abused by his boss, and how it mentally screwed him up to where he sees this little girl as an ""angel"" that can heal him. Y\'see how it\'s complicated and have mixed feelings about him? I promise you every character in this series has layers like this (8/10).The artwork in the show is mediocre (5/10) with pretty basic character models, aside from the eye-catching OP that REALLY reminds me of Madoka Magica. The sound design, on the other hand, is where this show really shines (9/10). This show knows when to have characters talk, when to have their voices muffled over for creepy effect, and when to have total silence to terrify the audience. So much of an effective horror movie/show is in its sound design, and this show nails it. I really enjoyed Happy Sugar Life and my favorite scene was at the end of episode 9 where a certain character strangles and stabs another character. All we hear is this girl\'s muffled screams and struggling, and we see her desperately clawing up the other girl\'s hand, and my God it was just so effective.

Overall 8/10', 'Horror is a genre that is hard to do right. Often times horror anime tend to focus on shocking you with gruesome and disturbing imagery rather than focusing on building tension and suspense. This also causes the characters and story to be underdeveloped and difficult to care about. But when you build too much suspense or tension, it can lead to stretches of boredom. When done right, Horror anime can have some of the most memorable scenes in anime as the tension and atmosphere leaves you uncomfortable and scared as the scene is etched into your head. You can put Horror into any kind of...situation as long you focus on what makes a horror anime good. Making the viewer feel uncomfortable and anxious. So when I watched the horror anime that was airing this summer, only one caught my attention and made me anxious to find out what happens next every single week. And that anime is the one I am reviewing today.Sit back, relax and make sure to hide after you read this review because the FBI is coming after you as I present to you the anime review for Happy Sugar Life. Lets begin.Story: 8/10Where to begin with this series? Well the story follows Satou Matsuzaka, a seemingly average high school girl who is having the time of her life. Having a steady income and living with an adorable little girl by the name of Shio Koube where both of them care for each other deeply and are comfortable around each other (don\'t worry, it\'s not paedophilia...I think). However, when characters start to disrupt the peace and happy lifestyle that Satou has built, she starts to go off into the deep end. From there, we see what lengths Satou will take to prevent her happy life style from crumbling and maintaining her ""Happy Sugar Life.""Over time, the plot does escalate to we really see the true nature of Satou and what kind of character she really is. This is all thanks to the show\'s tension and suspense that it does so well. Instead of just rushing into things, each episode builds to a point where Satou snaps and her true, manipulating mental state shows its ugly head. The horror aspect shines in this regard as it builds an atmosphere where these characters are not actually sane, but are great at hiding it. This makes their behaviour fairly unpredictable which adds to the tension of this show.Throughout the series, there is one question that hovers over this series and that question is, ""What is love?.......Baby don\'t hurt me!....Don\'t hurt me!..No more!"" (I am not sorry). Each character, including Satou, has their own twisted interpretation on love. Whereas love can be taken as being adored by everyone or by merely using it to cover your own problems. Each character uses their definition of love to drive their actions, causing conflict with Satou. Of course Satou uses that to manipulate people to do what she wants, leaving to some very tense scenes.Now the main thing I like about the plot is that it toys with your expectations. You think you know what is going to happen given your prior knowledge of other horror shows and what has happened in this particular show, but then it throws a curve ball and does something completely different. This leaves the show unpredictable as you don\'t really know what is going to happen next; adding to the suspense as you are waiting to see if you are right as you watch the outcome.You can see why I said the Horror aspect of this show is done well. Through unpredictability and tense moments, we are watching an anime that builds suspense and and an atmosphere that makes us feel uncomfortable, but at the same time, making us lean forward as to find out what is going to happen next.Characters: 8/10Satou is definitely a character that questions whether you want to route for her or to see her life crumble around her. She is a character who will do very questionable things for the sake of ""love"" because, like every other character of this show, she has her own twisted interpretation of love. This is because she has no sense of morality whatsoever. She will manipulate anyone in order to get what she wants and she wouldn\'t hesitate to do so. And while she wants to try to avoid killing people, she wouldn\'t hesitate to kill if that was her only option. This makes her both dangerously smart since she has a sense of self control and a massive hypocrite. She constantly belittles people for their actions and desires but unaware that she is just as bad, if not worse than the people she belittles.This pretty makes Satou a terrifying character as there is nothing more terrifying than a smart psychopath. Always looking to manipulate people and suffering no repercussions for doing so. Satou is not a good person and while her moments with Shio would make you question it, lets not forget that she is keeping Shio all to herself. She has no empathy for other characters and will remove them from the picture if she needs to. She is not a good person in this story. Rather, she is portrayed as the evil compared to other characters of the show. But the show does try its hardest to make Satou more of a sympathetic character and make you understand why she is the way she is, helping make her character less black and white than it initially seems.So the reason why Satou does all these bad things is because of her love for Shio. And while Shio is so adorable, she does have her own mental problems as well as she is suffering from suppressed memories. She often needs Satou as a way to hide her problems as she appears not to know better. It is clear that Shio has suffered some kind of traumatic event and needs Satou to make her feel happy. This makes the whole situation with Satou and Shio morally questionable. On one hand, these two really do care for each other and do want to spend the whole time together. On the other hand, you can\'t deny the fact that Satou has taken Shio and is keeping her away from the outside world, meaning that Shio isn\'t aware of her current situation. It\'s these morally grey questions that help give Happy Sugar Life some thought provoking questions on who is in the right and who is in the wrong. Your decision maybe concrete at times but the anime will try its hardest to convince you otherwise.Now one of the things that drags this show down is that some of the characters of this show really are just crazy for the sake of being crazy. While they have their own opinions on love and use it as a crutch for their instability, it can be pretty weak and just highlights the fact that everyone in this show has some kind of mental instability. In fact, there is only one character in this show that you would consider sane, and that is Satou\'s best friend Shouko. Other characters like Taiyou start off sane but get crazy later after some traumatic event. And honestly, I wouldn\'t blame them if they went crazy later after experiencing something traumatic. That makes their mental state more believable because we see what they went through and understand why they are the way they are. Not just randomly crazy and then dismissed as a one off character.I actually want to quickly talk about Shouko because being the only sane character throughout the show, she would be the character we would eventually get invested in. While she may start out irrelevant at first, over time, we see her grow and we get to understand her better as she just wants to be more useful to the people around her (mainly Satou) and help them, ignoring the consequences. Of course, Satou is mentally unstable. So by the end of it, you just want to see Shouko go through this show unscathed.Animation: 6.5/10In some areas, the animation excels and in other areas, the animation falls flat. So lets start with the bad side of the animation and that is the animation\'s art style. The art style is just plain and bland with nothing that stands out in this regard. While the character designs are bright, highlighting that this is a slice of life trapped in a horror anime, it doesn\'t invoke a sense of awe.Now what it excels at is everything that has to relate to the horror aspect of this show. Mainly, the character expressions. They are all just uncomfortable and unnerving to look at. Some more than others as they use different expressions to highlight their mental instability. Satou stands out in this regard. I already mentioned that she is a smart psychopath with a sense of control, well that relates to her facial expressions. She is able put on a Kawaii face, a straight face and a murderous face. This is especially true when her eyes glow or look like a swirling vortex of doom looking into your soul.Of course that isn\'t the only thing the animation does well as it also likes to use static during its more darker scenes as well as turning the screen red, highlighting that the situation has become dire and an emergency, normally when people are in Satou\'s way. It also likes to go cinematic with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen, highlighting that particular moment. These added effects to the animation really do add to the tension of the show and make the scene more dramatic.Sound: 8/10The soundtrack does add to the mood and there were a couple that stood out to me. And those ones are from the show\'s darker scenes. The soundtrack from the slice of life moments weren\'t memorable to me and didn\'t stand out except for one piece that played near the end of episode six. But my favourite scenes normally don\'t include an OST playing in the background. Rather, it is the absence of a soundtrack and just hearing the characters dialogue while an ominous, low, humming noise plays in the background and also using audio scratching and booming sounds to add to the atmosphere and tell the viewer that s**t just hit the floor.The opening, ""One Room Sugar Life"" by Akari Nanawo is definitely a highlight of show, as it balances the slice of life imagery with the creeping aspect of horror lurking in the shadows. It switches between slice of life with bright colours, sweets, cakes and the relationship between Satou and Shio to dark imagery with static, video tearing, and showing that no-one is sane in this series. The song as well balances this with the vocals sounding like they belong in a slice of life whereas the instrumentals say otherwise. While the low quality imagery in some aspects of the opening as well as some of the imagery looks photo-shopped may bring the quality of this opening down for some people, it didn\'t bother me and just added to the quality of the opening.The ED is appropriate. Going through an episode of this series is nerve-racking at times so having a calm ending is the sort of thing that would relax people. So why not show the sweet relationship between Satou and Shio to calm your nerves.One final thing in the sound department, I have to give props for Satou\'s voice actress Kana Hanazawa. She has done a really good job of portraying this character with many faces and present a very good vocal range to portray Satou\'s various moods and expressions.ConclusionHappy Sugar Life is a show that, for me, turned out to be better than it should have been. It has aspects that I look for in a horror series. Good pacing, solid characters, suspense, tension, an atmosphere built using animation, sound and a character\'s dialogue and actions and made me feel genuinely uncomfortable in some of its scenes or even entire episodes (like seriously, what the f**k is up with Satou\'s aunt). While the show does stumble with some of its characters and the art style isn\'t inspiring, it\'s pros out-way its cons.Honestly I wasn\'t expecting much from Happy Sugar Life because looking at it up front, it is about a pink haired, psychotic Yandere taking care of a loli and is surrounded by insane characters. But if look underneath the surface, you will find a well paced, well thought out horror series. Considering what horror series we\'ve had so far this year from generic vampire hunters to over the top magical girls, watching Happy Sugar Life will probably do you no harm, except maybe scar you for life. It ain\'t for the feint of heart as some scenes are jarring and uncomfortable to watch, but if you can manage through that, then you managed to watch an enjoyable horror series.My personal enjoyment: 10/10Overall score: 8.1/10  Recommendation: Watch it situation as long you focus on what makes a horror anime good.

It helped me grow up. If you have watched this then you know how unfair this is. But this is life.  Life is unfair. I respect this anime and the writer or in other words  the artist who made a change. This is the reason why i am now giving it 10.Warning: If you watch this then you might have a horrible 4 months or even more. I always feel sad when I hear or...read the word Happy. read the word Happy.', ""Quite a journey I had today. Looking back to this I can only think of the creative process the writers might have gone through. I've learned that these are not my type of shows, at some point I really wanted to turn it off and of course the people behind this project did not wanted to make it an easy watch and that's unfortunate because I really wanted to liked it when I first was reading about it.The story. We get a look into the world of a mentally ill person that has been abused since she was a little kid, we are also...able to go inside the mental state and the motivations behind their actions, the justifications they tell to themselves to commit these horrible crimes, how easy it is to have a normal life and fool everyone around you while also having a terrible secret, the manipulation they can put into others to accomplish something and the complete lack of emotions towards others.The art is one of the strongest points to this show since the real intent of it is to cover all of the horror that goes in the series, the really cute scenes that could be out of your favorite SoL, they feel a little bit out of place but once again they are there for a reason, there is nothing in this show that it isn't measured.I definitely didn't had a good time watching this but thats the point to it. I can see the appeal this would have on others but I'm not the target audience. This is not a bad show by any means, it's really good, and I cannot judge it by my moral standards. I'm giving it a 8/10, please read about it first to determine if you are the audience for this. able to go inside the mental state and the motivations behind their actions, the justifications they tell to themselves to commit these horrible crimes, how easy it is to have a normal life and fool everyone around you while also having a terrible secret, the manipulation they can put into others to accomplish something and the complete lack of emotions towards others.The art is one of the strongest points to this show since the real intent of it is to cover all of the horror that goes in the series, the really cute scenes that could be out of your favorite SoL, they feel a little bit out of place but once again they are there for a reason, there is nothing in this show that it isn't measured.I definitely didn't had a good time watching this but thats the point to it.

Most of the scenes are very bright I felt like it kinda hurts to watch in the dark. It also has very messed up scenes for people who are easily disturbed. I loved the art style it looked wonderful, and the sound was great they choose the perfect voice actors for this series. Many spots of the story had me on edge, and I loved it. This show made me want to look away, but I just could not. there are other parts I liked like the opening it...has a nice ring to it and really shows the true colors of the show. I would personally recommend this to people who like a nice juicy story with many twists and turns. has a nice ring to it and really shows the true colors of the show. I would personally recommend this to people who like a nice juicy story with many twists and turns.', '(English is not my first language, sorry if there are any mistakes.)Happy Sugar Life is one of those shows you cannot forget. It can be hard to find good horror anime, but this one took up the challenge and delivered a great, disturbing story. Do not expect it to be realistic: it is meant to be as crazy as possible, with murder, pedophiles, rape, kidnapping... The main character, Satou, lacks empathy and has completely lost her grasp on reality (one of the main themes of the anime), making everything and everyone usually considered unhinged and insane normal. You watch the characters\' descent into hell while...they are trying their best to lie to themselves and hide their madness.The presentation and development of the characters isn\'t the best. We get it, they are all crazy in some way and all gravitate around the pure and angel-like Shio. They all have a reason to believe she is the light of their life and that she will save them from what they are going through. However, the show has an immense problem with the phrase ""show, don\'t tell"". The long, often unuseful internal debates and speeches are fine when they happen with Satou, since she is the main character and we see most of the story from her point of view, but it happens with almost every single character. This tends to ruin the tension and the mystery surrounding them, especially with Matsuboshi, Daichi, and Satou\'s aunt.Shoko, a supporting role, is a terrible character. Her reactions do not make sense, she lacks personality and I couldn\'t push myself to care for her no matter how hard I tried.When I first finished the anime, I was disappointed with how little development Satou received in favor of Shio, but ultimately I think it was the right choice. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Shio grow and change. It also made more sense for her to evolve than Satou, who is so obsessed with love and Shio that she becomes stuck in it.Happy Sugar Life is a visually odd experience. The animation and overall art is pretty bad considering it came out in 2018. The characters\' design is poor, especially Asahi\'s. However, I do appreciate the bright colors and the imagery which added to the creepiness and created a contrast between what was going on (psychological horror) and what you would see (cute characters with pastel hair and metaphors with candy).This, of course, is a personal preference, but I loved the opening. It suited the mood of the anime extremely well. The OST\'s are fine, what added to the experience was the sound effects though. Also, Satou\'s seiyuu did an amazing job.No spoilers, but the ending was a bit rushed. It wasn\'t executed as well as it could have been, but the last couple of scenes were amazing and made the perfect ending to the story.This anime creeped me out. It was uncomfortable to watch, it was crazy, which is exactly what I was looking for. Again, it is not supposed to be realistic but a disturbing experience, and it did exactly that.

I\'ll try my best not to spill too much about what happens and if I do, I\'ll try to mark it. This review might make you give at least an idea of what the anime has to offer, though.This anime gave me so much emotions that I have to make my first review. Normally, I only keep my opinions, but I have so much to say. Now, I\'ll begin here. There will be minor spoilers, but they\'re written to be as vague as possible. Sorry if this review may seem messy!Story: 2.- The story\'s premise was a bit engaging at first,...but there are a lot of plot holes. It\'s fine to have plot holes sometimes, since it gives more space for writers to interpret the general message of the story, but in my opinion, it\'s too fast and soon that it starts to mislead people about the topics it tries to pursue, and the overall tone in general.- I\'m tolerant of problematic themes, but like I said earlier, it\'s told was too fast or soon, that it can mislead a lot of people about the tone of the anime. Sometimes, it felt like the anime was romanticizing the said themes because on how overused they are that it feels like the anime\'s treating it as a running gag. It feels like... the author is more of a ""hehe I\'ll put whatever creepy theme I can put for shock value"" rather than a ""I\'ll show the reader how hard it is to deal with this"" type of a horror writer.- Some scenes were too repetitive I have to fast forward because I\'m getting tired of seeing the same scenes again and again. Yes Karen, this teacher wants finds the student hot!- It would be nicer if this anime was shortened to an OVA tbh, to cut off the overuse of scenes so it wouldn\'t feel like a running gag.Art: 5.- It may seem biased, because I have a soft side for moe anime so the designs were appealing to me, and you can easily remember the characters with their respective designs. Also, Norainu did the visuals for the opening, and I\'ve been a big fan of her ever since FAKE TYPE and Utsu-P! So that immediately gives me a fair score for the anime.- I heard that the studio was pretty new during the time this anime was aired. For a new studio, the artwork is pretty dope! The animations weren\'t that engaging, but the colors they use make up for the loss.- Character designs were pretty decent. Some match their names (e.g. the warm color palettes for Taiyo, and his name means sun), and most character design gives you an overall view of what the character is. It\'s also what drew me to watch the show.- However, I\'ll lower the score here because sometimes, the visuals in the anime were repetitive as well: namely the static picture. It was cool at first that it represents the character or mood of the scene, but on the later episodes, the static was one of the things that made me feel like that it\'s a running gag in the show, since it rather ruins the mood for being overused. If they had more creative ideas other than overusing the static, I\'d give the art a higher rating.Sound: 5.- Again, this is going to be biased again. I liked Nanawoakari and Nayutalien ever since they were pretty underrated, so hearing the opening makes me hyped. I also loved the ending too.- The OST sounds pretty nice, I complimented it the first time I heard it. However, what gave me a lower rating is because on how they put it on unfitting situations. It does help make a situation unsettling, but dang I just wished they put fitting music at least once. Sound design is very important too, y\'know...Character: 1.- Designs aside, I genuinely disliked every character except for Asahi and Shio\'s mom. Even though we\'re being dug into their twisted PoVs, it\'s not powerful and it doesn\'t scare me. It feels random even.- There are so much reasons why the characters are rated 1. I might spoil the series if I continue, so if you don\'t mind a few spoilers, you can read more depth about my thoughts on the character at the bottom.Enjoyment: 3.- It was a great challenge to not get pissed on every episode, because I always end up being pissed. I finished this anime anyways, it was kekworthy.Overall: 3.- To put it short and sweet, this anime had a disappointing execution that I felt kek\'d on a lot of scenes rather than fearing it like the horror anime it should be. The only reason why I rated this at 3 is because of Asahi, the visuals, and the sound.Anyways,  if you\'re serious about:- a show that has a flawless execution of horror in a cute facade like Gakkou Gurashi,- and a series that gives you the PoV of a problematic person ft. a plot that grows gloomy like Saya no UtaI\'m sorry, this anime would probably not make you satisfied if you\'re serious about examining the plot\'s mood.-----SPOILER-Y THOUGHTS. If you want to watch Happy Sugar Life 100% blind, do not read anything below this.- You know how series need to be some nightmare fuel to feel real? Well, this had too much. Pure coincidences of a whole series of horrible events is really weak as a plot device, as if it feels like it\'s all a conspiracy.- In fact, some characters are completely unnecessary even. Namely, the teacher. He\'s just a random predator. He should be in jail before he even becomes a character.- Some decent characters end up either being really ""WTF?"" or never get paid for whatever hardwork they do. Like about the most normal person suddenly kissing some 11 year old kid? A guy literally doesn\'t get rewarded after working so hard and getting a lot of hope? I know that it\'s bad to hope too much, but the treatment of that invisible rule in this anime left a bad taste on the mouth. but there are a lot of plot holes.

I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt even remember Sugar Happy Life till a few days ago! Fair enough,this is the first anime which I‚Äôm watching with a yandere character so I may not have much knowledge on this sort of anime but in my opinion it was really good!Story 7: Yes, I guess not too much happens during the course of the 12 ep story (they‚Äôre together, someone gets killed, repeat) but we learn about some characters backstories and an...ending that I didn‚Äôt expect.Art 10: I LOVED this art. It‚Äôs so brightly coloured but seems dark too. I‚Äôd genuinely love to see more anime like this ( I haven‚Äôt seen much anime but from the ones I‚Äôve watched I haven‚Äôt seen an art style quite like this)Sound 7: I mean I‚Äôm not the best at writing reviews, nor am I good at musical stuff but I loved the Japanese voices, the op suits the anime very well and the soundtrack(I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called) is coolCharacter 7: Not much character development from what I saw, but my favourite character was shios brother, he turned into a better person because of satous ‚Äòfriend‚Äô i think and I can kinda relate to him based on the backstoryEnjoyment 8: I don‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt that into it last year, now when I watched it I couldn‚Äôt stop and idk I just really enjoyed itOverall 8: If you can overlook the age difference then it‚Äôs a really good anime. The last episode actually got me laughing (maybe I‚Äôm a psycho for laughing at a psychological horror..hah) but it‚Äôs nothing higher than an 8 because it didn‚Äôt manage to get me scared or crying, and idk why but that‚Äôs what I want from this sort of anime :) ending that I didn‚Äôt expect.Art 10: I LOVED this art.

I can only say that I rarely come across such garbage and can only give this a mediocre score because the animation and sound was good. From now on this review contains spoilers so read at your own risk.Basically, the only good thing about this anime were Shio's brother, the nice animation and the soundtrack.Giving this series the genre ‚ÄúPsychological‚Äù is an absolute insult to animes that excel in that category (see S1 of Psycho-Pass, Zankyou no Terror, etc.). I am a...big fan of psychological horror but this series gave me NO enjoyment whatsoever. The plot was incredibly predictable which is not what you want in a series. The only part of the plot that I found remotely interesting was the backstory of the painter and Satou. If the story had been about saving both main characters, like showing Satou what healthy love is and getting Shio into a suitable surrounding for a child, it would have been way better. But that's a problem stemming from the source material and concept the Mangaka had.The whole anime is basically glorifying Stockholm Syndrome and Kidnapping/Pedophilia all the way to the end which I find... repelling to say the least. Throughout the whole series I was hoping/rooting for the brother to free Shio, it was basically my saving grace. Oooh boy was I let down. The last episode was cringe inducing. It tried way too hard to paint the main characters and their decisions in a good light which... failed spectacularly in my eyes. Sorry but that child clearly suffered from Stockholm Syndrome. That ain't love, chief.Characters. Oh man. So many clich√©s, it's horrible.Chewed down pink haired Yandere? Check. Innocent Loli? Check. Kind best friend that dies? Check. Abusive father? Check. Perverted teacher? Check. Crazy aunt? Yup. The list goes on.I get that people like different character tropes but come on. At least give the Yandere a different hair color.All in all, Happy Sugar Life was a wild ride that absolutely let me down several times, just to end in one big unsatisfying boom.Can absolutely not recommend, unless you want to watch it with a friend and trash the series while doing so. If that's the case, I'd say go for it. big fan of psychological horror but this series gave me NO enjoyment whatsoever. The plot was incredibly predictable which is not what you want in a series.

If that's the case, I'd say go for it."", 'Contains Some Spoilers:Through an interesting premise and amazing execution, Happy Sugar Life manages to get me super invested in a narrative about a high-school lesbian that kidnaps an 8-year old in the name of love.Happy Sugar Life is a story about love that springs from a twisted perception of that very concept. Our main character, Satou is the personification of this very idea. She grows up in an environment that has only shown her the ugly and twisted perspectives of love which...results in Satou being in a state of confusion and emptiness. Before the beginning of the anime, Satou aimlessly searches for the true meaning of love since she most likely refuses to accept her own family member‚Äôs definition of love. Her search primary includes her and her best friend, Shouko, going around sleeping with various people. Nonetheless, she fails in her attempts to fall in love with anybody and continues her feeling of emptiness until the fateful day she meets a young girl named Shio.Although Satou‚Äôs state of confusion and emptiness is not the main focus of the anime and only serves as her backstory, it‚Äôs essential in understanding Satou‚Äôs character and her motivation throughout the entire series. The focus of this anime however, is Satou‚Äôs journey of maintaining her very own definition of love despite how morality and societal perception may contrast it. Happy Sugar Life is a psychological thriller drama that deals with Satou trying the best she can in preserving a happy life with a lost 8 year-old child, Shio. Satou‚Äôs main conflict is simply dealing with keeping her happy life with Shio a secret as well as individuals who attempt to pry into her life. This show excels creating interesting dramatic scenarios that feel very organic despite their absurdity at times. There is always rising tension that keeps me unable to stop watching in order to find out what happens next.Aside from our yandere protagonist herself, there is another main character who is also an integral part of the story. Shio, the love of Satou‚Äôs life, represents innocence that has been tainted by the cruel reality of her family situations. Being young and impressionable, her traumatic experiences have made her lose memories of her family and instead seek love from Satou instead. Shio‚Äôs relationship with a byproduct of Satou‚Äôs unresolved need in finding her own meaning love and the horrible situation Shio has endured during the early years of her life. Despite not being exactly moral, their relationship is something genuinely endearing and not portrayed as something completely terrible. Though the show does address the flaws within their relationship, the flaws are something that compel Satou to learn and grow which is a part of her character progression. Their unnatural, strange relationship is what generates the very enticing drama of the narrative and it‚Äôs fascinating to see how it evolves over the course of the show.Besides our main couple of the series, the other cast members are mostly very interesting and relevant to the overall narrative. Asahi, Shio‚Äôs biological big brother, who is strangely portrayed as the show‚Äôs main antagonist who serves to be Satou‚Äôs foil. His main motivation in the series is simply to find his missing little sister so they can be reunited once again as a family. Yet, because of the show‚Äôs unique ste-up, he is supposedly not really the hero of the story despite being one of the most morally just characters in the show. Though his goal seems noble to most people, it‚Äôs implied later on in the show that his longing for his family to one again is almost an unhealthy delusion for the past that has already been long broken. Frankly, I really rooted for Asahi the most in the show, but I do understand why he would eventually fail to really reunite with Shio as a family once again. He is truly a tragic character.Speaking of tragic characters, Satou‚Äôs best friend, Shouko, who may have ended up even more tragic than Asahi did at the end. Shouko is perhaps the most normal out of everyone from the series. She is used to being particularly minor as a character until she comes in contact with Taiyou. Then after being aware more and more about Satou‚Äôs relationship with Shio, she represents the ordinary path for Satou which is a gateway towards Satou‚Äôs potential redemption. She truly wants to understand and help Satou by preventing her from committing anymore horrible deeds. Nevertheless, Satou rejects Shouko‚Äôs offer of redemption and gateway towards ordinary life which leads to an inevitable outcome. Another important note about her is her brief relationship with Asahi. Shouko‚Äôs decision to get involved with Asahi‚Äôs situation is perhaps the greatest thing to ever happen to Asahi in a long, long time. She becomes Asahi‚Äôs only resemblance of hope left and reminds him that this bleak world does contain some good people after all.Our last member of the main cast we have Mitsuboshi Taiyou, probably one of the most entertaining characters to watch on screen because of the unlucky stuff he has to go through several times. In terms of narrative relanvancy, he plays a part as a somewhat minor obstacle for Satou and Shio‚Äôs relationship since he never comes across as a real threat to Satou. On the contrary, He becomes someone whom Satou can easily take advantage of which further contributes to his misfortune. Mitsuboshi is a character who is completely influenced by his misfortune and traumatic experiences with horrible adults which cause him to develop his own twisted obsession. His obsession with Shio stems from his desire to be purified and cleansed of his trauma. He perceives Shio as a path towards salvation because to Mitsuboshi, Shio is the purest form of innocence. He even out right calls her an angel. Regardless of how much effort he puts in, he always ends up being manipulated, violated, threatened, and indirectly rejected if he ever meets Shio again. For some reasons, it‚Äôs hilarious that  a guy is tortured by others because of terrible luck that he kind of brought upon himself.Besides the main cast of characters, we also have a few supporting and minor characters that do serve legitimate purposes in the stories. Two of them I want to highlight are Shio‚Äôs mother and of course, Satou‚Äôs aunt. Both of them are vital aspects of the main couple‚Äôs past and their foundation as characters. Shio‚Äôs mom‚Äôs backstory influenced Shio to become a lost soul that she used to before meeting Satou. Meanwhile, Satou‚Äôs aunt‚Äôs entire characterization is the very reason behind Satou‚Äôs main motivation in the first place.Unlike Shio‚Äôs mother however, she is such a monumental presence in the series since her appearance does not only occur during flashbacks. Her introduction late in the series honestly terrifies more than anything from this show. Satou‚Äôs aunt is hinted many times prior to her actual appearance and identity remains a mystery until the reveal which makes her introduction that much more impactful. She is the embodiment of  Satou‚Äôs entire internal conflict, the disgusting and false conception of what love is. After observing for the entirety of her childhood, Satou absolutely despises her aunt and tries to find her true understanding of love. Being the embodiment of all the ugly aspects of love or perhaps in this case it‚Äôs plain lust. Out of everything Satou encounters, her aunt might be the most challenging and terrifying to overcome.Although I have discussed in length about the characters, I would also like to mention a few other elements of the series. The visuals in this anime are pretty standard at first, but as the show goes on it utilizes interesting and abstract visualization during scenes of characters displaying their psychological breakdown. For example, Satou always feels extremely fulfilled whenever she is around Shio she would imagine a jar of candy being filled. The greatest instance of visuals however, has to be the episode that details the backstory behind Satou‚Äôs previous apartment owner. The entire episode is told through the perspective of the previous apartment room owner and we only see and hear Satou from a first-person perspective. To be able to convey the guy‚Äôs emotions through mostly visuals, sounds, and words was a nice change of pace compared to other episodes. The soundtrack works well for each scene it‚Äôs used, but not many of them really stand out to me. One piece of soundtrack I noticed is the one that sounds a soundtrack from Bleach which really surprised me big time.The only downside for this anime is perhaps some of the supporting characters in the series are not utilized to their potential. The teacher character I believe is mostly there a minor obstacle for Satou and doesn‚Äôt really get to do anything more as the show goes on. Him being a perverted sex offender doesn‚Äôt play a role in the overall narrative and his relevance was mostly trying to find out more about Satou and eventually being caught. Another character that is similarly under-used is the underclassmen who falls in love with Satou. Though you could argue that her purpose is to further Satou‚Äôs internal conflict which I agree with. However, I simply think she could have been integrated a little more. But overall, the anime is full of great characters.All in all, Happy Sugar Life is a love story that originates from a place of an unfortunate and distorted mentality. A tragedy that keeps thrilled from the beginning until the very end where you witness characters with conflicting motives going against each other. Two individuals that want nothing more than to secure a place where they are allowed the liberty to embrace each other no matter how society would view them. A tragic tale where they both fail to properly carry out their love and affection as they face the consequences of their actions and decisions. This anime is truly a fascinating, exciting, and unique ride from start to finish. results in Satou being in a state of confusion and emptiness.

Another character that is similarly under-used is the underclassmen who falls in love with Satou. Though you could argue that her purpose is to further Satou‚Äôs internal conflict which I agree with. However, I simply think she could have been integrated a little more. But overall, the anime is full of great characters.All in all, Happy Sugar Life is a love story that originates from a place of an unfortunate and distorted mentality. A tragedy that keeps thrilled from the beginning until the very end where you witness characters with conflicting motives going against each other. Two individuals that want nothing more than to secure a place where they are allowed the liberty to embrace each other no matter how society would view them. A tragic tale where they both fail to properly carry out their love and affection as they face the consequences of their actions and decisions. This anime is truly a fascinating, exciting, and unique ride from start to finish.', 'It\'s not bad but it certainly isn\'t for everybody.If you like edgy, shocky, nonsensical anime that feels like there\'s no plot and every episode ends with you saying ""what the hell did i just watch"", then this is for you.While i do appreciate that it\'s different and it\'s creative, the world in this anime makes so little sense that to me it feels more silly than brutal or raw and the fact that the show seems to take itself super seriously just makes it worse.This is one of those shows where Japan has no laws, and parents and the police do not exist. There\'s super...aggressive teenagers who beat and rape people in parks and streets, and school girls go around killing people and kidnapping children without any consequences whatsoever. Children walk around the streets alone and weirdos approach them and nobody notices or does a thing. I guess Japan is not a super safe first world country in this universe.It\'s all too convenient for the setting and quite frankly i\'m not a fan of that sort of plastic plot in this kind of anime.Again, it\'s not bad, it\'s just not for everybody. The show looks nice, sounds nice, the characters are decent and the plot, even if super convenient, is alright. You should definitely watch a few episodes before really deciding if this is your thing or not. aggressive teenagers who beat and rape people in parks and streets, and school girls go around killing people and kidnapping children without any consequences whatsoever.

This girl is the classical perfect one: beautiful, decisive, kind, and actually intelligent. Nevertheless, just like everyone in this world, she has a defect: a lot of personality problems. Due to the emptiness she felt, Satou despairly searched for the true meaning of \'love\' through a the perfect sweet life with a little called Shio.Just with the start, you can see everything here is going wrong. You haven\'t started watching the show, and it\'s easy...to become aware of the awful situation of that.Something you should know when you are going to watch this, is that you won\'t like any one of the characters. It reaches the moment that anything that happens to any of them doesn\'t matter at all. Some dies? Ok, goodbye. That\'s all on your mind. They don\'t really mind.Whenever the story continues, a lot of different awful people appears with their own problems. As I said, they are totally disgusting and you won\'t like them.Now, it\'s time to talk about the artistic side of this anime. Despite the good tracks you will find in the show, I can\'t say the same with the animation quality. It\'s not the worst I\'ve watched, but it\'s so far to be the best.This series is fulfilled with a lot of immorality, depravity, ignominy, and the constant: I feel bad for myself, so I can do anything I want to become happy. That\'s a thought I absolutely can\'t stand.After all the negative aspects of this I\'ve said, why is my score a 5 and not a 1? Well, that\'s simple. At least, I can say this is \'enjoyable\' and, sometimes, has some interesting themes to debate and learn. You can learn the consequences of acting on your own and the hidden cruelty in so many people.If are interested on this, you can give a try, but I recommend you to go to anything else unless you are willing to waste your time. to become aware of the awful situation of that.Something you should know when you are going to watch this, is that you won\'t like any one of the characters.

I was reluctant to watch this because I thought it'd be some happy fluffy Shoujo with a lot of pastries and candy. Boy was I wrong.This anime is so yandere that it makes Yuno from Mirai Nikki look wholesome. And anime with literal Yandere characters isn't extremely common, so this is a very nice change.-The OP/End songs are pretty good.-The characters look fairly standard but their personalities are absolutely extreme. Just don't expect realistic personalities. This anime is the Kill la Kill of character personalities, which may be a negative for some, but not a big deal for others.-A good...amount of shock value that will make you wonder what could possibly top the last f***** up thing you saw.-The animation is fair, nothing to brag about but it's not bad either.-The pacing is just right. There are several plot developments in each episode, and at least one really f***** up scene for each.Overall I give this anime an 8/10 because it is a fresh take on the crazy yandere trope. amount of shock value that will make you wonder what could possibly top the last f***** up thing you saw.-The animation is fair, nothing to brag about but it's not bad either.-The pacing is just right.

Low and behold, I got something rather unexpected and, at times, uncomfortable to watch with what the series explores with its plot and characters.Focused on high schooler Sato Matsuzaka and a little girl named Shio sharing an apartment together, Happy Sugar Life starts off being as deceptive as the titles I mentioned above in assuming you think it will be a cutesy slice-of-life title...involving our two leads, all the way down to the opening sequence for it not having a hint to the anime\'s more darker side. Beneath its cutesy facade, Happy Sugar Life is actually a psychological horror series delving into the more depraved elements of humanity and how such things can warp the mentality of those raised under such circumstances. Sato and Shio are characters of such circumstances with what Happy Sugar Life explores of their back stories and how their upbringings each effect them mentally, Sato especially as she does some rather heinous and, at times, deadly deeds to ensure her so-called ""happy sugar life"" is maintained with her living arrangements and bond with Shio. The exploration of Sato and Shio\'s characters are nicely done with exploring how dark and mentally jarring their past experiences shaped both of them to develop their bond with one another, at points even getting rather uncomfortable to watch that adds to how effective it shows how the bond may not be one for audiences to be completely sympathetic to.The addition of other characters to the series is a bit of a mixed bag. There are some like Shio\'s brother Asahi and Sato\'s close friend Shouko that make for solid additions to Happy Sugar Life\'s plot as they start to unravel more about the circumstances surrounding Sato and Shio\'s predicament, as well as facing their own developments in regards to the circumstances. Others like Taiyou and Kitaumekawa-sensei were a bit too over-the-top with their behavior and actions to be taken seriously and felt mostly like shallow archetypes in the show\'s exploration of humanity\'s depravity.The show also carries with it some issues in regards to its execution. It does take some time for the anime to start picking up steam in exploring Sato and Shio\'s characters, as we are otherwise introduced to the mentioned over-the-top characters in the series and Sato\'s actions to thwart anyone getting in the way of her bond with Shio. Also, there are occasions where the show\'s attempts at trying to come off serious can feel sloppy in their execution thanks to how over-the-top some of the characters come across with their actions, this being especially notable with Taiyou, Sato\'s aunt, and Kitaumekawa.Setting aside these issues, Happy Sugar Life is otherwise still a mostly solid psychological horror series whose cutesy facade hides an impactful and disturbing look at how people can be effected from being raised under horrific circumstances by their caretakers. I\'d at least recommend checking it out once to see how effective its horror elements and character exploration are. involving our two leads, all the way down to the opening sequence for it not having a hint to the anime\'s more darker side.

It was a very strange experience. Looking back, I didn\'t expect it to turn out the way it did.Love is a popular phenomenon throughout the world. It\'s praised and glorified as a wonderful and beautiful thing. However, that\'s all it is...a thing. No one has a solid definition of what love actually is. We think we understand it, but we describe it in various ways, mostly related to feelings. Most of us can\'t come up with a concise statement that truly breaks down what love is; love is understood differently by everyone.Because of...this, love is kind of like an eldritch abomination. We don\'t really know what it is, but we definitely know how it makes us feel. Overwhelming passion. Adoration. Elation. Security. Possession. Obsession. Madness. So, so sweet...The romance genre likes to portray love as a happy, pure, and fulfilling experience, but anyone who\'s experienced romantic feelings knows that there\'s a darker aspect to it. Jealousy. Insecurity. Heartbreak. Nausea. Abuse. Stalking. Being hurt by a person you love can lead to mental health issues, such as depression. It\'s not uncommon to hear of people committing suicide after a breakup.It really is scary, isn\'t it? You get incredibly attached to that one person. They make the world around you glitter. Reality is spinning as you get closer to them. They consume all your thoughts. Every time you see them interacting with someone else, that person is just another obstacle to you. Competition. Seeing them look so happy together makes your skin crawl and your blood boil. It makes you want to vomit.In Happy Sugar Life, the heroine, Satou, experiences this intense emotion after meeting a beautiful nymphet called Shio, who remarks that Satou\'s ""jar"" is empty but not broken, which represents her desire for meaning. Satou has never felt happiness this intense before, and she becomes intoxicated with it. She wants nothing more than to maintain this feeling she calls ""love"". As a result, she becomes insane and emotionally unstable.It\'s important to note that every character in this show experiences something they call ""love"" in their own individual ways, and every single one of them becomes at least somewhat insane because of it. Their ""love"" is also always connected to some kind of pain or trauma. The objects of their affections reveal some aspects of their personalities and inner selves. For example, Satou was always aware that a feeling known as ""love"" existed, but she didn\'t understand it. She didn\'t understand happiness, kindness, or warmth. When she met Shio, it was like a blind person seeing colors for the first time, or a deaf person suddenly hearing music. Her attraction to a young child is morally objectionable to most people, but Satou only sees it as pure, beautiful, fulfilling, and sweet. In a way, her love of Shio is metaphorical: she\'s young and vulnerable, pure and inexperienced, beautiful and weak. She adores Shio like a lion adores an antelope; she sustains her in a way that nothing else can.Love isn\'t necessarily what Satou and popular culture make it out to be. In the real world, love is conditional. Would your parents still love you if you weren\'t theirs? Why is it that people who are considered physically unattractive have difficulty in romance? Why do people who don\'t fit into social norms often end up bullied and friendless?When you fall in love with a person, do you really love that person, or the image of them you created? Why is it that when we fall in love, we tend to focus on the positive aspects of our loved ones and ignore the negatives? Why do so many abused people repeatedly end up in more abusive relationships? Would you still love your partner if they became severely depressed, physically or mentally disabled, or old?I can\'t offer any answers to these questions, but I hope Happy Sugar Life makes you want to answer them for yourself. this, love is kind of like an eldritch abomination.

Animation isn\'t the most fluid but it serves its purpose, the color palette is also good making a depressing tone while not falling into a desperate attempt to look ""dark"" (like some other anime we already talk about).Sound 7/10Average soundtrack, everything I said about the Art applies here too. Not too amazing but not bad, either.The ED and OP songs are great though, so it boosted the score a bit.Character 6/10Okay so here is where this anime gets fishy. Let\'s start with the actual good characters that thankfully are the main characters, Satou and Shio.Satou is your typical tsundere can be cute but can also be scary, Satou makes sense and through the story go fordward we start to understand her personality and traumas.Shio is a shy and cute loli, her ""development"" is pretty much the same as Satou, but unlike Satou, Shio doesn\'t understand anything and gets confused while entering a state of shock, very realistic child trauma reaction here.Now, the rest of the cast is pretty much plain with poorly written personalities which is a shame since the main characters aren\'t that bad.But i won\'t enter into detail here so my reveiw don\'t end up as a 400 pages thesis about human behavior.See the anime and judge the side characters by yourself. lol.Enjoyment 8/10Overall the anime is enjoyable to look at, with only a few bad exceptions.Again, nothing too crazy.Overall 7.5/10Happy Sugar Life Is definitely worth watching if you want some cassual edgy fun anime or if you have some free time.But if you are looking for a Serious Dark or a Smart Adult anime, better go watch Elfen Lied or something else cuz Happy Sugar Life is not for you.If you took the time to read all my rambling wall of text, then Thank you xD Here have a cookie. üç™ premise, a young waifu/girl that found love from a homeless loli, then she decides to make a happy life for the two by whatever means it takes to accomplish .Easy and simple story anyone can follow, okay nothing wrong here, but nothing too great eitherSimply by its concept you already know it doesn\'t have too much potential for anything crazy.Art 8/10Good.

Well that was...mostly true before she met Shio that is.Satou is a freshman at Makikou High School and primarily works at Cure √° Cute, her image around her acquaintances is rather gentle and kind in nature and who gets along with people.She actually says that she don't feel anything about anyone around her!(Instead of Shio that is)She live with her AUNT or so everyone thinks, but in truth she lives with Shio. works for her to get money and live without any of those problems!BTW a little spoiler SATOU IS A SAVAGE!

The anime adapts the manga ahead of itself, essentially, as of this writing, the manga is still ongoing and may or may not reach the same conclusions as the anime. Many points I\'ve raised about the series as a whole from my manga review can also be applied here. Hence, I\'m only looking into this purely from an anime standpoint.The anime has been frequently described as a ""psycho-horror love story"" but it doesn\'t accomplish the horror parts particularly...well. As I\'ve mentioned in my manga review, Happy Sugar Life consists of 2 halves, a ""Happy Sugar Life"" part of SoL delights with Satou and Shio, and an ""Salty Bitter Death"" part with all the other stuff. Quite frankly it\'s rubbish at the latter and I\'ve only enjoyed it mostly for the cutesy (genuinely cutesy) SoL elements, to which there are too few in this adaptation. The anime mainly focuses on the poorly written grim stuff, which is to its detriment more to anything.The animation itself is fine. For Ezola\'s first ever work, it\'s pretty decent. Very Diomedia-like in quality. Nothing special, some blemishes here and there that hurt the overall presentation but nothing to the level of Maerchen Maedhen. Some genuinely clever moments of visual direction and cinematography, but not enough of it. The main theme of Happy Sugar Life is brilliant and its leitmotif is heard throughout the soundtrack, making for some atmospheric scenes that complement some of my favourite manga scenes very well.  It\'s a bittersweet piece that\'s honestly a bit overpowering, but definitely one that makes an impact. The OP and ED are similarly well crafted and portray the overall theme of the story (the duality of Sweetness and Saltiness of the duo\'s lives) quite well in under 2 minutes.I will say to its credit the anime manages to condense over 40 chapters of manga (and ongoing!) into 12 episodes. It\'s a very efficient adaptation, most of the filler stuff is removed and some events are retooled slightly for a quicker pacing. Though I\'ve noticed it cut a lot more from the later chapters than the earlier chapters. Yuuna\'s backstory I feel is improved this way, while other events such as the buildup and payoff to a certain Little Bird\'s demise feels awkward and is less effective as a result.I\'ve iterated before that the grim stuff is poorly written. But seeing it in animation lends a ""So Bad It\'s Hilarious"" kind of quality to them, akin to a cheesy B-Horror film. Scenes meant to shock and terrify end up eliciting a laugh from me, turning this into my second most favourite blood-related comedy series with HanaKana as a main this season.To its credit, the ending to the series is done decently well.

As I\'ve mentioned in my manga review, Happy Sugar Life consists of 2 halves, a ""Happy Sugar Life"" part of SoL delights with Satou and Shio, and an ""Salty Bitter Death"" part with all the other stuff. Quite frankly it\'s rubbish at the latter and I\'ve only enjoyed it mostly for the cutesy (genuinely cutesy) SoL elements, to which there are too few in this adaptation. The anime mainly focuses on the poorly written grim stuff, which is to its detriment more to anything.The animation itself is fine. For Ezola\'s first ever work, it\'s pretty decent. Very Diomedia-like in quality. Nothing special, some blemishes here and there that hurt the overall presentation but nothing to the level of Maerchen Maedhen. Some genuinely clever moments of visual direction and cinematography, but not enough of it. The main theme of Happy Sugar Life is brilliant and its leitmotif is heard throughout the soundtrack, making for some atmospheric scenes that complement some of my favourite manga scenes very well.  It\'s a bittersweet piece that\'s honestly a bit overpowering, but definitely one that makes an impact. The OP and ED are similarly well crafted and portray the overall theme of the story (the duality of Sweetness and Saltiness of the duo\'s lives) quite well in under 2 minutes.I will say to its credit the anime manages to condense over 40 chapters of manga (and ongoing!) into 12 episodes. It\'s a very efficient adaptation, most of the filler stuff is removed and some events are retooled slightly for a quicker pacing. Though I\'ve noticed it cut a lot more from the later chapters than the earlier chapters. Yuuna\'s backstory I feel is improved this way, while other events such as the buildup and payoff to a certain Little Bird\'s demise feels awkward and is less effective as a result.I\'ve iterated before that the grim stuff is poorly written. But seeing it in animation lends a ""So Bad It\'s Hilarious"" kind of quality to them, akin to a cheesy B-Horror film. Scenes meant to shock and terrify end up eliciting a laugh from me, turning this into my second most favourite blood-related comedy series with HanaKana as a main this season.To its credit, the ending to the series is done decently well. It ends as you\'d expect but the execution of the scene is enjoyable enough. For a moment you get a tinge of the ""horror"" element played up.

The weaker of the HanaKana-focused blood-related comedy show.', 'Yanderes never fail to entertain.I\'m not gonna lie, I\'ve been waiting for a good yandere story since Mirai Nikki; they always add psychological elements and make for a relatively interesting story. Of course, you can\'t compare these two shows just due to one character. Both have their strengths and weaknesses and differences in tone and story. But, Happy Sugar Life has a very different psychological issue to deal with: pedophilia.Probably the one thing that stood out to me with this was that there were no happy endings, ironically, given the title. In most shows there is at least one final option or destination that...is achievable for the protagonist. In Shio\'s case, however, there is almost no happy ending (unless you side with Satou and are okay with pedophilia in fiction). Either she ends up with a pedophile (who is clearly grooming her), ends up with a grosser pedophile (who\'s so unlikeable I skipped almost every scene with him), or her family (where she was abused and abandoned).Because of this lack of a happy end, I felt a strong sense of tension throughout the show. I knew that this wasn\'t going to end well, the question was just ""how.""I wouldn\'t recommend this show if you\'re looking for a serious psychological thriller or a yandere-themed haunt.

All characters are weird and perverted, but most of them ""redeem"" themselves by at least being interesting.The tone is kinda dark, which creates a stark contrast to...the ""happy sugar""-scenes.And of course, Satou is a great protagonist: She\'s not completely deranged as other yanderes and even tries to solve most of her problems without the use of physical violence - she excells at psychological warfare though. the ""happy sugar""-scenes.And of course, Satou is a great protagonist: She\'s not completely deranged as other yanderes and even tries to solve most of her problems without the use of physical violence - she excells at psychological warfare though.', 'This was a weird anime.

Doesn't matter if you go on your phone, zone out or put it in your background, just keep watching and see how the mess turns out. I really think its worth a watch. The ending was what bumped my score from like a 5 to 8. I was thinking about it for ages.Arts is okay, music is pretty good.

The ending isn't a complete deal-breaker though, as it contrasts to otherwise pretty good story writing, I felt. I'll admit that certain themes made me feel uneasy, but they do exist in reality, so their exploration through...the story was pretty well handled, especially in that they made me think more carefully about the characters and how these themes contributed to the story as it developed. I'll also give some credit for the foreshadowing in the first episode and how it's surprisingly resolved in the final episode as well. I appreciated the thought-provoking and often surprising twists that the story took.Art - 10/10Seemingly moe, if the promotional media is to go by. I was nervous about how such an art style would lend itself to horror, but it did so very well, which was a pleasant surprise. The art-style works very well for the positive and happy scenes, owed to the more pastel-like colours that get used, along with special effects that help with setting the mood. In contrast, night scenes and scenes with are filled with darkness left me feeling quite immersed as well, which was a pleasant surprise. I'll admit, the cat-like pupil's for the Koubes were a bit odd, but they at least drew my attention, which I can respect. Horror scenes weren't as gory as I thought they would be, which I'm honestly okay with.Sound - 9/10An area which is handled quite well, though with the music, I felt something was lacking. The OP and ED are fine, but nothing spectacular. The ED for episode 9 (ReoNa - Canaria) did stand out however, being both a simple, yet well performed song and a perfect accompaniment to the events that were taking place and doing an excellent job of adding emotional weight to the scenes occurring in the foreground.Voice acting contributed more heavily to my scoring in this area however. I've heard Hanazawa's performances in a number of other anime, but I think her performance in Happy Sugar Life is among her best, as I was treated to a wider range of emotions than I'm used to hearing from her and the lines were delivered just as well as I'd come to expect from Kana as well. The rest of the cast also do a great job, in terms of voice acting, with Kuno (Shio) putting in a similarly good performance, along with the other main characters well. I always appreciate voice acting that helps bring a character to life and all of the main characters, along with some of the supporting characters were all portrayed very well I felt, across a wide range of emotions and situations, especially the psychology-driven scenes that are relatively difficult to perform.Character - 9/10So many psychological issues - yikes ':/ I can understand why some people just don't like any of the characters - almost all of them have major flaws. Personally, I think that despite how disturbing they may be to watch at times, such characters are what made the story interesting. As the story unravelled and I began to see the source of the characters' psychological issues, some of them became easier to sympathise with and others at least became easier to understand. I liked that relationships to Satou were explored in good depth, in that they helped explain how complex a character she was. Trying to understand the intricacies of various relationships between the characters throughout the series was also quite the experience, which I'm not complaining about, as this aspect helped with engagement.Enjoyment - 9/10This is a bit of a weird one, despite the awkward themes that get regularly explored throughout the series, I actually found myself quite invested in the story from start to finish. In terms of romance, there was a good bit of content, though very unconventional, meaning that I had to think a bit in order to sympathise with the characters in various scenes - a good thing in my book, at least from a keeping interest and keeping me engaged perspective. Tension is used a fair bit throughout the anime as well, to good effect, which I liked (worked very well with the yandere lead at least). I'll admit, there were also a few moments where the developments of the story were quite depressing (character deaths), but I take the emotional response to be a sign of good story writing and character portrayal.Overall - 9/10An interesting concept; a love story driven by unfortunate circumstances and psychological issues.

Lots of cute and wholesome momentsbut jesus christ the fanbase of viewers who take this shit the wrong way LMAO...I cannot imagine being that deranged I cannot imagine being that deranged', '""Happy Sugar Life"" so far has me hooked.  This show is creepy on a whole different level than most anime I have seen.  It takes concepts we all know and understand but actually portrays them in a tragic and intense manner.  The characters are not completely unique but they are all done well.  The main character Satou has a backstory that is yet to be revealed yet seems to be one of the most interesting characters I have seen in quite a long time.  Not only is Satou a great character but the side characters...seem to have a decent amount of screen time as well.  One character, which I will not name for spoiler purposes, did a complete 180 from what I had expected.  The way the show throws off your expectations and makes you question your morals is great!I have been craving a good show to watch for some time of watching cookie cutter basic shows and ""Happy Sugar Life"" has not let me down.  Certain events that happen in the show, with some strategically placed mystery, make you think deeply about what you think is the right thing to do and about how these things actually happen somewhere in the world.  It tugs at your heart strings and draws you in with creativity and the need to find out what happens next.  So far it seems every episode ends with a cliff hanger, but that just may be me wanting more of it.The art is great.  It isn\'t so beautiful as to be on the same level as ""Your Name"" or something of the like, but it is still very pleasing to the eye.  The character designs, the auras behind the people, and the atmosphere are all very well done and somewhat stylized.  I won\'t lie, it isn\'t something that we haven\'t really seen before.  It isn\'t as recognizable as ""One Piece"" or ""Death Note"" but that doesn\'t mean the art isn\'t well done.The sound in ""Happy Sugar Life"" is awesome!  Not only is the voice acting phenomenal but the music as well is very well placed and perfectly executed.  When the mood of a character swings, the music follows suit.  When things are good, the music is bubbly and happy.  When the mood is dark, the music is eerie  and intense.  Not to mention the beginning theme song and its unique sound and the ability to replay it.  The ending theme song is not as memorable as the beginning, but that may be because I skipped it once or twice.  The voice acting as I mentioned before is very well done.  Some characters are shown screaming, drooling, laughing hysterically, threatening, giggling and so on and so forth - all done perfectly.  Matsuzaka Satou is voiced by Kanazawa Hana and she does a great job with switching her voice from a sweet sounding cute girl to a menacing and bold yandere.  Hanae Natsuki, the voice actor for Mitsuboshi Tayou, also does a very good job at following the constant mood swings and grotesque sound effects while still remaining to sound like a perfectly nice guy when he is not alone.Over all I would say ""Happy Sugar Life"" is very promising and even if what I or others may say does not seem to appeal to you I would still check it out regardless.  People often follow the three episode rule, there are four out as I am writing this, so if you don\'t see fit to watch any more when the rest comes out, then obviously it is not your thing.  The show seems very lighthearted and cute on the surface, but I assure you it is not.  As I mentioned before, ""Happy Sugar Life"" is deep, dark, and disturbing.  That being said it is incredibly entertaining if you are not of the fainthearted and I believe it is very enjoyable.  I will be waiting for the rest of the season to come out :)~WolfAlliance~ seem to have a decent amount of screen time as well.  One character, which I will not name for spoiler purposes, did a complete 180 from what I had expected.  The way the show throws off your expectations and makes you question your morals is great!I have been craving a good show to watch for some time of watching cookie cutter basic shows and ""Happy Sugar Life"" has not let me down.  Certain events that happen in the show, with some strategically placed mystery, make you think deeply about what you think is the right thing to do and about how these things actually happen somewhere in the world.  It tugs at your heart strings and draws you in with creativity and the need to find out what happens next.  So far it seems every episode ends with a cliff hanger, but that just may be me wanting more of it.The art is great.  It isn\'t so beautiful as to be on the same level as ""Your Name"" or something of the like, but it is still very pleasing to the eye.  The character designs, the auras behind the people, and the atmosphere are all very well done and somewhat stylized.  I won\'t lie, it isn\'t something that we haven\'t really seen before.  It isn\'t as recognizable as ""One Piece"" or ""Death Note"" but that doesn\'t mean the art isn\'t well done.The sound in ""Happy Sugar Life"" is awesome!

Such a sweet sweet title ""Happy Sugar Life"" and the characters are sooo cute to. Not to mention the sweet pastel colors. Oh man this anime is going to be so sweet, is what I thought first without reading the tags.This anime is deeper than i thought it would be. I\'m going to give my point of view how I see the messages and symbolism. So buckle up and enjoy my review.I usually don‚Äôt watch these kind of anime so it was all new for me. I needed a lot...of patience to go trough the first few episodes. It felt like I was drowning in honey, in their sweet dreams and believes. It was so slow. In combination with the setting it made me uneasy. Was this the purpose? Was this part of the symbolism? Or just bad animation. Either way it just worked out in the end.--- It‚Äôs all opinion ---The pastel colors made it look like a child‚Äôs perspective. The soft colors made it all look like candy. Whenever there was a happy moment you could feel at ease with the shining background. That was really cleverly done. It shows how the children live in a fantasy world. Whenever the characters face hardship the screen is not or mildly deformed. It shows that the reality is hard. This nuance was done very clever.This anime is actually more than a horror. The characters tries their very best to live and get ‚Äúlove‚Äù by all means. They are the victim of someone else who are either delusional or are also hurt. This can clearly be seen by Taiyou, who got abused by his female boss. He is first a normal teen, but then has to deal with a huge trauma. Out of desperation he wants a younger person to love. This is in proportion when you think about the age gap with the boss and Taiyou. He tries to get his act together but fails to, because he is just a child. These flaws in the persons make them more nuanced and human.And all characters suffer in some sort of the same way, they got hurt and are going to hurt the next person. They are either scarred or they are going to leave a scar. A vicious cycle of pain passed on from grown up to child. I actually fell sorry for Taiyou and Asahi, they were the victims.Shio is depicted as the savior here. Satou, Taiyou and Asahi all want her to save them, give them love. She has no bad sides and she is as bright as the sun. She will shine on and do her best to make her loved one happy. She feels no hate or jealousy and will even wait for Satou. But in the end she is just a perfect doll. She isn‚Äôt really real. That‚Äôs because she has no bad sides. She just had a bad memory and even then she isn‚Äôt angry at her mom. She fits in the delusional word of the ‚Äúhappy sugar‚Äù life.And this brings me to why I‚Äôm annoyed by her. She is just sweet, does what you ask her to and show no sign of being human. No ordinary child will act as she does. But she is kept ignorant by everyone, so she isn‚Äôt to blame.Satou is actually the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù. She has mental problems and is delusional. She tries to find her love by all means. And when she found her love, Shio, she will do everything to keep that. Besides from being influenced by her hot aunt (pin me down as I‚Äôm scared and horny) Satou is more like a psychopath. She carefully evaluates how to eliminate ‚Äúthreats‚Äù of her love life. But the way she handles the problems feels more natural. Putting up a fa√ßade/mask to hide that she is sick, and when it comes down to it she will go all out to save what she loves. Satou wants to indulge in her own world, her castle, her happy sugar life. She has lost sight of being child and human. She tries to live the live of a lover on the loose. In the end that won‚Äôt just work out. I don‚Äôt know if I find it sad or that I wanted that she was gone.I recommend this anime to people who liked death note. I was super annoyed how ""perfect"" Shio acted but i guess that part of the show. It doesn\'t have a 8 or 9 because the flow of the show felt choppy. of patience to go trough the first few episodes.

I had high hopes but none of them really came through. There were a few small aspects to the storyline I enjoyed but overall - quite predictable and bland. The psycho element was purely just that and nothing...more.

[Major Spoilers]STORY: 6/10The story on the shallow level seems quite interesting. It\'s about a girl who falls in love with a child that she\'s recently begun to take care of. Even more interesting is how the same girl she takes care of is being searched for by an amount of people.What makes this story flawed is the love between the girls and the lack of common sense (or any sense at all) that almost every single character has. This makes much of the story unbearable and ruins parts of the plot that...could\'ve turned out for the better.The romance is simply the protagonist\'s obsession with a cute girl and a mutual response from the girl since the protagonist is her caretaker. There is no justice for anyone who takes or tries to take the small girl away from her normal home- especially the protagonist. With a romance based on nothing but the feeling of relief that the protagonist feels with the girl, there is almost no reason for her to go so far as she does to protect her ""happiness"" other than her being created as a yandere.CHARACTERS: 5/10Satou: She\'s the girl who loves Shio so dearly. The reason is simply because Shio washes all her problems away. The story creates her as a yandere so therefore she has the need to protect Shio at all costs. This is not at all good because that gives no valid reasoning towards why she is infatuated with Shio like she is. It better yet doesn\'t justify why she should be able to get away with her crimes or even commit them in the first place. However, since she\'s a yandere she must do all of that, right?Shio: She\'s a child who sadly rejects those truly dearest to her for someone who has recently shown her care. She doesn\'t have any morals at all and even pits her own ""lover"" over her family despite not meeting Satou for long.  Shio can\'t be helped because of her age and therefore that allows Satou to manipulate her for enough time to the point where Shio can\'t imagine a life without Satou. Satou\'s influence affects Shio for the rest of her life and I\'ve already explained how such a weak link led to these lasting results (and how dumb that is).Shouko: One of the 2 characters in this show who\'s sensible. She understands what is wrong with Satou and almost the rest of the cast. She\'s bold enough to stand up to all of them when they\'re in the wrong. Due to her personality conflicting with the yandere that is Satou, she is killed off just like that.Taiyou: He\'s just fucked up. He\'s the epitome of all the injustice that occurs in this anime. He has the idolization of Shio for no valid reason other than materialization (sees her as an anti-depressant- a lot like Satou does). He tries to take Shio and commit crimes that aren\'t justified in the slightest. He\'s luckily punished for all he does while Satou gets off scot-free. What doesn\'t make sense is how he gets punished for doing much of the same of what Satou does. But I forgot, Satou takes care of Shio and is a yandere so she\'s excused from this.Asahi: The other normal character in this series. He desperately wants to get his sister back and gets punished for this. She rejects his love after he tries so hard to get her back. Since Satou cares so much for her anti-depressant and is a yandere, she gets to keep custody of her stolen good. Asahi is good-hearted and wants the best for his sister, but the world that is this anime doesn\'t want the best for him in return. This is okay, but the means of doing this through Satou\'s unjust actions and Shio\'s misguided rejection of his affection is simply just wrong.ART: 7/10The art was solid. The OP sequence art was really good at portraying the corrupt nature of this series. The special effects during the fires or when Satou and Shio were having a wholesome moment was well made.SOUND: 7/10The OP song definitely carried this. The OST itself was okay, but there were some songs that I definitely liked over others.ENJOYMENT: 6/10I didn\'t like how this show buffed Satou to the point where she couldn\'t be affected by anything that got in her way. The only challenge that ended up facing her was her own suicide. The anime just didn\'t make me feel great watching it at all, nor did it give me any reason to feel good about what Satou was doing.OVERALL: 6/10I originally gave this a 7 but demoted it to a 6 solely because of how the way the characters represented the story a lot worse than they could\'ve. Almost all the characters lack any morals and makes their actions in the story confusing to understand. If you\'re thinking that its their emotions that tell them what to do well their emotions are as wild as their thought processes. The story simply becomes utter mayhem with all the wild characters and their actions surrounding a basically untouchable couple.

I feel like this is the right time for me to review it.For this review I will be focusing on the plot, art, characters, music and my enjoyment. There might be some spoilers ahead, so proceed with caution.Story/execution: To be honest, the story seems very scattered and confusing for the first few episodes. I admit that the show can seem a little boring when you don\'t know what\'s going on throughout the story. However, ones you watch further into the show, you will realize that there is actually a...pretty interesting premise underneath. The story is definitely very interesting and the creators seem to know what they are doing. There is also this blend of cuteness and scariness inside, but we have already seen that in many different forms. For example higurashi or gakkou gurashi shared the same cute to scary thing. There are definitely a lot of cheesy and over dramatized moments in this show, they just try way too hard to unsettle you at times.Art:Right off the bat you can tell just by looking at the art style that this will not be a ""happy"" show. The art style gives this aesthetic vibe that definitely manages to unsettle you.  If you are looking for a very dark and gloomy yet still kind of a light art style. Then this show is for you.Music:There isn\'t much to the opening, it\'s a very cutesy opening. However the opening doesn\'t have any replay value in it. It\'s definitely not a bad opening though. I know how subjective music is, but I am not the biggest fan of the opening. The ending song on the other hand is phenomenal, I can listen to the ending a million times and I won\'t get bored of it. Honestly, the ending is one of the best parts about this anime.Characters:The characters come out as exactly what the creator wanted us to think of them as. Our opinions are constantly changing for the characters, it\'s hard to know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Satou nails the yandere trope very well, shio chan is adorable to the core. All the other characters are also brilliant. The characters get enough screen time for you to actually see the plot from their perspective. Ones you get to know all of their back stories, you get to know the reasoning behind their actions. Pretty much of the characters in this anime are pretty evil except for the all mighty shio.Enjoyment: For the first 4 episodes I was bored out of my mind, the cheese was totally getting to me. However later on when I got to know the story a little better, I could find myself enjoying the whole thing. pretty interesting premise underneath. The story is definitely very interesting and the creators seem to know what they are doing.

Then this show is for you.Music:There isn\'t much to the opening, it\'s a very cutesy opening. However the opening doesn\'t have any replay value in it. It\'s definitely not a bad opening though. I know how subjective music is, but I am not the biggest fan of the opening. The ending song on the other hand is phenomenal, I can listen to the ending a million times and I won\'t get bored of it. Honestly, the ending is one of the best parts about this anime.Characters:The characters come out as exactly what the creator wanted us to think of them as. Our opinions are constantly changing for the characters, it\'s hard to know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. Satou nails the yandere trope very well, shio chan is adorable to the core. All the other characters are also brilliant. The characters get enough screen time for you to actually see the plot from their perspective. Ones you get to know all of their back stories, you get to know the reasoning behind their actions. Pretty much of the characters in this anime are pretty evil except for the all mighty shio.Enjoyment: For the first 4 episodes I was bored out of my mind, the cheese was totally getting to me. However later on when I got to know the story a little better, I could find myself enjoying the whole thing.', 'So let\'s start:___________________________________*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*___________________________________This is a story about a Yandere, Satou Matsuzaka who is in love with a loli(Shio Koube) whom she kidnapped and is keeping her locked away in a room which she got by murdering the person who owned the room and for some reason the apartments caretaker(who is never shown) hasn\'t found about it.This girl meets several psychologically challenged perverts in her life and dominates them all and I don\'t know how.....She can kill two guys by taking out their eyes and they didn\'t make any effort to run or self-defense....They just sit there terrified....YEP, these are the same...guys who can beat two other guys without breaking a sweat.There is a manager who wants everyone who works at her restaurant to love her and if one doesn\'t then she sexually abuses them and locks them in a cupboard.Now there is a blonde pervert who is in love with the same loli and is aroused by her touched....There is a teacher who despite of having a wife and child, declares himself single because he wants to make out with a lot of women but deep down inside he is a masochistic pervert.There is a male police officer who is dominated by a middle aged woman(yeh she is freaking beautiful but still) infront of a female police officer.The only two characters I liked are the Loli\'s Brother Asahi Koube(who is searching for her sister), and Satou\'s Friend Hida Shouko. Hida for some reason decides to take a picture of Satou and Shio and succeeds and is then killed by Satou and boom there goes my one of the favorite characters and probably the most decent character in the story.She sends the picture to Asahi so her death wasn\'t in vain I guess.The scene where Satou kills Hida made me hate Satou so much.......The biggest blunder is all this time the police hasn\'t been able to find Satou for murdering 4 people.... Is Japanese police that inefficient or is this show on a whole another level of unrealistic drama..I mean I dont think the girl, Satou has been given lessons to how to be smart and kill with efficiency without leaving evidenceüòÇ. Because no highschool girl can be that smart, powerful and efficient at killing unless she is given lessons.The pathetic attempts to show Satou and Shio\'s cute moments only makes it look more stupid...The lines of Satou, ""Its bitter, I want something sweet"", and her idea that no one else knows how love works is so annoying that it becomes absurd.For me the short moments between Hida and Asahi were more romantic and heart touching than any scene between Satou and Shio....In the end, Satou dies and making Shio a psychopath; honestly it would have been a better ending if Shio died along with Satou.And also I felt really bad for Asahi at the end, its like the one who suffered the most, didn\'t achieve anything, all his efforts were in vain.Recommended - No guys who can beat two other guys without breaking a sweat.There is a manager who wants everyone who works at her restaurant to love her and if one doesn\'t then she sexually abuses them and locks them in a cupboard.Now there is a blonde pervert who is in love with the same loli and is aroused by her touched....There is a teacher who despite of having a wife and child, declares himself single because he wants to make out with a lot of women but deep down inside he is a masochistic pervert.There is a male police officer who is dominated by a middle aged woman(yeh she is freaking beautiful but still) infront of a female police officer.The only two characters I liked are the Loli\'s Brother Asahi Koube(who is searching for her sister), and Satou\'s Friend Hida Shouko.

The reviews said that it was great so I started watching. But right after half of the first episode I knew how crappy this show will be. All of the characters who are trying to be somehow interesting are simply crazy and basic and that's all about them. The OST was...really super boring. Probably the only thing I liked was the art.All of the minutes I spend on watching this are in waste. This anime is pure garbage really super boring. Probably the only thing I liked was the art.All of the minutes I spend on watching this are in waste. This anime is pure garbage"", ""In my opinion, Happy Sugar Life is less of a psychological horror than a mystery tragedy. Mystery in that the audience is not shown the full scope of the circumstances of each characters from the beginning and it is slowly revealed to the viewer, potentially swaying their feelings and opinions throughout the story. Tragedy in that, well, literally every person in the story is worse off by the end of the show, to varying degrees. While that's not to discredit the psychological aspect of the characters or say the show is not frightening at all, I believe they are more of a means to an...end rather than the point of the show itself.Art(8/10)While the art isn't particularly stunning, I believe it is fully satisfactory for the purposes of the show. Personally, visuals are rather low on my priorities when watching an anime and it's very difficult to be so bad as to be distracting from the actual plot (see Berserk 2016-2017, Arifueta, Seven Deadly Sins Season 3). I also really enjoyed the use of visuals to reflect a character's mood and state of mind. Between flowery, warm, colorful backdrops and dark, cold, empty eyes and flashes of static on the screen, I believe the art and animation is totally solid.Sound(7/10)Again, the music and sound didn't particularly stand out and wasn't exactly the most memorable, but it also didn't distract from the show. While the song at the end of episode 9 was quite nice, I honestly can't really recall much other sound or music from the rest of the show so honestly I can't rate it too highly.Story(7/10)Personally, I really enjoyed the way that the show withheld information from the beginning and only gave snippets of it throughout the show until the audience can piece everything together. I love how at the beginning of the show, Satou's relationship with Shio is quite questionable and concerning yet by the end I'm rooting for them to win, knowing their predicaments. That said, I do believe the pacing of the show is a tad slow up until about episode 9, which is where it really picks up for me. This is the part where the show switches gears from mystery to tragedy. The tension becomes higher than ever as the main characters race against time to protect their happy sugar life. One criticism I have though that seems to be shared amongst many viewers is the many unbelievable things that do happen throughout the story, especially towards the end where (SPOILERS) Satou and Shio end up jumping off a building because Satou forgot her ring. Like seriously? How do you forget that? Moreover, you've literally had it for less than a few days, just get a new one? It's especially contradictory when they say how they don't care about leaving their home behind despite having so many happy memories in it as long as they're together, yet when it comes to a ring the just got, it's suddenly a huge deal? Sure they don't necessarily know that they'll run into trouble there but still...(Spoiler rant over)Character (9/10)I really enjoy the characters of Happy Sugar Life. While it is true that they're mostly stale, one dimensional, and pretty much devoid of character development, (besides Shoko and Shio) what I love about them is that they're all crazy (again, besdies Shoko and Shio). Not because I'm just that fond of edgy, psychopathic murderers, but because of the moral questions it raises. More on this later. Although characters in the show don't experience much growth or development, their backstories are mostly fleshed out very well to understand their perspectives and motives.Enjoyment(8/10)If I had were to be more specific, episodes 1-8 would be about 7/10 while episodes 9-12 are 10/10. The first 3/4 of the show is really just build up for the finale, hence the ratings. What I enjoyed the most about the show is learning the context and perspective of all the characters. In a sense, you could call the finale a battle royale between Satou, Taiyou and Asahi. Each of these characters are fighting for Shio, the cup of water that will quench the thirst of the parched desert that is their hearts. In this way, I've found myself really enjoying justifying Satou's actions. I believe she is not an inherently evil person, and that evil lies with intent rather than results. Satou is not necessarily broken but a completely hollow and empty person. Her life is cold and meaningless, and she spends every day in search of the flame that will warm her heart. She finds that flame in Shio, and to ask someone who has known nothing but the harsh and bitter cold of loneliness to part with the flame of love is wholly unreasonable. We even get a glimpse of what parting with Shio would mean for Satou in episode 10, when Shio tells her that she hates Satou. Satou is completely devastated and destroyed. She collapses in grief and fear of living without the flame that is Shio in the cold wilderness of the world. That is Satou is fighting to prevent. To her, losing Shio is essentially emotional death and she would do anything to prevent this. Thus, her actions in protecting her life with Shio could be described as emotional self defense. Anyhow, that's just an example of the mental acrobatics I get to do with this series which really makes it super fun to watch. end rather than the point of the show itself.Art(8/10)While the art isn't particularly stunning, I believe it is fully satisfactory for the purposes of the show.

I wouldn\'t call myself traumatized and I still ended up getting triggered while watching this show.Now that I\'ve...gotten this out of the way, let\'s get into the review. I\'ll try to keep this as short as possible because I just want to go back to pretending that this series does not exist asap.I think it\'s very easy to say in response to criticism of this sort of anime stuff like ""oh, you\'re just unappreciative of psychological horror"" or ""you\'re too sensitive"" or ""the way you\'re looking at this is shallow"", but sometimes you have to step back and really think about why you feel compelled to say that. Personally, I find the fact that so many people are willing to defend this... this series and its objectively morally bankrupt characters disturbing. It\'s genuinely and truly disturbing. I\'m not familiar with the mangaka\'s works (i.e. I\'ve never actually read any of them), but just looking at the covers I can tell that that\'s for the better. What this series looks like to me is like a grown man\'s attempt at projecting his fantasies or weird thoughts onto fictional characters without actually trying to give the story any deeper meaning.And to me, that\'s what is the most wrong about this show (and I assume the source material as well).When I think of actually good psychological horror, I think of stories that leave you devastated and almost broken, but at the same time, make you want to change the world for the better. On the other hand, poor examples of psychological horror are anime like these: anime where very real sorts of trauma and serious themes are confronted, only for the confrontation to do a 180 and deliver no lesson. No lesson, no payoff, no nothing. As I watched the anime, I felt dead. Now, I feel even deader. This sort of emptiness is not the sort of thing you should try and make your viewer feel.I won\'t even touch on how disturbing and edgy some aspects of the anime were. The first two episodes were insane and really set something up, but then... by the end, again. I was barely feeling anything. This anime wasn\'t keeping me on my toes; yes, I was hoping for something good to happen, but the problem with that is that this hope was fully unfounded; if this series really were as good as so many people claim it to be (I saw one person actually try and compare it with Shakespeare), it would\'ve dangled said hope before my eyes, torturing me with it, or it would\'ve given me tiny snatches of relief and happiness only to crush them later. The latter happened just once in the series with Shouko. For the rest... I\'d say that the reason why it dubbed itself ""psychological"" was to have an excuse to be as edgy as possible.When it comes to the characters and the way certain concepts are expressed through them, all of that isn\'t done very well. Satou, an objectively delusional and repulsive individual who also happens to be the main character, is an empty waste of space. I don\'t really know how else to put it and I don\'t want to waste another word on her. She had no character development, and I was happy to see that what happened to her at the end happen. Or as happy as I could be while still feeling dead inside. Why she grew attached to Shio was never explained, either.Also, her character design, while okay, doesn\'t make any sense within the context of the series and suffers acutely from ""main character so colorful eyes and hair and quirky hairstyle"" syndrome. Literally two other people in the whole series have somewhat abnormal hair colors (I\'m assuming that Taiyou\'s hair was dyed, so he barely even counts), and I didn\'t notice any of the background characters (like the passersby) look in any way distinguishable from one another.Shio was a mostly static character. She didn\'t seem like a real person to me. All she ever did was run around and smile and laugh and occasionally have mental breakdowns due to trauma, which is understandable. She\'s a heavily traumatized grade schooler, after all. She has a moment where she suddenly experiences some sort of... ""awakening"", I guess (I wouldn\'t necessarily call it character growth), but what depressed me was that this awakening didn\'t last. I will say that Shio\'s mental state was put into perspective very well during the last episode, but it\'s disappointing that that was done in a ""tell, not show"" way. Whatever, though. At least the anime did something. I don\'t know how to explain it, but when it came to the rest of Shio\'s backstory, even though I was conscious of the horrific nature of it, I felt nothing.Taiyou is definitely a... yeah, he\'s a character. I don\'t even know if he\'s worse or better than Satou from any standpoint. Like literally every other character in the show, he experienced no character growth (he did have a moment where he tried, but then he failed and never tried to improve after that - terrible writing strikes again), and as one reviewer correctly pointed out, was abandoned at the end of the series. This left a weird taste in my mouth because for all the series\' emphasis that rape happens not just to women, it didn\'t even attempt to resolve Taiyou\'s story. It threw him away simply because he wasn\'t the protagonist and considering that he\'s just as vile and zealous in his pedophilic and obsessive tendencies as Satou is, that makes me feel intensely uncomfortable. Not because he\'s a pure ""soft boi"" who deserves the world or anything (he does not - he deserves therapy and maybe a hit by a bus), but because, in spite of the series trying to assert that even girls can exhibit pedophilic tendencies, it punishes only the guy (you\'ll see what I mean by that if you go against my advice and actually watch this). The subtle message that this ends up (hopefully, and sadly) unintentionally sending is that as long as you\'re a girl and a pedophile, you\'re less ""bad"" than if you\'re a guy and into similarly repulsive stuff. That is NOT a message you want to send and seeing as this is a shounen anime, tagged as GL, and is deceptively ""cute"" on the surface, I can 10000% guarantee that at least some of its watchers interpreted Shio and Satou\'s relationship as a positive one. If you did that, take a step back and consider booking an appointment with a psychiatrist just in case.The aunt was gross and I hated her. She was also poorly written and the epitome of ""adult bad"" syndrome.Speaking of ""adult bad"" syndrome and the aforementioned Taiyou (as well as the other characters that do not trust adults): I find it hard to believe that Taiyou\'s mom has never seen the inside of his room and doesn\'t have questions about his mental state (he\'s very clearly unstable), and I also think it\'s weird that the only teacher at Satou\'s school that we\'re introduced to is the masochist pedophile. The fact that the series has no genuinely kind or respectable adults is another weak point of the plot, and it\'s hard to believe that this was done deliberately to convey some deep message about how abuse isolates or something like that.The only two characters that I actually liked were Asahi and Shouko, with Shouko being the most sane character out of the entire cast. She deserved a much better life than the one she was given. I\'m not sure about how I feel about her and Asahi in relation to each other because I was unable to verify Asahi\'s age, so I won\'t discuss that.Asahi seemed to have weirdly obsessive feelings towards Shio, but this was never really directly explored. It was explained why he was so bent on finding her, but some of the other things he does seem to indicate something a lot darker lurking below the surface. I\'ll just chalk that up to bad writing because this show has absolutely killed me.In other words, as I said earlier: this show hurls trauma and dark topics at its viewers over and over, but it doesn\'t explain or finish explaining those decisions very well, which is an issue. Thus, it seems to be acting edgy only for the sake of being called that. Moving on.The art of this anime is pretty mediocre. It does reflect the deceptive cutesiness that is the theme of the show - sweet delusion - but not clearly enough to remind SOME people that THIS IS NOT A TRAGIC LOVE STORY. Jesus Christ. The opening animation sequence is pretty good though and sets the stage well. For some reason, though, the closing theme\'s animation sequence doesn\'t do the same and I find that to be very strange.Speaking of the opening and closing, the sole saving grace of this anime was the sound and music. The voice acting seemed pretty good to me, and the music (with the exception of the ending theme, which was pleasing to the ear but pretty forgettable) was nice as well. I find it to be pretty pathetic, though, that those were the only parts of the anime that I genuinely liked.I did cry, however, when watching this. Once when the aftermath of Taiyou getting assaulted and raped for a second time was shown when he calls Asahi. I will say that that evoked genuine emotion in me. (Though I will add that this rape seems inconsistent with the nature of the character who is the cause of it, but whatever.) The second time was when the anime circled back to the scene that was shown at the beginning of episode one. And the last was two minutes after once the true ending and aftermath was revealed (specifically, what happened to Shio). Shio deserved so much better and this series treated her like garbage. That\'s all I\'ll say.Anyway, I\'m sick of talking about this. Sorry for making my review so long; that was not my intention. Bottom line is this: don\'t take what other positive reviewers have to say at face value and actually CONSIDER if you want to expose yourself to this sort of material.Thank you for reading and I hope this was helpful. gotten this out of the way, let\'s get into the review. I\'ll try to keep this as short as possible because I just want to go back to pretending that this series does not exist asap.I think it\'s very easy to say in response to criticism of this sort of anime stuff like ""oh, you\'re just unappreciative of psychological horror"" or ""you\'re too sensitive"" or ""the way you\'re looking at this is shallow"", but sometimes you have to step back and really think about why you feel compelled to say that.

I\'ll just chalk that up to bad writing because this show has absolutely killed me.In other words, as I said earlier: this show hurls trauma and dark topics at its viewers over and over, but it doesn\'t explain or finish explaining those decisions very well, which is an issue. Thus, it seems to be acting edgy only for the sake of being called that. Moving on.The art of this anime is pretty mediocre. It does reflect the deceptive cutesiness that is the theme of the show - sweet delusion - but not clearly enough to remind SOME people that THIS IS NOT A TRAGIC LOVE STORY. Jesus Christ. The opening animation sequence is pretty good though and sets the stage well. For some reason, though, the closing theme\'s animation sequence doesn\'t do the same and I find that to be very strange.Speaking of the opening and closing, the sole saving grace of this anime was the sound and music. The voice acting seemed pretty good to me, and the music (with the exception of the ending theme, which was pleasing to the ear but pretty forgettable) was nice as well. I find it to be pretty pathetic, though, that those were the only parts of the anime that I genuinely liked.I did cry, however, when watching this. Once when the aftermath of Taiyou getting assaulted and raped for a second time was shown when he calls Asahi. I will say that that evoked genuine emotion in me. (Though I will add that this rape seems inconsistent with the nature of the character who is the cause of it, but whatever.) The second time was when the anime circled back to the scene that was shown at the beginning of episode one. And the last was two minutes after once the true ending and aftermath was revealed (specifically, what happened to Shio). Shio deserved so much better and this series treated her like garbage. That\'s all I\'ll say.Anyway, I\'m sick of talking about this. Sorry for making my review so long; that was not my intention. Bottom line is this: don\'t take what other positive reviewers have to say at face value and actually CONSIDER if you want to expose yourself to this sort of material.Thank you for reading and I hope this was helpful.', 'An anime that delves deep into the question of love. What is love? In the anime, a young girl named Satou Matsuzaka has a habit of sleeping with one boy after another to find what this feeling of ""love"" is like but she never feels anything for them, no matter who she goes out with. She always left with the same pondering question of love. When one day, she met a little girl, a sweet and innocent young child. Shio K≈çbe. This encounter changes Satou. She has finally found something she could feel. Love.She tells others that she lives with her aunt when she secretly...lives in an apartment with Shio. Despite the show\'s title and appearance, it is a psychological horror anime that features a seemingly innocent girl with disturbing secrets. Satou will do anything to protect her beloved Shio, she would do anything to protect this feeling of love, no matter what it takes, no matter the cost.

I will not be discussing the plot, character names/arcs, or specific details.Happy Sugar Life.This show is really weird in the sense that it's almost never clear who you're supposed to like, or if you're supposed to like anyone. The psychology aspect of the show is great, though.It really plays into a dark side of humanity in many ways only an anime/manga could do (or get away with), and I really appreciate it for that.

When the two main characters have mental breakdowns, I think the series does a great job of conveying them to the viewer.

Higurashi.', ""When you watch the first episode this looks very similar to your typical Yandere anime. The main heroine (actually anti-heroine), Satou, is indeed a by-the-book high-schooler Yandere girl, the usual seemingly sweet at school and at her part-time job but whose heart is empty until she meets her so-called true love. So far sounds boring right?Well, her so-called true love is actually a grade-school age loli girl called Shio, who actually loves Satou as well. The two live together in Satou's apartment, seemingly having a sweet though forbidden age-gaped relationship. The problem is that nobody knows of that and that Shio is actually a missing...person, though she doesn't know about this because Satou cuts her off from the rest of the world like that princess in the castle. For Satou, even the thought of Shio *talking* to anyone else is unacceptable. The main difference from the typical Yandere story is that Satou already has her love and this is the story of her attempting to keep it and hide it. From here it's the usual Yandere things from lies to murders. Actually quite a good story for people who watch Yandere anime for the first or second time but may still be too typical if you've already watched shows of this kind several times.The only thing that actually makes this show different, that made it enjoyable and that makes me give it a 7 instead of 3 is the character of Shio, who is the only character in this show who has any depth. Shio comes from a shattered family, probably the worst childhood one can have. Parts of the show tell her life story and how she ended-up being with Satou, adding a dark slice-of-life aspect to the show and giving it some sort of uniqueness over your average Yandere anime.Art is usually very bright and moe, except when depicting a murderous or violent intent, as well as during the flashbacks into Shio's dark past. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a show of this type but overall no complaints here. Sound is great, with an opening theme that can suit a romantic comedy anime. Again, this is pretty much expected since most Yandere shows have that. Again, no complaints here.Bottom line - If you don't have anything special on your plan to watch list and you like Yandere and/or dark slice of life, then sure, give it a go.

This is one of the worst anime titles I\'ve ever come across.The story is horrible and it lacks any sort of realism. It tries to depict domestic abuse and fails very hard at that. The story is written in such a way that the protagonist always has plot armor for any situation (judging from the little I\'ve seen). The first two episodes are completely identical to each other.The episode starts off with the protagonist either working or being in school, shows that the protagonist is very cute, innocent and positive. Let\'s call that part one. The...part one exists in both of the first episodes. Part two, is where it gets ridiculous. Part two can be briefly described as: the main character using plot armor. What I mean by that is, something in the protagonist snaps and she gets crazy looking eyes. Crazy looking eyes means bad and scary right? That also means that you can make your dialogues monologues and fill it with unnecessary exposition. I don\'t understand why people would become instantly scared of you because the way you look at them changes or that you start talking with them in a more threatening manner.Another weak part of the story is the protagonist\'s undying love for another character. The protagonist is in love with a character to the extent where she\'d do anything to protect her. A little backstory as to why she has this undying love would be better than seeing her everyday life and her abusing/cheating her way through the plot with incredible amounts of plot armor.Since this show is all about domestic abuse, they need characters that are inherently evil. In this show\'s case, it\'s the adults who are inherently evil because they are adults. In the first episode, the manager of a caf√© starts abusing the protagonist. She tells her to work extra hours, clean after her work time is over and then proceeds to pay her with a lot less than what she has worked for. This was an interesting turn in the first episode as everything seemed to be innocent at first. Later, I started questioning myself: ""why is the manager acting up? the protagonist didn\'t do anything wrong"". Well, it turned out that protagonist was too cute and got more attention than the manager. This is why the manager decided to get some of that sweet revenge.This creates a massive plot hole. If that\'s all it took for the manager to snap and burst out all her anger on a co-worker, doesn\'t that mean that anyone who\'d be considered more ""cute"" or anyone who got more attention would end up in a situation like the protagonist. By that I mean, anyone new to that caf√©. I am aware that bullying and such does exist in companies, but there\'s usually an actual reason for that.I hate when stories have characters that are evil for the sake of being evil. It rarely gives any depth to the characters. There is no potential build up where they become evil and start hating the world, if they\'re evil just for the hell of it.More on that though. In episode 2, we\'re introduced a new character who\'s stalking the protagonist. He turns out to be her teacher and a complete creep. He has a wife and a child already but says that he wants to be loved and wants to love other women. This is why he\'s obsessed with the protagonist. She\'s really cute and he loves her. Why does he love her? Not explained. Everything that is explained is just that she interested him when she started going to that school. He likes girls like her. She\'s smart compared to her classmates. He tries to sort of rape her in episode 2 as well as kill her beloved one that she told him about. When the teacher starts threatening the protagonist, that\'s when the plot skips a beat. A car\'s alarm system is somehow prompted and people wake up. This forces the teacher to leave her be for this time.One thing I don\'t understand is that all the adults are written in such a manner that they are instantly scumbags. These scumbags are ready to abuse a girl who hasn\'t done them anything wrong and then get scared when she starts talking with them in exposition? Doesn\'t make any sense really. The teacher is the perfect example of that. He doesn\'t seem to care about getting fired from his job, it seems that he\'s had several relationships with other students. It seems that he\'s willing to go very long for the protagonist if he\'s constantly stalking her and being a complete creep. So why did he get scared when the protagonist suddenly started threatening him with crazy eyes?I know that there are scumbags in real life, I am not denying that. But the fact that the show is trying to make all adults evil because they\'re adults is annoying. All the adults in the show seem to talk about their understanding of love which is when the protagonist\'s plot armor activates and she completely destroys them by threatening them.The plot is pretty contrived and a lot of unnecessary things are there to move the plot along. The main character has immense amount of plot armor and can handle all situations at ease. This show tries to be as edgy as possible but fails to create a good balance. Not everything needs to be edgy. You can create edge by introducing other plot devices, other than evil bad adults.The characters are pathetic. The story is pathetic (if there even is one). The art & sound was actually surprisingly decent but other elements kill all sort of enjoyment one can have from a show like this. This show isn\'t entertaining at all. It\'s boring and repetitive.

You\'ve already looked at my rating, you know what happened.Story ‚Äì 3/10HSL throws a few very interesting ideas on the table ‚Äì sociopathy, pedophilia, obsessive love, morality ‚Äì but, after pushing them around for a bit, nothing truly worthy of watching comes out.

The only thing that matters is the Satou x Shio pairing, and the plot and other characters graciously twist themselves to try to fool the viewer into thinking that these girls\' unhealthy attachment to each other is ""true love"".However, HSL is very educational. For example, we learn that pedophilic urges can develop after being sexually assaulted during one\'s teenage years and developing an aversion towards adults.

This show feels like it was made by two different people.There are a lot of happy...moments mainly dealing with Sato and Shio when they are inside their house, but the happiness starts to fade when Sato goes into the outside world and Shio is alone at home.The first couple of episodes were intriguing for sure, there were things being shown here and there and what kept me watching was how things ended up this way in the first place and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Around the middle of the show, I kinda got a bit annoyed of the characters because there is something wrong with literally almost every single character introduced in the show.If one person wasn‚Äôt abused or sexually assaulted another person was a straight creep or pedophile. It got to deviantart OC levels of edge this side of Magical Girl Site. But right when I thought the show lost its way, episode 8 happened and it picked up.The combination of the art direction and editing really emphasized the psychological thriller this show is supposed to be.As a result the really screwed up moments come in at the final episodes where everything concludes and I feel satisfied.The art is basic and animation is average.One thing that is actually worth talking about was how at certain moments, the art direction took advantage of the basic art style to make it psychological.But that‚Äôs about it.(Like my reviews weren‚Äôt long enough)The sound is that bad either, Voice acting is great, a bit over dramatic, but great,nonetheless.Also the soundtrack is ‚Ä¶...good. The actual foley for this show was well done,There were some very weird sounds that played with my emotions.The Opening is addictive and the ending is too. Some of the insert songs are really good as well, it makes it stand out more when it is heard at certain moments.Okay, the characters. Sato, is what a way more accurate example of what a Yandere should be like.She traces the ‚ÄúYandere‚Äù criteria from when it first originated back in 2005 when Kaede from ‚ÄúShuffle!‚Äù was first made. Sato is more sociopathic than psychopathic. People can go around calling Yuno the true Yandere,but while watching Mirai Nikki I just saw Yuno as a horny killing machine and nothing else for the past twenty something episode.Sato mainly screws with people and manipulates everyone, she is a crazy person, but a crazy person with a brain.She also has CHARACTER development,there are some insecurities that she deals with like interest in taboo relationships(because if you think about it this is just a more clean genderbent version of Boku no Pico) and it's only been twice this year where I watch a show with that type of theme(the other one being Koi wa Ameagari).Shio is super duper cute but I kinda prefer her cute oblivious self over her hallucinatory self.She does get some redemption in the final episodes where the show focuses on her and Sato the most..The real problems come with all the other characters who are crazy AF. One person I would like to touch on is Asahi Kobe. This is the problem i have with him.He at first seems to act like the most sensible person in this show.Right? Wrong. There is one time where he threatens to cut someone's fingernails off, and it's for a split second. It wasn't even revealed in a twist type of way, it just HAPPENED.:/.And with the other characters, the problem is not what's wrong with them, but how much they are crazy.They pull of weird kookie faces but beyond that they act normal, if the show was more subtle about it, it would make the characters infinitely better.In the end, I enjoyed myself watching this, but I don't wanna say my life has changed from watching it.Probably since I've been watching so many psychological horrors these past years,nothing comes closest to Monster and compared to that show and Happy Sugar Life, Happy Sugar Life goes a bit too out of proportion.Also it's bland art style doesn't help either.What really made it stand out though was its story and it's interesting art direction,so I have to say that this is a good show for someone to be introduced into  thrillers like this and not be too traumatized.Overall-7Please don't kill me for what I said about Yuno. moments mainly dealing with Sato and Shio when they are inside their house, but the happiness starts to fade when Sato goes into the outside world and Shio is alone at home.The first couple of episodes were intriguing for sure, there were things being shown here and there and what kept me watching was how things ended up this way in the first place and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Around the middle of the show, I kinda got a bit annoyed of the characters because there is something wrong with literally almost every single character introduced in the show.If one person wasn‚Äôt abused or sexually assaulted another person was a straight creep or pedophile. It got to deviantart OC levels of edge this side of Magical Girl Site. But right when I thought the show lost its way, episode 8 happened and it picked up.The combination of the art direction and editing really emphasized the psychological thriller this show is supposed to be.As a result the really screwed up moments come in at the final episodes where everything concludes and I feel satisfied.The art is basic and animation is average.One thing that is actually worth talking about was how at certain moments, the art direction took advantage of the basic art style to make it psychological.But that‚Äôs about it.(Like my reviews weren‚Äôt long enough)The sound is that bad either, Voice acting is great, a bit over dramatic, but great,nonetheless.Also the soundtrack is ‚Ä¶...good. The actual foley for this show was well done,There were some very weird sounds that played with my emotions.The Opening is addictive and the ending is too. Some of the insert songs are really good as well, it makes it stand out more when it is heard at certain moments.Okay, the characters. Sato, is what a way more accurate example of what a Yandere should be like.She traces the ‚ÄúYandere‚Äù criteria from when it first originated back in 2005 when Kaede from ‚ÄúShuffle!‚Äù was first made. Sato is more sociopathic than psychopathic. People can go around calling Yuno the true Yandere,but while watching Mirai Nikki I just saw Yuno as a horny killing machine and nothing else for the past twenty something episode.Sato mainly screws with people and manipulates everyone, she is a crazy person, but a crazy person with a brain.She also has CHARACTER development,there are some insecurities that she deals with like interest in taboo relationships(because if you think about it this is just a more clean genderbent version of Boku no Pico) and it's only been twice this year where I watch a show with that type of theme(the other one being Koi wa Ameagari).Shio is super duper cute but I kinda prefer her cute oblivious self over her hallucinatory self.She does get some redemption in the final episodes where the show focuses on her and Sato the most..The real problems come with all the other characters who are crazy AF.

The main theme here is love. Every character has their own definition of love and it all surrounds this little girl that was abandoned. Honestly, there are so many great character moments at the beginning that made me think this would be a psychological study on love and how it can be abusive, but no. Everything they set up doesn't have a worthwhile payoff.For instance, there is a male teenager who is raped twice. Because of this he only feels safe around children...and then he develops an attraction toward one. Really fascinating character work, but unfortunately he's just a raving lunatic by the end where you start to feel like him being raped is just a bad joke and not actually a character moment.Other than that icky realization, the two other aspects about this show that I hate so much are a certain character's death and the sympathy toward the main character. There is a death near the end involving a certain character whose death genuinely disturbed me. It got under my skin because there was no reason for that death and no repercussions. Then there's the main character. She's a fucking psychopath who deserves no sympathy, and yet by the final episode, the show really pushes you, the audience, to believe that she has learned from all of this and was in the right the whole time.Bullshit. No sympathy. Fuck that.The art is good, and it had a strong start, but wow did this train jump off the bridge. There is so much abuse going around and there's not a clever thought about it. It's just there to be there. At first, you think the whole story is about the loss of innocence, and through this lost girl these characters are rekindling their childhood...but nope. It's just gross. and then he develops an attraction toward one.

audience.\xa0 So, that leads us here to \'Happy Sugar Life\', something that\'s certainly fits within that mold.Story:Our story starts with two girls, a grade schooler named Chio and a high schooler named Satou embracing each other on the roof of a burning building with rings on their hands before...plummeting down to the ground.\xa0 Huh...that got dark fast.The story\'s main goal is to go back to the beginning and tell the audience the set of events that led...to the conclusion of the main duo committing suicide, doing so by filling in any missing blanks it might\'ve been left open in previous episodes in order to get new perspectives on some of these characters.\xa0 This is done mostly because Happy Sugar Life is a story of the starvation of love, the twisting of the word to fit the definition of Satou and the various side characters that act as obstacles to her ultimate goal of being with Chio no matter the cost or circumstance.It\'s with this the show plants its feet into some very uncomfortable themes, ranging from obsession to rape and abuse, portraying its characters as sick and depraved individuals where their madness can only be satiated by their desires.\xa0 The plot itself is pretty straightforward with only a few small twists given how the audience more or less knows how things are going to end anyway.\xa0 But given how it\'s a well paced show with many character facets to expand on the overall story of the series, that can be ignored given how the audience at the beginning doesn\'t know everything.Overview:+ Good pacing-\xa0 Spoiling the ending is a bit of an odd narrative choiceCharacters:Matsuzaka Satou as the show\'s resident protagonist is a true testament of what it means to be a yandere.\xa0 The psychotic, crazed love of the trope as she desperately tries to keep her \'Happy Sugar Life\' is ingrained to her character as she exhibits an outwardly friendly behavior towards the one she loves and to feign as a sweet girl, acting cold, ruthless, and calculating only when the situation calls for it, manipulating those around her to her whims, taking matters into her own hands when it really calls for it.\xa0 I just find it nice to see a yandere for once not just be out of her mind to gain the affections for the one they love, but instead act rationally to keep or progress what they have planned out.Koube Shio on the other hand isn\'t really as fortunate as a character.\xa0 The show really puts her on a pedestal that makes it extremely hard to understand the logic behind some of the characters\' reasons to fawn and (literally) drool all over her.\xa0 Like everyone calls her SUPER CUTE, but she\'s not THAT cute, like come on.\xa0 She remains this way for a majority of the series, and only really comes to have some development/backstory for her at a point near the end of the series where both her and Satou get an explanation as to how Shio ends up being locked away in an apartment in order for Satou to get all of the love that she\'s been desiring all her life.\xa0 It\'s only then that she gets any proper development, being a factor that comes just a bit too late for my liking, though the rewards for it are certainly interesting.I\'d argue the sidecast is worse off than either Satou or Chio in terms of their mental health state, which is surprising considering you\'d expect it to be the other way around.\xa0 Ranging from Satou\'s aunt who first taught her of love, the unfortunate Mitsuboshi whose had to cope in some...unconventional ways, some of Satou\'s coworkers, and Asashi, who puts up missing posters of Shio in hopes of finding his missing sister, the sidecast only helps bolster the madness and depravity that goes on in this series, making the main characters almost sympathetic in a way given the kind of people that surround and breathe down their necks.Overview:+ Solid main character+ Memorable (and insane) sidecast- Shio is put on a pedestal way too muchArt:As the first project produced by Studio Ezo\'la, Happy Sugar Life is a very solid show to come out from a seemingly new production studio.\xa0 There\'re hardly any animation or consistency errors that I can see from, and the artstyle has this nice fluffy, almost picturesque style with light, bright colors that does a good job of portraying Satou\'s perfect world with Chio.This is immediately counteracted by the moments of insanity where the entire color scheme gets darker, the storybook setting is gone, and whatever happiness was there is replaced with the harsh suffocation of obsession that takes hold of this show, with the only light in any given frame of this being the neon glow of the characters\' eyes to show that they\'re not in the right state of mind.\xa0 This, combined with other aesthetic choices like Chio\'s head scribbles and disturbing imagery gives a great two sides to the art that flows seamlessly with the nature of the show.Overview:+ Solid work for a first project+ Flips between two versions of the same style seamlesslySound:Akari Nanawo\'s ""One Room Sugar Life"" is a song that tells you EXACTLY what you\'re getting into watching this.\xa0 Starting with an initially cheery beat before twisting chords to give some dissonance to the show\'s other half, the OP is one of the more memorable tracks in recent memory because it mixes its show\'s duality in a manner that tells you exactly what you\'re getting into.\xa0 Its sister, ReoNa\'s ""SWEET HURT"" however is a softer, more relaxed song that sounds nothing like a song that should be a part of a show like this.\xa0 I don\'t find it as memorable personally, and actually see it as something that\'s really out of place cause its tempo and melody really doesn\'t fit in a show where depravity is a character trait handed out like candy.Personal Enjoyment:I kind of feel dirty watching this show.\xa0 Like something violated me deep inside due to a number of the cast\'s perverted tendencies making it impossible for me to not writhe in my seat watching this show.\xa0 My experience can pretty much be summed up as \'uncomfortable\' due to the sheer amount of twisted logic that appears in Happy Sugar Life.That being said, I did find the show fun to watch on account of just wanting to see where it was going to go.\xa0 Happy Sugar Life does a very good job at gripping its audience, leaving them wanting more because in a scenario as precarious and intertwined as this, the slightest mistake made by Satou or another ends in their demise.\xa0 The tightrope act was really exhilarating to watch even though I knew how it ended from minute one, and I still find it really weird yet grateful that the series managed to find a way to make Satou one of the more sane/sympathetic characters in the show when everything is taken into account.While the subject matter is uncomfortable for those that aren\'t looking for it, Happy Sugar Life is a recommendation I would make only on the basis that it\'s an interesting psychological horror that paints a grim picture using only the wits and desires of the human brain.\xa0 Satou is a great protagonist where she and almost everyone in the cast pulls their

Shio has a large dose of stockholm syndrome, where she falls in love with her kidnapper, sociopsychopath Satou. Added bonus: everyone is a pedophile since Shio is like 6 years old. Literally everyone except ""dude what the hell is going on with you we never hang out anymore"" Shouko.I love how the story was told from Satou\'s POV instead of the classic ""outsider...who gets dragged in"" POV.

Although the age gap is uncomfortable and taking a lil girl you found on the street home is wrong, Satou isn't a danger to Shio (considering where Shio comes from). She is a danger to everyone else.

I\'m not even really sure what i was waiting for.  I guess a sort of morbid curiosity was egging me on; i just had to know how deep the rabbit hole went.Production wise it\'s mostly garbage.  The art is boring, the animation is hilariously weak.  The music is clumsy and far too obvious in its intent, like it was composed by a teenager.  There\'s some good voice acting at least.Since the anime is going exclusively for constant shock value, all the ""characters"" are largely plot devices, all mentally fucked up one way or another.  They exist so that we can see some higurashi-style ""creepy"" huge-eyes-with-small-irises-and-husky-voice scenes as often as possible.  Shio is probably the worst example.  It\'s like the writer has never seen a child in his life; this is not how children act.  Her mind is at-times too simple and at times far too profound, with no coherence at all.

With every new character that was introduced, barraged onto you as some other form of obsession with something (usually the MC), I lost any connection to them, meaning any emotion or thrill was lost. The plotline was undeniably somewhat interesting, as it did keep me watching, but the characters lack of deeper characteristics aside from ""hehe im so fucked up"" meant that any good from the plot was overshadowed.While reality is obviously not the pressing concern in animation, the fact that the whole thing was lolicon pandering and not the motherly love i expected ruined this. It\'s as if someone pitched a weird stockholm syndrome loli story and decided to make it passable by making it edgy and making everyone hate themselves. This could have been done so much better if there was any regard to making this a legitimately deep anime. the series.

Even if the characters are basically insane because the show wants to be edgy, I can't say that the characters don't make sense, because a lot of screen time is given just to show that. That doesn't mean the characters were good, though. I always find myself kind of wandering because the characters are really boringly predictable. You know, in mirai nikki, everyone is...trying to kill MC, there's a lot of action, so you're never bored. Honestly, that's probably what you want from a kind of edgy show. This show has a lot of exposition and character development, but it doesn't really matter when you aren't invested in any character at all. And when I mean character development, I just mean that you understand the psychopath's way of thinking. No one really changes that much other than the 2 main characters.It definitely gives similar vibes to Satsuriku no Tenshi. I just feel very uninvested since the plot is so boring and predictable. If you want to make something horror-esque or something, make the characters more interesting, or have a compelling plot. I just feel like I'm watching like 5 psychopaths battling it out. And it's boring. HOW? I don't know. You could breeze through from episode 1 and then skip to episode 12, and you would know what's going on, given  that you know that this show very edgy and wants people to battle it out. I really tried liking the show, but its just not that bad. Rewatch Mirai Nikki instead if you want a crazy girl. And it's not that Mirai Nikki is a masterpiece, but this show echoes a lot of some of the themes in the show, and it gets pulled off badly trying to kill MC, there's a lot of action, so you're never bored.

It could have explored the discrepancy between what adults want and what children need, but instead it was disgusting. The entire time I watched this show I was hoping that the relationship between the two main leads would be about the two teaching each other how a family is supposed to work and heal from it, but it turned into a love story. This would not be an issue if the love were not glorified. But through and through we see this idea that the love...between the two main characters is fine because they had each other.Abuse created more abusers. That's already a gross moral, but I can't get over how much this glorifies pedophilia.

Now we wait for me to loose my login to this acc too!', 'Happy Sugar Life, an anime that appears nice, happy and bright and is actually just filled with messed up people and a messed up plot.And speaking of the plot- jesus christ it was some sort of plot that\'s for sure. I don\'t have much to say about it, but one positive is that it was pretty suspenseful at times! Which is good in this kind of anime, it invokes unease and anxiety in the viewer. Other than that though, each episode was riddled with plot holes which unfortunately made it hard to take it seriously. On top of this, it also felt very rushed at...times and had many predictable scenes. So if you\'re looking for an anime with a story you can take seriously, this definitely is not the one for you.As for the art- In my opinion, the art and animation of an anime is very important to the point it can save a bad story. Unfortunately, that is not the case with this one. There was poor anatomy in certain parts, however this was less noticeable. Something that was more noticeable though was there were scenes where character\'s hair clipped through their head. This is the first time I\'ve seen this in an anime that isn\'t 3D animation, and the fact the first time I noticed it was in a serious scene too really did not help. It just completely killed the mood. As did the animation, it was very stiff in some parts and some scenes look as though they did not put any effort in and it just makes it more comedic than anything, when it\'s clearly not supposed to be comedic.However, one of the most noticeable things that I really liked about the art is how bright and colourful it is, and the way it completely contradicts with the anime. It\'s obviously one of the first things I noticed, and the fact it left a positive impact is good. Another positive is the visual effects, this arguably in my opinion is the best part of the visuals of this anime. The effects added an intense feeling to the scenes, and made them a lot more intimidating than they would\'ve been without.The visual effects also made the characters much more intimidating than they actually are, unfortunately this is one of the only positives relating to the characters. Each character is incredibly easy to hate, and none of them seem to get any character development. The most we actually get from them is some sad backstory that is seemingly supposed to make them more likeable and make us feel sorry for them, but their past does not excuse their current self and their current selves are just unlikeable. Like I said earlier, there are many plot holes in this anime. A lot of these plot holes relate to the main character and, without spoilers, the main character is portrayed to be smart, however she is constantly making mistakes that are easy to avoid and many of her actions leave you wondering ""Well what was the point of that?"" or ""Why didn\'t she just do this instead?"" and it\'s honestly just disappointing and contributes to the poor story of this anime.And now my final point; the audio. To me audio is not only important in anime, but is one of the most overlooked and underrated features of all media. It is incredibly important, and probably the best feature from this anime. To start off, the opening is catchy and nice to sit through. It showcases the nature of the anime very well and definitely helps to set the mood before you start the episode. As for the background music, this one is the one that seems to be lacking in the sound department. Whilst the background music matches the mood of what\'s going on and really sets the scene, it\'s also all generic anime music. I feel like I\'ve heard it all before, and their could\'ve been better choices. Especially for the flashback scenes. However the sound effects- now those were good. They added to the scenes and made everything feel so much more alive than they would be without. The final thing I can applaud for the sound is the voice acting. The voice acting was great, each voice fit the character\'s perfectly and you could genuinely hear the emotions in their voices. Good job on the voice actors, definitely one of the saving graces of this anime.Overall, despite my critiques of it I quite enjoyed this anime. Unfortunately, I enjoyed it because of how absurd the story was and the fact I couldn\'t take it seriously. But one thing it did correctly was it caught me in the suspense, and I couldn\'t wait to watch each episode and found out what happened next. Solid 5/10. times and had many predictable scenes.

It\'s over-the-top and edgy, but it\'s also a psychological horror, so some leeway is granted. The main character is in love with an elementary school girl, who she keeps hidden in her apartment, and she will destroy anyone who gets in her way. Classic villain-centric stuff, and fascinating to boot.Like I said, it is over-the-top; virtually everybody is crazy, extreme, broken, or some mix of all three, and sometimes the show revels too much in the edginess so that it tips over to silly. However, it makes up for this by having the main crazy do...a battle-of-wits against all the other crazies, so there is still a story with forward momentum, and it makes for some entertaining fun.Unfortunately, it can\'t keep the pace. I don\'t want to spoil anything, so I\'ll just say that as it goes on, the show seems to forget that it\'s an over-the-top psychological horror, and actually seems to be playing itself seriously, to which I give a hearty, ""Um, no."" Everything about this show is ridiculous, and it plays that well when it knows it\'s ridiculous. When it goes from trying to make you gasp to trying to make you smile, it\'s honestly more of a cringe. I wish it had stayed in the horror vein, where it did well and where the content fit the genre. Sadly, the last episodes just about ruin the rest.Even so, it can be schlocky entertainment if you\'re looking for that sort of thing. a battle-of-wits against all the other crazies, so there is still a story with forward momentum, and it makes for some entertaining fun.Unfortunately, it can\'t keep the pace.

Possibly because I had been reading a lot about the yandere trope? Maybe?So when I started watching Happy Sugar Life, I wasn't fooled by the cute art style, I knew there was something darker going on, but I didn't know exactly. And I feel like every episode introduced something even more darker than the previous, which definitely kept me on my toes.And while I got shocked every episode, I still enjoyed watching this. I had to know what would happen, I had to know what is wrong with these characters, I...just had to know more in general. That means it's excellently written psychological thriller. While it kept shocking me, I kept watching.I did hope something more from the art style. The manga looks way more unique, the anime looks pretty generic apart from some exceptions. just had to know more in general. That means it's excellently written psychological thriller.

She comes upon a lost child named Shio Kobe, for whom she feels something towards for the first time. Having felt this emotion she believes is true love that she has never experienced before, Satou is determined to hold Shio close and never let her go. No matter who or what stands in her way.Satou basically kidnaps Shio up off the street and drags her ass to her home with her,...then proceeds to isolate her in an apartment by telling her the outside world is dangerous and later physically locking her in. She knows full well that there are missing person posters everywhere for her, and knows who\'s looking for her. But she refuses to even consider letting her go because shes an edgy pedophile. No one sane exists in this world just a bunch of pedophile killers who kidnap and rape children.Anyway the story is unique as in I have never watched something with such a burning intent on wanting to have sex with a child. However there is more than people wanting to diddle kids here. There is also domestic abuse and stuff to make it ""Edgy"" for all those 12 year olds looking for the ""Forbidden"" since being a pedophile isn\'t degenerate enough for them.The art was alright nothing too fancy and or bad however the music chosen for this was your generic anime music you can find if you just type ""Anime Music"" in YouTube. Ofcourse don\'t forget your ear busting suspense shit they throw in.Overall I rate this anime 2edgy4me/10 hopefully it drops below the 7star Thresh hold since its dying fast lol. then proceeds to isolate her in an apartment by telling her the outside world is dangerous and later physically locking her in.

I saw this on Amazon Prime and it had ""Yuri"" as one of the tags. Perfect. A light fluffy lesbian show I can play in the background without subtitles while I do my work.And that\'s what it was for like 10 minutes. I am doing my work on my laptop and then looking up to see some pink haired teenager talking with her friends with a bubbly little sound track.Out of the corner of my eye, I see a dark, red, scene. The bubbly pink character is speaking in monotone and her eyes dart...to a locker. I am utterly confused and kinda scared. So, I turn on subtitles and rewatch the episode, this time paying attention. I don\'t watch horror. I just really have to give props to this show for misleading me so severely.

There is not absolutely any arc in there story.Now, it\'s a horror show, so you can expect some disturbing scenes, but this show brings it to a different (worst) level. Some scenes are really disgusting, not because they were extremely gore, but because it deals with lots of very unmoral topics, which I prefer not to mention.Good thingsOne of the things that  i liked, is that even though the characters where very horrible portrayed, was that the shows keeps you (for some reason) on your seat, there\'s something that makes you wonder what happen on the past so the story follows up until that, but I also thing is heavily conditioned by the horror part.I liked all the voice acting in this show, it really goes along with the characters and their ""personalities"".Overall NOT GOOD 3/7 type of characters that you would forget in a couple days.

It‚Äôs supposed to make you feel uncomfortable and confused and weirded out. This psychological horror anime does an incredible job of making you feel uncomfortable.The story itself is a little bland. It reminds me a little of Mirai Nikki in some aspects, although this may just be because...of the ‚Äúyandere aspects‚Äù there are. I‚Äôve seen it done better but it isn‚Äôt too bad.The art is adorable. This, however, is the point of the anime.

I\'d say that 90% of the characters were insufferable, INCLUDING THE MC!!! The events that happened in episode 9 further cemented my overall displeasure with the handling of its characters and the use of friendship and trauma. The adoration of deuteragonist, Shio Kobe, felt like nothing more than Stockholm syndrome and borderline pedophilia. Even most of the ""horror"" scenes were underwhelming. After watching stuff like Perfect Blue...and Monster (both of which handle suspense/horror extremely well), it really raised my expectations as to what a good thriller should feel like. Again, episode 9 was not only my least favorite episode, but it also had the most unsettling death scene of the entire show. Had the earlier episodes really capture that uneasy sense the way that specific death scene did, this show would\'ve been rated much higher. Overall, this show had potential to be a really great horror anime had it been handled properly. The ""kawaii girl"" tropes were, well, kawaii at first, but it became distracting and downright annoying due to how young the characters were. This is a lesson to be learned for me that maybe with the types of themes presented is just not for someone like me. and Monster (both of which handle suspense/horror extremely well), it really raised my expectations as to what a good thriller should feel like.

Firstly, the entire anime runs off sexual assault and child kidnapping. I first got on this anime thinking it was going to be like a murder mystery or something and was extremely disappointed and in disarray. The plot was entirely too quick and they practically just threw trauma onto the characters like that was ever giving them backbone or depth. I didn't like...how the mc had so many different outlets for getting her gritty jobs done, it just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth-- Like she just ironically happens to have an affair with a teacher that can easily be forced to dispose a body for her? Next, I understand that Shiro is a child (she's like what--7?) but you cannot tell me that she was never suspicious of the big fat metal door in the apartment. How can you NOT be curious about it? It's literally the only thing that sticks out of place in the apartment you are forced to live in 25/8. Lastly, I wish there was more suspense and wonder if she was ever going to fail in her tasks. The only thing saving this anime from a 1/10 is its opening. how the mc had so many different outlets for getting her gritty jobs done, it just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth-- Like she just ironically happens to have an affair with a teacher that can easily be forced to dispose a body for her?

Because these kinds of themes don\'t necessarily make the story bad, you can take a villainous, killer and pedo protagonist and make it work and make it scary, but satou isn\'t made to be scary. Satou is very cute, her design is cute, the colors make her look adorable, aside from the fact that in one particular scene they show her shirtless, it\'s obvious she\'s made to be the waifu. The problem as such is not that, but that if there is no story to tell, the only thing left is to put in filler and stuff like that. The characters monologue for minutes and minutes and minutes and scenes that you can remove perfectly well and it doesn\'t affect the ""plot"" at all, which is interspersed with scenes from Satou\'s personal life at work, at school, which also don\'t add anything to the point, not even to her personality. The characters talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and TALK and talk about their paraphilias and other disgusting things for long and uncomfortable scenes, which no, they are NOT scary, they give a mixture of cringe and disgust. no, it doesn\'t propose moral dilemmas, unless you want to wonder if it\'s ok to have little girls in your apartment. the point about people having hidden faces is ridiculous, because in this series the only face the characters have is the disturbed one, otherwise they have no personality.another problem i have is with the general tone, being something colorful and visually cute, the scenes where Satou is with the girl, or where other characters do bad things, are cute and colorful, they look good and nothing in the environment or ost tells you that it\'s something wrong, that it\'s something that happens with the intention to scare or disgust you, in the scenes of the coworker and the teacher I didn\'t know if they were an attempt of comedy or they wanted to disgust me or make me feel uncomfortable, I don\'t understand the tone they wanted to take, if it\'s something scary or """"romantic"""".3. THE CHARACTERS and we enter in strong ground because that\'s what triggers me the most. the characters have only 1 dimension and that\'s their paraphilias, you can describe them all in 2 or 3 words when you couldn\'t do that with a decently made character, and they give that kind of criticism that ""woww shows us the multiple human facets"", the characters have no purpose or reason to be outside of being predators or mess with satou\'s goal and then never appear again, there are many things in the human being that can inspire real FEAR and not just shock value and they decide to go for the easy way. You can\'t identify with the characters, there are ONLY 2 that are normal and they appeared like 3 times, while the rest are given very long scenes of half an episode.-Satou, the main character, kinda a mary sue in universe because everyone loves her, in every episode someone confesses to her at least once, everything goes well for her, and she can do thousands of illegal things and no one will even turn to look at her. It\'s a cute mold for a killer, who pretends to be the wow factor, but as soon as you see that she has a little girl in her apartment you know something is off. And even that\'s not having personality because when she goes into """"yandere"""" mode she looks like a copy of any yandere/yangire girl from any other anime of the style. Her life starts and ends at the girl, she has no other personality, she has no other desire besides that. She doesn\'t do anything that isn\'t for her. (This isn\'t exactly bad, you can make a character lovesick/obsessed which unique goal is to support/make happy/have the person they love, and they can be good or decent or likeable at least, this isn\'t the case) The worst thing is that the show pulls the ""she is traumatized, that\'s why she\'s crazy"" card.the rest of the characters can be easily summarized:-sexual harasser, masochist and pedophile teacher, who burned the corpses that satou gave him with absolutely no questions asked and got horny because of it.-pedophile coworker who wanted to take the girl home and abuse her, he fell in love with her for seeing her on the missing person posters, has his room with a bunch of the posters plastered on the walls. i assume he is underage in universe because he is contemporary with satou but i haven\'t searched about it-pedophile and rapist boss who molested the co-worker and takes advantage of her power position-random girl who is obsessed with satou, smells her clothes and cums-girl\'s brother, cute, looks half sick in health not in sexuality, hates adults and the police-normal girl, friend of satou-shio, who is also relatively normalall but the normal ones have half a chapter dedicated to them talking about their paraphilias and that they like children.and finally, i want to say that i don\'t understand WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE OF THIS THING. because they say ""it\'s a raw story, it\'s not for everyone"" but it\'s not raw, it doesn\'t show you a reality, it\'s something too exaggerated and caricatured to be even comparable with reality. i guess if you like lolis idk maybe you can like it, but you can\'t identify with it, if you do identify with it it\'s your problem and it\'s a little weird and creepy? but normal people won\'t identify with any of the characters, they won\'t see themselves in the story because they don\'t feel attraction towards minors or have a minor kidnapped in their homes or something like that.Good points: the OST is kinda nice sometimes, the animation is pretty, I love the character design and the art style, the opening is really good.Also, it really made me want to see where the story is leading, even if it\'s disgusting. The thing is they put the ending in the first scene and the opening, so it spoils you half of it. the only risk is that the girl left the apartment once and interacted with the others, but the main character is not in danger because she is a perfect npc designed to be cute and loved by everyone around her.the main character is supposed to be a student but it\'s even hard to notice because nothing in her room or in the apartment can give you that idea, she lives alone and i thought she was already an adult because she works, but aparently she\'s 15 and still goes to school.the structure of the chapters is something like: satou being a pedophile - a new character is introduced - wow, the new character has weird paraphilias - satou says the new character is bitter, she wants something sweet, she kisses the 5 year old girl - kills someone in stupid ways and no one seems to notice - repeatthis pattern starts in the second chapter and doesn\'t stop, because there is no real danger and you know that in the end satou being the main character is going to kill everyone who gets in the way and that\'s it, she goes on with her life because no one seems to notice that it\'s weird.2. the way the story is told.

THE CHARACTERS and we enter in strong ground because that\'s what triggers me the most. the characters have only 1 dimension and that\'s their paraphilias, you can describe them all in 2 or 3 words when you couldn\'t do that with a decently made character, and they give that kind of criticism that ""woww shows us the multiple human facets"", the characters have no purpose or reason to be outside of being predators or mess with satou\'s goal and then never appear again, there are many things in the human being that can inspire real FEAR and not just shock value and they decide to go for the easy way. You can\'t identify with the characters, there are ONLY 2 that are normal and they appeared like 3 times, while the rest are given very long scenes of half an episode.-Satou, the main character, kinda a mary sue in universe because everyone loves her, in every episode someone confesses to her at least once, everything goes well for her, and she can do thousands of illegal things and no one will even turn to look at her. It\'s a cute mold for a killer, who pretends to be the wow factor, but as soon as you see that she has a little girl in her apartment you know something is off. And even that\'s not having personality because when she goes into """"yandere"""" mode she looks like a copy of any yandere/yangire girl from any other anime of the style. Her life starts and ends at the girl, she has no other personality, she has no other desire besides that. She doesn\'t do anything that isn\'t for her. (This isn\'t exactly bad, you can make a character lovesick/obsessed which unique goal is to support/make happy/have the person they love, and they can be good or decent or likeable at least, this isn\'t the case) The worst thing is that the show pulls the ""she is traumatized, that\'s why she\'s crazy"" card.the rest of the characters can be easily summarized:-sexual harasser, masochist and pedophile teacher, who burned the corpses that satou gave him with absolutely no questions asked and got horny because of it.-pedophile coworker who wanted to take the girl home and abuse her, he fell in love with her for seeing her on the missing person posters, has his room with a bunch of the posters plastered on the walls. i assume he is underage in universe because he is contemporary with satou but i haven\'t searched about it-pedophile and rapist boss who molested the co-worker and takes advantage of her power position-random girl who is obsessed with satou, smells her clothes and cums-girl\'s brother, cute, looks half sick in health not in sexuality, hates adults and the police-normal girl, friend of satou-shio, who is also relatively normalall but the normal ones have half a chapter dedicated to them talking about their paraphilias and that they like children.and finally, i want to say that i don\'t understand WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE OF THIS THING. because they say ""it\'s a raw story, it\'s not for everyone"" but it\'s not raw, it doesn\'t show you a reality, it\'s something too exaggerated and caricatured to be even comparable with reality. i guess if you like lolis idk maybe you can like it, but you can\'t identify with it, if you do identify with it it\'s your problem and it\'s a little weird and creepy? but normal people won\'t identify with any of the characters, they won\'t see themselves in the story because they don\'t feel attraction towards minors or have a minor kidnapped in their homes or something like that.Good points: the OST is kinda nice sometimes, the animation is pretty, I love the character design and the art style, the opening is really good.Also, it really made me want to see where the story is leading, even if it\'s disgusting. The thing is they put the ending in the first scene and the opening, so it spoils you half of it.', 'It\'s a series written to be written with no depth or meaning, chars pasts are just writtin without meaning that the writer only think of ""i am only adding tragedy and nothing else"", while its working and plot was already crap this series doesnt even have an aim, the only goal in the series is ""random human beings who have traumas is having some fetishes on kids"". On the subject of psychology, I wouldn\'t like it even if it was the first psychology production I watched, you can\'t even connect with the characters unless you are a pedophile, in short, if you are not a...pedo that has lost its reality, this anime is not for you. pedo that has lost its reality, this anime is not for you.', ""The show can be summed up into one description: bad animation, fetishes galore, and an overall questionable premise. I wanted to drop the show from the start, but I stuck with it for some reason. As much as I hated it, I've come to appreciate it for at least existing.Is it for everyone? Hell no. Did I think the plot was good? Eh, it's unique, I guess. Did it hit home at times? YES. I'd highly recommend watching this if you have time to spare, don't mind gore, and want to spice things up because you've done nothing but watch the same romcom concept just...rehashed in a slightly different manner.

Some is deserved, some is not, and im gonna share my opinion about this showfor one, the characters kinda are very meh, the pedophile dude seems to be trying his hardest to be edgy and 'look at me im drooling over child ahh!!' but it just doesnt work because he's trying too hard.and honestly the concept of the story seems good, a child kidnapped and locked into a high school girls apartment because the girl is a pedo n shitif it was executed right.it had a great plot but horrid execution because they...tried cramming in too many other 'edgy' characters if.. i dunno everyone else was innocent and are starting to suspect that the girl is having a child in her apartment for some reason and they were trying to figure it all out or something it couldve gone in a wayy different direction than 'edgy edgy edgy scary murder pedophile rape abuse abuse pedophile!!' or maybe the kid in the apartment grows up to have some kind of mental issues or something, im not a story writer im a person who reviews the storyalso unnnecesary kills like why??but there was good parts of it such as -the way the mc manipulates people to keep the girl in her apartmentshe litterally said that she loves someone to keep them away from her apartment, or makes people feel bad about prying, or murdering her best friend because she found out, she is good at manipulating, she is good at doing murder! but they hardly did much with it on some episodes but did too much with others! i feel like if they rolled with the manipulating and kept out the other 'im edgy' characters this maybe would have been good but it ended up like thistl;dr good story bad executionalso really edgy for no reason edgy tried cramming in too many other 'edgy' characters if.. i dunno everyone else was innocent and are starting to suspect that the girl is having a child in her apartment for some reason and they were trying to figure it all out or something it couldve gone in a wayy different direction than 'edgy edgy edgy scary murder pedophile rape abuse abuse pedophile!!' or maybe the kid in the apartment grows up to have some kind of mental issues or something, im not a story writer im a person who reviews the storyalso unnnecesary kills like why??but there was good parts of it such as -the way the mc manipulates people to keep the girl in her apartmentshe litterally said that she loves someone to keep them away from her apartment, or makes people feel bad about prying, or murdering her best friend because she found out, she is good at manipulating, she is good at doing murder! but they hardly did much with it on some episodes but did too much with others! i feel like if they rolled with the manipulating and kept out the other 'im edgy' characters this maybe would have been good but it ended up like thistl;dr good story bad executionalso really edgy for no reason edgy"", 'It is literally the worst anime I have ever seen, at first it was interesting to see the morbid and stuff, but as it progresses it becomes repetitive with the scenes that go from ""happy"" to ""dark"" over and over again, not counting the disgust that their pedophile scenes cause me, it\'s really repulsive even if it\'s just innuendo.And to all this, adding that the concept of the ""yanderes"" seems so fucking boring , Matsuzaka is simply a mediocre character who kills and kills without anyone being able to do anything and nothing else, like 100% of yandere characters.Definitely the worst anime I\'ve ever seen...in my entire life in my entire life', ""Entertaining and very exaggerated. I overall think it's very enjoyable.If you were expecting psychological horror which this was labeled as, this isn't what you're looking for. This anime is excessive when it comes to dramatization; each character is over-the-top when it comes to who they are.[Story: 6/10]I like the premise a lot. To me, it got me reeled in. Satou's incredibly unhealthy and somewhat terrifying perception of reality is a large hook which you will probably be reeled in with too. You just want to know what will happen next. Yet, the characters themselves are kind of detrimental to the story (I'm looking at you...episode 2). It feels like the hard-work established got tarnished and seems entirely out-of-character.[Characters: 5/10]Is a character an antagonist? That character *has* to be dramatic. Not only that, but certain character traits are INCREDIBLY focused on which defines how you remember them. Say for example a character likes cats, that will be exactly what you remember them for. What is the point of having such over-the-top antagonistic characters? I'd much rather there be no excessive characterization and it stay on track. Two antagonists being quickly moved on from from the first 2 episodes, yet there's an unnecessary need to introduce a piece of information about a character which I'll repeat: *absolutely* unneeded. It would've been fine had it been what they were originally but now they've completely done a 180 in who they are defined as. The only redeeming quality in my eyes is how Satou (so far) has been handled. Yes, she is completely insane and dramatic, but it doesn't *feel* unneeded.Needless to say: overdramatic and unnecessary edgy.(SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH!) Having Mitsuboshi stupidly characterized has me feel more like laughing than actually feeling resent for him. It could have just been him being who he was: a character traumatized over an assault and trying to develop out of it. Then, immediately after in the next episode, you find he's attracted to Shio of all people. Uncharacteristically, he just snaps out of his trauma and instead just moves onto his twisted love for Shio (he literally spends about 3 minutes sobbing to Shio and expressing how much he loves her). Personally, the teacher being an antagonist was alright. It felt like a solid twist despite it being obvious and quickly revealed. Yet, there was absolutely no need to also include his masochism. It could have been handled so much better.[Sound: 9/10]The background tracks are great for building up suspense. I really like how it's just overall designed. Sound effects and music have been used greatly. I think the use of silence (no background tracks) is masterfully done in my opinion. The distortion of the voice of characters feels too extra in my opinion, however.[Art: 9/10]While it's not perfect, the characters themselves are well-defined despite being simple. What's more appealing though is the visuals itself rather than the art. The use of colors is exceptionally well-done and the camera angles are (while not so complex) defined.-------------------------------------------------------------------[Short Version]Story: Interesting yet kind of mediocre.Characters: A bit funny how badly they're doneArt & Visuals: The art is very solid with characters well-defined.

The biggest example of this is the MC, Satou Matsuzaka, the psycho bitch that throughout the series kills multiple people to protect Shio, the girl she kidnapped. On top of that, there are other examples of this Anime being extremely fucked up. For example: Every character in this Anime seems to be a...Pedophile. Obviously the MC is one since she kidnapped an 8-year-old girl, but other examples are: Satou's Teacher, Mitsuboshi (The blonde guy), And Satou's aunt just to name a few.So, this Anime is very fucked up, but that's what makes it so enjoyable to watch.It's an absolute rollercoaster for the entire 12 episodes, It's very thrilling and has a lot of suspense. The episodes end on cliffhangers a lot of the time as well, which builds that suspense even more, and there are a bunch of moments where it genuinely gets a little scary.- Spoiler Segment -The ending is so well executed, it was remarkable to see everything that was established earlier in the Anime get together in the final episode. The scene where the building gets lit on fire is so damn thrilling and an amazing way to conclude the Anime, although it would have been more enjoyable if that wasn't revealed at the start and would be more of a surprise. The scene with Shio in the hospital is kind of strange, Shio chose to be with Satou but Satou died and now Shio is just chilling in the hospital? What?That part of the ending could've been executed better, but it's somewhat decent the way that it is.Overall, this Anime is wild af, It's pretty good. Pedophile.

I love horror and edgy for the sake of it shows but HSL is so badly forced and try hard that its not even enjoyable. They just cycle through every \'horrific\' plot point you can think of every episode, to the point where any character shows up on screen and its immediately obvious...\'oh their going to suddenly be revealed as a pervert/pedo/rapist/murderer\' as this applies to literally every major or minor character. This makes any plot revelation or attempt at twist; while always coming of nowhere, impossible to be shocking as they just happen so often they mean nothing after the first episode.

Its so bland and the way the story barely progresses each episode I really dont get the impression that they took this seriously and are trying to make a great piece of pysch horror media.

By any standard metric, this anime is not well made. The characters are way to over the top and do not carry any sense of realism. The plot is pretty edgy, with a lot of rape, murder and abuse. The backstories are quite generic, and nothing I haven\'t seen before in horror. The way the themes of mental health and suicide are dealt with are completely insensitive. If you don\'t want to watch a show like this, sure, go ahead, I wouldn\'t blame you, but I didn\'t give this show a 9/10 on enjoyment for nothing. This show\'s purpose is...not to deal with mental health issues, and it doesn\'t really pretend to do that. The focus of the show is on ""love"", which should really be obvious given how that\'s the one thing it consistently explores in all of the episodes. If you look at this as a show that tries to explore a perverse sort of love between the various characters and not as a mental health awareness thing, then the show starts making sense and is actually pretty enjoyableStory: 6/10The plot is in no sense masterful. There is the occasional plothole here and there, the occasional creepy scene which doesn\'t really have a purpose, but the plot serves the purpose of showing how various characters end up in the relationships they do and how they end up afterwards. Most of the events follow a progression and it is easy to see why they are there. The show is not actually very subtle about this and the character\'s inner monologues show how events affect them.Art and animation: 5/10The art is utterly mediocre. The moe art fit the themes of the show very well (what sort of art do you expect from a show about love called ""happy sugar life""?), but that doesn\'t make it well made. It\'s just kind of, super generic. The same goes for the animation. Both are pretty much forgettable.Sound: 8/10I really loved the OP and ED, and listen to them frequently. The OP carries that creepy feeling really well, and the ED is nice and heart-warming. The rest of the OST was, mostly unnoticeable, but that\'s ok. The purpose of music is to seamlessly blend in with the scenes, and if you can\'t notice the music, then that fine. The same goes for the sound effects, they don\'t break immersion. If we removed the OP and ED, the sound score falls to 7/10, or maybe even 6/10 but hey, that\'s not bad.Characters: 3/10Mitsuboshi was atrocious. His way too over the top pedophilia not-pedophilia (I can\'t for the life of me figure out) had the opposite of the intended effect, it made something that was supposed to be ""creepy"", and turned it into something that was just, unbearable. And it\'s not like he was a small part of the cast either, and has a decent amount of screen time devoted to him. Other characters which at first seem like they might play a big role end up not mattering at all. Satou and shio, the main characters are also caricatures of themselves to some degree. If mitsuboshi acted less over the top, and if satou\'s edge was handled better, I could see the character score jump to a 5-6 easily.Enjoyment: 9/10If you are like me, who loves Japanese pop horror to death (you know, all those JRPG horror games and stuff), then you\'ll have a pretty good time watching happy sugar life. It has all of the classic JRPG horror elements and presents them in a way that is bearable for the most part (excluding mental health issues). Sure, the writing is objectively nothing like Shakespeare, but does that really matter when you have a cute loli, pink-haired yandere girl and horny masochistic auntie?Overall: 7/10I liked watching happy sugar life for all of the reasons I described above, but I will view this show more akin to a good pizza I once ordered and ate than as an expensive Gordon Ramsey meal. not to deal with mental health issues, and it doesn\'t really pretend to do that.

The ending certainly suggests to us that the love that the protagonist feels for THE CHILD (AND I STRESS THE CHILD WHY I DON\'T CARE ABOUT IT IF THEY SEEM TO BE HAPPY SINCE PEDOPHILIA REMAINS AS A CHILD IS NOT ABLE TO INTEND AND WILL) is unhealthy as it will also lead the little girl to have a dark future, probably if she has to kill for love she will do it as she is the exact incarnation of the one who...showed her ""love"" even if in the wrong form. However, I must say that if the author wanted to give this message, denounce this in a bloody way, he did it badly. I cannot understand what his intentions were in creating this work. Sometimes, most of them seem to justify such behaviors only because the protagonist has no physical relationship with her, she describes their life happily almost as if she wanted to show another face of pedophiles and kidnappers. Well, my dear lolicon friends, she remains pedophilia and is wrong through and through. Here, this bothered me. The knowledge that many people will be able to misunderstand these child abuse after seeing this work (because the mentally deviant are there).I gave the pass only because she kept me in suspense until the end and left me with a deep sense of bitterness for Shio and her brother and also for the fact that she did not bore me. It remains a controversial work and I hope one day to be able to read what the author thinks to get a better idea. I would have liked a different ending, a happy ending maybe showed her ""love"" even if in the wrong form.

I might give it a try again but it doesn\'t really go anywhere for me, it\'s just boring.storyehhhh, well it\'s just...? boring.. I don\'t know where it goes and what\'s going on.artThe art is good, the artstyle doesn\'t really fit for the story, kawaii? yes. scary? no, absolutely no. I don\'t find it terrfiying, scary or whatever, the only thing they went for is ""let\'s make it a kawaii yandere yeah"" I mean, you couldve atleast tried to make it scary...soundI don\'t know what to rate this because I don\'t care about the sound,...but there we go again, the whole kawaii uwu girl voices, I don\'t know it\'s just annoying to me but fits the characters..charactershonestly.. for a cute anime it fits, but like some of the characters are absolutely bland.. satou is just your ordinary kawaii school girl nothing specialenjoymentit\'s just.. the two girls love eachother a lot yes, then a guy/girl falls in love with one of them and is like ""i gotta have them!"" thats where it just goes, and then satou is like ""no i love this girl"" and just scares them and it just goes on like that..? I didn\'t find it entertaining, maybe it gets better when it goes on? i don\'t know, I just can\'t stand it.. it goes to a kawaii cutesy theme rather than scaryoveralli don\'t think i\'m gonna watch the anime again..

It\'s definently not something I like T_T', 'What is Satou\'s story?                (Spoiler Alert)To me...The idea isnt to say it is a love story but to show how crazy people can get over their concepts of love, me as a Happy Sugar Life fan ‚úäÔ∏è i can confirm that it isnt a beautiful love story as everyone expects love stories to be, to have an happy ending.. or a reasonable one, but that\'s exactly the purpose.. it\'s like a dark humour joke in between serious pshycological behaviour. Its not meant to be a good story, but a crazy...one with a crazy concept. Why does everything need to have a good ending where people get taken care of and carried to others ""ideal ways of living"" Happy Sugar Life is indeed an awful anime to society\'s eyes, but the anime/manga isnt about what society wants, the anime is indeed pointing to Satou\'s desires and her own ideal understanting of Happiness. The idea of hidden horrors (such as the bloody pages) in between the beautiful interpretations of Satou\'s ideals, these ideas are screaming her actions and memories of ""pay the price of crime"" intrusive thoughts that society has input in us (our ways of thinking), but she doesnt care, Satou knows she\'s done things wrong (in society\'s aspect) but all she wants is happiness and love (and if we think about it its just what everyone wants, but everyone is different, some people rather love money for example) so she just keeps on pushing on what she believes, ignoring all of her intrusive thougts. Satou\'s intrusive thoughts represent her as crazy, but she likes the outcome of her actions so she doesnt care at all.Satou isnt crazy, doing such awful things in such a controlled society is indeed unnacceptable as it is destabilizing the beautiful ways that it has given us. But Satou doesnt want what it has to offer, she ""WANTS"" what she feels like she desires and she isnt letting go of it, and why would she? Arent we all deeply inside egoisitic and looking forward for getting what we want? Deep inside is it wrong to hold the will of our hearts? Do you remember the day, that, that big fat dude that was starving ate a donut instead of giving it to a cute little begar child asking for it because he couldnt buy it? Everyone around got mad at him, and debated his actions, but he was hungry, but no one cared because he seemed fat and full to their eyes. So is it bad to really want something? Have we asked to be part of this? Dude only wanted to go out and eat a donut, but everyone seems to be blind by basing themselves of the obvious, and just as him, who ate without second thought, Satou doesnt want to be part of other\'s perspectives and interests neither and clearly, this being the reason why she kept going till the ending she thought she deserved. Ofc she died, but it was the ending she craved for as things were going.. even though she died, she lived all her moments as she wished for, she died a criminal in society\'s eyes, but to herself she did what she wanted. It doesnt matter if you like the story or not, the story isnt about you or neither me, its about Satou, and about how she won what she wanted within all those atrocities.Satou won and had her Happy Sugar Life achieved.(Extra)By the way, aint gonna lie when we look to what she did to poor Shouko üíÄ she didnt deserve that, she seemed like a truthfully amazing friend, i got really sad when she stabbed her with zero compassion, but i understand that she won (Satou), and i dont consider her as weak like many of us who hide and run away from what we want.. her ways were abrubt and violent, but her strength was indomitable when she saw what she wanted.Now an official review based on a research i made after writing this point of view of mine without any information beforehand, just to prove my point isnt wrong:>>The author of ""Happy Sugar Life,"" Tomiyaki Kagisora, crafted the story to explore the darker aspects of love and human nature. The narrative delves into themes such as obsession, manipulation, and the lengths one might go to preserve their perceived ideal life. Kagisora intended to challenge the traditional, often sanitized portrayals of love by juxtaposing it with horror and psychological tension.In interviews and discussions, Kagisora has emphasized that the core of ""Happy Sugar Life"" is about the complex and sometimes destructive nature of love. The story\'s protagonist, Satou, embodies this complexity through her extreme actions to protect her relationship with Shio. This contrast between the seemingly innocent title and the dark content serves to unsettle and provoke thought in the audience.Kagisora aimed to depict how a person\'s distorted view of love can lead to dangerous and morally ambiguous actions. By doing so, the author invites readers to reflect on their own perceptions of love and morality. The conclusion of the story, with its tragic and unsettling resolution, reinforces these themes and leaves a lasting impact on the audience.<<I gotta say, i feel rly cool after hitting it on point so much üòéAnyhowThis is my personnal review, intending to share my view on this.

At first it was cute, until all the underlying problems come out in full. The MC was crazy, but partially because of her past. The other characters were just as crazy or just messed up. It was a fun and crazy ride for sure, with just a bit of cringe.The story wasn't to bad. Pretty easy to follow and understandable. Sure there were some extremes, but it was entertaining. Even though it felt wrong at times, the story progressed forward well.

For me it was a little bit better than mediocre.The show starts off pretty good, but then it starts showing a little plotholes towards the end, or trying to make one girl just look plain stupid.There were some unanswered questions at the end credits, which you probably would have to fill in I guess. For me I needed some extra scenes, but the studio probably wouldn\'t want to show it a gore scene at the end if you know what I mean *splat*.I don\'t know if the series was rushed a little bit, but for me...it was. Well the situation was only 3 months and it does show what money is needed, also what working means, but also what alcohol can do for some people, well won\'t get into that. The mental state of children and teens is very crucial, because it can affect them in the future in a terrible way, where they can be psychotic or have tendencies which is dangerous. You have to help them before they get broken (can recover a bit, but never fully) or past broken (which you can\'t recover from or never), but past probably only 1%. This anime shows you the mental state of which I talked about. This anime also shows you how some terrible people are, like co workers, bosses, lolicon (trying to take, for themselves) and how you can get consumed by others personalities. I said a little mediocre, but I rate overall a 6 want to say good, but towards the ""end"" it was just not my thing anymore. Its not who choose who, maybe a little, but it\'s just that I didn\'t like how you can get consumed by love in a bad way, if you love someone let them go, which can go both ways (good or bad). Last note probably, wanted to say more, but would spoil.(TL:DR This anime shows you how you how you can become broken, if you don\'t get love when your a child. FYI had this as 8/10, but then thought about it 6/10.) One last note the who choose who didn\'t break this anime for me, just wasn\'t feeling it anymore and it kinda rushed well for me. it was.

Never have I seen in anime so many crazy people. This anime is peek inside of their minds and I like it. It tells us why they think and act like this in very believable way. If you want to see really fucked up psychological horror anime this is for you. Don't let low score to fool you this anime triggers so many people for reason. It has so many haters because it is very hard to identify with anyone. I can guarantee that this anime will make you cry not in horror but in loss. "", 'This was seriously an amazing watch! I really didn\'t expect to find something like this and enjoy it this much. I genuinely made a great choice when I decided to check out this anime after watching a clip from it. I seriously recommend it to people who are okay with - and perhaps even interested in - watching a practically immoral love + life evolve from a twisted point of view. I don\'t recommend it if you\'re just here for the horror and murder, though.Story: 8/10I really love the story. Even though it\'s a little predictable and over-focused on a few supporting characters in the...beginning, the story is still definitely enjoyable and interesting. The most fun part was watching what goes on and how each of the characters - especially our yandere protagonist - handles everything. Everything flows well and logically, too, although dramatized with a couple of loopholes. It makes you sit on the edge of the seat, perhaps conflicted on who you want to cheer for, and curious or nervous as to what happens next. I really love the impact of a specific few scenes, too. Also, I especially really love how uncomfortable this series can make you feel. I couldn\'t help but squirm in discomfort a few times in response to some things, but that\'s what really adds to the fascinatingly disturbing aspect of Happy Sugar Life.Art: 8/10The art also really captures the original manga art style well! It\'s also really cute and appealing to look at, adding to the false image of softness and cuteness to the story\'s tone - while also making the darker aspects interesting in a way. It really helps capture the ""appears soft and happy but dark and horrible beneath the surface"" tone. The art does still set me off a little, though, mostly with how slightly wonky and moe-y it looks sometimes. Like with some things looking a little unrealistic (like Satou\'s hair, I love it but the way it\'s often drawn looks unnatural from an artistic perspective), and the moe style simply setting me off a bit. I do love it on a few characters and all, but I can\'t help but be off-put by how it looks on the boys and Shouko.Sound: 7/10Sound\'s really nicely incorporated into the overall story, especially during the more suspenseful and ""bitter"" moments. I really like the opening, too, as it\'s catchy and seems to fit the anime perfectly. I\'m pretty meh with the ending, though, despite still liking it. The overall sound also could\'ve been better, as I feel it still lacked a bit in impactful storytelling - but I\'m sure it must\'ve connected to other people more than it did with me, anyway. I still find the overall sound to be good, too.Character: 8/10I love the characters! Almost all of them are so nicely developed, surprisingly even Asahi and Shouko - character archetypes that you\'d expect to be used as flat characters literally only there to become murder victims. Shio\'s really nicely developed, too, despite often being painted as the cute, innocent, sweet love interest who\'s being protected and fought over all the time. It\'s a very nice surprise, to be honest- mostly since I feel like most yandere stories don\'t properly develop anyone aside from the yandere character (and/or the love interest). Even Satou doesn\'t just senselessly kill for love - she\'s much more complicated than that and goes about with things in various, yet still questionable and immoral things. My only issue, though, is with how many insane and immoral characters there are in the cast in contrast to the actually sane and normal ones. It feels incredibly unrealistic to have so many insane characters around someone like that, although I did have to remind myself multiple times that it may be for dramatizing\'s sake. It\'s interesting to see how each character is insane in a different way, yes- but I still wish there were a little more normal and sane characters in the cast that aren\'t just there in the background, like the white-haired cafe worker. On the other hand, though, maybe it\'s done like that on purpose so that there\'s all the more charm in Shouko\'s character....Enjoyment: 9/10As somewhat mentioned already, I really really enjoyed watching this anime. It was really exciting watching the disturbing story unfold while making me conflicted on who to cheer for and sympathize most with. It\'s really different from other animes and mangas I\'ve come across before, and I love it. It\'s really a whole new taste of a series. Of course, I know there may be other series out there similar to this, but- nevertheless, it\'s not that common to come across a series with an immoral (+ lesbian) couple, well-developed side characters, and a twisted main point of view. That really excites me as a person who enjoys reading stories and characters from such unusual and psychotic perspectives.Overall: 8/10Overall, as stated already - I think this anime is awesome. 8/10 in my opinion. I do wish more people would know about this and find it as good as I do, though. Regardless, though, I do look forward to reading more in the manga!

I\'m excited to see what else happens after this anime\'s ending.', 'To be fair, I didn\'t like Happy Sugar Life from the moment is begun and was desperate to drop it, but, decided to give it a go. To be in an agonizing pain for 24 minutes again and again. So this review is taking too much of my pesonal opinion rather than a, aproach from all sides, kind of thing. There is much hate for the anime due to it being so out of expectations, because I really wanted to like it. So I sat through all 12√©pisodes.Sound:7/10Now, where to start, I\'ll go from best to worst, and the best has to be the opening...song, which in the 150 anime I watched is one of the few I actually sat through every episode and listened to it. The closing song was not as good but did try to be good so I\'ll leave it at that. Apart from the songs, the voices, reactions etc, where pretty good, at times there was a touch of laziness in it, and at others it was too much. But I will  not be that critical, hence the 7 which in my diary is good.Art:7/10I don\'t know much about studios and stuff, so what I watch and like is not based on that. And till this moment, I do not know who took on the art for Happy Sugar Life. For the medium budget I believe it to have, they did what was right. It was overall average, with small ""high quality"" moments when stuff really begun to stray from god\'s path AMEN.Characters:1/10Characters for me is how much I can relate or understand one\'s actions and way of thinking and also, how much character development there is, so it\'s 2 in 1. With that said, character development for me was a 0. I did not see any difference from the first episode all the way to the 12th, with the only exception being a ""young,blond,hot playboy"", who turned pedophile and yes you know who I mean. Aside form that, I did like the fact that the main, and supporting cast had messed up characters. However when we leave the ""some messed up"" and close in on ""all messed up"" that\'s where things for me start getting bleached, and when my pain intesified because it goes like this:""Hello I\'m a whore who\'s been with 100 men but a 5 year old girl makes me more fulfilled"" - MC""Oh hello I like you and you rejected me, I got bondage raped by an older woman, and now I only fancy myself lolies""- young,blond,hot playboy""Yo, I\'m a teacher with a wife and kid\'s, but I do like my willywarmer young""You can watch, of have watched it and catch up on the rest.Story:2/102 is being generous and is only given for 2 moments in the whole anime that I liked. Apart from that, there is no story, nor plot here. It\'s more like this. We have a starting set, and small events that happen all of a sudden. We do have some minor plot twists that can be predictable, but like some anime fans I don\'t like thinking about an anime while watching it, but simply try to get absorbed by it , and think the details and what I didn\'t like next.Overall Enjoyment: 2/10For me happy sugar life was one of the very few that I would call, a time loser. In all honesty you may find me over reacting but in my defence, I am not. I have watched a lot of trashy anime and Have never felt this disappointed. song, which in the 150 anime I watched is one of the few I actually sat through every episode and listened to it.

But I will  not be that critical, hence the 7 which in my diary is good.Art:7/10I don\'t know much about studios and stuff, so what I watch and like is not based on that. And till this moment, I do not know who took on the art for Happy Sugar Life. For the medium budget I believe it to have, they did what was right. It was overall average, with small ""high quality"" moments when stuff really begun to stray from god\'s path AMEN.Characters:1/10Characters for me is how much I can relate or understand one\'s actions and way of thinking and also, how much character development there is, so it\'s 2 in 1. With that said, character development for me was a 0. I did not see any difference from the first episode all the way to the 12th, with the only exception being a ""young,blond,hot playboy"", who turned pedophile and yes you know who I mean. Aside form that, I did like the fact that the main, and supporting cast had messed up characters. However when we leave the ""some messed up"" and close in on ""all messed up"" that\'s where things for me start getting bleached, and when my pain intesified because it goes like this:""Hello I\'m a whore who\'s been with 100 men but a 5 year old girl makes me more fulfilled"" - MC""Oh hello I like you and you rejected me, I got bondage raped by an older woman, and now I only fancy myself lolies""- young,blond,hot playboy""Yo, I\'m a teacher with a wife and kid\'s, but I do like my willywarmer young""You can watch, of have watched it and catch up on the rest.Story:2/102 is being generous and is only given for 2 moments in the whole anime that I liked. Apart from that, there is no story, nor plot here. It\'s more like this. We have a starting set, and small events that happen all of a sudden. We do have some minor plot twists that can be predictable, but like some anime fans I don\'t like thinking about an anime while watching it, but simply try to get absorbed by it , and think the details and what I didn\'t like next.Overall Enjoyment: 2/10For me happy sugar life was one of the very few that I would call, a time loser. In all honesty you may find me over reacting but in my defence, I am not. I have watched a lot of trashy anime and Have never felt this disappointed.', ""Sometimes, you read a synopsis and expect it to be really happy and void of any dark concepts.  Had I not looked into MAL's similar recommendations, I would have thought that here too.Story & Characters: Happy Sugar Life is... difficult to sum up.  Satou Matsuzaka is a high school student who makes herself appear as happy and friendly in front of others.  She works part time as a waitress at various locales so she can afford to support herself and appears as this perfect, humble student.  She lost her parents at a young age and is under the care of her...aunt... or so we think.  In reality, who she lives with is not her aunt, but Shio Kube, a girl who is roughly ten years younger, who Satou loves with all her heart.  We find out early on that Satou keeps Shio locked inside their apartment, telling Shio that it's dangerous to go outside.  A few episodes in, we actually learn that Shio's brother is looking for her.  Much of the rest of the series consists of slowly watching Satou and Shio's secret lives unfold in front of us and it's anything but light.Satou is an unstable girl, who does anything to protect the world from seeing Shio with her.  She knows it's a problem that she is with her due to the circumstances that they meet, but instead of doing anything morally correct, she makes things worse with everything she does.  She's been, fairly, compared to Yuno from Future Diary, because they both go through desperate lengths to be with the one they care for so much, and with a personality to match.  Shio is estimated to be a younger elementary school age, but all she does is hang out in the apartment and play cute with Satou.  She doesn't have much to her.  Taiyou is introduced early on as a coworker of Satou and ends up being abused while working on the job.  The problem?  He ends up developing this fear and hatred towards adults and it leads to him being the most annoying anime character that I have seen in a really long time.  He freaks out of any instance of any adult approaching him, and while it's not unusual based his experiences, it's not the most pleasant viewing experience.  Asahi is Shio's brother and ends up making posters to try and find his sister and while he's an okay character at first, his reactions to everything feels excessive at the worst of times, and annoying at others.  Shio's irresponsible Aunt gets introduced to us later on and she basically doesn't think anything through before doing anything.  I really don't understand why she's in this series, other than to be a container for Satou's manipulations, and even then, it just comes off as being too easy because there's zero motivation here.Almost the entire cast of characters is horribly laid out to us.  Satou doesn't think a thing through before acting on her impulses, Shio refuses to listen to anyone (holding someone's hand apparently is a really difficult task), Taiyou and Asahi are past being unlikeable and end up being straight up annoying and Satou's aunt follows Satou's orders for zero reasons.  They all simply make no sense to me, as characters.  The one glimmer of light are Satou's coworkers, Sumire and Shouko.  Sumire seems to have a crush on Satou and is actually quite brave for being so up front with her.  She acts like any other ordinary school girl and I was sad to see she was only in a few episodes.  Shouko, like Sumire, was another character who is very innocent and tries to befriend Satou.  She had way more potential to be a beacon of light for Satou's character, but like Sumire, wasn't included enough in the series for her to really get the chance.  I was really rooting for both of them, but like other darker anime, the series mostly just mocks their existence.As the series progresses, more and more details of Satou and Shio's backstories are laid out to us, similar to how Future Diary went about unraveling the details of Yuno and Yukiteru to us.  Similarly, Happy Sugar Life attempts to do the same with mixed results.  The story portions that take place in Satou's workplace feel so out of place, and aside from Taiyou, it doesn't feel like the scenes serve much of a purpose.  The scenes of Satou and Shio together weren't bad, as they showed us just how much Shio means to Satou.  The main problem are the circumstances in how they met.  It really emphasizes Satou's inability to think things through because if she acted differently, being with Shio wouldn't have been such a crime that the series shows it to be.  The ending to the series, again, had some decent concepts, but again, it gets completely destroyed by a decision that Satou makes involving a ring.  It completely derails the ending and clearly tells the audience that they have no interest in showing us what true happiness is.  (Story: 6/10, Characters: 3/10)Art: The art style seemed fine at times, but it really feels like they wrestled with the thought of going full CG, and kind of ran a final product that looks like they stopped halfway.  It's different, for sure, but I'm on the fence about whether I liked it or not.  The series also gets pretty graphic at times and the scenes where blood is shown, really don't look that great.  Blood just kind of looks pasted on.  I really didn't like the look of that.  (6/10)Sound: The OST, voices and songs were all pretty average with not much spectacular to speak of.  Both EDs I liked, as I've come around to liking ReoNa more lately, due to her involvement with some of Hiroyuki Sawano's works.  But there's nothing spectacular - or significantly problematic here.  (6/10)Overall Enjoyment: Happy Sugar Life had some okay concepts, but was completely bombarded by the terrible cast of characters from anyone not named Sumire and Shouko.  The groundwork was there, but our characters just make poor decision after poor decision, and the result is a really unlikable cast of characters within the series.  I wasn't expecting a lot aside from some stark ideas, but this managed to get below with.  (5/10) aunt... or so we think.

But in reality it delves into the mindset of Satou Matsuzaka, an individual with a corrupted past which then caused her mental state to appear normal from first look, but hides a sinister intention after meeting her true ""love"" of her life, Shio Kobe who also has a corrupted past and what drives her and the plot of this anime.Happy Sugar Life is a good anime as it incorporates lots of elements we would usually associate with a character and flips it on...top of its head. It\'s plot is good but it does have some faults which primarily comes from the removal of some integral parts of the manga. Especially the backstory of Kobe\'s family which was surprising as it was a integral part of what made her mother do the things she did which in the end makes her look more disrespectful and mean in the anime. But the main plot is still there and that\'s what makes it enjoyable to watch as it makes you want to understand that none of the people in this story are truly good except for maybe Asahi. As for Satou the plot manages to make you feel for her even though you should be the least of sympathy for her as although she has the right intentions of being with Shio she ultimately decides on removing the ones who pose opposition in her life. It makes you question whether or not she is bad or whether or not you should be rooting for her and in the end it brings a climax to where she ends it all to be permanently one with Shio.Although one things for sure this anime is definitely not something everyone can watch as the main premise is a sensitive topic which is wrong in all circumstances and teaches the dangers and cycles of abuse that can happen and its effects on individuals. Which is something not many people can watch through. But when understanding the themes it can definitely make this anime an enjoyable watch.(Bonus points for the Opening and Ending themes, they are seriously bangers and they definitely carry this anime no doubt) top of its head.

You‚Äôd expect everything to calm down, but this anime is anything but calm. There‚Äôs nothing Happy, no Sugar, and definitely no Life.If the name is already gonna mislead you, just imagine what the anime is like..Satou isn‚Äôt just your typical stereotype yandere. She actually has some common sense and logic in herself, like she won‚Äôt just say something rude to you because she feels like it. She has control over herself and won‚Äôt just go out and massacre people. Take the best example of a stereotype yandere as Yuno Gasai, the ""queen...of yanderes"" herself. Satou doesn‚Äôt just kill off people because she thinks they‚Äôre no good or just a disturbance to her. She never killed taiyou, because she‚Äôd probably be a top suspect, since she had been asked out by taiyou (she rejected him), and a day after that, he went missing (because of the manager). This alone is enough to get her arrested or confronted, so it‚Äôs no good news for satou to kill taiyou.Overall, I‚Äôm surprised tomiyaki kagisora had actually put some sense into his main, most prized character, Satou Matsuzaka. You could very well write many essays about the several character‚Äôs mental state, best example is Taiyou and Daichi. Happy Sugar Life is the hidden masterpiece of all Animes & Mangas that I‚Äôve ever watched. It really packs a punch into you once you get covered by this thin layer of happiness during the first few episodes, best example is the friendship between Satou Matsuzaka and Shouko Hida. You‚Äôre all caught up with the happy and upbeat animation and colors, but all of a sudden it just.. disappears.[ SPOILER ALERT ]We get to episode 9, possibly the most traumatizing moment (if not episode 12). You get met with this little song at the end of the episode, Canaria, and me personally, I think it was misleading. Now if you‚Äôre English, and do not understand Japanese, great! Cause the lyrics will literally make you cry. The song sounds all happy and sad at the same time, but the animation. OH BOY. You see Satou and Shouko supposedly having a conversation, and you‚Äôd think it‚Äôs all going good for Shouko, becuase of how tomiyaki animated the colors.I caught onto this, and you‚Äôd see the light shine onto Satou‚Äôs face during one part of the song, which would make you think ""oh! That should mean she‚Äôs gonna forgive shouko!"". ‚Äî Nope. Not even seconds after the song fully stops, Shouko gets killed.That entire roller coaster filled with so many emotions, just to come to an abrupt pause and realization that it‚Äôs no good. After Satou kills Shouko, shio comes to a breaking point. Shio and Satou have this emotional moment, and Satou breaks. Her mental state is now the lowest it‚Äôs ever been. Not even minutes after she killed Shouko, she‚Äôs already mentally breaking apart.If you did watch Satou‚Äôs actions and emotions a little after she killed Shouko, she did have some sense of remorse, something you‚Äôd NEVER find from another yandere. Satou had actually felt bad, and if not possibly regretted killing Shouko. It was really the only choice she had, as Shouko would take everything Satou held dear to herself away.Satou is not just a stereotypical yandere. She‚Äôs the embodiment of a yandere that has some part of their mental state that can still think. Despite her poor mental state, and trauma from her childhood, she can still put logic and sense into herself. Her trauma could‚Äôve been an excuse for poor mental thinking, but no.

I would never EVER wanna recommend this shit to ANYBODY even if it‚Äôs a joke hell to the naw.literally the main character herself and almost every single side character is a pedophile. No, am not exaggerating no, am not tryna mislead you it‚Äôs literally RIGHT there In the damn bio hell,...just look at the clips on yt!!The main character is a hoe and she sleeps with tons of older dudes.

I understand anime is meant to break from realism and be a little extra in their portrayal of things, considering most anime/manga are fictional, and not recreations of historical events. But HSL\'s plot makes literally no sense at all if this was a real situation. Like how the hell is no one worried about a girl buying very suspicious items from a general store, with a woman who reeks of bodily fluids? Not to mention that BS scene at the end of the show when Sato ""saves"" Shio from a...5+ story building fall, like blud that aint how physics works.

I do not hope for more darkness upon the series, the show pretty much predictable if you are viewing it carefully.The Happiness moment is where I hate the most, because I think it\'s the strangest way to cope reality. Seriously? I was hoping more from this anime, guess I do not need such high expectancy.Overall, I think the anime is good to show and understand how psychology works but cannot be considered...as a main source, rather a guessing game I think? as a main source, rather a guessing game I think?', 'The plot is that everyone is a weird pedophile. Thats kind of it. The reason why i rate it a 6 is because unlike the really garbage anime, this one kept me sufficiently engaged enough to watch the whole series. I also think the ending was something to read a bit into. You have an ending where this weird fucked up cycle of emotional and sexual abuse kind of continues with the loli having being imprinted by the main character. Aside from that, the plot is convenient. It serves a weird tsundere fantasy of being able to overpower anyone who gets in the way of...something you love. something you love.', 'The more I watch, the more I think this is just pedophile battle royale and the kid is the main prize.It¬¥s mostly a decent show, however, I have a question: ,,Where are the good guys!¬¥¬¥ There is not a single important character that isn¬¥t a pedo, murderer, or both. There is just no reason to watch the show. Not a good one at least.There is no way you would root for any of the characters, hoping everything will turn alright for them.I think that¬¥s the main problem of this show. No protagonist to root for, no redeemable main-side character, no nothing. You NEED a character...like that, therwise it¬¥s just watching bad guys do bad stuff, which just makes you feel bad and uncomfortable. like that, therwise it¬¥s just watching bad guys do bad stuff, which just makes you feel bad and uncomfortable.', '*Disclaimer*Just personal scratch.Advised, possible spoilers.Opinion & InformalArt: 6/10The art was usually fine. In some cases it could look pretty good while in other cases there was a noticeable drop in quality and detail. For example, sometimes hands could look a bit iffy or basic. For the most part however anatomy and proportions checked out. There were a impact shots but there weren\'t really any impact sequences. The impact shots themselves didn\'t look too impressive or leave any impact; they were usually the ""scary-face"" and honestly felt like they were used a bit too much...I get it, Matsuzaka is off. I don\'t need to be reminded...of it more than two times. There were no nature or panoramic shots. There weren\'t any showcases of artistic skill either. Overall, the art was a pretty modern-standard type that didn\'t do much in differentiating in style, quality, or presentation.Animation: 5/10The animation, like the art, was about average in most cases. I do feel like the animation in a few sequences were terrible though. There was clear use of shortcuts such as selective framing (waist-up so as to not need to animate walking), cut-shot-action (for example, when Shio\'s mom slaps her, that\'s not actually animated), dropping frames (during actiony bits), and reused animation (multiple uses of the vows sequence or flashbacks). Two examples I can point to in the last episode, which is the finale and is expected to have some higher level of quality in my opinion, is when the blond dude trips trying to chase after Matsuzaka and Shio; his fall is animated as a cut-shot with selective framing as to not animated the rest of his body falling circa-impact. The second example is when Matsuzaka swings the luggage case at the hoodie dude. The animation in that was a bit...eh in which it\'s clear that a few frames were dropped. The one nice thing about the animation in this show was the nice use of supporting effects. The deep-glowing eye colors, the ""brightness"" during happy moments, and a few extra bits were all nice additions to the otherwise simple animation.Characters: 5/10There was a needless amount of characters in this. The teacher was forgotten for more than half the show and only really served as the tutorial instructor for introducing Matsuzaka\'s twisted personality. The stalker-coworker...what was she for again? Was her only point in the show to eventually give Matsuzaka a passport because that\'s what it seemed like. The character designs overall were okay. I didn\'t like the hoodie dude\'s design too much; from what it seems he hasn\'t been in contact with his abusive father for quite some time, so why the bandages? I can understand why the aunt had bandages because of the nature of her ""work."" The character development in this show was abhorrent up until the final episode. The amount of character development in this show should have been better suited to maybe 6 episodes; that\'s how much pointless plot and filler was added. I did not appreciate one bit how long it took to reveal the state of how Matsuzaka and Shio came to be as well as how long it took for a true antagonist to really appear. Basically, I feel that the character development never took off until the final episode.Plot & Development: 5/10This could seriously be condensed into maybe 6 episodes with the plot setup and the amount of meaningful development that was presented. I felt the pacing was way too slow for what was laid on the table. The plot was introduced pretty weakly and there wasn\'t much to go off on besides the fact that Matsuzaka and Shio are living together; the episodes on introducing the blonde guy, the teacher, and the stalker are honestly needed. What did the blonde guy do for the story other than as to serve as the roundabout way for hoodie guy to find Matsuzaka\'s apartment? The teacher was just there to be there to build the creepy atmosphere of the show. The aunt could have totally disposed of the bodies instead. Furthermore, the aunt could have totally somehow been able to give Matsuzaka a passport too. Matsuzaka\'s fake death plan was sort of setup to fail from the start. Using her own clothes on the body was pointless because bodies can be identified with dental records alone. Despite the lackluster and pointless development for most of the show, I decided to give the overall development a 5/10 because I genuinely appreciated the culmination of Matsuzaka and Shio\'s relationship in the final episode. Shio was confronted with a choice and she chose for herself giving her own true reasons for her choice. Matsuzaka also found her own resolve in what she wanted for herself, her happiness, and for the future of her relationship with Shio; she chose for herself. In the end, both Matsuzaka and Shio were able to make choices for themselves. Matsuzaka was finally able to understand what it is she was looking for her entire life and Shio was able to finally let go of everything to be with Matsuzaka. They both reached a climax from their decisions which was good enough character development for me to give this show a 5/10.Music: 5/10There is no sound design worth bringing up. The soundboard was fitting for it\'s sequences such as bodily sound effects, blood and gore sound effects, etc. The music was average but was most fitting in only one case, the final sequence in the last episode. The OP and ED were okay to my tastes.Conclusion: 6/10I liked the final sequence conclusion, the burning building and their double-suicide part, so much that it redeemed only slightly a lot of the gripes I had about this show for the first 11 episodes. The conclusion answered many of the big questions by revisiting all of the characters in the show and what their fates were. The actual conclusion was open-ended and a bit interesting in regards to what the future for Shio holds. Though, not interesting enough to get me to watch a season 2 if that ever happened.Overall: 5/10Not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It\'s not bad, but it\'s not fine either. Overall, the art and animation were of average quality. The music was average too. The majority of the character and plot development were lacking, but the conclusion is only somewhat worth it to consider picking this up if you have time to kill or are interested in this sort of genre. of it more than two times.

This is one of those shows where like half the cast is comprised of shitty people, yet it works for the story being told. The characters ranged from morbidly interesting to Mitsuboshi. Outside of Mitsuboshi, the rest of the characters are solid in my opinion, as Mitsuboshi alone brings my personal rating for characters from a 9 or 10 to a 7. Easily the worst character just based how he was written.I personally enjoyed the ride that was this show. If a somewhat morbidly fucked up, yet tragic story was the...aim, it succeeded in my absolutely honest opinion. Although, I would say to make sure you aren't weak of mind, as the themes touched do genuinely range to morbid on a social scale, but, if you don't have any restraints about the dark themes, it's one hell of a ride and interesting in seeing how these absolutely derranged characters go about the events of the story. I'd easily and give this an 8 overall.Edit: Forgot to mention this, but if you are specifically looking for GL/Yuri, this is probably NOT your anime. As a Yuri enjoyer myself, this anime absolutely does not scratch that itch as much as it scratches the Psychological Horror. So, I will say it again, DO NOT watch Happy Sugar Life based on the yuri/girl's love tag!! aim, it succeeded in my absolutely honest opinion.
