I was excited, I watched it straight away.I know, you might be thinking, Why does a 20 year old watch DDP? And get excited about it?Because I enjoy it. It brings me joy and fuzzy feels.I liked the movie, it was great, and I was moving back and forth with the music.I didn't have high expectations for the movie or anything, and i'm glad I didn't, it wasn't super epic, but I didn't dislike it, and I would watch it again, even buy the DVD.They only thing I did dislike about the movie was the CGI scenes, I...know some of you think CGI in anime is cool, but I just don't like it in DDP, Except for the ED's. I don't mind them.Story: 8/10Art: 8/10 (TBH, I think the art was better in the Anime, or maybe it was just my LQ stream.)Character: 10/10 I love my Precures. However, I disliked the bad guys, I thought they were cliche and nothing exciting. xDSound: 9/10. I dance along.Enjoyment: 10/10. I'm a little kid, and I love DDP.Overall: 8/10Must watch for DDP fans. ;) know some of you think CGI in anime is cool, but I just don't like it in DDP, Except for the ED's.

I watched the first bit in November and didn't get around to finishing it until January, watching the second half at 3x speed to get through. I normally would have just dropped it, but I had a hope it might do something interesting with the memories gimmick. That hope was dashed.I honestly don't care about Cure Heart much, and the fact that the whole movie revolves around her is a turn off right away. The overemphasis of her memories at the expense of the other girls' is pretty tragic considering how much more interesting their scenarios were....Mana lived a day of her life, pretty much (albeit a bad one), and the other girls were having fairly important outings. I'd have liked to see more of that.As much as the reasons behind the glimpse of the future made no sense, I did like the look at aged-up cures that we got. It would be cool to see a sequel movie or two for popular teams where they grow up a bit.

Mirai ni Tsunagu Kibou no Dress is unfortunately a very underwhelming movie by Precure standards, with a disjointed plot that feels haphazardly placed together with elements that don\'t seem to fit or connect. The movie is about overcoming memories of the past and moving on from painful times and dealing with the deceased; however, the method with which they choose to execute this is on shaky foundation, to say the least. Many of the twists wind up feeling silly and nonsensical in a bad way, often making no sense in the context of the movie.The movie seems to be attempting...to send messages about how people are wasteful and throw out whatever they don\'t need, but the point is moot: by having this executed by the villains, the audience will by default side with the heroes of the film and likely not pay attention. There are other themes here, like loss mentioned later, as well as moving on, which work to moderate success. There is also a small amount of backstory for Alice and Rikka if you wish they were expanded upon. Unfortunately, both of them (as well as Makoto and Madoka) take incredibly small roles in the movie. As well, Madoka only appears very briefly near the end of the film with no explanation or context as to why she was there at all.As an example, two characters are killed off and later returned as main characters in the movie. However, no explanation at all was even given by the characters; the twists simply appeared to come out of nowhere and only happen for the sake of happening. Despite the movie being allegedly about Mana\'s grandmother\'s wedding dress, it actually plays a very small role in the movie and is, ironically enough, useless in the following scenes. It only reappears briefly twice towards the end, but they seem more like trivial details than essential parts of the plot. Many motivations and explanations are completely left in the dark with no context, and motivations and backstories are skipped over completely in some cases.One thing about Mana in this movie is that she is quite openly the ""main character"" in this: while this is understandable typically, her name being in the movie title, it crosses the line today: about 25 minutes of the movie are dedicated solely to her scenes with the other girls getting relatively short appearances. This could be forgiven if Mana was in character, though she sadly is not: she acts much different than she does in the series and her defining happiness and traits to ""never give up"" have mysteriously vanished.The movie makes an attempt to use CGI, but it is typically not noticeable. However, the movie\'s true villain is the true problem; they aren\'t revealed until very late in the movie and have no context (as expanded on above) and are killed off in about a minute after the fight begins. I wouldn\'t really recommend this unless you are a completionist or a fan of Dokidoki Precure, as there is unfortunately nothing special here. 4/10. to send messages about how people are wasteful and throw out whatever they don\'t need, but the point is moot: by having this executed by the villains, the audience will by default side with the heroes of the film and likely not pay attention.

Dominion,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1151/Dominion,"[""Dominion Tank Police is a timeless classic from the master himself, Shirow Masamune. It quickly became one of my favorite ovas ever and it's rewatch value has never diminished, even after watching it for the last 14 years.STORY: A very simple story about policemen who patrol the city, keeping it safe from crime............IN BIG-ASS FREAKING TANKS!!! That concept alone had me sold! A young lady cop, Leona Ozaki, joins and she gets the cutest, most badass little tank you've ever seen!! The primary targets are Buaku and Annapuna and Umipuma, two sexy, gun-crazy catgirls. It's so incredibly simple and so effective at the...same time. Most of the story probably takes place in the manga, which I can't get my hands on, so there isn't much I can say about plot aside from Buaku's past, so if it suffers from anything, this would probably be it, but it's not too much of a concern. You won't feel left out of anything significant.ART: The animation is very good for it's time and still holds up well today. The character designs are colorful and vibrant, in stark contrast to the gray-blue, smog-covered tone of the city. The design of the tanks look amusing, especially Bonaparte (I think I spelled that right). A highlight is Liutenant Britian's facial expressions when he's screaming and barking out orders. This Masamune never fails with captivating backgrounds or great character designs. A definite win.Sound: The english dub is classic and gets funnier with repeated viewing. Watching the criminals bicker with each other in the museum is just friggin hilarious. The musical score is nice and transitions well from scene to scene, so you can't get tired of the BGM.CHARACTER: Every personality in this show is just just fantastic, from Leona's mother-like affection for her tank, Britian's insanity, the Police Chief's screaming and ranting over files and paperwork, to the perfect chemistry amongst the crooks and their banter back and forth along with their hair-brained schemes that barely work, everything just works with these characters, even the bit player in the police force.ENJOYMENT: This is a fun one to watch anytime. It has high rewatch value off of it's humor alone, and it's only two episodes long, so you won't lose any time at all. The opening theme will get stuck in your head after a while, but it's kind of catchy in a late 80's, early 90's sort of way, like Captain Planet or something (maybe not the best example, but have you tried to drill it out of your head?)OVERALL: This is just entertainment all around. I can recommend this anyone, but the language may be a bit harsh. The first episode is drop dead hilarious, the second episdoe takes a shift from humor to tell a story about the bad guys, but it's just as entertaining. It's a must have in any anime collection. same time.

On the whole I enjoyed the series pretty much, good to have shorter series to watch that arent 200+ eps marathons.Since it is an ova there isnt much character development and we barely get to know who they are. Although they are mostly stereotypes so it doesn't matter that much.For the age of the anime, the animation and sounds are decent enough to watch without any complaints.It made me laugh at some parts, wich is enough for me to recommend the series to anyone. "", ""Funny...A Little Confusing in places.....Loving the 80's 'Streets-Of-Ragey' Music over the battle scenes......Every Character has something to bring.......Very Silly at times but the better for it. "", 'Dominion is a bit of an outlier. Usually, action anime (or any anime under 12 episodes) likes to get to the point, establish a general story and aesthetic, have a bunch of firefights, and then resolve the conflict, but Dominion decided to do the very opposite.The story is told from the perspective of the Tank Police, whose name is rather self explanatory, they do regular police things (bureaucracy and homicide), but they have tanks. As for the tanks themselves, I can’t say I’m a fan of the design, I’m not sure what science fiction mumbojumbo they came up with to explain why they look like...that, but these tanks look more like inflatable dummy tanks than actual tanks. Another major issue is that these tanks are almost never used, you see them plenty, but for the most part it’s just decorative scenery that doesn’t get properly implemented. Of all the combat encounters in Dominion, only a fraction actually utilised the tanks. Sometimes that’s because it’s in a particular time and place in which there are no tanks, but more often than not it seems the Tank Police use their tanks as regular patrol cars, and seem to completely forget that they have big guns on them they should probably be using. In fact, the main character, Leona, has a customised tank, which usually coincides with being a lot better than all the other tanks, but it’s not really, it never saves the day, the police probably would have gotten more done if they stopped using tanks, and just started carrying rocket launchers in their patrol cars. For a unit with a psychotic squad leader who likes to blow everything up, they are remarkably patient with when they decide to actually open fire.Secondarily, for such a short series, the plot is needlessly convoluted, for a four episode series, just one macguffin would have gotten the job done, a central figure in this story is Greenpeace (a person, not the organisation), who isn’t mentioned by name until the last episode, and isn’t actually seen until it’s about 5 minutes from ending. When it comes down to it, a more effective story would be showing the sort of crime that actually lead to the formation of the Tank Police, having a criminal organisation commit bank robberies and drug trafficking and the like would make the most sense to me, but instead they’re stealing things for some shadow government who have been engaging in a several hundred year conspiracy. They say at one point that in this city there’s an emergency every 36 seconds, but we never see it, the only people who commit crimes are this one fat bloke and his two catgirls, and I have no reason to believe that there’s anyone else engaging in criminal enterprise. There is more concrete detail about ecological damage than there is about crime, which is a bit backwards for a show about police.But, it’s not irredeemable, the firefights, though lacking majorly in tanks, are certainly enjoyable, the fighting’s well orchestrated and there’s definitely a good sense of scale,  it’s hard to be that disinterested when you’ve got buildings collapsing and that, and also it’s the 80s so the soundtrack is peak as. Dominion certainly isn’t bad, but it could be a lot better, and they could start by designing tanks that don’t look pure gobshite. that, but these tanks look more like inflatable dummy tanks than actual tanks.

In case it wasn't obvious, it's a raunchy comedy with a side of fun action.If you watch all four episodes totaling about two hours, you will not leave a better or wiser person with a new perspective. You will, however, be unable to forget that the main character has her climactic showdown and character arc finish because the entire rest of the tank fleet got immobilized by a dildo minefield. That sentence right there is pretty much a measuring stick of how much you will enjoy the rest of the series. blowing up hospitals.

It has good animation, well designed characters, good music, and good world building.  But it is so slow.  It is first and foremost a comedy series, and while there are bits of action they are mostly used for comedic effect.  (In my opinion the comedy has not aged particularly well, but because of its subjectivity this does not affect the overall review.)  The characters while well designed are underutilized.  The overall narrative is contrived.  There are a lot of good ideas in the series but they never come together.

Masamune Shirow has many ideas and many things to say. Anybody who knows more than the superficial about him knows that he's hard to neatly categorise as an author. Ghost in the Shell is a thought-provoking milestone in the medium coming from that mind and although Dominion is also thought-provoking, it is so in a much meta-textual way. I will presently attempt to articulate why.From the very second it starts, Dominion appears to present itself as biting commentary on police brutality and excess. The first minutes are spent hearing (voice-off) a heated discussion between a police chief and the...mayor of that city. As the mayor struggles to keep her composture and argue rationally about the necessity for the police to minimise civilian casualties stemming from police misuse of extreme force (via military tanks deployed in the streets), the chief uses screaming, bombastic arguments and logical fallacies to argue for the necessity of even more force than that, less oversight and, of course, more funding. You could have easily think that this was a very facile caricature of American law enforcement following certain events in the mid-2010s but this story was written in the mid 80s, which in itself is both remarkably prescient and quite depressing.If you thought that this was setting the stage for a grim analogy on the corruption observed and expected in law enforcement, you may be surprised to find out it's not the case as they are the protagonists of the series. Although the series does parody (to a rather great comedic effect) the police forces' ineptitude, cruelty, and proneness to violence and excess, nowhere besides that intro dialogue and a blink-and-you-miss-it part near the end are those traits condemned, let alone met with consequences. Even the sympathetic rookie that we could have expected to become a motor for change, or at the very least a permanently horrified straight-woman, does little else than pushing against the (also expected) prevalent sexism in the institution, before being widely embraced by it when she proved she could be as bad or even worse as the lot of them.I was constantly puzzled trying to figure out what was Shirow trying to say with this piece. Does he ultimately agree with the police stance that the necessity for their existence justifies their excesses no matter how bad? Or did he simply choose, for some reason, a complex real life issue as the backdrop for his sci-fi comedy featuring a gang of irredeemable fuck-ups? Then you have to add to this a rather significant amount of the runtime (for its scant 4 episodes) spent in intriguing worldbuilding (that sort of goes nowhere) or almost a whole episode worth of delving into the main antagonist's backstory for a dramatic and gripping commentary on the inhuman lenghts to which humans can go in the name of scientific progress as way to understand their own existence.Having said that, by the end, the story is expertly told and wrapped up satisfactorily. In short, it is a good watch but one that might leave more questions in your mind than answers were received. And, I posit, maybe that's not a bad thing. mayor of that city.

Beginning with the story, the viewer is presented with the backdrop of Newport City. This is a place where a crime occurs every 36 seconds, all while most of the earth is enveloped in a toxic ""bacterial cloud\', and the police ride around in tanks and torture suspects for fun. However, it is all played for comedy, which in its own way adds to the bizarre, irreverent charm this show puts on. The story itself is disjointed and focuses more on gags and jokes...than the progression of any kind of plot. There are two separate storylines which are covered 2 episodes a piece, and they\'re both unceremoniously dropped, bereft of any satisfying conclusion. The art is probably the strong point here, but that\'s relative only to the rest of the show and not a general statement of quality. The world is designed in an utterly unique style, with a striking, maverick art direction. This really shines through with the backgrounds, where Newport City embodies this grungy urban squalor while still preserving that punchy visual optimism characteristic of the 80s. The best aspect of the art by far is the architectural design of Newport City, where many buildings feature this bizarre asymmetric style reminiscent of bacterial mats, while others embody a more classic cyberpunk skyscraper vibe. The character design, while characteristic of their decade, lack a certain polish which makes them feel cheap by comparison. Put simply, it feels as though this whole anime is in the same artistic genre as the Metal Slug games. The sound, however, is a little rougher than everything else. Aside from a catchy OP, the music is goofy and often fails to compliment the tone of a given scene. Even when it tries to be deep or cerebral, it just comes off as corny. This is all not to mention it is the most dated aspect of the OVA, showcasing the worst of 80s sound design, with shallow, cheap sounds of life and uninspired voice work. The characters are broadly inoffensive, meeting all standards of quality for their time, though nobody really stands out.

It turned out to be one of my favorites of that week, and I've loved it ever since. Having the ability to see the unedited version over the years, in its original language, has only increased my fondness for it. The gags all hit, it's super funny, it has incredibly memorable characters, the animation is excellent, the story is fun; if you thought Masamune Shirow could only do hard cyberpunk the likes...of Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed, and Black Magic M-66, this will open up your eyes. There's a reason this one is considered one of the hallmarks of classic, old-school anime. of Ghost in the Shell, Appleseed, and Black Magic M-66, this will open up your eyes.

It asks you to stop thinking, sit back, and enjoy while the characters revel in their vices.I have to commend the latter half of the OVA in particular, which focus on the recurring ""villain"" Buaku. His obsession with the past and eventual coming to terms with his own existence seems to have had a great influence on how Shirow approached the philosophies of artificial life in Ghost in the Shell....Dominion is worth watching for that alone.

D.C.II: Da Capo II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2595/DCII__Da_Capo_II,"[""I decided to change my review because I didn't liked it anymore, and I have other things to say now.StoryI still say that I can't give the story higher then a 6. I think I'm going to sound very negative now, but I can't help it, sorry. The story is just.. boring! The whole series is about the Koko x Yoshiyuki relationship which isn't going anywhere! We also see some episodes about Minatsu, again, I'm not really interested, but other people can like it. After some episodes I was really forcing myself to watch it.. Like I said, one word: B-O-R-I-N-G.ArtI can say something good...about this, at least.. There's nothing wrong with the art, we could also see that in the other Da Capo series. Bright colors, nice characterdesign, you can see that this anime is kinda new, that's a good thing, isn't it?Sound/Seiyuu'sNothing wrong with the sound, you can hear it very bright, so.. we can't say bad things about that either. But now we come to the seiyuu's. Some of them.. ANNOY ME!Examples:Yoshiyuki: If my boyfriend had a voice like that, I would say: Goodbye! That was really harsh, isn't it? Okay, maybe I won't, if I would really love the guy.Minatsu: The most annoying voice ever, does she always have a cold or something?! Maybe her seiyuu was sick or something?!The rest of them, they're fine. Some of them are really good, others are normal, think you understand me, right?CharacterI like most of Da Capo II's characters. Good ones: Otome, Yume, Nanaka, Anzu, Sakura and the rest who aren't with the bad ones. Bad ones: Yoshiyuki, Koko, Minatsu. Why I don't like Yoshiyuki, Koko and Minatsu? They are the worst main characters they could choose, and the story is mostly about them. Yoshiyuki is way too dense. Koko is annoying and thinks that Yoshiyuki always will see her as the first place, selfish brat. Minatsu acts like she don't need help, so people will feel sorry for her. And WTF is the thing with the bananas? I mean, she (Minatsu) says that she hates them, but she needs to eat them to survive. I mean.. BANANAS! How do they think of something so stupid! Did they ask the greengrocer for help when they thought of this! Horrible.. That this still can get a 7 is because of the 'good ones', and because I'm way to nice! :-)EnjoymentDo you like boring stories with two people who are in a relationship which never will work out? Do you like robots and bananas? Then Da Capo II is the anime for you! Okay, forget what I said.. I can't believe that this crap is from the same makers as the other Da Capo series. Where is the drama?! Even the end s*ckt very badly! We don't know anything yet... I'm not sure if I want to watch the second season of this, it needs to be VERY good otherwise I will drop it right away. But maybe some people enjoyed this, I don't know, I think that there was a episode where Nanaka sings, that one wasn't very bad.OverallI'm sure some of you are wondering why I gave such good notes, because I was really negative if you ask me. 1. I'm way too nice.. 2. Other people may like it, I wanted to watch at their point of view a little..My real OPINION: I wasted my damn time on this sh*t! BUT, I'll give the second season ONE chance, maybe they will make up for the crappy story/ending and all the other things. If they won't, I wasted my time even more.Thanks for spending your time to read this review! Some of you didn't expected Erisu to go evil, neh? :-) about this, at least.. There's nothing wrong with the art, we could also see that in the other Da Capo series.

As someone who's new to the Da Capo franchise, I still enjoyed it very much, so if you've never seen any of the previous installments, do not let this discourage you. The series can be enjoyed as a stand-alone experience, at least I did. This review will be spoiler-free.The Story: 6To be fair, the story is not the strongest point of the series, but it's certainly nothing to frown at. The plot progresses at a comfortable...pace, and it is a heartwarming tale for the most part. Some events are a bit predictable, but it's never boring, and it doesn't drag on. If you're looking for an epic tale, look elsewhere, but for a harem, it's quite good.Art: 8The art and visual are very beautiful. The whole team of sakuras and the lively colors used throughout the series really do enhance the mood. The character designs are fantastic, which is what first drew me to the series. Aesthetically, it is a very pleasant experience. It is a harem, after all, and seeing beautiful women is always a plus.Sound: 7The opening theme is very good, I think they chose a very fitting song for the series. The background music mostly good as well, some of it memorable, and some it just blending into the background. I personally thought the ending could have been better, though.Characters: 8The characters often make or break a show, and Da Capo was no exception. I already mentioned the wonderful character designs, and this extends to their personality as well as their appearance. The male lead isn't perfect, but he is quite likable for a harem lead. Almost all of the female &quot;contestants&quot; are just lovable and cute, but each of them have their own special charm. Amakase was especially entertaining to watch, a great character.Enjoyment: 7It was a pleasant and enjoyable experience. It kept me entertained, and I grew attached to the characters. It is a high school harem, and it's pretty hard to stand out in this genre, but I think Da Capo did a good job of making a show that's both enjoyable and memorable. It wasn't out of this world, but it was good, and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a strong bias against harems.Overall I gave the series 7: Good and enjoyable. I'm looking forward to enjoying the second season, and I hope you will too. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and happy watching. pace, and it is a heartwarming tale for the most part.

Veterans of the original Da Capo will see some distinct similarities concerning the overall plot and the characters that make up the world of DCII.As previously stated, the anime of DCII is severely lacking compared to its predecessors. It's not that the story itself is lacking, but due to a 26 episode series being abruptly split in half to two 13 episode seasons.I find it hard to review an incomplete story such as DCII but I don't want current and future viewers...to get the wrong idea. To those who have watched this series, you must definitely watch season two or you will have wasted your time. To future viewers, take into consideration that there is a continuation to the tale of D.C.II set to air in a couple of days.This review might seem out of place, but that's because I know the &quot;actual&quot; story of DCII . &quot;Season 1&quot; is not a good representative of the actual story, but think of it as the calm before a raging storm. Alert viewers would notice subtle hints that were dropped in some of the episodes, which means that there is more than meets the eye...With that said, think not of this as a review but more of a word of advice. If you felt cheated of your time by watching such a mediocre story, then &quot;Season 2&quot; might just change your mind. Since spoilers aren't allowed, then those who read this will just have to take my word for it.I for one am eager to see whether the &quot;Da Capo&quot; part of the story will get some screen time. Veterans of D.C.II should know what I'm talking about ;-) to get the wrong idea. To those who have watched this series, you must definitely watch season two or you will have wasted your time.

I was expecting the least of it since it has a low rating and watching it at first got me confused and disappointed because it was something completely different from the previous ones, but, it turns out great. People must have taken this series the wrong way because it is actually quite good. I\'ve watched it while expecting and searching for disappointments, but the only flaw to it is that it has two main stories which is basically wrong. The stories are great and they indeed, are able to switch between the two like...it was dante\'s weapons in devil may cry 3, but as what everyone learned since elementary, there should ALWAYS be ONLY ONE main topic because it\'s very hard to talk about two things at the same time. ""EF - A Tale of Memories"" were able to pull it off somehow but this one didn\'t, still, this is definitely a MUST WATCH, not as a continuation of the previous Da Capo but as a new anime.The undying Sakura trees do return but they\'re more like just a background this time. There\'s a whole new story but sadly its very wrong because they tried to fit two stories into one show. However, when separated, the stories are pretty good. Da Capo II has a story of love between childhood friends and also a story of robots and society. There\'s also a side story of playing in a band and a hint of the Da Capo harem. There\'s also this thing about the main guy having dreams just like Junichi in the very first Da Capo. It\'s really such a waste that they tried a mix of stories here. They took the other things lightly and ended up focusing most on the robot story while trying to keep up with the love story, so it was quite a mess. Anyway, the fact that the stories in separate are good and because it had a very nice ending, the story department still deserves a good score.The art is very good. Everyone and everything looked nice, but the problem is that it lacked beauty and cuteness. The drawings are good and the animation is good but comparing it to the previous works, the art, most specially the characters, could have looked so much better (the characters look bad in side view).The sounds are great. It has a nice OP and ED that is well fitted for the genre and it also has nice backgrounds, and nice voices. Everything is well blended with the scenes. The sounds are really good but not to a point that people would like it so much.To the viewers of the previous Da Capo, the new characters will feel really weird and disappointing since they don\'t seem to be directly related to the old ones. No history was presented. Disregarding that, the characters were all great and everyone had good roles, except for Sakura Yoshino. Thinking about it, it\'s quite disappointing that she doesn\'t have much to do this time. Another bad thing is that the main guy can be too much thickheaded but he was able to make up for that somehow.Da Capo II could have been great. It\'s quite enjoyable despite the negative facts. It has the comedy back, it has good drama, and the music band thing was a big plus. Suginami\'s 100% evasion is something to miss though but it\'s still fine without it. it was dante\'s weapons in devil may cry 3, but as what everyone learned since elementary, there should ALWAYS be ONLY ONE main topic because it\'s very hard to talk about two things at the same time.

But from what I have watched so far, nothing has changed at all! In nine episodes there has only been roughly 2 solid events: Koko's confession and the trip.Art: Based off a visual novel just like the previous two seasons, there is not much you can really say about the art work, except its well-drawn. Not that there are any significant differences in style.Sound: I was pleased with the songs in this season. I enjoyed the OP and ED song alot, as well as a few insert...songs. The OST is exceptional so far, and I hope I'll be able to get my hands on it soon.Character: Not much of a difference between the casts of the First Da Capo and this one. Yes, they very much resemble their ancestors with slight differences. But I thought there are some unnecessary characters this time barely affecting the story at all. Nanaka and Koko are my favorite characters so far, the rest of the cast pretty much OK.Enjoyment: So far the series ranks an OK, I ll lets keep going, although sometimes I am reluctant. I usually can finish an episode in one sitting, but it actually took the course of almost half a day to a whole day to actually get back on track and resume.Overall: If it were not for the sound, this anime wouldve ranked much lower than I had reviewed the first season of Da Capo. Not much you can really say, that stands out. I guess this would be the standard for &quot;The Average High School Anime.&quot; songs.

The big idea in this series, xenophobia to robots, was introduced echoing the last two series about bananas. Surprisingly the relationship between the protagonist and Koko was established quickly. Their obstacles in their relationship was fairly predictable, being too nice and general insensitivity from the classic protagonist. The story progressed much faster as a 13 episode series which was great because the three characters (Yoshiyuki, Koko, and Minatasu) were fairly fleshed out.Art-7There was nothing outstanding from the art (except the nice animation of ripping the world...domination notebook) but it was still nice.Sound-7Instead of Kotori singing we have Nanaka. I actually enjoyed the singing parts this time because more people were actually involved. (the band) The rest of the sounds were nice and the OP actually stuck with me.Character-7Our protagonist Yoshiyuki is a much more active character than Junichi. He goes for the girl and succeeds. The Asakura siblings do not have a major impact in the story save for the one episode but help flesh out the relationships between the three main characters. Koko is the shy one that lacks initiation until she gathers the courage which is great. Minatsu is the interesting character about living in society where robots are seen as tools. She has the most development as a character. The two girls, Akane and Anzu, serve their role to aid Koko and were neither outstanding or boring. Nanaka has her moment comparable to Kotori with the protagonist and it established her character well.Enjoyment-7There was not a single episode where I wished I would want to skip. The episodes usually kept me busy but nothing outstanding. I liked the part where the ""cliffhanger"" at the second last episode was supposed to mean something but the last episode just glossed over it in the first half. I chuckled at that because for once there was no emphasis in romance in the a romance genre series.Overall-7The series again improved from its prequels and kept the enjoyment factor satisfying.

It tries to imitate the original series but the characters feel rather familiar and the scenes seem disconnected. Although the plot eventually turns out to be more intricate than ordinary it still differs from the common harem clichés.The cast, led by Yoshiyuki Sakurai, attempts to deviate from the usual high school harem protagonist, but ultimately fails to break the mold entirely. The female characters, while introducing new tones to the story, still bear too many similarities to their predecessors, adding little freshness to...the narrative.Rather than the customary harem dynamics, Da Capo II concentrates on individual character arcs and overriding themes. Nevertheless, its plot lacks fluidity sometimes and seems disunited, which gives a rough viewing. Furthermore, its connection to the original series only serves to highlight gaps in continuity and unresolved plotlines.The quality of animation is a letdown, not reaching up to the required 2007 anime quality mark. The 1080p visuals seem to be upscaled and rendered fuzzy, lacking sharpness. While character designs retain the original Da Capo style, the resemblance is often too striking, blurring the lines between the two series.The opening and ending themes are nice but they cannot make up for the disappointing anime band performances and the inconsistent background soundtrack. While the Japanese voice acting remains consistent, it does little to salvage the overall viewing experience.In summary, Da Capo II may attempt to offer a fresh take on the harem genre, but its deviations from the norm result in a disappointing and disjointed narrative. With flaws in animation quality and narrative coherence, it struggles to engage viewers, offering little more than a mediocre viewing experience, even for fans of romance and slice-of-life genres. the narrative.Rather than the customary harem dynamics, Da Capo II concentrates on individual character arcs and overriding themes.

However, the entire plot line diverges from the dramatic tension and magic that defined the original series so well.This series is actually more similar to Chobits and True Heart ~Memories in terms of themes than the original Da Capo. After a few episodes dealing with a weak relationship, the main plot focuses on the Robot/human/feelings issue. So if you\'re looking for intense love triangles, either look elsewhere or wade through this quickly to get to the sequel.Animation:The animation...is actually very nice. The characters are well proportioned and colors are nicely set. The descendants actually look quite similar to their respective equivalent in the first series, except for Sakura, of course, who looks identical to her former self.Sound:The OP and ED didn\'t catch my attention much and the overall feel of the BGM was lackluster compared to the original series, but that might just be because of the lack of actual tension in this series in general. The voice acting cast on the other hand is very good and Yui Horie as Yume Asakura is just too cute.Story:The story is about a male who lives in Sakura\'s house named Yoshiyuki Sakurai who is apparently called ""brother"" by the Asakura sisters even though they have different last names (check Wiki if interested as to why) and this is never explained in the series.At first, the story is about his relationship with a girl named Koko, who he had been a good friend with for years. However, instead of continuing to develop and expand the relationship, the focus of the story shifts unnaturally when the main character stumbles upon a robot similar to Miharu Amakase in the original series.Yoshiyuki feels responsible for awakening the robot and the rest of the story deals with how others perceive of ""robots"" that have ""feelings"".However, the execution of this development was done in an inferior fashion and left the human girl, Koko, in the shadows. The overall conclusion of the story never answers what happens to the relationships but that\'s probably because they want to leave something for the second series.Overall, the story is a let down to the dramatic and amazing story in the original Da Capo.Character:The main characters in this series include familiar names such as Asakura, Amakase, and Shirakawa. It is interesting to note that Sakura (who still looks like a child) is now the principal at the school.Yoshiyuki is a ""nice"" guy as is most other lead males in harem animes. He is also stereotypically slow when it comes to understanding the feelings of the one he is supposed to be in a relationship with. Overall, I find his character weak in comparison to Hiroyuki in To Heart. He is apparently related to Jun\'ichi as he also sees others\' dreams and can magically make candy.In terms of the other characters, Koko is a shy girl who is very reserved despite being in a relationship with Yoshiyuki.Personally, I feel Koko\'s character is a far cry from Nemu in terms of potential. The only two characters that I really wanted to see developed were the two Asakura sisters who sadly got minimal air time. Jump to the sequel if you want to see more of them.Value:My expectations for this show were pretty high since it is the direct successor of Da Capo. I didn\'t expect the focus of the anime to shift away from relationships to focus on the metaphysical topic of robots with feelings and how society deals with them. Even with the shift in topic, it was handled in an inferior fashion in comparison with other animes of that topic. Overall, I think the value of this series is average. is actually very nice.

Dog Days'',https://myanimelist.net/anime/16385/Dog_Days,"[""Dog Days Season 3: Nothing Really Exceptional Here...In all honesty, the first season of Dog Days touched my heart. It told a very subtle, light-hearted, romantic tale with a basic plotline that really defined the value of simplicity. With the story being so brilliantly executed with minor flaws, I could easily consider it one of my favorite animes.However, I've noticed that season 2 and 3 share a similar problem- the plot never gets anywhere. Everything just feels so bland, and from an analytic perspective, makes it feel very lacking. Both the characters and the story remain shallow, and development was minimal.One good quality that all...the seasons of Dog Days share is the music. In my opinion, I think the music was phenomenal. All the openings sounded great, and the OSTs themselves were a simply magnificent collection. From the fanfares to the marches, to what even sounds like ancient medieval church hymns, the music really did enhance the powerful feeling of love and chivalry.Argh... Getting off track.My point is that Dog Days season 3 still possesses the same kind of potential as season 1, but the problem is that we're getting a jumbled up, rushed series, with practically no plot. After 5 episodes, the only real positive thing I can say is that I'm happy to be revisiting the world of Flonyard. The setting is one of the strongest points of this show.Well guys, thanks for your time in reading my REALLY sidetracked review! I hope this gives you a better perspective on what to expect from this anime. If not, I do sincerely apologize, but still, thank you for your time. the seasons of Dog Days share is the music.

I\'m not going to go into detail to explain the setting however since this is the third season of a series and thus you\'re pretty much expected to know all about that at this point. Now the second season of Dog Days was criticized a bit due to how plotless it was, but this time the story kicks into...high gear immediately from the very first episode as it takes on a slightly darker tone with a more serious and demonic plotline. However this quickly proves itself to be a bit misleading as the entire season does not look like this. You can roughly divide it into three parts, where the first few episodes cover a more serious story arc, the middle episodes are plotless, episodic and just plain fun, and the last few episodes once again consist of a second story arc. But as far as entertainment value goes, all of it is very enjoyable.The simplest way to describe it would just be as ""more of the same"". Assuming that you\'ve seen the first two seasons of the series (which you should have if you\'re reading this), then you should know pretty well what to expect, and I can only confirm that the third season follows essentially the same concept and atmosphere of a similar quality.Something that did change a bit this time around though was the level of fanservice which the show had during one or two of its more light-hearted episodes in the middle. The amount of skin shown definitely reached a new record for the series, but it still didn\'t feel forced or out of place to me, even though I can\'t really say it was necessary either. This is not an ecchi anime after all.The characters don\'t really develop very much (if at all) during the course of the show, which in a way might feel a bit disappointing but at the same time it\'s not really needed either. Dog Days has always been a series about pure and simple fun, nothing deep or thought-provoking. Hell the entire world of Flognarde itself is basically one big playground.Speaking of which, I also have to mention that the world itself is simply astonishing to look at. Flognarde is and always has been one of the most beautiful settings I have ever seen in anime with its magical floating islands, majestic castles, impressive landmarks, dinosaurs and every kind of fantasy creature you can imagine. It really feels like a Disney film when you look at it.All-in-all, the third season of Dog Days isn\'t really any different from the first two neither in script nor in execution. But as the saying goes, ""if it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it"", and with that in mind there isn\'t really very much to complain about. It\'s an anime which is very easy to watch and which has a surprisingly high amount of entertainment value, and you can\'t really ask for much more than that in the end. high gear immediately from the very first episode as it takes on a slightly darker tone with a more serious and demonic plotline.

Many times I asked myself what is this anime and what it tries to make, combining childish plot with pretty mature ecchi. ""This Show doesn’t fit for anybody"" I thought at the first season, but now I can say, it was the ""Introdusing the characters stage"".When the 2nd show came out I was very surprised, since I couldn’t guess where can they take the plot...any further.. This time I was wrong. The season introduced us new character and secrets of the world of biscotti, things that we couldn’t guess that can be there.And there comes the 3rd season, that made me very happy! Dog days is that kind of series that only becomes better and better with the more seasons it gets. I don’t want to spoiler you, but this time it starter with a big shock, for all of us, learning that there can be evil powers in such an innocent and cute world.This is a great show that can be very peaceful and hillarious at times ,but when it comes for action and battles (and they don’t forget them) it’s a party to your eyes! any further..

As a show that has received rather decent feedback on itself overall, one must wonder, with as of now, two, full, 12 episode seasons before Winter 2015, what does Dog Days"" hold in store for us?Story (7.00/10): Similar to the last two seasons, Dog Days and Dog Days\', Dog Days"" doesn\'t really deviate from what the series has already established.  Sink, Rebecca, and Nanami return back to the land of Flonyard, the world where all of their animal-themed friends in order to spend more time with them and play.As far as central plot goes, that\'s really all that...Dog Days"" has to offer.  The setup for the anime is the same for the previous two seasons, so there\'s not really much to say there.  However, apart from the two seasons, we do get some new content, something that Dog Days as a series always somehow manages to do.  As a fantasy show, Dog Days spends a significant amount of time world building, essentially creating the world of Flonyard as we view the show, adding in more details and facts about the show than one would\'ve known after just watching the first two seasons.  I always found this to be a positive of the series more or less because of how crucial it is for a fantasy story to explain where and what is going on.As for actual story content, Dog Days"" does a strange mix.  From watching the first two seasons, the first season is more plot based, with an overarching story that goes from one end of the runtime to the other.  While the second season is more slice-of-life based, with the story more focused on day to day life, rather than conflict.  This third season however, does a mix of both, combining both the plot driven story and day to day storytelling together.  The only problem I see with this style of storytelling is the fact that the series sort of pulls itself into two different directions.  Because of this, the more episodic parts don\'t really stack up to the rest of the season in terms of quality and importance.Overall though, Dog Days"" was an interesting addition to the Dog Days"" franchise.  Drawing in elements from the first two seasons and continuing with the world building that Dog Days actually does pretty well in, the show did pretty well with what it accomplished.  While the show really isn\'t the most stellar in the grand scheme of things, with some parts of the show being lower in story quality than most, there aren\'t really that many things to say bad about this series.Overview:+  World building+  Continues where the story left off (kinda)+/-  Both overarching story + episodic elements-   Episodic styled episodes fall flat when comparing to ones of the other natureCharacters (7.00/10): As a sequel series to Dog Days\', the characters in Dog Days"" don\'t really change all that much.  The series features the exact same cast of characters that are featured in the second season, without really much change in terms of personality or any other aspect.  A lot of them are quite one-note characters and don\'t really have much personality beyond what we know about them, but in the long run, it doesn\'t particularly impact the story in a big way more or less due to the fact that they\'re characters that are quite easy to remember and they tie in very well to the series that they\'re featured in.Following Dog Days tradition though, Dog Days"" adds in a couple new characters that add in to the already expansive cast of the show with the customary one male character.  (Grand total of recurring male characters is 4 everybody!)  Each of the new characters gets varying importance and impact to the story, with the character known as Sharl sharing the role of Couverte in the last season, as being the cast member that was the most impactful.While the characters in Dog Days do work in for the series, there are a couple things about Dog Days\'s characters that really gripes me.  For one thing, the expansive cast dumbs down a lot of character importance.  In the first season, the characters Sink and Millefiore really took the attention and were the two main characters of the show, with Eclair bearing similar if not as much importance as the Hero and Princess.  But as you get through the second season, and now the third season, character importance really falls flat.  No one is considered a ""main character"" anymore because they all share the spotlight with each other.  Because of this, a couple choice characters don\'t really do anything in this season, and that\'s a huge disappointment because you don\'t really get a feel as to who is above in terms of character importance in this series.  (Hell, Eclair barely does anything this season, and the series actually acknowledges it!)Overview:+  Easy to recognize cast+  New additions that served well for the series-   Character importance is non-existent-   No real development because of lack of character importanceArt and Sound (7.21/10): The art for Dog Days has been standard throughout its existence as a series.  Giving off a moe style look with bright colors everywhere, Dog Days truly takes on its fantasy genre again with the whimsical and magical looking characters and scenery that is the world of Flonyard.  The artstyle doesn\'t waver in quality over the course of the series, and stays rather stable throughout.The action sequences are great to look at, with the execution of the fantasy style of fighting looking quite fluid and very aesthetically pleasing.  And, in classic Dog Days fashion, there is some clothes ripping and some ecchi.  Not as prominent as the previous two seasons, but it\'s still there.  A downside of this season however is the fact that there aren\'t any customary war games like what\'s been featured before.  So, if you were looking forward to that, sorry, it isn\'t here.Sound on the other hand is a bit of a strange topic.  For all three seasons, Dog Days has had the exact same people do the OP and the ED tracks for the series.  (This is the first time I\'ve ever seen this happen.)  As a result of this, at the very least, the OP, sounds very similar to the style of the other two openings of the overall series.  The ED on the other hand is slightly different with a happy-go-lucky style of music.  Overall though, like the rest of the Dog Days tracks, there really isn\'t much to say.  It\'s not memorable enough to get it stuck in your head, but recognizing the tracks becomes quite an easy task on account of how distinguishable this series can be.Overview:+ Consistent art+ Good battle scenes+ Lack of ecchi.  Still there, but a lot less (This is a good thing, trust me.)+/-  Good, but not really memorable soundtrackOverall Enjoyment (7.21/10): Dog Days has been a series that I\'ve known to be a relaxing show to watch.  Because the show doesn\'t take its conflicts with the idea of the characters possibly losing or losing someone along the way, it\'s a nice fluff show that manages to be interesting regardless of whatever point you\'re watching it at.Did I like this anime?I did enjoy it, in fact.  While not the most stellar series ever, Dog Days does manage to entertain with its laid-back style combined with fantasy action, which in turn, creates a rather nice viewing experience.What didn\'t I like about this anime?For one thing, the characters never really break their own boundaries.  Because everyone is numbed down to equal ground all around, there really isn\'t much about them that is significant.  This was a problem in the second season too, and it\'s a shame because harking back to the days of Dog Days the first season, the show did manage to make some of its characters more important, thus creating a slightly more gripping story that looking back, was better to an extent to this one.Would I recommend this anime?If you\'ve watched both seasons of dog days and liked it, this won\'t be a bad experience for you.  With its laid-back style, Dog Days has shone out to be a relatively good watch when one would want fantasy mixed in with action and slice-of-life.  There really aren\'t too many bad points about this series, as it really grounds itself in the idea of being fluff above all else.  Of course, if you\'re a kemonomimi fan, this is also a good watch because al but three characters are animal themed, so it also has that going for it.Overall Score: 7.11/10 Dog Days"" has to offer.

As comparison, season 1 somehow left an impact on me, having a dramatic ending and all. Plus each episode is nice to watch. Season 2 is so-so, more like it was meant to be that way: no big conflicts whatsoever. Because of that, I was expecting something bigger for season 3.However, it seems that the plot of this season has little to none connection with the past two seasons. Pointless stories each episode, more side characters suddenly popping out, more pointless...fan service, no character development.That aside, the art is very nice; the one thing I truly enjoyed. The VA, OP, and ED are good, but nothing noteworthy.Now, I'm hoping that the next episodes will change my view of this season.

To be updated after the season ends."", '*Warning - this review contains some mild spoilers*I must admit I came across Dog Days while preparing for my ""Anime of 2015"" presentation scheduled for next local convention.In order to do each show justice I try to watch it\'s earlier seasons - that is if it had any.That way I ended up marathoning first two seasons on two weekends before even starting with Double Dash.While I have some issues with the show as a whole and my first impression was somewhat bad the first two seasons managed to get me hooked up.The world is very, very beautiful and inhabited by lots and lots of characters...- each one of them likeable and cute to some degree (yes - even the character voiced by Emperor Wakamoto fits in just fine in there).Thus - after finally being done with Dash I was eager to watch Double Dash as well.I was excited mostly to see the characters I came to like develop further - something that began in Dash and was done beautifully.Those expectations were further supported by anime itself - with the promise the Heroes will be summoned during peaceful time so they can spend more time with their friends.I was disappointed.With loads and loads of characters I\'ve mentioned above there\'s more than enough material to work with in Dog Days already.I just can\'t imagine what the creators were thinking while writing the script for 3rd season.Instead of character development I\'ve anticipated they gave me even more characters - all of them living too freaking far away to make it to regular cast.I understand the idea was to show us that the world of fluffy people is much larger and beautiful but still - some parts were rather unnecessary and led to nothing.All the development our regular cast received during season 2 was ignored painfully leaving my hunger not satisfied.And while I could somehow bear with new characters as they are - the fact they took valuable screen time away from the main cast is painfully felt in this season.Finally we were introduced to cliché ""misunderstood"" antagonist. Who wasn\'t even misunderstood in the first place - in fact: despite having good intentions he resorted to evilest possible means of achieving them at first opportunity.I cannot quite appreciate the creators\' use of existing tools if they cannot use them properly...The good part of this season were the 3... 2,5 episodes actually focusing on the thing which was promised to us:Existing characters.Special note goes to one episode where certain characters reveal their past - which was by far the best one of the season and the only one which made me feel any compassion.Ehh...I\'ve complained a lot with this review so I\'ll end it on a more positive note.The visuals and music were just as good (if not better) than those of the first two seasons - with the opening IMO much better than the one we had in Dash.The new locations (which I take were the focus of this season after all) look gorgeously and make you want to be there with the cast.We also (finally) get to see Nanami\'s \'Hero Mode\' - which turns her into a beautiful young lady. Pity we don\'t get to see much of it.The fan service while increased in amount (seems to be a trend with each following season) is still performed in a pleasant, non vulgar way - this deserves a praise seeing the competition in this area.Still - I have high hopes. If this letdown doesn\'t kill the franchise the hypothetical Season 4 (Triple Dash?) might deliver what 3rd did not.Perhaps the writers decided to develop the world in order to come back with something grander yet? - each one of them likeable and cute to some degree (yes - even the character voiced by Emperor Wakamoto fits in just fine in there).Thus - after finally being done with Dash I was eager to watch Double Dash as well.I was excited mostly to see the characters I came to like develop further - something that began in Dash and was done beautifully.Those expectations were further supported by anime itself - with the promise the Heroes will be summoned during peaceful time so they can spend more time with their friends.I was disappointed.With loads and loads of characters I\'ve mentioned above there\'s more than enough material to work with in Dog Days already.I just can\'t imagine what the creators were thinking while writing the script for 3rd season.Instead of character development I\'ve anticipated they gave me even more characters - all of them living too freaking far away to make it to regular cast.I understand the idea was to show us that the world of fluffy people is much larger and beautiful but still - some parts were rather unnecessary and led to nothing.All the development our regular cast received during season 2 was ignored painfully leaving my hunger not satisfied.And while I could somehow bear with new characters as they are - the fact they took valuable screen time away from the main cast is painfully felt in this season.Finally we were introduced to cliché ""misunderstood"" antagonist.

Did those hopes get fulfilled? Ehhhhhhh.Story: 6/10Assuming you've watched the first two seasons, you know all about the world that this show takes place in. What you probably want to know is what the general feel is like. The first series carried a slightly darker, more linear plot than the second season, which mostly filled itself with fights of the day and lighter fluff. The third...season takes a middle ground, with 3-4 episode long arcs at the beginning and end of the series, and the middle full of fluff and/or backstory. While this sounds great on paper, and the first arc is fine, I couldn't bring myself to care about the last 4 episode's story at all. I'm somebody who weighs the later parts of series heavier than the earlier parts, so this leaves a damper on my story rating.Art: 8/10One of the strongest suits of Dog Days has always been its art. With bright, gorgeous backdrops and cute characters, the show is at least nice to look at. There's even a bit of 3DCG on the castles, and it looks fine.Sound: 6/10In my review for Dog Days Apostrophe (this is how I am going to refer to them, because that's how I believe Dog Days' should be pronounced), I gave the sound a 6/10 for being too generic. This time, it's not because it's not special, but because of roses and thorns. The OP was better this time around, and the last arc has some nice atmospheric music to go along with it. However, with this new positive comes the dreaded Lalalagate. In the last two episodes, there's an idol song with only la la las as lyrics. It was super disappointing and made it seem like Seven Arcs didn't even have enough money to pay their voice actors to sing. So it evens out.Character: 6/10The other large difference between Dog Days Quotation Mark and its predecessors is that Quotation Mark balances out character times, possibly a bit too much. Basically, characters that didn't get much screen time before get a lot more, and visa versa. Do you like Cinque/Shinku/Shulk? What about the princess? And Eclair? Those old favorites get surprisingly little screen time for being some of the main characters. This season continues the trend of dumping new characters in, except unlike last season, I don't like these new ones.Enjoyment: 7/10My hopes were high as I had a good time watching the first few episodes. It waned a bit during the repetitive fanservice and fluff episodes, rose back for the lore episode, and crashed in the last arc. Overall, it didn't feel as comfy to watch as the first two seasons.Overall: 6/10Is the third time the charm? Nah. Dog Days Quotation Mark failed to entertain me as much as the first two seasons. Maybe it wasn't as bad as a standalone, but after three seasons of pretty much the same thing, Dog Days is getting hard in the tooth, and it may take some broad changes to make it as enjoyable again.If you too like touching fluffy tail (but only if you're a real fan of this series) I recommend this season. season takes a middle ground, with 3-4 episode long arcs at the beginning and end of the series, and the middle full of fluff and/or backstory. While this sounds great on paper, and the first arc is fine, I couldn't bring myself to care about the last 4 episode's story at all. I'm somebody who weighs the later parts of series heavier than the earlier parts, so this leaves a damper on my story rating.Art: 8/10One of the strongest suits of Dog Days has always been its art. With bright, gorgeous backdrops and cute characters, the show is at least nice to look at. There's even a bit of 3DCG on the castles, and it looks fine.Sound: 6/10In my review for Dog Days Apostrophe (this is how I am going to refer to them, because that's how I believe Dog Days' should be pronounced), I gave the sound a 6/10 for being too generic. This time, it's not because it's not special, but because of roses and thorns. The OP was better this time around, and the last arc has some nice atmospheric music to go along with it. However, with this new positive comes the dreaded Lalalagate. In the last two episodes, there's an idol song with only la la las as lyrics. It was super disappointing and made it seem like Seven Arcs didn't even have enough money to pay their voice actors to sing. So it evens out.Character: 6/10The other large difference between Dog Days Quotation Mark and its predecessors is that Quotation Mark balances out character times, possibly a bit too much.

The overal concept  of the show has always interested me as i am a big isekai fan l. This show was on my hold list for some time i watched this shows 1st season ages ago and loved it but now watched it fully.Anyway the point to that is one of its premises is the \'war games\' which i always loved about the series as i thought it was an interesting concept which diverges from your average isekai...plot.HOWEVER! this was taken away in this season. I think it lost some of its charm. This season focuses on the demons- pretty similar to average isekai plots right?This annoyed me as they basicly threw the  war games in the bin.In all the other series they have them. Yes it had something similar but it was more to introduce a new character.Yes i did like some episodes though because they did exactly what i wanted. An expansion on other characters backstories and feelings. Which in my personal oppinion is what you should do on an expansion of a series.Now lets talk about the opening and endings. The opening in my oppinion was boring. The ending was a little better but that was mainly because of the animation going along side it was cute and funny. These can play a vital role in the overal enjoyment of the show. And it did. But in a bad way. In the first season the opening was great! It got me hyped for the series and made me excited to see it. But compared to the third one it was nothing. Even the animation clip runing beside the song was not as great as previous ones.But i must say i did find enjoyment in this series and that is mostly because of the characters. I loved in the previous series and who i grown to like.But the main problem with this season is pacing and event order.Firstly unlike the other 2 seasons it has 12 episodes insted of 13. Why?In the previous 2 seasons it seemed like a organization these 13 episodes were split into sections in my oppinion for example A-summoning and world building B- problem or main event of the series C-conclusion and returning home. Which really worked in the previous seasons but it did not. It more goes like this summoning problem problem,problem, character building,problem, the end. The problem i have is it starts of of with an interesting concept of the summoning going wrong which i though could be interesting and it kinda was? But during the start it becomes an \'epic\' battle which seems like it should of happened in the middle of the series it could of been a great part of the show but no. It lasted about 2 episodes and was rushed. Which i think was a waste. The fact of bringing dragons in was cool but was rushed. The middle episode was more on the lines of what i came for-Dog Days. and it was.But as i say again the loss of the epic war battles made it lose its charm. But then it ends and goes to a massive battle arc which seemed ok because its a formula dog days has used in the past. But this arc lasted too long it lasted to the last episode.This comes back to my original point pacing. In the previous series as i mentioned the first 2 seasons end with a conclusion and returning home. This more was ending the main story arc and end. End i said because it basicly takes way the returning home and summoning ritual away and saying goodbye to end of the series.It ends the main arc then basicly ends with them going. Which was not a good ending for the series.This comes back to my point about why was the series a 12 insted of a 13? In the previous seasons the ending usually finishes in about 2 episodes which closes everything nicely and saying goodbye but this season felt soooo rushed it took about 10 minutes and it was over. Even the in the normal world scene was reduced to a start for the credits. It lost the sadness of having to leave everyone and everything in this world and having to go back to their dull boaring lives. The small time you had at the ending the sadness had gone and it seemed like ""oh i can come back anytime so its not sad"" which annoyed me even in the second series where they knew they could come back they were sad.In conclusion,Dog days""(3) tries to be too much of a battle shounen and your average isekai this resulted in a loss of some intresting concepts. Its poor pacing gives a rushed feeling about this show. The fact it is more battle shounenRuins some of the great things about dog days. Dog days was always a cute and funny show with some shounen action  but in this season it tried to take over the show and failed.A/N- this was my first ever review before i hope you enjoyed it :D-Rido plot.HOWEVER! this was taken away in this season.

Denpa Kyoushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29589/Denpa_Kyoushi,"[""I had actually read a little bit of the Denpa Kyoushi manga before the anime was announced. I had only finished the first two volumes, but I was excited for the adaptation none the less. So, was my excitement well placed? Let's break it down and find out:Story - 6Kagami Junichirou is an otaku NEET with a bad case of YD, meaning that he can only do that which he Yearns to Do. His younger sister isn’t satisfied with that, so she forces him to take a job as a teacher. Unsurprisingly, Kagami is unenthusiastic about teaching, but if any of his students have an...issue that he finds amusing, then he decides to help them out. That's the basic premise, and unfortunately, the show doesn't really go beyond it. For the most part, each episode introduces a new student, and then Kagami fixes whatever problems they had with some wacky solution. Every episode follows this same formula, so it doesn’t take long for watching the show to become tedious, especially since an overarching story is near-nonexistent.Art - 6A-1 Pictures is one of the bigger animation studios. They animate several shows each season, and for both halves of Denpa Kyoushi, they were working on three other animes besides it. However, it looks like they couldn’t quite handle that many at once, since they clearly cut costs for this show’s art, which just does not look good. It lacks a distinctive style, and most colors lack any gradients, so everything just looks flat and lifeless.Sound - 7Sound quality is one of the few things that improved as Denpa Kyoushi went on. The opening and ending themes for the first half weren’t that memorable, but the themes for the second half better fit the vibe of the show, and were all around better. The voice acting also improved. It’s not that it was bad at first, but it was initially dragged down by Matsui Rena, who voiced Kagami’s sister. This was her first role, and she terrible at first, but she became more experienced over the course of the series, and was fine by the end.Characters - 5Denpa Kyoushi’s cast can be broken up into two sections: Kagami and everyone else. I honestly don’t know which is worse. In the beginning, Kagami seemed interesting despite his flaws, but as time went on, he began to fall apart. He’s unbelievably good at various skills for no particular reason, and often acts overly smug and obnoxious. But when he’s not donning his plot armor, he’s complaining about how he doesn’t want to do anything, and his rants about YD quickly grow tiresome. His personality is awful in just about every way, but at least he has one. On the other hand, the rest of the cast is completely lifeless. Each student only plays a major role in the episode where they’re introduced, so there’s really no time to have any sort of depth established. Then, once their moment in the spotlight is over, they’re either whisked off to the sidelines, or off the stage altogether. It’s true that most of them do stick around after their initial appearance, but usually they’ll be left with only a shred of their personality, and be used for plot convenience more than anything else. So, between a lead with a terrible personality and a supporting cast with no personality, characters were easily Denpa Kyoushi’s weakest area.Enjoyment - 5At first, the series really was fun to watch. Kagami’s solutions to problems were fairly creative, and there was still the possibility of an overarching plot. But as the series dragged on, it only got worse. There was no greater story to be found, and Kagami’s plans began to lose their appeal. They became less unique and more contrived, especially when gaming is involved. Honestly, the enjoyment value of this series would have been higher if the series were only 12 episodes, because the length of the show really killed it.Overall - 5In conclusion, I can’t recommend watching Denpa Kyoushi. If the concept interests you, you should instead watch Great Teacher Onizuka or Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai, which have similar premises but better execution. But if you absolutely insist on watching this, I’d say jump out at the halfway point. That’s essentially where the series peaks, and everything after that is really nothing new. issue that he finds amusing, then he decides to help them out.

You get to see your favorite characters animated and voiced right before your eyes, and even watch a couple of your favorite scenes, which is always a little treat for fans of the show.  However, there are times when you get those adaptions that you just...want to forget, permanently.Story: The story of Denpa Kyoushi follows the tale of a man named Kagami Junichiro.  As an otaku who is lazy as all hell, his policy in life is the concept of ""YD"" or ""Yearn to do"", where he only...does things that he really wants to do.  And since that isn\'t very often, he\'s pretty lazy in that regard.  Inversely, he\'s able to do quite a number of very promising things, like creating a theory for transporting objects instantaneously like Doreamon\'s pocket so long as he wants to do it.  So, after his sister bothers him to go to a job that she got for him, we begin his journey as the Otaku Teacher, Kagami Junichiro.Now, the story for this...mess is...well, nonexistent.  The story is basically comprised of helping one student after another.  it\'s an arcic setup with not much differing in between each other because the story goes with Kagami encountering a new ""trouble"" student, finds out what\'s wrong with them, then proceeds to teach them something/help them in order to resolve their issue.  They\'re happy, he\'s happy, he moves on.  And really, that\'s all there is to it.  The story doesn\'t vary in any way, and as a result, there really isn\'t much development for characters aside from the ""helped"" ones, and the development itself just seems too convenient for really anything.And since that\'s the story, there really isn\'t anything else to say.  The show follows this storyline throughout its whole run and there really isn\'t anything great about it.  It adds up to a very boring experience because that\'s the entire show.  There simply isn\'t any variation and there isn\'t as a result, much to say.  It\'s very bland, and it ends kind of meh...Overview:-  Bland story-  Extremely repetitive storyline-  Average endingCharacters: As for characters, Denpa Kyoushi has Junichiro, and the plot fodder.As for Junichiro, Junichiro is an otaku who yearns only to do what he wants.  After becoming a teacher by the volition of two different girls, Kagami becomes a teacher not out of his own free will and lazes around as he is still the same kind of person as he was.  Throughout the whole series, Kagami helps out the kids because he just simply wants to, and as a result, doesn\'t change all that much as a character.  His lack of character change hones him into this static role of helping various students and as such, especially with this arcic setup, we don\'t get to know much about him other than the fact that he is apparently really smart, but only when he wants to be.And then we have the other characters.  I group everyone else all in one category simply because there just isn\'t much to say about any of them.  Most of them are students that Kagami has helped and as such, are sort of a go to, pass along sort of deal, since every student Kagami helps either fades into the background as a side character, or just disappears entirely.  Because of this, you don\'t get very much development for any of them and they just become plot devices.Overview:+/-  Average protagonist  (he\'s intriguing, but really doesn\'t have anything much going for him)-  Little to no actual character development (Student development is really only there to continue the story)-  Every other character is a plot device rather than an actual characterArt: Now, the art.  Art...isn\'t really Denpa Kyoushi\'s thing.  In fact, it\'s so bad that I swear the budget for it was 5,000 yen at most.  With its very bland colors that are just sort of...colors, Denpa Kyoushi doesn\'t offer anything substantial to the art in the world of anime simply because it just looks terrible.  But that isn\'t the only issue.The main issue with Denpa Kyoushi is not just that the art itself is just bland, uninspirational, and generic at most, but it\'s inconsistent, horrendously inconsistent.  The characters never look the scene in one scene to another, where eyes can be shifted to different places, the face shape or hair can look different, and the noses, OH THE NOSES.  Half the time, the noses for the characters aren\'t even there, not even a little line to indicate that they even have one.  As a result, the characters resemble one of those happy faces children draw when they\'re little and it just looks horrid!Overview:-  Terrible...just terrible art-  Incredibly inconsistentSound: The soundtrack for Denpa Kyoushi is nothing to write home about.  They\'re generic tracks that are average at most.Personal Enjoyment: Well, Denpa Kyoushi was quite the disappointment.  Hearing about how the show itself didn\'t relate to the manga at all, I was having my doubts about its quality, like when I watched Isuca a while back.  Needless to say, this was not the best thing to come out of Summer 2015.Did I enjoy this show?Admittedly, I did.  For about the first few episodes or so.  But because it\'s so repetitive, I saw no reason in liking it, and as such, grew a growing hatred of it with each passing episode.What didn\'t I like about this show?It\'s bland.  Out of everything about this show, there just wasn\'t anything positive to say about it.  The show itself has a repetitive plotline that doesn\'t feel fun to watch.  And because it\'s the same godforsaken thing week after week with its ""kid of the week"" setup, there just isn\'t anything that\'s great about it due to its lack of variation.  Also, I found some of the things going on in the series to be quite cringeworthy.  (Like...family power rangers.  Why...)  And because this is the section where I can say something I don\'t like, I\'ll say it again.  They don\'t have noses half of the time.  There are many times in this show where they simply...just...don\'t...have...noses.  Or any indication of having one.  And it is very weird to see a person without a nose.Would I recommend this anime?I\'ll cut straight to the point.  No.  Don\'t hurt yourself in watching this poor adaptation of a rather popular manga.  If you do, you will regret the decision like I do.  This one belongs in the ""pretend it didn\'t happen"" section of anime. does things that he really wants to do.  And since that isn\'t very often, he\'s pretty lazy in that regard.

And it is very weird to see a person without a nose.Would I recommend this anime?I\'ll cut straight to the point.  No.  Don\'t hurt yourself in watching this poor adaptation of a rather popular manga.  If you do, you will regret the decision like I do.

What really got me hyped was when I heard Ono Daisuke voices Kagami and Asumi Kana voices Suzune in the promotion video because these two are my some of my favorite voice actors. Unfortunately these two didn't get cast for either of there roles and it was Kamiya Hiroshi and Matsui...Rena according to myanimelist who took Kagami and Suzune's role. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying kamiya's a bad actor what so ever, in fact I'm a fan of a lot of his roles such as Natsume from Natsume no Yujincho and Law from One Peace to name some. But personally I don't like Kamiya's take on Kagami, it could be that I'm partly biased because I wanted Ono Daisuke to voice Kagami but I just can't seem to like his voice for Kagami. I also didn't really like Matsui Rena's take on Suzune mainly cause I find  her voice is kinda well atrocious and doesn't suit Suzune at all. Now my thoughts on the story, I think the story has done fairly well by faithfully keeping close to how the story in the manga played out but they did take out some things which kinda made it loose its impact that it had in the manga. For instance -SPOILER IN THE MANGA- before Kagami was about to quit his first teaching job he was to be replaced by a teacher who graduated from Yale and was pretty much a jerk who believed that if you can't obey the rules you wont get anywhere in life, at the assembly the The teacher from Yale gave his speech about his belief to soon to be students but Kagami gives them his lecture about not being bound by rules and to carve out your own path which was by far my favorite moment in the manga. In the anime the Teacher from Yale wasn't there so for me it kinda lost it's impact. So my conclusion, for now the shows kinda okay and I''ll watch it till the end before I give my final decision but as of now this anime is one of my least favorite in all honesty but that could change so hope my rant didn't bore you and have and awesome day Rena according to myanimelist who took Kagami and Suzune's role. Now don't get me wrong I'm not saying kamiya's a bad actor what so ever, in fact I'm a fan of a lot of his roles such as Natsume from Natsume no Yujincho and Law from One Peace to name some.

YD is a disease that only let\'s him doing what he wants to do.Seems interesting? Well it was .. until I figure out that this show is another show like Assassination Classroom, a teacher that is solving the problems of his students.The plot doesn´t actually have anything developed so far, he is only there helping out teens but still is not that bad. The first few episodes and the last 4-5 episodes are being fun. I\'m actually attached to this anime and has become one of...my favourites of this season so far.But again, we are 11 eps in and we still have no plot line, no goal for our protagonist. He is there because he wants to ? Well yeah that\'s it. The entire plot so far is watching  him doing stuff that he wants to do. Not that interesting. Plus, the characters themselves and their background story are kinda over exaggerated. A girl fucked up her life only because she had a part time job in some maid café. I\'m like forced to believe that the characters are in a bad spot and need to be saved by Kagami.Art: 6/10. I hate it. The colorful looks awful. The animations as well are as cheap as possible. The background for the most part looks like a picture of a 5 years old kid who just got his markers and is now learning how to use them. It only doesn´t have a worst rate because the character design if at least good. Good looking characters, especially the girls. Each one has her own design and pallet so that they can be unique in the anime and that is really something important for me. Because not that rare I see characters that look like the same and the only way to distinguish them is by their voices.Sound: 7/10. The opening is fine so as the ending. The ost used are also fine. Everything looks fine. No complaints about it. It\'s just fine.Character: 8/10. Well, they are funny, likeable and very good looking. What do I mean? Well besides the nice design, they also have a nice personality that fits with both her design and her position in the anime. Each character ends up related with Kagami in some way which is nice to watch.They are really different from each other which is also really important because the anime doesn´t get repetitive. For instance let me use an example: Assassination Classroom. They do the exact same thing but, all the characters have the same problem which is : school problems.At least denpa kyoushi is more creative, even though some of the problems are quite hard to ""accept"".Enjoyment: The main purpose of the anime is comedy, and the comedy is not that great. I don´t like it. They don´t focus any other point. Don´t get me wrong, the anime is fun to watch but is not that good.Overall:Short pros and cons:Pros:- Funny to watch- Likeable characters- Nice designsCons:- Bad art overall- Sound not being great- Story with some flaws- Weak comedy overallso .. ?Give it a try.

Spoilers ahead!)I was an elementary school student when I met the coolest teacher I have ever known. His name was Mr. E (the resulting sound that makes in this context is perfect). He was always smiling, laughing and joking with his students. He made learning fun and had a charismatic way of dealing with both teachers and kids alike. As an adult, I rarely see him nowadays, but on the occasions that I do, I always make sure to strike up a conversation, letting him know how grateful I am for the positive atmosphere he always carried...with him. Mr. E., the modest man that he is, always downplays his role those many years ago.Denpa Kyoushi is an anime featuring a similarly universally liked teacher. But where Mr. E always deserves to be remembered, this anime should be placed in the trash where it deserves to belong.STORYDenpa Kyoushi does everything in its power to steer itself wrong. While the “otaku” motif persists throughout the season, the praise stops there, the anime constantly losing focus, shifting plot lines, and forgetting ideas, ultimately destroying any semblance of worth the show might have held.At its core, Denpa Kyoushi is an anime centered on a singular notion: “otaku”. Besides the title of the show being “Ultimate Otaku Teacher,” many of the events involve aspects from that type of lifestyle. More specifically, the anime uses these aspects to solve the various problems the narrative introduces. A character has difficulty making friends, so Junichiro has him play a video game to improve his soccer skills. Another character needs good grades in physics, so Junichiro makes a training game from scratch to help her practice. Yet another refuses to accept his true identity, so he has the rest of the class hang out with him in an MMORPG to improve his confidence. Lots of video games, but the show also uses television cartoons, manga, and maid cafes as other solutions to the difficulties at hand. Doing so demonstrated that, at the minimum, the anime understood that using one of its central motifs was not just mandatory but also vital.Vitals at this point fail, the remainder of Denpa Kyoushi an atrocious mess of miraculous proportions. The biggest flaw is the show’s inability to use previous events to drive the plot forward. When one arc concludes, the anime seemingly forgets about what happened. Characters make cameos without purpose, the outcomes have little impact, and all the while the show continues to inject more of both. For example, one plotline involves a teenage girl who does not want to be married off to a rival of her parent’s company. After Junichiro helps her out, though, she (and the guy) disappear for the last ten episodes or so, as if her predicament never happened or, worse, did not matter. Denpa Kyoushi does this constantly mostly because, again, the show never stops bringing in people that needed saving. The first half consists of roughly seven students and the second half consists of roughly the same number, each of who are different from one another. The result is the show jumping from student to student, no connection between the individual plotlines found.For each student, the narrative takes the same approach: articulate their plight, reveal the relevant bits of their past, and eventually get them to learn their lesson. This setup has a nice past, present, and future construction, but save for a couple of instances, the anime refuses to deviate from this formula, quickly devolving into a repetitive pattern. Their pasts are considerably important because they are what created their internal conflict – a mean video surfaced, a feeling of guilt, and so on. Despite the trauma the characters faced, the majority of the flashbacks are only briefly shown, glimpses rather than occurrences. In other words, their personal problems lack the emphasis required to make them worthy of investigation. Many of the backstories are also isolated, pertaining only to the character or characters investigated rather than having relevancy to the other students involved, perpetuating the disconnectedness the anime continually touts.The finale likewise does not escape from stupidity. The characters put themselves into their original holes precisely because they had no one else to turn to. So when Junichiro gives them total control, his decision counterintuitively goes against the anime’s own motif on seeking outside help. His final decision to essentially eliminate the need for teaching in favor of self-teaching also goes against its teacher motif; a gross mistake. The finale also makes it glaringly obvious how underused the characters were throughout the season: the show halfheartedly has about half of those that Junichiro helped (not everyone, just half) show up to cheer him on. They were not present when he needed them most – despite doing just that for them – so their presence at the end is more a slap to the face than it is a sincere goodbye.More issues exist besides the jarring plot, the misused flashbacks, and the horrid finale. One, the comedy. Junichiro’s younger sister berating him, him getting mad about people misunderstanding his interests, and the mistimed jokes make the show a slog to endure. Two, the romance. Many of the girls, upon having their problems corrected, fall for the teacher, but these feelings are never explored. In fact, the girls’ feelings either come out of nowhere or are brought up only to never be mentioned again – usually caused by the show refusing to either include the girl rarely (or never) afterwards.Even disregarding all of these problems, the worst part is that Denpa Kyoushi does not even try to be anything. There is no real overarching plot, no unified theme ties everything together (despite there being numerous motifs), and there is no purpose behind the various events that take place. The anime is a slow burn of nothingness that – rather appropriately – ultimately leads nowhere.ANIMATIONDenpa Kyoushi has some of the worst art and animation in the medium, the latter barely existing in the first place. Aptly speaking, the anime is ugly.When it comes to actual animation, the show is severely below average. This is not an understatement: still frames litter the show, usually just the characters mouths seeing any kind of movement. The anime reaches its lowest point animation-wise very early on, in episode six where the soccer match becomes what might as well have been a bunch of cardboard cutouts kicking a circle around. Another vivid example is in episode thirteen, Junichiro typing away on his keyboard, but not so much typing as he is flexing his fingers while sweeping his hands across the keys. In the general sense, Denpa Kyoushi barely moves its characters, even during action-heavy scenes. Eyes rarely blink, hair hardly ruffles, and clothes seldom contort, placing the show in a negative light of its own doing throughout the majority of the season.Art follows the actual animation’s footsteps (more specifically, the actual animation’s dragged path). Again, this is not an understatement: the show has problems at even the most basic of levels. Lines are jagged, civilians amorphous blobs rather than humans. Colors are overly vibrant, blinding the audience rather than inviting them to watch. Backgrounds are bland, environments drawn from memory rather than living places. All of this speaks nothing of Denpa Kyoushi’s lack of shadowing, subpar camera direction, and unsettling CG work. The show is an eyesore, a nonstop travesty that bruises the brain.Equally awful are the character designs which are, mildly put, disgusting. Each person seems as if they forgot to use conditioner when taking a shower, their wiry and wonky hair nauseating the audience. Once again, everyone has an overt brightness to their design. Not that light strikes them in a godlike manner, but instead the colors that make up their clothes and hair is unnecessarily saturated. Many of the characters also have abnormally large foreheads. The ones that do not are usually the ones that wear their wiry, unconditioned hair down to cover their defect. Looking in-depth at their actual construction, Junichiro’s lab coat and glasses paint him as both a smart guy and a teacher, his red hair matching his random yet wholehearted passion. Nanami’s spiky hair and slanting eyes turn him into the rough dude he tends to be. Sachiko’s long blonde hair and more formal attire makes her more mature than the rest of the characters despite her small stature. This same inspection can be applied to the entire cast, but given their inherent unsavoriness, doing so too many times would adversely affect one’s health.CHARACTERSRealistically, the cast of Denpa Kyoushi is large, with well over twenty people taking the limelight over the course of the season. Comparatively speaking, the characters are the best feature of the anime, though that is not saying a whole lot.Early on the anime seems, at the minimum, poised to have an adequate cast. Minako is the first character developed. Her past life as a street kid affected her transition into a “normal” teenage life, her old friends bullying her in her current lifestyle. As was mentioned previously, this is how the anime approaches every character: some flaw in the character’s past is revealed, said flaw’s effects on this character’s present are showcased, and, upon Junichiro helping out the student, their future is saved. Minako is the same, the anime focusing on this singular form of development for each of its characters. Kiriko, Nanami, Shachiko, Kanan, and Koutarou as well follow this same path. The growth is repetitive and nothing major, but the anime at least has complete stories for each of its characters.Besides Koutarou, one of the major problems with this setup is how little actual time is spent on the characters. The size of the cast forces the people involved to have regularly one or two episodes maximum for expounding on their individual tales. Combined with the aforementioned, constant ditching of its characters following their arcs, the characters ultimately feel unfulfilling. Koutarou is exempt from this issue since the anime, rather surprisingly, takes its time describing his situation and his overall journey. His hobby – dressing up as a girl despite being a boy – caused a lot of hate to funnel his way. Therefore, he secluded himself, away from people to continue his desires while avoiding any further ridicule. The only place he found that fully accepted him was an online video game, his character’s looks reflecting his own style. When Junichiro learns of Koutarou’s self-seclusion and personal struggles with identity, he forces the boy to confront his past aggressors. In the end, Koutarou comes to accept himself – girl and all – providing the audience with the message that one should never be afraid to be who they really are. Koutarou is the best character of the anime and, while he, too, hardly has a presence following his own arc, saves the cast from being fully badly written.Giving credit once more, Denpa Kyoushi does switch up its approach when the second half rolls around. The show decides to tackle couplings: a rich girl and an arrogant guy, twin sisters, and Junichiro himself with an ignorant child. The anime still leans on its initial direction at times – a ghost girl wanting to draw and a little kid understanding that some mistakes need to be corrected with one’s own power. However this new, dual-aiding becomes the norm. As expected, this makes the characters even more unfulfilling, since the time spent on the new set of people is divided in two. Many of these plotlines are lacking thematic strength as well – the talks about arrogance and amusement are barely explored (relative to the first half’s themes). Only the twins’ arc, focusing on “one’s place” and familial bonds through their mirroring careers, their sisterly status, and their affinity for a cartoon based on family, has any merit. Plus, similar to Koutarou’s arc, the anime takes a bit more time than usual to craft the events and its characters in the twins’ arc, giving the second half a much needed boost.Mentioned in passing was that Junichiro himself has an arc of his own, where the anime attempts to make Junichiro the one in need of saving. Technically he shares the arc with another character, but the purpose of the final few episodes is to have the star undergo development of his own. Junichiro’s whole idea centers on his signature attitude: what he “yearns to do” more than anything. Ironically, the time he spent saving the various kids leads him into thinking that his teacher job is not what he really wants to do. Already this spells doom for the anime; spending nearly the entirety of the season on his helping exploits only to turn around and say that what he was doing was wrong (for him) all along is nothing short of nonsensical. Still, he believes this, deciding to work on one of his previous theories: the “Anywhere Door”.Once again, though, a problem arises. Notably is the door itself. Passing references to the door are made in the beginning and in the middle, but not until the end does the door have any sort of significance. Meaning the anime using the door as a way to expound on Junichiro has very little foundation to work with. Furthermore, the anime tries to use the “Anywhere Door” as a symbol for Junichiro’s own passion. The final few events has the anime showing that since he does not want to make the door, one can conclude that Junichiro has already found what he wants to do. The conclusion? That he wants to help out the kids by letting them help themselves. That is to say, he returns to what he had been doing for the whole series, making his detour a faux attempt at developing his character. In short, Junichiro’s arc has no execution whatsoever which, given the rest of the anime, is an appropriate way to finish the season.SOUNDThe first opening theme is a huge mess, the pounding beat and the constantly changing vocalists grating on the ears. The middle of the piece changes into one that is floatier in nature, which has no place within the mood of the anime. When the singers work together, the track has a bit more harmony, but that only happens sparingly in the second half of the piece. The piece ends in an abrupt manner, though, killing any sort of praising it might have earned. The second OP is somewhat stronger, the lyrical composition easier to listen to than the first OP. The tone of the piece, however, is still very much a “single” sound, the instruments and beat blending together to make a piece that is more noise than a coherent song. This time the track ends in an appropriate manner (lots of “la”), so comparatively much is gained between the first and second OP.The first ending theme is a childish song. The cheery tune, the vocalists, and the instruments are all designed to make the piece kiddy in design, fitting the childish vibe of the actual anime. The track is catchy, meaning there is some merit to its effectiveness. Regardless, the piece is neither grand in scope nor grandeur in sound, making it a tough sell to listen to outside of the show itself. As for the second ED, it follows the footsteps of the second OP, mashing together a repetitive beat with a set of instruments that makes the song hard to listen to for any length of time. The “hey, hey, hey” and the stuttering lyrics try to soften the blows that the piece assails the listener with, but similar to the first OP, the track ends pretty abruptly, once again ruining any sort of traction it made have garnered.Perhaps obviously at this point, the remainder of the soundtrack is filled with pieces that have next to no worth. Tense piano tracks, slice-of-life violin tracks, and poignant flute-filled ones. A distinct, western-cowboy track exists for those buddy-buddy moments as does a resounding, triumphant tune when Junichiro succeeds. Collectively, the OST offers very little of value even if the pieces themselves fit their respective occasions, reducing the overall execution of the anime that much more.And just for good (bad) measure, the voice acting in the anime is below average. Hiroshi Kamiya provides a competent performance, his geeky voice a decent fit for the adult, male teacher. Suzuko Mimori provides an average performance as well, her mature voice fitting the character’s position but not necessarily the character’s person. However and sadly, Rena Matsui, in her first role ever in the medium, gives one of the worst performances in recent years. Her emotions, way of speaking, and inflections simply do not work, making each of her appearances on-screen a battle to sit through. Unfortunately her performance brings the whole VA package down a few notches.ENJOYMENTThis anime at least did something that no other anime I have seen has been able to do before: be beyond lame. Junichiro’s signature catch-phrase, “Time to start the lecture,” followed by him snapping his fingers, has got to be one of the lamest actions I have seen in anime. Lame to the point that I was actually mocking him, saying his line in a stupid voice and performing the same gesture. And since he did this constantly, I for a time became the “YD” dude. I could never take him seriously which, by extension, made it difficult for me to take the anime seriously.“YD” is another part of Junichiro’s personality that was lame. Listening to the beginning, with the “yukata de date” and the “yakiniku daisuki”, followed by mentions of his “yearn to do” lifestyle, irked me nonstop. This guy, if he wanted, could: cure cancer, solve world hunger, invent never-before-seen technology, eliminate economic disasters, and ensure global peace if he wanted to. But simply because he did not feel like it, all of humanity must suffer. Is it fair to expect this of him? Should someone with the capabilities to positively affect life never use said capabilities? This brings up questions of free will and personal choice, but I think asking to correct one of these prevalent problems when it is so easy for him is not too much of a request.Did I have fun watching this one? I am not sure, to be honest. Part of the reason I got into this one to begin with was because of the “romance” tag it touted. Having gone through the whole season, said “romance” was a sham. As was stated, the comedy is horribly executed, so laughs were a rarity. Outside of a small reaction to the ghost girl’s story, none of the drama instilled an emotional response from my soul. Junichiro got on my nerves like none other, but many of the other characters were no different. Sachiko’s “blood boiling” line was not funny, Nanami’s personality was too abrasive, and Tim was such an unneeded character.I think the only aspect of the anime I could truthfully say I liked were the nicknames – “Options,” “Cyborg,” “Potato”, and so on. They were clever given each character’s context, but they also symbolized the close relationship Junichiro had established with the people around him. Still, nicknames alone cannot save an entire, two-cour show.As a last remark, I have a theory why this anime was unbelievably awful in nearly everything it did. Despite the show having subpar voice acting, some of the most popular and recognizable voice actors and actresses were enlisted. Huge names such as Hiroshi Kamiya, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Kana Hanazawa, Risa Taneda, and a few others. The last three are significant since they are barely present. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka has such an infinitesimally small role compared to everyone else in the cast that it almost makes no logical sense why the show decided to invite him in the first place. Thus, the conspiracy is born: the anime spent so much time and resources on hiring A-List voice actors and actresses that there was no money left to spend on directing, animating, and producing. The diverting of resources to these bigger talents also lends credit as to why Rena Matsui was given the main role as the sister; the anime did not have the money left to acquire a bigwig, thus they gave a main lead to a complete newcomer. Is my theory true? I like to think it is. Otherwise there is nothing to justify the abysmal turn this show took from the very beginning.Denpa Kyoushi is impossibly atrocious. The story is ridiculous, the art is vomit-inducing, the characters are annoying, the sound is ear-bleeding, and the enjoyment is nonexistent. Suffice it to say that it is not a mystery why this anime deserves no better place than the dumpster.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, the narrative is a complete mess due to forgetting characters, a repetitive setup, a contradictory finale, misplaced comedy, and a lack of overall purposeAnimation: Terrible, ugly art, actual animation, and character designs throughout the entire experienceCharacters: Bad, besides Koutarou and the twins’ arc, the whole cast, including Junichiro, are severely missing exploration and executionSound: Terrible, bad first OP, bad second OP, fine first ED, bad second ED, bad OST, below average VA workEnjoyment: Terrible, silly yet meaningful nicknames cannot save an entire anime, let alone this oneFinal Score: 1/10 with him.

The result is the show jumping from student to student, no connection between the individual plotlines found.For each student, the narrative takes the same approach: articulate their plight, reveal the relevant bits of their past, and eventually get them to learn their lesson. This setup has a nice past, present, and future construction, but save for a couple of instances, the anime refuses to deviate from this formula, quickly devolving into a repetitive pattern. Their pasts are considerably important because they are what created their internal conflict – a mean video surfaced, a feeling of guilt, and so on. Despite the trauma the characters faced, the majority of the flashbacks are only briefly shown, glimpses rather than occurrences. In other words, their personal problems lack the emphasis required to make them worthy of investigation. Many of the backstories are also isolated, pertaining only to the character or characters investigated rather than having relevancy to the other students involved, perpetuating the disconnectedness the anime continually touts.The finale likewise does not escape from stupidity. The characters put themselves into their original holes precisely because they had no one else to turn to. So when Junichiro gives them total control, his decision counterintuitively goes against the anime’s own motif on seeking outside help. His final decision to essentially eliminate the need for teaching in favor of self-teaching also goes against its teacher motif; a gross mistake. The finale also makes it glaringly obvious how underused the characters were throughout the season: the show halfheartedly has about half of those that Junichiro helped (not everyone, just half) show up to cheer him on. They were not present when he needed them most – despite doing just that for them – so their presence at the end is more a slap to the face than it is a sincere goodbye.More issues exist besides the jarring plot, the misused flashbacks, and the horrid finale. One, the comedy. Junichiro’s younger sister berating him, him getting mad about people misunderstanding his interests, and the mistimed jokes make the show a slog to endure. Two, the romance. Many of the girls, upon having their problems corrected, fall for the teacher, but these feelings are never explored. In fact, the girls’ feelings either come out of nowhere or are brought up only to never be mentioned again – usually caused by the show refusing to either include the girl rarely (or never) afterwards.Even disregarding all of these problems, the worst part is that Denpa Kyoushi does not even try to be anything. There is no real overarching plot, no unified theme ties everything together (despite there being numerous motifs), and there is no purpose behind the various events that take place. The anime is a slow burn of nothingness that – rather appropriately – ultimately leads nowhere.ANIMATIONDenpa Kyoushi has some of the worst art and animation in the medium, the latter barely existing in the first place. Aptly speaking, the anime is ugly.When it comes to actual animation, the show is severely below average. This is not an understatement: still frames litter the show, usually just the characters mouths seeing any kind of movement. The anime reaches its lowest point animation-wise very early on, in episode six where the soccer match becomes what might as well have been a bunch of cardboard cutouts kicking a circle around. Another vivid example is in episode thirteen, Junichiro typing away on his keyboard, but not so much typing as he is flexing his fingers while sweeping his hands across the keys. In the general sense, Denpa Kyoushi barely moves its characters, even during action-heavy scenes. Eyes rarely blink, hair hardly ruffles, and clothes seldom contort, placing the show in a negative light of its own doing throughout the majority of the season.Art follows the actual animation’s footsteps (more specifically, the actual animation’s dragged path). Again, this is not an understatement: the show has problems at even the most basic of levels. Lines are jagged, civilians amorphous blobs rather than humans. Colors are overly vibrant, blinding the audience rather than inviting them to watch. Backgrounds are bland, environments drawn from memory rather than living places. All of this speaks nothing of Denpa Kyoushi’s lack of shadowing, subpar camera direction, and unsettling CG work. The show is an eyesore, a nonstop travesty that bruises the brain.Equally awful are the character designs which are, mildly put, disgusting. Each person seems as if they forgot to use conditioner when taking a shower, their wiry and wonky hair nauseating the audience. Once again, everyone has an overt brightness to their design. Not that light strikes them in a godlike manner, but instead the colors that make up their clothes and hair is unnecessarily saturated. Many of the characters also have abnormally large foreheads. The ones that do not are usually the ones that wear their wiry, unconditioned hair down to cover their defect. Looking in-depth at their actual construction, Junichiro’s lab coat and glasses paint him as both a smart guy and a teacher, his red hair matching his random yet wholehearted passion. Nanami’s spiky hair and slanting eyes turn him into the rough dude he tends to be. Sachiko’s long blonde hair and more formal attire makes her more mature than the rest of the characters despite her small stature. This same inspection can be applied to the entire cast, but given their inherent unsavoriness, doing so too many times would adversely affect one’s health.CHARACTERSRealistically, the cast of Denpa Kyoushi is large, with well over twenty people taking the limelight over the course of the season. Comparatively speaking, the characters are the best feature of the anime, though that is not saying a whole lot.Early on the anime seems, at the minimum, poised to have an adequate cast. Minako is the first character developed. Her past life as a street kid affected her transition into a “normal” teenage life, her old friends bullying her in her current lifestyle. As was mentioned previously, this is how the anime approaches every character: some flaw in the character’s past is revealed, said flaw’s effects on this character’s present are showcased, and, upon Junichiro helping out the student, their future is saved. Minako is the same, the anime focusing on this singular form of development for each of its characters. Kiriko, Nanami, Shachiko, Kanan, and Koutarou as well follow this same path. The growth is repetitive and nothing major, but the anime at least has complete stories for each of its characters.Besides Koutarou, one of the major problems with this setup is how little actual time is spent on the characters. The size of the cast forces the people involved to have regularly one or two episodes maximum for expounding on their individual tales. Combined with the aforementioned, constant ditching of its characters following their arcs, the characters ultimately feel unfulfilling. Koutarou is exempt from this issue since the anime, rather surprisingly, takes its time describing his situation and his overall journey. His hobby – dressing up as a girl despite being a boy – caused a lot of hate to funnel his way. Therefore, he secluded himself, away from people to continue his desires while avoiding any further ridicule. The only place he found that fully accepted him was an online video game, his character’s looks reflecting his own style. When Junichiro learns of Koutarou’s self-seclusion and personal struggles with identity, he forces the boy to confront his past aggressors. In the end, Koutarou comes to accept himself – girl and all – providing the audience with the message that one should never be afraid to be who they really are. Koutarou is the best character of the anime and, while he, too, hardly has a presence following his own arc, saves the cast from being fully badly written.Giving credit once more, Denpa Kyoushi does switch up its approach when the second half rolls around. The show decides to tackle couplings: a rich girl and an arrogant guy, twin sisters, and Junichiro himself with an ignorant child. The anime still leans on its initial direction at times – a ghost girl wanting to draw and a little kid understanding that some mistakes need to be corrected with one’s own power. However this new, dual-aiding becomes the norm. As expected, this makes the characters even more unfulfilling, since the time spent on the new set of people is divided in two. Many of these plotlines are lacking thematic strength as well – the talks about arrogance and amusement are barely explored (relative to the first half’s themes). Only the twins’ arc, focusing on “one’s place” and familial bonds through their mirroring careers, their sisterly status, and their affinity for a cartoon based on family, has any merit. Plus, similar to Koutarou’s arc, the anime takes a bit more time than usual to craft the events and its characters in the twins’ arc, giving the second half a much needed boost.Mentioned in passing was that Junichiro himself has an arc of his own, where the anime attempts to make Junichiro the one in need of saving. Technically he shares the arc with another character, but the purpose of the final few episodes is to have the star undergo development of his own. Junichiro’s whole idea centers on his signature attitude: what he “yearns to do” more than anything. Ironically, the time he spent saving the various kids leads him into thinking that his teacher job is not what he really wants to do. Already this spells doom for the anime; spending nearly the entirety of the season on his helping exploits only to turn around and say that what he was doing was wrong (for him) all along is nothing short of nonsensical. Still, he believes this, deciding to work on one of his previous theories: the “Anywhere Door”.Once again, though, a problem arises. Notably is the door itself. Passing references to the door are made in the beginning and in the middle, but not until the end does the door have any sort of significance. Meaning the anime using the door as a way to expound on Junichiro has very little foundation to work with. Furthermore, the anime tries to use the “Anywhere Door” as a symbol for Junichiro’s own passion. The final few events has the anime showing that since he does not want to make the door, one can conclude that Junichiro has already found what he wants to do. The conclusion? That he wants to help out the kids by letting them help themselves. That is to say, he returns to what he had been doing for the whole series, making his detour a faux attempt at developing his character. In short, Junichiro’s arc has no execution whatsoever which, given the rest of the anime, is an appropriate way to finish the season.SOUNDThe first opening theme is a huge mess, the pounding beat and the constantly changing vocalists grating on the ears. The middle of the piece changes into one that is floatier in nature, which has no place within the mood of the anime. When the singers work together, the track has a bit more harmony, but that only happens sparingly in the second half of the piece. The piece ends in an abrupt manner, though, killing any sort of praising it might have earned. The second OP is somewhat stronger, the lyrical composition easier to listen to than the first OP. The tone of the piece, however, is still very much a “single” sound, the instruments and beat blending together to make a piece that is more noise than a coherent song. This time the track ends in an appropriate manner (lots of “la”), so comparatively much is gained between the first and second OP.The first ending theme is a childish song. The cheery tune, the vocalists, and the instruments are all designed to make the piece kiddy in design, fitting the childish vibe of the actual anime. The track is catchy, meaning there is some merit to its effectiveness. Regardless, the piece is neither grand in scope nor grandeur in sound, making it a tough sell to listen to outside of the show itself. As for the second ED, it follows the footsteps of the second OP, mashing together a repetitive beat with a set of instruments that makes the song hard to listen to for any length of time. The “hey, hey, hey” and the stuttering lyrics try to soften the blows that the piece assails the listener with, but similar to the first OP, the track ends pretty abruptly, once again ruining any sort of traction it made have garnered.Perhaps obviously at this point, the remainder of the soundtrack is filled with pieces that have next to no worth. Tense piano tracks, slice-of-life violin tracks, and poignant flute-filled ones. A distinct, western-cowboy track exists for those buddy-buddy moments as does a resounding, triumphant tune when Junichiro succeeds. Collectively, the OST offers very little of value even if the pieces themselves fit their respective occasions, reducing the overall execution of the anime that much more.And just for good (bad) measure, the voice acting in the anime is below average. Hiroshi Kamiya provides a competent performance, his geeky voice a decent fit for the adult, male teacher. Suzuko Mimori provides an average performance as well, her mature voice fitting the character’s position but not necessarily the character’s person. However and sadly, Rena Matsui, in her first role ever in the medium, gives one of the worst performances in recent years. Her emotions, way of speaking, and inflections simply do not work, making each of her appearances on-screen a battle to sit through. Unfortunately her performance brings the whole VA package down a few notches.ENJOYMENTThis anime at least did something that no other anime I have seen has been able to do before: be beyond lame. Junichiro’s signature catch-phrase, “Time to start the lecture,” followed by him snapping his fingers, has got to be one of the lamest actions I have seen in anime. Lame to the point that I was actually mocking him, saying his line in a stupid voice and performing the same gesture. And since he did this constantly, I for a time became the “YD” dude. I could never take him seriously which, by extension, made it difficult for me to take the anime seriously.“YD” is another part of Junichiro’s personality that was lame. Listening to the beginning, with the “yukata de date” and the “yakiniku daisuki”, followed by mentions of his “yearn to do” lifestyle, irked me nonstop. This guy, if he wanted, could: cure cancer, solve world hunger, invent never-before-seen technology, eliminate economic disasters, and ensure global peace if he wanted to. But simply because he did not feel like it, all of humanity must suffer. Is it fair to expect this of him? Should someone with the capabilities to positively affect life never use said capabilities? This brings up questions of free will and personal choice, but I think asking to correct one of these prevalent problems when it is so easy for him is not too much of a request.Did I have fun watching this one? I am not sure, to be honest. Part of the reason I got into this one to begin with was because of the “romance” tag it touted. Having gone through the whole season, said “romance” was a sham. As was stated, the comedy is horribly executed, so laughs were a rarity. Outside of a small reaction to the ghost girl’s story, none of the drama instilled an emotional response from my soul. Junichiro got on my nerves like none other, but many of the other characters were no different. Sachiko’s “blood boiling” line was not funny, Nanami’s personality was too abrasive, and Tim was such an unneeded character.I think the only aspect of the anime I could truthfully say I liked were the nicknames – “Options,” “Cyborg,” “Potato”, and so on. They were clever given each character’s context, but they also symbolized the close relationship Junichiro had established with the people around him. Still, nicknames alone cannot save an entire, two-cour show.As a last remark, I have a theory why this anime was unbelievably awful in nearly everything it did. Despite the show having subpar voice acting, some of the most popular and recognizable voice actors and actresses were enlisted. Huge names such as Hiroshi Kamiya, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Kana Hanazawa, Risa Taneda, and a few others. The last three are significant since they are barely present. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka has such an infinitesimally small role compared to everyone else in the cast that it almost makes no logical sense why the show decided to invite him in the first place. Thus, the conspiracy is born: the anime spent so much time and resources on hiring A-List voice actors and actresses that there was no money left to spend on directing, animating, and producing. The diverting of resources to these bigger talents also lends credit as to why Rena Matsui was given the main role as the sister; the anime did not have the money left to acquire a bigwig, thus they gave a main lead to a complete newcomer. Is my theory true? I like to think it is. Otherwise there is nothing to justify the abysmal turn this show took from the very beginning.Denpa Kyoushi is impossibly atrocious. The story is ridiculous, the art is vomit-inducing, the characters are annoying, the sound is ear-bleeding, and the enjoyment is nonexistent. Suffice it to say that it is not a mystery why this anime deserves no better place than the dumpster.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, the narrative is a complete mess due to forgetting characters, a repetitive setup, a contradictory finale, misplaced comedy, and a lack of overall purposeAnimation: Terrible, ugly art, actual animation, and character designs throughout the entire experienceCharacters: Bad, besides Koutarou and the twins’ arc, the whole cast, including Junichiro, are severely missing exploration and executionSound: Terrible, bad first OP, bad second OP, fine first ED, bad second ED, bad OST, below average VA workEnjoyment: Terrible, silly yet meaningful nicknames cannot save an entire anime, let alone this oneFinal Score: 1/10', 'I find this anime very enjoyable. While the artwork is nothing spectacular, it doesn\'t detract from it in any way. The story is likewise fairly cookie-cutter problem-student of the week. But it\'s fairly original. It\'s not a harem, moe or action anime. And it certainly has plenty of charm. Where it really shines is the characters. This show has a cast of very unique characters that don\'t really fit any archetypes. There aren\'t any dere\'s as far as I can tell. The protagonist, while certainly unique, can be a bit annoying with his precocious ""YD"" crap. Seriously, it just makes him seem whiny and immature....Overall, this is a very enjoyable light-hearted show, and I\'d recommend it to anyone looking for a fun watch.

And not to mention he has no interest in physics or computer cause he is 'YD' meaning yearning to do whatever he wants. Give me a break. Never judge an anime character about how he crossed over so many brands and this ain't even wuxia novel.

The characters were all with unique trait but with shallow story. Unlike GTO characters, they are easily convinced to join the happy go lucky team. Not the mc but more like the anime team is YD, doing whatever they want and failed miserably.

Out of the characters featured on the show my favorite one has to be Minako who is played by one of my favorite seiyuu's  Sora Amamiya and Koyomi Hiiragi who is played by the talented seiyuu Suzoko Mimori whose character i found to pretty amusing.Additionally the character of Suzune who is played by the well known idol Rena Matsui really surprised me as Rena is not really a professionally trained seiyuu but never less gave a amazing performance.In conclusion i really enjoyed the Ultimate Otaku teacher and i felt that it was relatively faithful to its source material. Kagami is such an interesting character and some of the methods that he uses to solve the problems that his students are having are truly unique and can only be thought off by him. An example will be using a live performance to stop a student from being expelled by making her too popular.Overall a great anime that was equal bits amusing and funny that was paired with an excellent story that had a great cast of characters and a ensemble cast of seiyuu's. a existing source material to be successful it must in addition to being faithful to the story also be faithful to its art and character designs.

The story follows Junichiro Kagami, a genius scientist who becomes a teacher at a high school and helps his students with their various problems using his scientific knowledge.The main character, Kagami, is a bit of an eccentric and can come off as a bit obnoxious at times, but he does have his moments of charm. His interactions with his students are entertaining, and he manages to teach them valuable life lessons along the way.As for the music, it's nothing to write home...about, but it does the job of setting the tone for the show. I can't say I found myself humming any of the tunes afterwards, though.Overall, I did enjoy watching Denpa Kyoushi, but it's not without its flaws. The pacing can be a bit slow at times, and some of the character arcs felt a bit rushed. However, if you're looking for a lighthearted anime with some science thrown in, then this one might be worth checking out. It's not the best anime out there, but it's certainly not the worst either. So, I guess I would recommend it... if you have some spare time and nothing better to watch.--------------------------------------Baiklah, jika saya harus memberikan ulasan tentang Denpa Kyoushi, saya akan mengatakan bahwa itu tidak terlalu buruk. Ceritanya mengikuti Junichiro Kagami, seorang ilmuwan jenius yang menjadi guru di sebuah sekolah menengah dan membantu siswanya dengan berbagai masalah menggunakan pengetahuan ilmiahnya.Karakter utama, Kagami, agak eksentrik dan terkadang bisa terlihat agak menyebalkan, tetapi dia memiliki momen-momen daya tariknya sendiri. Interaksinya dengan siswanya menghibur, dan dia berhasil mengajarkan kepada mereka pelajaran hidup yang berharga.Sementara untuk musiknya, itu tidak terlalu spesial, tetapi cukup untuk menetapkan nada untuk acara tersebut. Namun, saya tidak bisa mengatakan bahwa saya menemukan diri saya menyanyikan nada-nada itu setelahnya.Secara keseluruhan, saya menikmati menonton Denpa Kyoushi, tetapi tidak tanpa kekurangannya. Tempo ceritanya terkadang bisa lambat, dan beberapa pengembangan karakter terasa terburu-buru. Namun, jika Anda mencari anime yang ringan dengan sedikit ilmu pengetahuan, maka ini mungkin layak untuk dilihat. Ini bukan anime terbaik di luar sana, tetapi juga bukan yang terburuk.

Enjoying first and second episode, but in the third episode I didn't really know, why I have the imoutou of protagonist. And after looking for 5 episodes, I dropped it.I hyped because the theme is 'otaku's genius' and saw first episode was epic. But next story just so bland. I don't know because it's seiyuu, since I know that Rena Matsui was graduated member of idol, or just me because my preference.I hope in the next work, they can upgrade...it well. it well."", 'The Elder Teacher\'s Uncategorized ...Denpa Kyoushi has a somewhat unique plot, tells of an otaku named Kagami Junichiro, in fact a concept like this has often been used by predecessors although the premises are discussed differently, such as: Oreki Houtarou; Sora-Shiro; Light Yagami. The differences that underline Kagami Junichiro with other perfectionist characters are professions, comedy nuances, and flexibility. Kagami Junichiro works as an otaku physics teacher, why is my physics teacher otaku? Because formally he is a physics teacher, but almost all the scenes show the fact that everything he taught is always related to manga, games, anime, etc., sounds unreasonable, but quite imaginative...is not it? If we know \'Ansatsu Kyoushitsu\' of course things like that is not something foreign.In addition, the applied teaching methods are not nailed to the education system in general. Here Kagami Junichiro takes a personal approach to his students, there are advantages in this method, including: As a moment to introduce new characters; The audience more easily understands the character of each character; Each character has a different character, the problem is also different, so the solution is also different. Excessive number of characters should be avoided, often the role of some characters to have no effect on the story. But on the other hand, the diverse character behavior makes it easy for the author to create a new path in anticipation of audience boredom. The number of characters can help or hinder the development of the story, depending on the flow of the story. For psychology stories, increasing the number of characters is clearly not effective and not a wise choice. Conversely, for a comedic story adding character means adding new assets, the freedom to create humor will be more open.Denpa Kyoushi does not present a frontal comedy, the comedy offered is gently sweeping away. That is, the audience will feel ""oh it\'s funny"" when it\'s drifting in the story. The strange actions shown by Kagami Junichiro are really beyond our thinking, ""Ah ... I can not believe it"" so that the smiles themselves are natural. The mainstream perfectionist (genius) character is identical to the ideal; Craving; perfect. Usually this type of character that attracted many audiences, but the design of such a character just makes the character seem stiff. Unlike the protagonist of Denpa Kyoushi, though genius but the presentation is so flexible and not monotonous. is not it?

I didn\'t much like this anime, hopefully i can touch on some points to tell you why without giving away spoilers.Story 5Denpa Kyoushi doesn\'t have much in the way of story. The overall story is about a young man who has a condition called ""YD"", which only allows him to do what he yearns to do. We follow this man as he journeys to find what he actually yearns to do.The rest of the story is split into mini stories. These mini...stories revolve around people that the main character meets and decides to help in some way. This wasn\'t a terrible idea. Other anime have done this in the past but I felt like this had an interesting twist. Each person generally had a problem which was detrimental to their living condition. For example; a heartless bully, a cross dresser, a delinquent student, etc.. You follow these unusual characters for an episode or up to three episodes to finally get to the point where they have learned a valuable lesson and are grateful to the main character.That\'s the entire story. Unfortunately this didn\'t interest me enough. The mini stories were hit and miss, and you know how ever situation is going to end. Those are two big reasons that this anime scored so low IMO. GTO is a popular anime that gets referenced to this show a lot. GTO was interesting, the teacher did things in a different manner and had an outlandish personality for being a teacher which made that show interesting and fun. Denpa Kyoushi had an interesting main character who didn\'t fit into the typical mold, but it wasn\'t up to the same standards. Some of the mini stories felt rushed and other times some of the stories were well paced and done well, but each ultimately ended with satisfaction and that just gets boring time after time of seeing that happen.Art & Sound 7The art was well done. I was able to spot some reused still frames, but that\'s nothing to complain about. There were times where I wondered at some of the aesthetic choices , like masks with skin tone making it hard to tell who is speaking, and the whole twin mini story later in the show. Other than that the art was done well. The music didn\'t catch me either way good or bad. The resolution song was kinda annoying by the end of the show. The voice actor for the main characters sister too also had me wondering. She doesn\'t sound bad, but seemed like an odd choice.Characters 6The characters are what will make or break this show for many people. The cast is quite large because of the helping people solve their problems angle they took. I rated this section low again because I didn\'t think the characters presented much enjoyment to me.Lets talk about the main character. First and foremost the main character is insanely strong. Not strong as in Kirito or Tatsuya way, but strong in the nerdy character who can do anything with technology and his mind. You will see several times in the anime where the main character cant do many physical thing but can always pull through with some miraculous nerd level skills. I keep saying ""nerd"" because he is an otaku. He uses that power several times, like updating his blog to get people to follow a car, or to miraculously escape capture in Akihabara. The YD conundrum caused me to dislike him more than I liked him. He always got serious for odd reasons, and when he got serious he stopped feeling like a real character. His ability to solve problems and to come up with solutions was always strong and to me felt really un balanced, leaving him to be a mere tool to push along the story. The initial things that made him relate able like the blog obsession, or love of anime or games was thrown out the window and he just became someone with insane skills.As for the side characters/Students, they were hit and miss for me. You had many interesting issues crop up but sometimes the problems seemed silly, or unrealistic. Each character has their own nickname given by the main character which will help you remember their names. There are too many here to go into full detail and to do so will be to give spoilers.Since that is the case I will close of characters section by saying that this score represent my personal taste. The characters were not enjoyable too me and the way that writer served them up like baseballs to be hit out of the park left them with little to no presence or purpose. This however is the main selling point of the show so you may disagree.Enjoyment 6Overall I am happy that I watched this anime. I dont have much good things to say about it, however it is one of the few anime in this genre that I have completed. GTO was super long and I couldn\'t get passed the first 10 episodes. This was a good medium sized anime that I could force myself to watch(which unfortunately I did need to force myself). The characters were semi enjoyable from time to time. I laughed at certain parts and became curious about certain issues that arose. However for those of you looking for romance, there is none. Not sure why there is a romance tag. There are a couple hints that romance could be had, but nothing ever happens. The whole ""YD"" and ""Amusing"" premise that they kept shoving down my throat was less than interesting to me as well and often found myself being assaulted by my own boredom. In a show like this i feel like they would have done better by highlighting the characters strengths in more detail. It just felt shallow and not well thought out.TLDR:  If you have time to kill and want to watch kids with odd personalities try to make it in society then give Denpa Kyoushi a shot.

Thanks for reading, have a good day.', ""tl;dr: An anime about a strange teacher helping his students that has some good concepts but is really rough in pretty much every aspect.This is the story of a very irregular teacher managing to be very competent at helping his students grow and make their way past various problems that they're having. It's very similar to GTO, the main difference being that instead of being a delinquent the teacher is an otaku. I like this premise quite a bit as this results in a teacher using brains over brawn in dealing with problems, and I did like the character of\xa0Junichirou as well as most of...the students he helped as well as the concepts behind their arcs. However, I think the biggest issue is that unlike GTO, this didn't feel like a story that was written very well. The way that the problems that the students were facing was framed made them seem somewhat trivial, and while the viewer could understand why the problem came to be, it didn't do a very good job at making the viewer sympathize with them. On top of that, the arcs themselves ended up being somewhat hit or miss in the end because the solutions themselves sometimes felt kind of forced. The world itself also felt pretty random and inconsistent, wherein it not being realistic is perfectly fine but it not really being consistent in how it's larger than life can result in things seeming ridiculous to the point of being awkward. And just in general it felt like a lot of the arcs were longer than they should have been with really slow pacing, especially Koutarou's arc. Now some arcs didn't fall into most of these problems, with the Madoka arc and Komiya arc being the most solid, but it was very much a mixed bag. The ending felt like something rushed and forced. The humor was present from the beginning to end, but that too I think was a mixed bag. Parts that it felt like were trying to be funny weren't really all that funny at all, but some parts were incredibly hilarious.In terms of art and animation, it felt tremendously lacking. The style and designs were fine but it simply didn't look very good most of the time. The first OP and second ED were great, though I thought the first ED and second OP were just okay. The soundtrack was okay but pretty forgettable. the students he helped as well as the concepts behind their arcs.

To put it bluntly, it is an seriously inferior version of Great Teacher Onizuka... except that instead of delinquent you get an uber-otaku genius teacher. I didn\'t like it, but rated it as 5, because of the effort put into it. Detailed breakdown below:Story: 3/10Honestly, it is not good. It follows similar pattern as Great Teacher Onizuka or maybe even Assasination Classroom, but the problem is that it wastes quite a lot of the time trying to prove that ""otaku are people...too"" and trying to appeal to various popular trends/niche interest/hobbies. Occasionally there are amazing episodes (I really loved 3rd episode), but their number is depressingly low. Another issue is that ""otaku powers"" of main character surpass anything reasonably possible, which makes story harder to believe. Some of the events are pointlessly overdramatized to the point where they may look cruel (this happens only two times, though). Because of all this it is hard to take the story seriously. It doesn\'t help that cast of characters is less charming than Great Teacher Onizuka was.Art: 5/10.Standard ""modern"" arts with relatively low detail, fairly solid overall (and it doesn\'t look cheap). Looks better than mahouka, but it is not a ""realistic proportions"" type of anime, and it is less detailed than, say.... Spice and Wolf or even Shokugeki. Art does its job, it is done relatively well, but it could be better.Sound 4/10:Mostly does its job, but does not stand out, and I think one of the themes annoyed me.Characters: 4/10.One and possibly only amazing character here is protagonist\'s sister (suzune). Scenes where she get confused by her brothers are interesting to watch, and for some reason her character looks much more believable personality-wise. This may be happening because her voice acting is much more reserved than usual anime, which, amusingly, makes it more life-like. One of the side characters  - kanan chinami - was interesting to watch too, but only for the duration of the arc where she was introduced, and her behavior promptly deteriorated afterwards. The rest of the cast has less personality to display, acts in stereotypical manner and in general less believable. ""Sensei"" himself is fairly uninteresting character, with unreasonably high mental and computer skills.Enjoyement 4/10:I liked few episodes, but overall the anime was a disappointment. It is drop in a quality compared to Onizuka, and it spends too much time pandering to niche interests and hobbies or trying to prove that ""otaku are people too"".Overall: 5/10I\'d say 5/10, because they put effort into it, but overall I think you\'d be better off watching Greater Teacher Onizuka instead. Most likely it is more appealing to teens or younger teens.Basically, check first three episodes, and see if it is your thing or not. The quality is roughly the same throughought the whole anime. too"" and trying to appeal to various popular trends/niche interest/hobbies.

He only helps people only if he gets anything from that person like anime or game otherwise he doesn't give a fuck about anyone no matter if that guy is dying.When others give him some work he never wants to do it. but when it comes to a help for him in anime or a game he forces other and orders the to help him in it. A student is dying or suck at life he wont give a fuck but if a student says a particular game suck or an anime suck he wont leave them until they change their opinion. He is a teacher who can make entire class play a game n waste their time rather than teaching them. hate this fact a loti wouldn't have even given it a 5 if not for the min comedy it has and kinda good animation. no proper story and character building is very low.

I knew what to expect and still held it through to the end without losing my sight.And no, you shouldn\'t compare this title with ""Great Teacher Onizuka"" despite the enormously similar subject matter. They are similar but also enormously different. And especially in the area of \u200b\u200bquality, the two are worlds apart.I have one positive point to make about the series after reading the manga. The anime adaptation is much more child-friendly and contains the most minimal fan service, whereas the manga shows a lot more. Hints of incest are present in both, though minimal shows...up in the anime. I don\'t know if these approaches were supposed to be funny in any way, but they weren\'t.The actual plot revolves around the Super Otaku becoming a teacher and trying to integrate one Stereo Type student after the other into the social world. Which reminded me more of the scheme of a ""dating simulator"", but luckily it wasn\'t true.The individual character arcs did not contain anything worth mentioning and were extremely sluggish and boring. Worst of all, the humor wasn\'t even tangible. Otherwise, most of the scenes were impressively embarrassing.

Doraemon Movie 18: Nobita no Nejimaki City Boukenki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2678/Doraemon_Movie_18__Nobita_no_Nejimaki_City_Boukenki,"[""My overall take: Built on many intriguing concepts, but doesn't always follow up on them in a satisfying way.In this movie, Nobita and his friends populate a planet with sentient toys. This movie is a milestone, because it is the final Doraemon movie that the manga author Fujiko F. Fujio worked on before he passed. In fact, he apparently collapsed while drawing the manga that this film was based on, and the rest of the story had to be completed by his company, Fujiko Pro. Without speculating on exactly how that affected the development of this movie, I do feel that Nobita and the Spiral...City sets up many interesting concepts—for example, the toy civilization that the main characters create, the fact that the planet is apparently populated by sentient plants, and the mysterious shapeshifting golden statue that is eventually revealed to be the creator of all life(?!)—but doesn't always tie them together in a satisfying manner by the end.Much of how the plot is ultimately resolved here seems to borrow heavily from previous Doraemon movies. Shizuka's kindness inspiring an antagonist to act in favor of the heroes at a critical moment? Nobita reuniting with Doraemon using Doraemon's Spare Pocket? The villain leader being defeated by Nobita's sharpshooting skills? All story beats that we've seen before. Perhaps one of the more original moments in the second half of this movie is when a plush monkey sneaks back to Earth with Doraemon's Key of Life and grants sentience to several inanimate objects that don't quite fit in with the toys, such as a model skeleton from a school science lab. (Unfortunately, the movie leaves out one of the funniest new allies that the monkey recruited in the manga: a propaganda poster for a politician!)The confrontation with the villains drags on for a while considering that they're a group of regular humans without superpowers or futuristic technology, who probably could have been easily dealt with using Doraemon's gadgets. In fact, once the main characters are prepared to face them, the villains are defeated pretty handily, even with barely any gadgets involved. Until then, however, the story goes out of its way to produce circumstances in which the villains would be a threat, at one point forcing the main characters to work with them in an uneasy alliance. Although this could have been an interesting narrative angle to take, it mostly comes across as contrived in practice.

This show deserves a bit more attention IMO. It has a surprisingly low score -- I nearly skipped this show because of its 6-ish score. I honestly think this show should at least average a 7. I blame the really bad subs that are available and low popularity.This show also lacks better tagging -- there is definitely some romance and comedy. Reminds me of Yi Nian Yong Heng, although comparing the two is rather difficult. The comedy antics are quite similar, and the MCs have quite similar personalities in...both shows.

I don’t know what’s wrong with makers/ writers of this show…there is no character development, main character just fool around, flirt with every girl that he meet and thanks to shitty luck he somehow manages to power up.

As if watching the first season wasn\'t bad enough, I am tempted to watch the OVA just to conclude this ""harem"" anime in my long list of harem animes (and maybe at the same time, the OVA would provide some answers to how the problems in the first season was resolved so easily, but no luck here)What was I expecting.. It\'s an OVA, at best you would get is a bunch fanservice in the form of carefully planned trip to I don\'t know, somewhere that you would have to put less to no amount of clothes. So it would be either...be a beach, a pool or a hotsprings. Since the first two had been done in the first season, your guesses are correct. HOTSPRINGS! So yeah, all you manly guys out there are ready with your guns but please, put that away, the amount of ""fanservice time"" given isn\'t even barely enough for you to capture a mental image for your manly standards.Art and music quality is remains the same. So did the opening and ending songs. Yes, you heard me correctly, the OP and ED songs are still the same! If you would just labeled this episode, episode 13 (which somehow feels that way) no one would even complain.Is there development for characters for this particular episode? Nope, don\'t expect to see the love between Erika and Kouhei to develop. He\'s still running into her naked. But yeah he escapes with just a smack to the face. Lucky guy. Where I\'m from, if I see a real life girl naked, my eyes would get gougedout. Expect no development on Erika\'s vampirsm nature as well.""What? She\'s a vampire??""Yes for those who did not watch the first season, she is a vampire..""That would explains why she glitters under the sun!""Yes that would explain why she..... Wait.. What?So what\'s so enjoyable watching this OVA? If you manage to watch through the entire season, then a little bit more wouldn\'t hurt you now would it?

Something about a new law Japan enact banning lolicon themes? However brother-sister love in still present which means, the law on incest must not be in power yet.Overall, this was a HAPPY anime no matter how tragic they made it seem. I haven\'t seen such a happy anime since Shukufu no Campanella. Attempt to break from the harsh of circle of harem, failed. Does this OVA signal the creation of the second season? Perhaps not. If you have time to kill and you are a fan of the visual novel, they why not waste your time on this OVA?

In fact, if it did worse than the series, I would not have been surprised, but turns out, I was surprised in a much different manner.In short, I gave this OVA a 9 across the boards, simply because it was so much greater than the series for lack of better words. The story that was so jumbled in the series took a more coherent turn for the...better, as development of the story takes place. The great thing about this OVA is that the story of it does not focus on one thing, but it incorporated many activities that the group participate in, and we see how it drives the story forward.Art and Sound were solid, so no complaints.Character is where this OVA shines. Going a bit back to the story development, I believe it directly tied into character development as we see characters progress substantially from their series counterpart. Characters that were never really explored had a chance to come out and see them for their glory and greatness. I am trying to be as ambiguous as possible so I don't spoil any part of the OVA, but you will understand by the ending scene how much we see these characters seemingly grow over the course of 20 mins.For enjoyment, I rated it a 9, just because going in, this would be the last of Fortune Arterial. I was a bit bummed out that there will be no season 2, but I hope others can still enjoy the OVA as much as I did.Overall, a score of 9 does this OVA justice, especially if we factor in how poorly the series did. As mentioned before, only 20 mins for this OVA. This is definitely worth checking out and worth the effort if you went ahead and already finished the series. better, as development of the story takes place.

If you\'re looking for some explanation/better conclusion for the series you\'re going to be disappointed. Nonetheless, the episode comes across as a fairly easy watch with a few interesting moments mixed in. Still, I\'m not quite sure how the OVA is currently rated higher than the main show...Animation:I watched a low-res version of this OVA so I can\'t really judge the sharpness/detailing relative to the original.

They take a trip to a beach house where various activities take place (tennis, onsen, etc.). There isn\'t any serious plot behind any of the events and, most unfortunately, no further explanation of how Kouhei will resolve Erika\'s little family problem.Character:There is absolutely no additional character development in this OVA. All you can expect is what results from taking the main cast and plopping them by a lakeside cabin; all characters seem to behave consistent with their personalities in the main series.

Generator Gawl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1022/Generator_Gawl,"['I highly recommend this series to anyone that has a healthy (or unhealthy, whatever the case may be) interest in Sci-Fi stories that revolve around time travel. The characters are likeable, the plot flows well, and it has a good deal of eye candy action sequences. However, what I like best about it is that it makes you think and any media that does that is a good thing. Enjoy. ', 'Story: 8I was very surprised by this anime with how deep the plot was in only twelve episodes. Many of the twists I didn’t see coming. Generator Gawl’s story starts out slow but it was fast enough to keep you interesting in what was going to happen next. My two problems with this series are firstly that the first half of the series could have had a bit more plot development than it did rather than a monster of the week show. Secondly the School Festival episode was entirely useless. It had a little plot development but it could have been spread between the first...half of the series, thus making the first half more plot based. I also didn’t get the ending of this series, I just didn’t get it. It was a very scifi ending and I didn’t see it coming, but it just felt like it wrapped everything up rather conveniently. Nevertheless, it was at least a good ending that didn’t have me needing a sequel.I loved the dialogue in this series. It was all very fun and added much comedy. Their explanations of time travel and the science of the series made sense without the characters going into too much depth.Art: 8When it came to animation, this show took no shortcuts. Almost all movements were smooth. The battle scenes were active and didn’t have moments of just screaming how powerful you were to your opponent with a lined background to somehow make it look cool. It got right down to the attacking with little or no exhibition. This show is practically on par with most of the modernly made anime in its quality, particularly in its realistic character designs.The characters were good when it came to appearance, noticeable their eyes were not typical anime eyes and their faces were very organic looking. The Generators, though, are where the real creativity went. They were all very detailed and interesting, until later in the series when some of them look just like humans with some putty plastered on them. Generator Gawl in my mind was always the coolest in appearance. The main bone I have to pick is with Natsume’s hair. What was with that? The way her hair was shaped was very distracting and honestly creepy. And I never got used to them. She was the only human who looked entirely unbelievable.The background of this future set anime was realistic! Most anime set in the future (2007 in this case) take society to a ridiculous level. This show didn’t. We still had cars, cell phones, and schools, and we still dressed like human beings who need a sense of self expression. Thus it made the future seem to be a believable existence.The art for the background was not fantastic but they did do the job and at times was quite beautiful.Sound: 7 (dub)The music is where this show really lacks in. The tracks really aren’t that great and from most scenes are absent entirely, and with the lack of background noise it was even worse making it seem like you are listening to a silent void.I didn’t like the opening at all to start out with but it oddly grew on me. I still can’t say it’s great but it is a good opening. The ending has a sort of catchy tune that is pleasant to listen to and was comedic, a good thing for a show that otherwise has a serious plot.The voice acting was the best part. Both Vic Mignogna (Gawl) and Monica Rial (Natsume) did excellently in their roles. They obviously showed less experience but I think this added to the performance, especially Gawl who sounded very snarky. Rozie Curtis, who voiced Masami was perfect at being bossy and sassy towards Gawl. It really is a shame she has barely voiced in anything else.Character: 9Gawl would have to be hands down my favourite character as well as the best written. His personality was very deep and intriguing. Not to say that the others weren’t also well made and all of fit into their roles. Gawl and Masami helped keep the mood light with their antics. Without it the series would have been very dark overall. The villains were also well made and I felt I had come to know them through the writing, very impressed.Overall: 8Scifi, action, suspense, mystery, and a tiny bit of romance make this ""sort of"" mecha series the right to be considered a classic.  Unfortunately it seems the Otaku world has forgotten this series, which is a real crying shame.  ADV going out of business didn\'t help either.Frankly this is an amazing anime that everyone needs to check out, if you are lucky enough to find it that is. I just happened to have a copy at the local library, the rest of you, good luck. It had me interested from beginning to end and I am definitely considering owning this series because I could watch it over and over.Parental Caution:Rated PG-13-Some swearing.-Lots of monster blood.-There is a public bath shown in one of the episodes. Gawl stands up in the bath but thankfully it was cleverly censored.-There is a female generator who appears to be naked in her human form but the body tattoo mostly omits this and how the animation is done. Similar to Mystique or one of the other characters in X-men.-The terms stalker and flasher are used, but neither situation come to fruition. half of the series, thus making the first half more plot based.

She was the only human who looked entirely unbelievable.The background of this future set anime was realistic! Most anime set in the future (2007 in this case) take society to a ridiculous level. This show didn’t. We still had cars, cell phones, and schools, and we still dressed like human beings who need a sense of self expression. Thus it made the future seem to be a believable existence.The art for the background was not fantastic but they did do the job and at times was quite beautiful.Sound: 7 (dub)The music is where this show really lacks in. The tracks really aren’t that great and from most scenes are absent entirely, and with the lack of background noise it was even worse making it seem like you are listening to a silent void.I didn’t like the opening at all to start out with but it oddly grew on me. I still can’t say it’s great but it is a good opening. The ending has a sort of catchy tune that is pleasant to listen to and was comedic, a good thing for a show that otherwise has a serious plot.The voice acting was the best part. Both Vic Mignogna (Gawl) and Monica Rial (Natsume) did excellently in their roles. They obviously showed less experience but I think this added to the performance, especially Gawl who sounded very snarky. Rozie Curtis, who voiced Masami was perfect at being bossy and sassy towards Gawl. It really is a shame she has barely voiced in anything else.Character: 9Gawl would have to be hands down my favourite character as well as the best written. His personality was very deep and intriguing. Not to say that the others weren’t also well made and all of fit into their roles. Gawl and Masami helped keep the mood light with their antics. Without it the series would have been very dark overall. The villains were also well made and I felt I had come to know them through the writing, very impressed.Overall: 8Scifi, action, suspense, mystery, and a tiny bit of romance make this ""sort of"" mecha series the right to be considered a classic.  Unfortunately it seems the Otaku world has forgotten this series, which is a real crying shame.  ADV going out of business didn\'t help either.Frankly this is an amazing anime that everyone needs to check out, if you are lucky enough to find it that is. I just happened to have a copy at the local library, the rest of you, good luck. It had me interested from beginning to end and I am definitely considering owning this series because I could watch it over and over.Parental Caution:Rated PG-13-Some swearing.-Lots of monster blood.-There is a public bath shown in one of the episodes. Gawl stands up in the bath but thankfully it was cleverly censored.-There is a female generator who appears to be naked in her human form but the body tattoo mostly omits this and how the animation is done. Similar to Mystique or one of the other characters in X-men.-The terms stalker and flasher are used, but neither situation come to fruition.', 'I have a bit of a bias, as this is my favorite anime, but I\'ll try and be unbiased in my review.The story is not too average, though it is in a typical school setting and has the typical characters-types (quiet one, spaz, girl-and-boy-who-start-off-hating-each-other-and-end-up-falling-in-love), but it deals with real-world morality issues, like cloning and nuclear-holocaust.  There are many subtleties that you\'ll have to re-watch the anime to pick up, including an ""oh shit"" moment at the end that you have to catch the first time.  Just try watching the opening after seeing the last episode and try not saying ""Oh, man, how did...I miss that?!"", haha.Lessee... the character voices are spot-on, and though I recommend watching it in Japanese as well as English, this is one of the few anime I usually watch in English (others being Gundam and Evangelion).  A few scenes in English the dialogue changes drastically to accommodate cultural differences (in a scene where the students are cleaning the classroom, in English there\'s an announcement over the speakers that it\'s due to a \'custodial strike\'; also, in the first episode, in Japanese our Title hero is accused of being a regular pervert for peering suspiciously into a restaurant where girls in cute uniforms work, in English he\'s labeled as a \'fast-food stalker\'), but all of those involved know what they\'re about when it comes to anime voice-acting.I think what I like best about Generator Gawl is the pacing.  One of the first anime I ever watched was Gundam W, and that series alone was 49 episodes and a movie.  Generator Gawl didn\'t feel like it was being dragged out; everything moved along from point to point, and in twelve episodes they\'re able to tell a story.In the interest of not gushing, I think I\'ll end my review here.  In conclusion, I gave the Art 10 of 10 because of the way it\'s used both during battles and outside of combat situations, sometimes even artistically to illustrate a point (as seen in a the dream sequence Ryo has).  The sound is 10 of 10 as the voices are all well done, and the background conversations are all well-placed but completely necessary.  Enjoyment is 10 of 10; I feel like I learned something as a person just for having seen it.  The Character I gave a 9 of 10 to, as while each character gets plenty of development, they all start off as a generic manga/anime type character.  The story is 9 of 10 for the same reason.  Overall, I rated it as a 9 of 10, as, while this is *my* favorite anime, I recognize that it\'s probably not ""the greatest anime in existence"".

I love an anime that has good fight scenes, and Generator Gawl does not disapoint. The characters become likeable very quickly. While in some shows humor seems to ruin the mood, Generator Gawl makes it work, some scenes are downright hillarious. The storyline is one that gets you thinking, sometimes you have no idea whats going to happen next and thats what makes the series so great. Overall, this anime is definately worth checking out. ', 'Animated by Tatsunoko Productions, a company with generally low budgets. They have made a few goodies such as Irresponcible Captain Tylor and Soul Taker but their roster is mostly made up of bad and passable anime. Directed by Mizushima Seiji, whose roster includes average to bad works. This doesn’t look very promising from the very first second you lay your eyes on it.I have seen lots of shows where the protagonist transforms to a cybernetic monster and wrecks havoc to other monsters. The most famous amongst anime are Tekkaman Blade and Biobuster Armor Guyver, and if I include live action there is also Kamen Rider....Watching most of their duration was interesting or exciting. Since their target audience was young teens, they were meant to be full of action and emotion, the same things which this variant DOES NOT HAVE. Compared to the above titles, the production values are TERRIBLE! Simplistic character designs, dull explosions, boring BGM, slow plot, amateurish directing, the list of lazy productions just goes on.The premise of the story is definitely good, for combining lots of interesting science fiction elements, such as time travel, advanced genetic manipulation, and mind control. Everything else in it though is one big mess. The pacing for example is purely episodic in the first half before it becomes slow and erratic in the second half. Half of the audience will be completely bored and will have given up midway, while most of the other half will be staring at it with complete apathy to the end. THERE IS NO EXCITEMENT! Everything plays out so damn basic and slow that fail to impress you.At the same time this is not one of those deep philosophical shows that go for substance instead of style. It really is immature all the way, so not even the sophisticated viewers can appreciate it for trying to be smart. The very first episode is about three pretty boys being arrested as peeping toms, before being released and by complete chance having to live in the same house with the girl one of them erroneously molested. HOW’S THAT FOR MATURITY? No matter how smart the show attempts to be at times with some funky scientific talking, it is all trashed with retarded anime humor such as that.What is even lamer about it is how the three main characters are supposed to be pretty boys and extremely smart. “Supposed” couldn’t be more presented in a vaguer way since they are clearly acting completely stupid most of the time and ARE NOT THAT PRETTY TO BEGIN WITH. Of course we can always blame the production values for the later issue. Everyone in this show looks like a blob most of the time. And damn, some of their hairstyles are just OUT THERE! There is even a girl where something bad happens to her and instead of feeling sorry you are just laughing with her improbable hairdo.What is even lamer than that is how we are supposed to consider the main trio to be super cool and awesome for just standing around while wearing fancy leather and sunglasses. How the devil can we do that when essentially only ONE of them is important to the plot and he acts like an idiot all the time? Which one of the three you may ask? Well, look at the title, why do you think the anime is called Gawl? So yeah, only he is the hero and the other two just come along as extra space and flavor for the female audience who… Hey wait a second; why do we even need a female audience for this show to begin with? It is action/supernatural for male teenagers! Stupid publicity stunts!Anyways, it’s not like they worked to begin with. They don’t look so awesome because the production values suck. And so do the battles; man, they are so short and dull. Some creatures make of foam appear and Gawl turns to a beast and kicks their asses in a few minutes of boredom. They don’t even blow up after defeat; they just dissolve to dust, which is again lame. The other two and the token chick are mostly looking spaced out at him while doing all that; it’s like they are there just to eat up screen time.They are not even developed in any way to care about them. Every single character in this show is a simplistic archetype and sticks to it no matter what happens. The three dudes are like they popped out of a c-grade date sim for women and the two girls are standard token chicks that are there to provide humor and cheap drama without actually doing anything. Yawn!The fandom forgot about this show very fast and for a good reason. There was nothing in it that you won’t find in the titles I mention in the beginning and it also looks bad. Not recommended.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 4/10Analysis: General Artwork 0/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Voice Acting 1/3, Music Themes 1/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 0/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Presence 0/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 1/2, Catharsis 1/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 0/1, Sound 0/2, Story 1/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 3/10 Watching most of their duration was interesting or exciting.

Hells,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4983/Hells,"['The story is about Linne, a regular old schoolgirl who’s late for school and running with a piece of toast in her mouth. Then she’s hit by a truck and ends up in hell. Not exactly the best start to her day. She has to attend the Hell School for Prim and Proper Ladies, a variety of demon ladies with various gothic dresses or alternatively lavishly decorated pubic hair. Oh, and the principal is Elvis-sorry, I mean Helvis.The style of hell is very much that cartoony gothic you see in Tim Burton or, to bring a more anime example to the table, Soul Eater, and...it’s a style I’m rather fond of. It works well in Hells because they know full well how ridiculous the story is and so ham it up to eleven. Unlike the very crisp and clean animation style of Soul Eater though, Hells goes for a very pencil sketchy look. It’s not something I’m normally a fan of, but Hells pulls it off perfectly. The style goes well with its bonkers hyperactivity and over-indulgence in exaggeration. Its boundless energy is catching, and the art style brings that across perfectly. If you’re watching this anime, you’re watching it for the art style, because that’s where the fun lies. Because you’re probably not going to watch it for the story…After 45 minutes of this nearly 2 hour movie, I was all ready to call it my anime of the year. The pacing is frantic but coherent and action scene blends in well with calmer scenes. The introduction to the new character’s in Linne’s classroom is hyper and crazy, but you then get a downer scene of her trying to cope with where she has ended up. This is followed by the fight scene with the literally heartless Stealer and the gatekeepers, which flows into plot development and character interaction scenes with the classmates and student council and so on. Each scene has a purpose and moves the relatively simple plot forward.Then I’m not quite sure what happened, but my guess is the lead writer was eaten by alligators and replaced by some hobo who had gotten through the first few pages of the bible. I don’t really want to spoil events, but suddenly in pops Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, 3 of which are characters we’ve already been introduced to. There were no hints given earlier on in the story that they were supposed to be these biblical figures. It just randomly decided to attribute these characteristics to each person. Adam is a totally new character who randomly shows up halfway through the movie with absolutely no warning and becomes an important character. Then there’s Mario, whose purpose in the movie I don’t get at all. He’s just some dude who yells a lot. I’m not kidding when I say he probably gets the most screentime out of anyone in the second half of the movie, despite his actions having limited to no effect on the events of the story. If you removed him completely, it wouldn’t really change, except perhaps less shouting and an overall improvement of the quality of the movie.I’m not necessarily against the plot points in the second half of the movie, and part of me appreciates the audacity of the set pieces and dramatics. I even genuinely liked the ending, in all its cheesy sentimentalism. But a good hour of that movie could be cut down to about 10 minutes. It’s especially exasperating when the plot doesn’t appear to be advancing through all this yelling and self-doubt. The main theme of the movie is meant to be self-doubt, but that doesn’t mean you’ve got to hammer it into our heads over and over again. It’s incredibly frustrating because you can see how this movie could be amazing if it was just an hour long. For as much as I love that Madhouse are willing to give directors such creative freedom with absolutely no prospect for making their money back, there’s a reason you need a strict editor sometimes.I feel rather conflicted about writing negative stuff about Hells though, because it’s astonishing that it was even made in the first place. It bears many resemblances to Redline in this regard. Madhouse and their utter disregard for making a profit just so they can give directors free reign to experiment. Hells is certainly no Redline, but it’s born from the same kind of production environment. It’s the same place that saw directors like Satoshi Kon and Mamoru Hosada rise up. It will eventually drive Madhouse into the dirt, but for the sake of art I’d love to see them keep trying. Hells may not have worked, but there are flashes of genius here. I was about to say that I’d love to see what this director works on next, but we’ve already seen that. He was brought under the creative branches at JC Staff.

That anime in question was Kill Me Baby.', 'It’s hard to properly describe just how absurd Hells is. Much like feelings themselves, this movie is inexplicable, irrational, and borderline unpredictable at times. By that same token, given that it embodies feelings so well, it does an admirable job at being a delightfully earnest film. It’s honestly a shame this eye-catcher didn’t receive that much attention until now.On that note, let’s start at what drew me in. The art style in this movie is insane! Far removed from the blander or softer art styles present in most anime, this movie showcases rough outlines and keeps the sketching and coloring lines on its characters. This...unique style allows for the designers and animators to go all out in constructing the craziest and loveliest character designs, craft a wonderfully vibrant world in Hell, and play around with the rugged linework and imagery in a way that Mob Psycho 100 would gain notoriety for mastering 8 years later. That being said, the anime still decides to use mediocre CG at times and the animation generally feels tamer than the art style. The film’s probably not as visually explosive as the team at Studio Madhouse could have made. However, it’s still one of the most eye-catching anime I’ve witnessed to date.The other major draw is the dub. Purists may chant for blood at this, but the fact that several members of the abridging juggernaut brand: TeamFourStar, were contacted by Discotek Media to participate in the dub was explosive. The performances in this film were generally good, and some of the adlibs were as priceless as hearing the likes of LittleKuriboh and KaiserNeko as side characters. All in all, the performances were good enough for this risk to be worthwhile and potentially replicated in the future. After all, given how painfully obscure this film is, they had nothing to lose when taking this chance. The performances eclipse most of the soundtrack, with the only exception being the banger of an end credits theme: “Breathe Again"" by Jamosa feat. Sphere.It feels rather fitting that they decided to take this risk with such an obscure, dumb, loveable anime. This movie’s infectious charm is rivaled by its own absurdity, constantly turning its own rules and world on their heads in a way that’s almost impossible to accept. Its messages of love, self-worth, forgiveness, etc. are deeply intertwined to this mess of a narrative. Nothing makes sense, all rules exist to be broken, and believing is what causes the setting to be created and altered constantly. Caution is thrown to the wind by the characters and the script as things simply happen for aforementioned reasons, and sometimes no known reason at all. It’s all hard to buy. Another reason why it’s so messy is that the film is not just blatant about how it utilizes its themes, but as preachy about them as its characters are violent.Said characters are generally lacking in any real depth beyond blatantly spelling out their deep-rooted sorrows. Their personalities often range from infectious to grating, and they constantly either stand around for no reason or beat the living shit out of each other. If a film less loveable as this had these qualities, it would be much harder to stomach most of this. However, this is Hells, a brazen, funny, beautiful mess of a film. That means these characters interactions often make up for how weak and shallow they may be upon analysis.It\'s rather fitting that Hells was given this chance. Abandoned by history, this dumb, rambunctious upstart was given a loving license and dub by people who wanted to take a risk and share this with the world. If you like the unique and rough art style, like the kind of humor and writing that the best anime abridgers craft, or like the works of TeamFourStar and would like to see more eventful risks like this in our industry, then please, give this film a shot. It may be a hell of a mess, but it’s one I can’t help but promote.

Beyond the art however, you find that the story at times is special within its own right, yet lacking in its bipolar plot. Personally, I enjoyed the few aspects of the story. The story I guess you could say... is a form of art: making you think of literature and such (it gets quite metaphoric in the second half, although that\'s not entirely a good thing because it\'s so different from the first half). And if you\'re interested in Cain/Abel references, then that\'s a cool bonus for you.The art seems pretty retro and possibly low budget,...also reminding me of Kill La Kill. I wouldn\'t say that the art is a weak point in this anime however, because its drawing really fits the theme of this anime superbly, being flexible towards its dark moments as well as its comical moments.The sound is fair and mediocre. Pretty much nothing bad nor good, just average so you wouldn\'t be bothered but neither does it stand out in any way.The characters are all really interesting when they are first introduced; but as the story moves forward you can feel the lack of significant bonding between characters... a fully fledged TV series would\'ve done character development justice. But with what we\'re presented here, I rate the characters below average.My enjoyment personally was really good; the first half of this movie just CAUGHT ME. I was hooked and I loved the interesting concept of a girl who ran into hell unknowingly. The atmosphere was great and the anime kept me thinking about what would happen to our protagonist and would she ever find her way back to her world. However after the first half of the movie, it suddenly becomes very cliche as if the producers gave up half way through. The whole theme flip flops into biblical allusions that seems to have rose from nowhere. This makes it stray away from the ominous tone that the movie initially had going for it. And rather than going for that ominous tone of ""Hells"", the movie suddenly starts producing random plot and random character backgrounds for the story and characters.Overall, if you\'re hesitant on watching this movie, I say: don\'t try it. This is one movie that I do not recommend. But I will give the movie props for making people hesitant in watching it in the first place. The anime is funny in some areas, but also somewhat inspiring in some others.Because of Hells\' comical and witty nature, my enjoyment is higher than the (bad) story-design itself. Initially, I was intrigued by the unique art and atmosphere of Hells. However, if it doesn\'t intrigue you, then I doubt you\'re going to find something worth your time in this film.Thanks for reading ~ also reminding me of Kill La Kill.

Both stylistically and thematically. However, both Mindgame and Kaiba ease you into what they are trying to say, and draw from their references subtly. Especially Mindgame, which could also be seen in a biblical context (Jonah and the whale...), but it never comes out and beats you over the head with this.So Hells does a good job of introducing the characters and getting you to emotionally invest in them. But then the...focus shifts from their personal stories, to some larger biblical story. I feel like this shift was really unnecessary, and they could have made all the same points within their personal dramas. But instead they chose to come right out and tell you exactly what they wanted you to know. There's no mystery here.This is why I don't think it is near as good as Mindgame or Kaiba. The beginnings of all these are similar, but Mindgame and Kaiba choose to stay in that character driven drama, subtly referencing the themes they are dealing with. They make their points through the natural evolution of the characters, rather than spelling it out for you. So you stay emotionally invested in those characters the entire time. You aren't trying to intellectually pieced together all this dialogue. You understand it on an emotional level, and afterwards you can go back and intellectualize it, but it's really unnecessary.But I'm still glad I watched it, ultimately I do feel like it said something interesting, and there was an emotional payoff at the end.And comparing anything to Mindgame or Kaiba, even if it seems like I'm doing so in a negative light, is high praise, because I feel those anime are incredible works of art. I'll watch anything that even scratches the surface of what those accomplished. focus shifts from their personal stories, to some larger biblical story.

Almost every negative review of this gives a lot of credit for the unique art style and wild trigger-like fights and general unhinged storyline. Bottom line is the majority of negative reviews here actually missed primary plot lines (confusion, more like skill issue, try again next time). The show has a certain skill hill for compreshesion and while some people who watch this may hate the idea of, what is now known as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, the final fight scene being a biblical condensed evangelion scale experience of...positive self thought and indominable human spirit based on the writings of occult magic study.This movie is in a way just Gurren Laggan mixed with Evangelion, and like both is great if you're actually able to see the value in the themes and the overall depth of the ironic humor. and terrible if you are watching the show to distract you from your sad life. positive self thought and indominable human spirit based on the writings of occult magic study.This movie is in a way just Gurren Laggan mixed with Evangelion, and like both is great if you're actually able to see the value in the themes and the overall depth of the ironic humor. and terrible if you are watching the show to distract you from your sad life."", 'Rinne Amagame is an average schoolgirl ready to start the new year, but on her way to her first class is struck by a semi-truck while trying to save a cat. Naturally, she goes straight to Hell and is enrolled at an academy for demonic delinquents whose goal is graduation and ascension to Heaven. But Rinne quickly learns her death is a mistake, and looks for a way to return to the real world and her mother. Rinne and the rest of Hell will even be dragged into a plot that goes as far back as the story of Adam and Eve.It\'s surprising to see...anime with such distinctive art and stunning animation be such a well-kept secret, and a modern anime at that. This one could have gone under my radar for a long time but I fortunately learned about it, and a look at some screenshots instantly convinced me it\'d be a worthwhile watch. Whenever people encounter such a work so heavily focused on its stylization, they assume the plot and characters will fail to have some kind of ""maturity"". I don\'t like to use the word ""substance"" because it\'s so loaded. But when it comes to storyline standards, plots with heavy dialogue, complex relationships, and emotional grace tends to be considered linearly better. I\'ve gone on and on about how visuals play just as much of a part of getting across a strong story as any choice of words, so I won\'t go off on another one of those tangents here. My point is that the movie Redline often suffers the same criticisms, and yet I love its story and characters that are delivered in such a refreshing blow that they overcome a variety of dramatic pretensions for emotional impact. Besides, after a certain point both the simplest save-the-day stories and complex character dramas have both equally been done to death before. So, style is often the distinctive factor.Basically, what I’m trying to say here is that if there\'s a target audience for Hells, I\'d figure I\'m part of it. Hells’ underworld is designed in a darkly comic manner most people will be able to draw a comparison with somewhere. The likely candidate is the stop-motion characters Tim Burton has designed, with Hells’ art being at once colorful and childishly simple but rendered in abrasive ways, with harsh jagged lines that accentuate their inhuman features. Even Rinne, a human, looks lanky and doll-like. Similarly, when this nightmarish distortion is applied to even the most basic of scenery and curved buildings it begins to look like a German expressionist work. Combining the innocent with the disgusting may be a worn-out trend, but anime unusually touches influences such as these which makes Hells feel exciting in context.But all of that is how Hells looks when it’s static. As for how it moves, another comfortable point of comparison is the works of studio Trigger. The movement in Hells is every bit as breakneck and attention-deficit as the pacing of its storyline, bouncing and bolting from scene to scene with a fittingly childish enthusiasm. It’s fluid, colorful, and even unpredictable with short and sudden style shifts. The result feels light and juvenile, but in a way that’s rebelliously punky. Hells’ base simplicity and simple sense of wonder truly pays off in a final act about challenging reality with conviction and making the impossible possible with a loud, straightforward optimism reminiscent of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann’s messages. Not surprisingly, that series was composed by current members of studio Trigger.The sheer speed at which Hells moves isn’t very beneficial to deep character development. The movie is clearly trying to capture a story larger than its runtime, but style is once again the great compromiser here, making characters likable and understandable simply through their boundless expressions. You don’t fully understand the logic of, say, Rinne and Steeler’s relationship because it feels like they barely interact, but what’s important is that whenever that relationship is relevant it’s so exuberantly captured that you can simply feel its significance to the characters. The emotions in Hells all feel genuine despite their lack of set-up, and takes little explanation to cheer for a cast that’s so innately enjoyable and fun. Hells doesn’t offer contemplative looks at morality, but those kinds of conversations have been handled by media so much already. Instead of beating around the same old concepts in your head, movies like Hells come along and aren’t discouraged to try their hardest to make the ride something you’d have to remember rather than something you feel like you should. anime with such distinctive art and stunning animation be such a well-kept secret, and a modern anime at that.

The movie\'s only watchable.Good points:The art style stays true to the manga\'s, very ""hellish"". If the movie stands alone, I would say it\'s an impressionistic piece of crazy artsy shit.Not-so-good points:This is a very concise adaptation of the manga. It\'s like an animated version with a lot of essential factors taken away. The plot rushes through character development and important relationships, making everyone seems rather flat. Although the manga only has three volumes, the story and the characters are so complex and interesting that a TV series would do more justice than a movie. Cramming all the drama and plot twists...in just two hours doesn\'t seem like a good idea.Overall, meh. Try the manga. in just two hours doesn\'t seem like a good idea.Overall, meh.

The characters are constantly jumping from one end to the other over and over again. It would have been better if this was a show instead but even then, the final result of the unfolding of this story would have still been an absolute mess if the destination was the same. The only redeemable aspect of this show is the art. It's aesthetically pleasing to look at but even then I know for a fact some people wouldn’t like it. Just...watch something else honestly. Some people recommend the manga more than the movie. I haven't read the manga but maybe give that a shot instead. The ratings on MAL for both are pretty much the same. watch something else honestly.

There's all this talk about the madness of Able, God appears but doesn't really add anything to the story, and the movie's ending doesn't even make sense.On top of that, the movie is full of anime...cliches like how Rinne is constantly late for school, the student council being the antagonists, and Rinne having this genki girl personality where she's so happy go lucky and optimistic all the time.Also, a lot of the conflicts in the movie are resolved through deus ex machina. For example, a character loses his arm, but Rinne just tells him to believe in himself and magically the arm reappears because all you have to do is believe you can do something and it'll come true.The only good thing about this movie is the art. I really like the design of the school and the demon students that attend it. It's interesting how each demon is designed after a different monster like a mummy, a witch, a werewolf, and Frankenstein's monster. However, while the designs are good, the animation is another matter. It's painfully obvious that this movie was made on a small budget; there's one scene that lasts for over 10 minutes where all we see is a clip show of still images.Overall, I'd recommend do not watch this movie. It seems like some talented people worked on it, but it's so disorganized and poorly executed that I recommend avoiding it. cliches like how Rinne is constantly late for school, the student council being the antagonists, and Rinne having this genki girl personality where she's so happy go lucky and optimistic all the time.Also, a lot of the conflicts in the movie are resolved through deus ex machina.

Honestly I found this a rather difficult movie to follow or to evaluate; the art style is very unique and enjoyable, and the characters and scenes FEEL like they have a lot of personality, but the story, atmosphere and direction seem to unpredictably jump around a lot, and not always in a good way. It feels like this never establishes enough of a status quo for the twists and upheavals to it to really land. That may be partly due to them compressing 21 manga chapters into...a 2-hour movie when usually you\'d want around 10 minutes per chapter, and partly due to the manga itself probably changing direction as it was being written and not being sure exactly where it was going from the beginning (and I suspect this adaptation stuck to a little over-literally to the manga rather than making enough changes to suit the condensed telling). All that being said, I THINK it raises a few interesting philosophical points, although they\'re hard to pull out from the general insanity of the story, and it\'s memorable for its sheer boldness and novelty if nothing else. This is hardly what I\'d call a must-see, but I suppose I\'d say that if a look at the trailer really piques your interest, then you probably won\'t regret watching this one. a 2-hour movie when usually you\'d want around 10 minutes per chapter, and partly due to the manga itself probably changing direction as it was being written and not being sure exactly where it was going from the beginning (and I suspect this adaptation stuck to a little over-literally to the manga rather than making enough changes to suit the condensed telling).

The reason I dislike said trope comes down to the fact the viewer won't notice the tropes utilization unless they're doing either a full blown analysis of the work or the message the author is putting in becomes too obvious for the work's own good. The movie Hells falls into the latter. This isn't to say the message isn't a good message - though in this case I think it is, but when the narrative pummels it into the viewer in the degree and ferocity Hells does it's hard for said viewer not to become sick of...the whole thing.On top of the Author Tract trope the series also falls into the Black and White morality problem and over simplifies the concepts of hope and despair with rhetoric which can't even begin to understand human nature. In fact, by the end I felt the narrative openly mocked those with depression without actually bringing the subject up, yet doing so is no easy feat. In addition to this I felt all the negative things anybodies gone through in life mocked.

About halfway through the film, the story and characters become a lot weightier, which reinvigorated my interest right when I was getting a little bored of the quirky Hell antics.

However, Hells still had aspects about it that made it enjoyable.The first thing you\'ll notice is the striking art style. I loved the gothic flair, sketchy outlines, and very over-the-top exaggerated animation. It captures the style of the manga well, and each colour choice is exceptional. Rinne\'s brighter palette really stood out against the dark, moody atmosphere and more muted tones on the other character designs. I appreciated the subtle...visual cues, such as stitching appearing to be wherever Steela was.Another aspect I enjoyed about this film was that it felt very hopeful. Rinne is a very likable protagonist, while also eventually learning to stand up for herself and what she believes in. Her friendship with Steela was so sweet, and the way she gradually won over the others was enjoyable. She very much is a ""power of friendship"" type protagonist and even reminds me a little of Suzuki Iruma, but that\'s exactly what I liked so much about her.This film is free on retrocrush if you want to try and give it a chance. visual cues, such as stitching appearing to be wherever Steela was.Another aspect I enjoyed about this film was that it felt very hopeful.

Come for the party.', ""What a trip.It's always interesting to see how Japan takes and adapts Christian folklore into the surreal world of anime. Hell is a concept almost ubiquitous in religions around the world, but nobody seems to be able to agree on it's exact nature. While a strictly Biblical depiction would show it to be a place of only suffering, eastern ideas about the afterlife paint it as being basically a continuation of our society as we have it already here on earth. So of course Hell is going to be a Japanese high school, where they play volleyball and talk about which boys they like.The philosophies...aside, what really stands out in this movie is the unique art style and animation. It's the kind of thing you can really only get from anime, and is hard to describe in just words. Even if the plot is utterly nonsensical it ultimately doesn't matter if it still looks cool, and it does. Honestly that's really all it had going for it for me, though. Looking cool isn't really enough to elevate it's score much past a 6/10, so that's what I gave it. Kind of dumb movie otherwise. aside, what really stands out in this movie is the unique art style and animation.

Kind of dumb movie otherwise."", '""Hells Angels"" is an extraordinary work that surprises at every turn. The film directed by Yoshiki Yamakawa, based on the manga by Shinichi Hiromoto, is both a film and a manga full of incredible plot twists, diverse characters and unusual graphics that catch the eye from the first minutes. One of the greatest advantages of ""Hells Angels"" is the variety of characters. The main character, Amane, is an ordinary girl who ends up in hell as a result of an unfortunate accident. There he meets a number of colorful and unique characters who create an extraordinary and unpredictable world. Each character, from the lovable punk...devil to the mysterious guardians of Hell, has their own unique traits and motivations that add depth to the plot and make it more engaging. As for the plot, it\'s a real rollercoaster of emotions. It starts inconspicuously, but quickly gains momentum, introducing you to a world of hellish intrigues and adventures full of unexpected twists and turns. The story of Amane, who tries to find her way back to the world of the living, is not only captivating, but also full of philosophical reflections on life, death and redemption. The film balances between humor, drama and moments of horror, which means you never know what to expect. It is a story about struggle, determination and hope that stays with the viewer long after the film ends. Unusual graphics are another element that makes this film stand out. The animation style is bold and original, with a clear influence of punk aestheticism that perfectly suits the hellish world depicted in the film. The colors are vibrant and contrasting, and the character designs are incredibly detailed and varied, making each scene visually intriguing. The scriptwriters managed to create a world that, despite its fantastic nature, is deeply rooted in human emotions and experiences.  To sum up, ""Hells Angels"" is an anime film that deserves the attention of every fan of the genre. With a variety of characters, amazing plot twists, unique graphics and a deeply original plot, it is a work that will remain in your memory for a long time. It\'s an anime that not only entertains, but also makes you think, which makes it unique in its category. devil to the mysterious guardians of Hell, has their own unique traits and motivations that add depth to the plot and make it more engaging.

A Madhouse film from 2008 based off of a manga. For a long time I\'ve posited that Madhouse has two teams. One that\'s putting out quality work, another that puts out utter rubbish. So, which one are we getting?Story:We open with our main heroine, Amagane Rinne, running late for school. On her way there, she rescues a strange looking cat that\'s being harassed by some horrible children. Does she think she\'s Tsukino Usagi? This results in her being hit by a truck. Afterwards, she wakes up in hell where she can start at a new...school and leave hell if she graduates. There\'s just one catch, she may not be quite dead.The biggest problem with the film is that the pacing is very awkward. Hells likes to pause the action for long, rambling speeches about hope vs skill and other topics. And when they do wax philosophical in these moments it\'s very simplistic. Like, one side will say you have to have hope. The other will say hope is nothing without the ability to act on it. Then the original side will say that taking those steps to get results all start with hope and that\'s why it\'s so important. It also has this weird habit of dragging out some scenes and rushing through others. A perfect example is the Volleyball tournament. The first match they have takes up more time than every other match combined, including the final.I will give the story-telling credit for staying compelling throughout. The pacing may be wonky, but there is always something interesting going on. The series also does do some creative things with the whole concept of hell and the afterlife. The film also possesses a lot of charming moments and scenes that just work very well.Characters:The cast is largely very bland. This film does have a lot of characters, so most of them aren\'t used that much. The big exceptions are Rinne, Steela & Kutou. Rinne and Steela actually have a very strong dynamic and it helps bring out different facets for them both. Kutou seems boring at first, but becomes an interesting character midway through the film.Art:The art is a bit different in that it looks more like a Western cartoon than an anime with its general style and hyperactive animation. The whole aesthetic of hell and the various demon characters is pretty interesting. The bizarre spiky nipple thing they do with various characters, like Headmaster Helvis is just weird. That being said, I don\'t dislike the whole design. I actually think basing Rinne\'s classmates off of classic monsters is pretty well done. Especially since they don\'t do the usual sexy monster girl thing.Sound:The man issue with the acting in this anime is that a lot of it is pretty over the top. It\'s one of those where a lot of the comedy is based around big, vibrant moments with lines being delivered very flamboyantly. Which isn\'t to say that Sawashiro Miyuki, Fukuen Misato, Kishio Daisuke and the others are bad. They actually do very well with switching from the over the top comedic moments to the more subdued talkative or emotional moments. The music is okay. It was done by Edison, the same composer who worked on Black Lagoon. The music in this isn\'t as good as Black Lagoon\'s, but it\'s decent enough.Ho-yay:There\'s a bit. Once Steela and Rinne\'s relationship starts to develop it comes across as a little les-yayish. It\'s sort of like a more toned down version of the dynamic betwixt Mai and Mikoto in Mai-Hime.Areas of Improvement:1: If your ""philosophy"" is at a very basic level, you don\'t need to have very long, slow scenes about it. I\'m sorry, but the whole argument about hope, talent and wishing versus doing is not complex enough to need the time they spend on it.2: Less talking in general during the more action-oriented sequences would be welcome. I get it, you have information to impart and you want to make the characters slightly more complex but that would work better with less action sequences and more character scenes rather than by having your characters pause in the middle of an actiony moment to just have a long, rambling talk.3: The film could benefit from having more developed characters. There are characters like Mario, Kiki and Phantoma who have important moments but those moments don\'t work as well as they could because Mario, Kiki & Phantoma are all tired archetypes.Final Thoughts:This film isn\'t great. It probably shouldn\'t be defined as horror since it\'s one of those where the horror genre is based on having monsters and being set in Hell rather than on the actual aesthetic. That being said, I kind of liked it. It has charm, intrigue and some heart. So, I\'m going to give it a 7/10. Not the best, but worth watching. school and leave hell if she graduates.

TL;DR: This is the life story of a future star singer.Tamura Eriko is not your typical usual student as her parents are rich and famous people. Her life could be a sugar bowl but not everything is happy in the real life. Life of a starting singer of 80s has its advantages and drawbacks.Unlike most of recent romance comedies this anime has surprisingly strong and consistent plot. Yes, fillers are present but not too often. Predictability of the story development is about 40-60% (vs 95% in modern anime) and this is why I liked it.Characters are...well written. Every single one, even minor personage has a believable character without much overacting (like in modern shows).No grotesque tsunderes, no stupid average school boys, no stereotypes. Awesome!Eriko herself is too naive and sweet sometimes, but she\'s only 14 (in the 1989) so it isn\'t much of an eyesore (unlike the ""TRASHY MAN"") or Mary Sue. She has bright personality, hardly ever gets angry, excels at every activity and always puts the needs of others before herself, also can be described as a hard worker on the whole.The music is nice and not easy forgettable. I really liked ""Serious"" song (真剣).Soundtrack is good (like most anime soundtracks from the end of 80s).Designs were pleasing to my eye. Sure, secondary characters sometimes have derpy faces, coloring is off, backgrounds are mostly simple and Eririn\'s expressions from 48 episode are creepy.But! Those faces are not copypasted plastic mannequins (like in Sailor Moon Crystal).Cons: show is repetitive (songs, some scenes), sometimes prolonged where it not supposed to.Overall, I did enjoy my time with Idol Densetsu Eriko, and I\'m definitely not a romance fan.  In the end, there was plenty of room for improvement, but it was quite a charming show. I\'ll give it a 7+. well written.

Although it could be more properly named \'video art\' rather than anime, in order not to raise flames among the conservative otaku (I can hear screams of ""Where\'s the fuckin\' plot, the fuckin\' characters..?""), and even if I don\'t play the role of the snobbish anime viewer I understand that rating this work as anime could be confusing.However.I think this is not only a gentle, good-vibration-inducing work, but also that its beauty lies in the details and the beautiful hybrid between sense of wonder and warmth: the harmony of the sound of a revolving door...merging with the soothing music (Background? Sound is a protagonist nearly as much as sight, in Iblard Jikan), the contrast between a home-like, Ghiblian scene of girls playing and pebble-Zeppelins (!) floating in the sky, the pleasure of letting the eye lose itself in the color traces, the gentle thrill of wondering what will move in the next scenery, whether a girl will fade from reality into paint or a rectangular train will come. I think this 30-minutes piece could be refreshing and new even after watching it several times.Don\'t look at the vote, it\'s only to put a number and to note the quite sad truth that Iblard Jikan is a fish out of water among anime: it could either raise childlike wonder or be terribly boring, and it would not be difficult to label it as \'artsy\' in the worst sense.

It has the most artistic visuals I've ever seen in an anime, and by miles at that. The soundtrack doesn't fall short either, as it has a full OST despite only being a 30 min OVA, and a fantastic one at that.Despite its complete lack of concrete characters or storyline, it manages anyway....The art itself is the story. It captivates you and draws you in. Even if noone tells you what is going on specifically, you somehow understand it anyway.This was by far the best OVA I've ever seen, and one of the most memorable anime I can think of.

In Iblard Jikan you’ll experience a magical journey, as you look through a canvas, because this particular and unique anime seems very much like an exquisite exhibition taken from an art gallery. In here, you will see, photogram by photogram, a vast new planet and, inside its whole, an immensity of worlds lost through space and time. From forgotten floating islands, flowering fields, futuristic ambiences, antique and decadent villages, and more. In an OVA such as this, in which...there are virtually no conversation or soliloquies, the musical score is a foundation of most importance. The music will guide you comfortably deeper into this imaginary, so attractive; almost irresistible. However, I do believe that this living canvas will only please those who are proper to mind-free at such visionary work. there are virtually no conversation or soliloquies, the musical score is a foundation of most importance.

The best way to describe Iblard Jikan is that it\'s like looking through a window into another world, and getting a brief glimpse of the potential beauty that the world your looking at offers.There isn\'t much to talk about in Iblard Jikan, as there is no real plot or characters to speak of, and there isn\'t really a need for one. The entire short exists just to show a slice of the world it created. What few characters we see are brief cameos by characters from other Ghibli projects that are added into the paintings,...as a way of showing that the world you are watching is alive and there are stories going on even if you don\'t know any of the details.The OVA was released as part of the Ghibli ga Ippai Collection and was directed by Naohisa Inoue. This short takes place in the fantasy world of Iblard, originally depicted in paintings by Inoue, which were inspired by the fantasy sequences of Ghibli\'s Whisper of the Heart. Studio Ghibli produced this short by digitally animating portions of the paintings and integrating original elements into the scenery.There are a total of eight separate segments, each featuring a different painting or landscape, accompanied by an instrumental musical piece, making it feel like it\'s a journey all around the world that it\'s showing to you. The OVA has an original soundtrack composed by Kiyonori Matsuo, all of which match the laid back tone of the artwork. The result is a wonderfully relaxing experience to sit through.Iblard Jikan is the type of media that is hard to give a score to, since it relies only on what the viewer is thinking or feeling. It would be easy to throw around works like ""delightful"" and ""thought provoking"", but this experience can\'t really be summed up by a simple review like this one. And the whole thing is one of those \'love it or hate it\' experiences.It\'s also hard to recommend to everyone since it\'s a 30 minute art piece that\'s simply meant to relax the watcher and bring them into the brief glimpses of the world it presents, but I\'m sure the audience that it was intended for would get exactly what they\'re looking for out of it, as it makes for something nice to put on when you want to just unwind, fall asleep, simply something to have in the background. as a way of showing that the world you are watching is alive and there are stories going on even if you don\'t know any of the details.The OVA was released as part of the Ghibli ga Ippai Collection and was directed by Naohisa Inoue.

One should watch Iblard Jikan with the mindset to study and appreciate as they would in a gallery.Iblard Jikan reminds me of the slideshows left in the background of family gatherings. The T.V is tuned to an instrumental radio station, and you default to a library of backgrounds that came bundled with the attached laptop.The premise of the show is to weave characters into paintings. There are various styles of art that would fit on a canvas. Animation is used sparingly, to move clouds, add people, apply wind.

Naohisa Inoue\'s art is dreamy and his colors are like those of Monet, who I think they referenced here in a shot with waterlilies. Combine that with an imaginary world with lot of plants, big shots and a little sci-fi and you get a very pretty anime.Unfortunately, I think Iblard Jikan is very dragged out. While I was mesmerized the first few minutes, it lasts 30, which wouldn\'t be a problem if the anime wasn\'t just a collection of paintings. You see a pretty scenary with a little...animation for 5-15 seconds , and you pass to another. That\'s it. I\'ll say it again, Iblard Jikan is very pretty. However, without any story or anything else going on, I personally got tired of it quickly. I didn\'t even appreciate the last things cause I was burned out! While I understand this was more of an arthouse film and the story or action wasn\'t the focus, I felt it needed something more.On the other hand, the soundtrack is okay, kinda hit-or-miss. I liked some of the ambient-y songs but others were pretty boring or even silly, like the one with the dude going ""doo doo doo"".I\'m not sure If I\'d recommend Iblard Jikan, maybe watch 1 min of it on Youtube before deciding.

Actually, this is my very first time writing one for MAL, but here we go!I\'ll start by saying this: Iblard Jikan is not for everyone.And I\'m not saying this with an ""elitist"" tone. I\'m saying this with a ""not everyone would like to watch 30 minutes of pretty landscape paintings and soothing songs"" tone.And that\'s okay!Part of why I wanted to write this review - and it won\'t be a long one - is because this short experimental movie from Ghibli is very special to me.It has the power to calm me down and...cheer me up every time.I don\'t know  exactly why. Maybe it\'s the sorta AI crazy paintings and backgrounds or the instrumental music. It just... hits different.If you\'re a fan of art in general, I recommend watching it :)It\'s not a 10 precisely cause I don\'t think anyone could enjoy it or watch it to the end, but it\'s definitely a 9 cause I hold this very dear to my heart <3 cheer me up every time.I don\'t know  exactly why.

At the same time, this is the most sensitive portrayal of reality. If you hadn't seen reality first, then there is nothing to dream about.What is the purpose of life? My answer is, does it matter? Does it matter...where it's all going, when you see such beauty?Sometimes on the subway, in a moment of silence, a moment of eternity, a pause in life, I’d look around at the faces around me and wonder about what kind of life they led, what problems they’re currently dealing with, what their hopes and dreams are, etc. Yet, all those things, all these things that make up one’s life, pause for a moment in the subway car. In taking transportation from one part of their day to the other, they occupy a space in which they’re just conscious.

However the animation is a little underwhelming from what i'm used to.However i'm no art critque so my appreciation is not that developed yet.The story was simple enough to follow along but not that intersting, the hardest thing about getting into this is that there are no spoken lines. It's not a silent film because of the music that accompanies it but the music seemed to almost be the same melody...for 30 minutes, no grandiose type scores like in thumbelina which makes it lacking as this is the only sound you hear for thirty minutes.

Jue Shi Wu Hun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43626/Jue_Shi_Wu_Hun,"[""Peerless Martial Spirit ReviewPeerless Martial Spirit is an objectively bad martial arts cultivation donghua. The synopsis doesn't cover the series at all so I will leave my own experience about the story and characters of Peerless Martial Spirit.Overview - Beginning Synopsis.Our Main character Chen Feng is a young disciple of popular elder Yan Qinyu, however his meridians are sealed and his cultivation advances slower than everyone his age. Naturally, at the age in Episode 1 disciples are expected to reach Rank 1 - stage 6 yet Chen Feng's cultivation halts around Rank 1 - Stage 3.Chen Feng's teacher Yan Qinyu was a highly...respected inner sect elder of the Qian Yuan Sect and was affectionate with another female elder within the outer sect. Due to his righteous personality, past grudges have come to collect their debts with Chen Feng's teacher as Ci She - a heavenly gate 5th stage (Rank 2 Stage 5) cultivator (most likely hired by the Yan family) breaks his cultivation and Yan Qinyu becomes more or less crippled. The young junior elder that had affections with Yan Qinyu left him for dead by replacing his spot in the inner sect and forcing Yan Qinyu and his disciple Chen Feng to the Qian Yuan sect's outskirts. The grudges don't end there, Ci She comes to collect more debt by crippling Chen Feng's dantian being unable to progress from Rank 1 Stage 3. Many more people have grudges that they decide to pay back to Yan Qinyu which lead him to pass away from heavy injuries; despite that he manages to collect a treasure that is sealed inside him capable of curing Chen Feng's cultivation and increasing the rate of cultivation several times the normal rate. Chen Feng takes advantage of this godsend from his late teacher to get revenge on everyone that hurts him and his senior sister Han.Story: 4/10There are many plot holes in this Donghua, characters are born into existence when a random extra mentions the power of the newly existing character or where they hail from. Examples can include the skull sect that everyone fears, the Mayor's alchemy student who flaunts left and right or the never ending disciples of Qian Yuan Sect somehow coming under Elder Su's power. Everyone wants a piece of Chen Feng yet every time he defeats an opponent either an elder or guard steps in to protect the characters from getting killed by Chen Feng and stopping progression.Every time Chen Feng gets stronger he is still treated like trash even when he becomes the Sect patriarch's rising inner disciple. Literally everyone in this series is courting death.Art & Sound: 6/10The donghua is a typical 3D CGI animation with low budget character rigging and low quality polygons. FIght scenes are repetitive and character design for Chen Feng is very poor. His blue robe doesn't suit the story he looks more of a futuristic character from a Sci-Fi series than a cultivation setting.Sound is also average low quality sound effects and character grunting/breathing. The background music and series soundtracks are subpar and not iconic.Character: 4/10Chen Feng is an arrogant overpowered main character that boasts and attracts the wrong crow ds. The romance between him and senior Han is superficial, all of a sudden they become a couple after she wakes up from being clapped in the life or death arena. The character development makes zero sense between them every episode it's either Chen Feng fighting a new person or he finds someone that needs to be saved by him. You can skip 10-20 episodes and still meet back to the original character storyline.In the beginning when Chen Feng collects the Iron blood wolf pups (can't remember the exact naming), they mutate into an egg thanks to the dragon blood but only one egg hatches a mutated beast: Xue Feng. And in episodes 80 to 100, there were no mention of Xue Feng's existence or the other 2 wolf pups. Chen Feng visits the outer sect for supervision in episode 90+ so there would have been an opportunity to see those wolf pups hatched and mature within the time frame he was away in sect tournaments or inner disciple tournament. Instead, the direction of characters becomes more sacrificial, as we are introduced to the Yang family, Su family and Yan family feuds which are more chaotic and don't advance character development in the slightest.Also, when Chen Feng wears a mask to hide that he is buying the breakthrough pills at Xie family auction he wears literally the same clothes he usually does. His iconic blue, black and white clothing is a dead giveaway to others and having his face change from face masks is a lazy character design method of concealment.Enjoyment: 6/10Everyone loves an OPMC series where the main character is underestimated or hides their true powers. This in the sense, is its only appealing characteristic - everything else is a rollercoaster of garbage.

Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi: Kioku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20423/Kamisama_no_Inai_Nichiyoubi__Kioku,"['This is my first (and short) review.The special for Kamisami no Inai Nichiyoubi is split into three short episodes. The first short episode is a typical onsen (hot spring) scene. As obvious, there is fan service, both males and females. The second short episode shows Alice/Alis recalling his actions (main series spoilers not shown) and then encountering Hampnie. The final short episode shows how Hampnie first met with Hana.The stories are interesting to follow, but the way they are portrayed from start to end is awkward - jumping from a cheerful story to a serious dramatic story. The first episode would only appeal as fan-service,...well as the other two episodes appeal as stories with development. It would be better if these short stories can be separated into three individual OVAs. Anyway, the special is optional to watch.To put the stories in chronological order, the first episode takes place during the last arc of the main series, the second episode probably taking place after ""the actions"" Alice did, hence the last arc as well, and the third episode takes place during the first arc, second episode to be exact.The art style is okay, but not really much appealing.But although the downsides of the special, I enjoyed it as much as the main series. well as the other two episodes appeal as stories with development.

First, they can work as a means to promote a story or series to encourage viewers, or as a way to conclude a series and offer proper closure with an unsatisfied audience, if any. Second, they may hint at a possible continuation of a series. And third, it always works as an excuse for catering. Whether it be fanservice, or that much requested manga chapter that didn\'t make it to the ""big screen"" - there is always room for catering. Or, ultimately, as a means to make more money. But let\'s put aside these realities...for a bit for the sake of this post.The Sunday Without God Special promotes a total of three mini-episodes which, all together, make it episode 13. So in order to understand the episode, you should probably watch the anime beforehand.Impressions:In the spirit of all things great about Specials and OVAs, episode 13\'s first ""mini-episode"" offered a lot of fanservice, for the simple sake of fanservice - taking place around the third arc of the anime. Segments two and three catered to an audience who enjoys a little more development. Also taking place in the third arc of the series, it captures Alice recalling an encounter with Hampnie, while the third segment focuses on Hampnie\'s memory of how he met Hana - most probably taking place during the first arc of the anime.

So in order to understand the episode, you should probably watch the anime beforehand.Impressions:In the spirit of all things great about Specials and OVAs, episode 13\'s first ""mini-episode"" offered a lot of fanservice, for the simple sake of fanservice - taking place around the third arc of the anime. Segments two and three catered to an audience who enjoys a little more development. Also taking place in the third arc of the series, it captures Alice recalling an encounter with Hampnie, while the third segment focuses on Hampnie\'s memory of how he met Hana - most probably taking place during the first arc of the anime.

I mean everything is unique, the storyline, the characters, even the animation! This anime can be greatly appreciated by comedy lovers and users who have a passion for let's say 'crazed' storylines. But be warned, most of the comedy in this one are 'dirty', in other words related to sex, and are just weird. Compared to other comedy/gag anime out there this has to be the best.Now let's take a deeper look at the sound and animation since we identified most of the other areas. I would give the sound a 9/10, since...the OSTs, particularly the opening and ending themes were very funny to listen to and they suited this type of gag anime. The art on the other hand was OUTSTANDING, (yes I have to say it caps) since it is so well done and it stands out from other typical artworks. Describing the artwork using words is hard so I'll use weird words like 'crisp' and 'clean' to describe it.The comedy really had me going there throughout the anime. Its really the king of gags.

The characters look, sound, and act like the characters in SZS. The animation, soundtrack, sound effects are all similar for obvious reasons.  The quirky randomness is the same. The way the story seems to take place at school, but the characters meet around town and engage in silliness is the same.But as stated earlier, it's a prototype....As you watch, you can tell Kette ni Kaizou is less mature and sophisticated than SZS. The former has less social commentary(though it does happen occasionally) and replaces it with ridiculousness, sexual jokes, and general being over the top.Since these connections are so clear, they are constantly in your mind as you watch. I'm sure this was done intentionally to ride on SZS's popularity but that's what's holding it back. It doesn't have it's own identity, and will always be overshadowed by it's better and more successful older(or younger depending on how you look at it) brother.

Honestly this one is pretty wacky and I missed out on a lot of the jokes. This ones might be a bit challenging for people who are not aware of Japanese culture.There really isn't a story. Our story revolves around club full of weirdos who spend most of the anime being weird in some way. That' the best I can do to summarize it. The anime is skit based, which means it runs through a small joke or idea then moves onto the next idea. Each episode generally contains...two or more skits. At the start of the anime I couldn't stop laughing, the pool episode had me in stitches for awhile. However about episode 4 out of 6 I had a hard time following the action and ultimately enjoyed the anime a little less.The art is done by shaft so it is obviously the best it can be. The soundtrack was decent, nothing really to write home about.The characters were fun and made the comedy crazy and fun. Katsu, Kaizou is our main male lead. Kaizou believes he is a cyborg and must fight random beings. He has all kinds of delusions and odd friends that you meet through the show. Natori, Umi is some kind crazy girl that loves pain and death. She is so odd that she often is banned from activities and areas because of how she acts. Tsubouchi, Chitan is Kaizou's underling, and is there purely to be used as a punching bag. Saien, Suzu is the cool headed doctor girl who is supposed to build and upgrade Kaizou. There are some characters that we see every now and then but mostly this is the group you will see every episode.I enjoyed this anime a lot. I wish it was a bit longer so they could have gone into the characters. When you stop being apart of the jokes it lost a little charm, because the jokes were the primary focus. That's about all you can say about this anime I think. Its pretty funny and it only has 6 episodes so give it a watch. two or more skits.

It was how I came across it and while it did color my expectations to a fair degree,  the show is...still enjoyable and immensely familiar as it morphs into proto-SZS. Shaft's attention to detail is to be commended. Everything from the character designs, to the backgrounds, animations, even Kumeta's in-universe depiction (going from a normal mangaka to some bitter loser), all gradually evolve elegantly from its initial dick joke-ridden chaotic mess into something more focused or at the very least more consistent with Shaft's adaptation of SZS. The style of the last 2 episodes especially don't look out of place from the rest of the SZS series, what with the freeze-frame gags, the spoken sound effects, and the obsession with lists. Umi's transformation from the tsukkomi to proto-Chiri is hilarious and really fitting.I know I mention SZS a lot in this review, but honestly it can't be helped. If you were to watch this on its own it would still be enjoyable, but you wouldn't understand why Shaft would have given this otherwise forgotten manga a short adaptation.

The characters were quirky and the situations were absurd, which is just what any comedy of this type needs to be succesful or at the very least enjoyable. It was immediately apparent as soon as I watched the very first episodes that I was wrong.Kill me baby is the kind of series that sets a ridiculous premise and then never lives up to it, the kind of comedy that presents itself as completely demented and over-the-top but...never leaves the comfort zone of character-based jokes, the kind of experience that hypes itself to stardom but settles for mediocrity instead - It simply doesn\'t have enough to push the show forward.The ridiculous premise quickly degenerates into a mere gimmick due to sheer repetition of the same trite, formulaic jokes. They all play out the same way: Yasuna does something silly, she gets knocked out by the annoyed Sonya the assassin, while Agiri the ninja does something random, if she is around while that happens… you can generally predict how the joke plays out before it even starts, which is exactly as exciting as it sounds.But beyond that, three characters are simply not enough to carry a comedy show for twelve full-length episodes. Any succesful comedy series I can think of – let\'s say Azumanga Daioh – had a diverse enough set of side characters that prevented the show from reaching the point of stalemate and kept the show relatively fresh despite the length.At this point I wonder how Kill me Baby would have fared if it was a 3-minutes short series… as a friend of mine commented on the series: “it was tolerable back when I watched it weekly”, which is something I can honestly believe, as from my experience, the more often I watched an episode of Kill me Baby, the harder it was to pull through it and by applying that rule on a more abstract level, then you\'re better off not watching it at all. The opening track, ""Kill Me Baby"", arguably the worst opening song for a show of all time pretty much represents the show as a whole - weird at first,  annoying and repetitive after you hear it once.

Stay away.', 'Kill Me Baby is one interesting anime to watch and to review, but particularly to evolve with the characters and how you relate to their presence on each episode and the show in general, which makes it sort of slow started, but ends up being an endearing 4-koma. So, here we go:Story - 6Look at it however you want, this is, at the end of the day, just another slapstick show about wacky schoolgirls. The story isn\'t anything special, and, at first it doesn\'t even seem to have a story per se. However it\'s not the same as saying it\'s a bad thing, because on...this sort of shows, the focus isn\'t the story, and it\'s more about providing a background where the characters can show what they\'re worth at making us spend a good 20 mins each week.Art - 6Not a masterpiece of detail and fluid overwhelming animation, but again, it\'s a show that doesn\'t demand such a thing, it\'s just, right for what the concept of KMB really is. The designs are very simple, the backgrounds have that borderline children anime watercolor innocence to it, but overall, the characters are very cute and expressive, and look chibi.Sound - 7After an OP that sounds so irritating at the first 2 episodes but ends up getting unavoidable to listen to each week, and after an ED that was awesome since the first day i heard it and even became a popular track for remixes and loops on the internet, what\'s left to mention is the good job that was done on how the sound carries many of the logic and punch lines behind a huge variety of the hilarious skits along the show. In the end, while the quality of the sound isn\'t anything of intricate quality, we see a show where the sound plays as much of a role to make things funny as the visuals do.Character - 8We have 2 main characters: blonde assassin/student from Russia, Sonya, and short/brown haired airhead Yasuna. Sonya keeps feeling bothered about Yasuna\'s uncanny will to be friends, and have fun together, and she often comes out as being an impossible to like character due to her cruelty, but which is an interesting approach on a girl which is supposed to be a cold blooded assassin. Yasuna starts the show as the merely annoying dumb girl who always ends up being a victim despite wanting to be friends so badly, however the same insistence of her that feels a bit annoying for how dumb and masochistic it seems early in the show, ends up making Yasuna an endearing character with a simple mind but a huge heart, as she always worried about Sonya and tries to straighten her way out of murderous jobs. These characters are enveloped in an actually touching undertone which never falls off from the humour priority of KMB, but is felt through each time we see Yasuna fall innocently, climaxing in the last episode which, without spoiling, actually made me cry. As the series approach an ending, i couldn\'t get enough of Yasuna\'s voice acting and preciousness and even Sonya managed to become somewhat likeable as she\'s slowly softened up (but not much) by her loyal classmate. Given that ""Character"" was the stat i gave a better rating, it\'s getting a bit long, but i shall hurry it up with the 3rd main/support character, and perhaps the most popular of the whole show given that many people couldn\'t see beyond Yasuna\'s early annoying masochistic antics, Agiri-san simply had, i believe, no defects (perhaps the only problem was not giving her enough air time). Agiri-san is complicated to describe, with a presence and voice that are as feeble as they are powerful, like a drowzee but aware, airheaded but smart or talented but effortless character, she was purely awesome and with a voice as memorable as Yasuna\'s (except, i believe most people felt captivated by Agiri from her very first appearance) and was one of the driving reasons i waited eagerly for the next episode. Always linked to wacky unexpectedly justifiable ninja techniques with a twist, Agiri often appeared as a random element of surprise, to help out Yasuna and Sonya\'s troubles or to aid the scenes that otherwise could become too dull.There\'s a 4th character that appears only on about 3 or 4 scenes and the OP, a character that seems pointless, she has no name, and her purpose in appearing is the simple joke (i believe that\'s the joke) that she\'s useless and never noticed.Enjoyment - 7This was a show that needed your patience to win your heart because, i understand that, other than Agiri-san, it\'s not very compelling from the start, until Yasuna\'s voice and attitude get deep into your head and you get to hope Sonya\'s ice might be eventually melted somehow. Some early episodes had plenty of dry and dull jokes as well as some drink spilling hilarious ones, whoever with a not very favourable ratio between the two. Overall it does get much better with time because you get to know and antecipate the characters and the type of puns more and more. Personally, early on, i thought i\'d end up giving a 6 at best, to this show, but i ended up connecting to the characters more than i imagined, and even got emotional in the last ep. Check it out sometime! this sort of shows, the focus isn\'t the story, and it\'s more about providing a background where the characters can show what they\'re worth at making us spend a good 20 mins each week.Art - 6Not a masterpiece of detail and fluid overwhelming animation, but again, it\'s a show that doesn\'t demand such a thing, it\'s just, right for what the concept of KMB really is.

Given that ""Character"" was the stat i gave a better rating, it\'s getting a bit long, but i shall hurry it up with the 3rd main/support character, and perhaps the most popular of the whole show given that many people couldn\'t see beyond Yasuna\'s early annoying masochistic antics, Agiri-san simply had, i believe, no defects (perhaps the only problem was not giving her enough air time). Agiri-san is complicated to describe, with a presence and voice that are as feeble as they are powerful, like a drowzee but aware, airheaded but smart or talented but effortless character, she was purely awesome and with a voice as memorable as Yasuna\'s (except, i believe most people felt captivated by Agiri from her very first appearance) and was one of the driving reasons i waited eagerly for the next episode. Always linked to wacky unexpectedly justifiable ninja techniques with a twist, Agiri often appeared as a random element of surprise, to help out Yasuna and Sonya\'s troubles or to aid the scenes that otherwise could become too dull.There\'s a 4th character that appears only on about 3 or 4 scenes and the OP, a character that seems pointless, she has no name, and her purpose in appearing is the simple joke (i believe that\'s the joke) that she\'s useless and never noticed.Enjoyment - 7This was a show that needed your patience to win your heart because, i understand that, other than Agiri-san, it\'s not very compelling from the start, until Yasuna\'s voice and attitude get deep into your head and you get to hope Sonya\'s ice might be eventually melted somehow. Some early episodes had plenty of dry and dull jokes as well as some drink spilling hilarious ones, whoever with a not very favourable ratio between the two. Overall it does get much better with time because you get to know and antecipate the characters and the type of puns more and more. Personally, early on, i thought i\'d end up giving a 6 at best, to this show, but i ended up connecting to the characters more than i imagined, and even got emotional in the last ep. Check it out sometime!', ""Comedy is probably - no, it IS the most subjective genre in any kind of artistic entertainment. Writing a review for this kind of anime for isn't an easy task, as it can easily contain many personal opinions from the writer. As such, this review will mainly focus in the parts that don't need to be of the likes of the viewer in order to be rated positively or negatively.While the main story ain't something bad, the main problem is that it ain't something new at all. We have our main funny-stupid highschool girl, a serious-antifun girl and a ... ninja. That said, being a...random comedy, it follows the everyday life of the girls and the random things that happens to them while in the school and outside of it. It's very easy to notice that many other anime have done this before, let's take Nichijou and Minami-ke for example.In this we can also put the character aspects, since they're almost the same for this kind of anime, having the same development but with differents designs and names. (Design's ain't that different, though)However as I said at the start, this does not make an anime bad, but plots like this being repeated all over again can be kinda annoying and generic.The art also differs a bit from other animes, being very simple and moe-like, though not bad at all. It reflects the random, childish and un-serious nature of the series. The animation is consistent, with some unrealistic moves at times, but nothing to be afraid of looking at.In the sound department, it is actually good. While most of the scenes are run by only character's voices, short music pieces are put inbetween comedic scenes giving it a child-like ambient. The sound effects are also nice overall, and add to the easy-taking ambient of this anime.As I said at the start of this review, being a comedy, the Enjoyment part is something that will vary a lot from one to another. Jokes and entertainment ain't something everybody shares, and as such, giving it a rate is merely subjective. For me, I gave it a 9 as of episode 2, as it made me laugh way more than the first episode.Kill me Baby is far from being a bad anime, but it isn't something new nor something really good to be noteworthy of. Don't expect anything serious, as it is very childish and easy-digesting.

The series that used stereotypical characters to represent countries and got WAY more popular in the US than it actually deserved? Imagine you took the characters Italy, Germany, and Japan and put them in a highschool by themselves. Now keep the dynamic and everything about the characters the same only change them from male to female. Lastly get rid of the few fragments of history Hetalia actually had. That is Kill me Baby!Plot and characters: 2/10There really isn\'t a plot. It is just random shenanigans and the airhead Yasuna (Italy) annoying the short fused ""assassin"" Sonya (Germany). Sometimes the mysterious Agiri(Japan) shows up,...but she doesn\'t really add much. Hetalia wasn\'t very funny or well written in the first place, but it had highly talented voice actors for the English dub. They could simply yell stupid shit and it would be funny. Unfortunately, this series has voice actors who just don\'t give a shit! They don\'t want to work on this series any more than the viewer wants to watch it! It would have at least had a few laughs if it had Patrick Seitz screaming in his terrible German accent.Animation: 2/10It is the same moe style animation that Hetalia used with cutesy character designs and very little background art detail or animation budget.Sound: 1/10The soundtrack gave me an ulcer.Enjoyment: 2/10I think it may have had 1 scene that was sort of funny. This was based on a 4 panel Newspaper manga where there is only time to set up a quick and simple joke each week similar to Garfield or Dilbert. It can be quite challenging to adapt an anime from that kind of format, although Azumanga Daioh pulled it off.Overall: 2/10This is one of those lousy anime that follow in the wake of a popular series and try to rip it off to make a quick dollar. Whenever a blockbuster movie is released, some terrible company like The Assylum or Full Moon will make a cheap ripoff like Snakes on a Train. This is like the Assylum ripoff of Axis Powers Hetalia.

One of those shows was Ren & Stimpy. Now part of my rewatching these shows was to evaluate if they held up over time, some did and some didn\'t as you might imagine and unfortunately Ren & Stimpy didn\'t really hold up in reality like it did in my fond childhood memories. It lacked a lot of the humor, characterization and was more annoying than entertaining in hindsight than I would have thought had I not rewatched it. Now let\'s imagine for a second this review is...about that show and not about Kill Me Baby and this site is for American cartoons. There are three easy defenses a person can make for Kill- I mean Ren & Stimpy:1. It\'s a comedy/ It\'s not serious it\'s supposed to be funny!2. It\'s a show for Kids! Geez lighten up.3. It\'s deeper than you think, you don\'t understand the show or don\'t know enough about the genre!I can see why some people might be inclined to immediately offer some of these arguments especially the second one in terms of a defense for media like this. I just don\'t really see most of them as a viable defense of either show upon further scrutiny.The thing about comedy is and I know this is going to be a ground breaking thought... It has to be funny. The problem is I just don\'t really find anything in this show funny. The situations they get in aren\'t well crafted jokes, they aren\'t jokes based off well established characters or a setting within the show, they aren\'t parodying a specific genre of anime or something else and they don\'t really offer anything of substance aside from these extremely obvious ways you can milk comedy. Even the randomness and the absurdity of the show seems anti-humor as it constantly negates the somewhat unique on paper premise of the show and mires it in constant cliches and ordinary situations. At least Ren & Stimpy could sometimes pull a laugh with it\'s random humor, Log Log Log. About the only joke I found funny in this is the constant uselessness of the ""ninja"" character, because it gave me a small pretense of consistent character and a running gag. Pretty much everything else fell flat in terms of comedy. I think I should further emphasize the fact that the show really does not do anything good with it\'s initial premise, it seems like it would be rather easy to think up comedic situations that revolve around an assassin doing everyday things, but the show seems almost determined to not do anything funny with this idea. I\'ve seen non-comedy shows have more humor around a serious subject like this, than I did in this ""comedy"" show. Now even with all that going wrong they might have been able to find a joke in the unrelated to the premise situations that they do depict, but the show seems inept at even doing that. I\'d like to be able to say ""I can see how someone else can enjoy this but I just personally cant,"" or some kind of fair statement to that effect but I just cant really, nor do I want to imagine the grown-up person who finds any of this funny or enjoyable.Which leads me to that second defense, in the case of Ren & Stimpy I do believe the creators of the show originally intended it to be for kids, so fair enough for them on this one I guess, but at least here in the west the only people I have ever seen talk about Kill Me Baby is teens and adults. The premise of the show regardless of whether they take advantage of it or not, seems to exclude children as an audience as I\'m not sure how funny kids are supposed to find an assassin being in a school doing ordinary things. Now you can say this isn\'t the shows fault, I\'ve seen some bad marketing for shows in various regions, for some reason in my area of America, One Punch Man is being marketed to extremely young kids, even though I think the premise of the show and it\'s main ""gag"" would go right over their little heads as they haven\'t really seen what it is supposed to be a parody of. Nothing about Kill Me Baby seems especially conducive or appealing to children in a similar manner and as such I just don\'t really accept this as a defense. I guess you can say it\'s art style is childish, but I\'d just call it bad. As a staple of bad Animation, every three episodes or so you get a few creative shots, but on a whole it just looks bad and unappealing.One of the main reasons I wanted to compare this show to Ren and Stimpy was I think the two main characters have a vary similar dynamic. Ren is the straight man who has a violent streak towards his friend, but is usually the grounded one in most situations unless they try to do a ""comedic"" heel turn and have him be wrong about something in favor of Stimpy being right. Stimpy is an annoying grotesque dummy who is constantly annoying and wrong about everything and this is supposed to be balanced out by small moments of charm where Stimpy seems like the nicer one. Sonya is basically Ren and Yasuna is basically Stimpy, but the dynamic is slightly more lopsided in that Sonya seems more grounded in reality than Ren and Yasuna is the worst character ever conceived of by a human. Now some people might think I\'m exaggerating a bit but the annoyingness of the Yasuna character honestly almost broke me mentally and physically and I almost quit watching this show several times. Now this is where the defenders of the show might say ""Yeah but she is supposed to be annoying!"" Well this is where I\'ll say that sometimes you can succeed a little too much in the bad traits of a character. To now reference another thing I\'m sure no one on this site cares about, a few years ago I watched the horror movie ""The Babadook."" On a technical level I thought the movie was pretty good and there was even a lot of good to say about the story and general metaphorical arc of the movie, the problem with this movie though and the reason I\'ll probably never watch it again despite it\'s accomplishments in most cinematic areas is the fact that a lot of the movie is filled with a kid being as annoying and needy as possible to his single and already stressed mother. Now similar to Kill Me Baby this kid was supposed to be annoying in fact I\'d say it was a key part of the plot and his characterization and the young actor deserves a lot of credit for his acting at his age, but he was too convincing at being annoying to the point that it transcended the movie and just started annoying me in real life. Kill Me Baby has a similar problem, I stopped caring that Sonya was annoyed because I was annoyed by Yasuna near constantly. Annoyance is something that needs balance in something like this, you want to do it enough that it\'s convincing to the situation the characters are in, but if you do it too much it\'s just starts actually annoying people. I would say Yasuna is the single worst aspect of the show and taking her out would improve it by about a thousand or so notches. I mean it still wouldn\'t be funny and enjoyable, but at least I wouldn\'t have to hear her voice for another second.Lets examine the last defense now, the ""you just don\'t get it defense."" Well despite people saying this I didn\'t see anything particularly deep or meaningful about this show, nor was there any kind of meta-commentary within about anime as a genre or specific anime sub-genres. I think parodying something or doing a meta-commentary might give us too much easy humor to milk and the last thing this show ever seems to want you to do is laugh. It doesn\'t really touch upon any themes or broad ideas within it\'s subject matter. It doesn\'t even aim for the typical cliches a show might aim for like this in Anime like ""Yasuna just wants too cool for school work oriented Japanese people to enjoy life."" It cant even rise up to the level of tired cliches of that nature. At the end of day, I can give a million other examinations, refutations, observations and intellectual masturbation\'s about this show and some guy can come along and say ""you still don\'t le get it."" I can offer that as a defense of almost anything bad in media that has even the slightest bit of information to make murky peoples attempts to decipher it. I\'ll go one further though and say I don\'t even really care if I ""got"" this show and it\'s supposed depth or not, on a surface level it is bad enough for me to just dismiss any kind of perceived depth that might exist within it\'s horridly annoying innards.This show is the equivalent of having a person poking you in the ear and eyes with a sharp stick and every time you show the mildest amounts of displeasure, a neckbeardian to the side of you constantly tells you to just to enjoy it.

Well, I just cant. Happy Happy Joy Joy.', ""Kill me Baby is a slice of life comedy from 2012. It's based on an ongoing manga by Kaduho that started in 2008 and the anime was adapted by J.C. Staff. They're not exactly strangers to either slice of life or comedic works, having also done such anime as Azumanga Daioh, Hachimitsu to Clover, Potemayo, Love Stage & Nodame Cantabile. So, given that history, the worst we can expect is sub-par and the best is excellent. Then again, they could always hit a new low or high. Let's examine the series and see how it compares.Story:Yasuna is an ordinary student. Her best friend, Sonya,...is an assassin. The two of them go to school and spend a lot of time together. This results in all kinds shenanigans. So, this is essentially a school comedy where the twist is that one of the characters is an assassin.The humour is based around a blend of quirky character comedy and physical humour. The biggest flaw with the comedy is definitely that some of the pay offs are really obvious. For example, there's a joke where Yasuna is telling Sonya to treat her like a dog and asks to be given a command. The first command you'd guess is probably the exact one that gets given. There are other jokes like that but, in all fairness to the series, most of them only partly rely on the pay off while partly relying on the character reactions for the humour and the reactions are usually pretty funny. The humour, in general, works quite well. The physical comedy is kind of reminiscent of the physical comedy in Azumanga Daioh. The school comedy is a bit more similar to A-Channel with every episode containing short comedic moments, usually only thinly connected to each other, broken up by transitions. In general, it is entertaining and funny stuff.Where the assassin gimmick pays off is that it allows for some different scenarios than you would normally get in this type of anime and some responses that are unique. It gives the series its own sense of identity as opposed to the usual “group of high school girls doing every day things in a quirky fashion.” Of course, different isn't necessarily good and there are certainly times when the humour here doesn't work. In addition to the aforementioned obvious jokes there are times when the physical humour goes a bit too far and crosses the line into being a bit uncomfortable. At least it doesn't take the physical humour anywhere close to the degree that Bokusatsu Tenshi did.In terms of non-comedic elements, the transitions are awful. Every episode has multiple transition screens where the lines “kill me baby” & “baby please kill me” will be spoken before moving on. It's not even the length of them that's the issue so much as it is that they're annoying. I do have to give the series some credit as well. The ending does have a fairly sweet moment that really works.Characters:This series is also different from the usual school comedy in that the cast of characters is pretty small. We have our two major characters, Yasuna and Sonya. We also have Agiri, a ninja and Unusued character, a girl who shows up on rare occasions and never interacts with the other three. The interactions between Yasuna and Sonya are a bit reminiscent of those betwixt Yomi & Tomo from Azumanga. Yasuna is the high energy, crazy one who gets into all kinds of trouble while Sonya is the more subdued one who gets dragged into the mess. Agiri is more a really laid back character who actively trolls the other two while Unused character just really wants to get involved in things but can never manage it. For comedic purposes, it works pretty well but it can be a bit much at times. Here's the thing,  when you've got a really high energy character in a comedic work they can be great, but you start to grow a bit weary of their hijinks when you don't get a break from them. With Azumanga, they gave you that break by having segments that focused on other characters. You don't get that here since Yasuna and Sonya are there constantly.Art:Kill Me Baby uses even more basic art than a lot of slice of life anime. The background characters are largely indistinct white blobs. The backgrounds themselves frequently look very basic and bland. The character designs of those few characters we actually get are based around having very plain bodies with simple heads that are too large for the bodies. The animation is basically functional but nothing great. The best it gets is the dance in the ending theme tune and that's not exactly at the level of the dances from the PreCure franchise.Sound:The big weakness of the acting comes during the transitions. Every time they say the line “Baby, please kill me” they try to do it in a different, quirky way and a good ninety percent of the time it turns out to be really annoying. It's like they were trying to judge how bad they could make them before audiences started turning the program off whenever it reached one. Little did they realise that a mute button exists. That being said, our main cast does a good job. Takabe Ai, Akasaki Chinatsu, Tamura Mutsumi & Kugimiya Rie all deliver their lines very well and it really serves to make the comedy work, when the comedic moments are strong. In terms of music, the background music works nicely. I liked the ending theme tune, didn't like the opening. The problem with the opening is that, like with the transitions, it's overly fond of repeating itself and it uses a lot of spoken words. It's less a song and more people talking while loud music plays. The effect is outright obnoxious.Ho-yay:There's quite a bit. Yasuna is very enthusiastic about getting closer to Sonya. She wants them to run along the beach like a couple and there's more than one part where she very blatantly wants Sonya to touch her. I think she might be a masochist looking for Sonya  to “punish” her. I also think Sonya is totally okay with that.Final Thoughts:Kill Me Baby is a pretty entertaining series. There are parts that are too obvious or otherwise don't work but, as a whole, it's bloody funny and the twist of having an assassin character does work in its favour. In the end, I give it a solid 7/10. It's a good series, in spite of its flaws. Next week I'll move on to a request I've been working at for a while, Hunter x Hunter 2011. is an assassin. The two of them go to school and spend a lot of time together. This results in all kinds shenanigans. So, this is essentially a school comedy where the twist is that one of the characters is an assassin.The humour is based around a blend of quirky character comedy and physical humour. The biggest flaw with the comedy is definitely that some of the pay offs are really obvious. For example, there's a joke where Yasuna is telling Sonya to treat her like a dog and asks to be given a command. The first command you'd guess is probably the exact one that gets given. There are other jokes like that but, in all fairness to the series, most of them only partly rely on the pay off while partly relying on the character reactions for the humour and the reactions are usually pretty funny. The humour, in general, works quite well. The physical comedy is kind of reminiscent of the physical comedy in Azumanga Daioh. The school comedy is a bit more similar to A-Channel with every episode containing short comedic moments, usually only thinly connected to each other, broken up by transitions. In general, it is entertaining and funny stuff.Where the assassin gimmick pays off is that it allows for some different scenarios than you would normally get in this type of anime and some responses that are unique. It gives the series its own sense of identity as opposed to the usual “group of high school girls doing every day things in a quirky fashion.” Of course, different isn't necessarily good and there are certainly times when the humour here doesn't work. In addition to the aforementioned obvious jokes there are times when the physical humour goes a bit too far and crosses the line into being a bit uncomfortable. At least it doesn't take the physical humour anywhere close to the degree that Bokusatsu Tenshi did.In terms of non-comedic elements, the transitions are awful. Every episode has multiple transition screens where the lines “kill me baby” & “baby please kill me” will be spoken before moving on. It's not even the length of them that's the issue so much as it is that they're annoying. I do have to give the series some credit as well. The ending does have a fairly sweet moment that really works.Characters:This series is also different from the usual school comedy in that the cast of characters is pretty small. We have our two major characters, Yasuna and Sonya. We also have Agiri, a ninja and Unusued character, a girl who shows up on rare occasions and never interacts with the other three. The interactions between Yasuna and Sonya are a bit reminiscent of those betwixt Yomi & Tomo from Azumanga. Yasuna is the high energy, crazy one who gets into all kinds of trouble while Sonya is the more subdued one who gets dragged into the mess. Agiri is more a really laid back character who actively trolls the other two while Unused character just really wants to get involved in things but can never manage it.

After watching it, I have a few things of note to say about it.I'll start with the cons because I'd like to end on a good note.While the art style for the characters is very cute, the actual art itself is lacking.  There are quite a few scenes where the background looks like a sketch that was never completed.  Sometimes the background is in black and white even.Characters are not very interesting to me. Oribe is delightfully adorable, and so is Sonya at...times, but overall they aren't really interesting.Probably the worst part about the show is that the comedy is really lacking.  Most of the jokes are pretty much the same as others, and it is the reason so many people dislike this anime.  Any laughing is going to come from the deliverance of the jokes (I'll note on this again), not how clever or funny the jokes actually are.Now for the pros, which I believe outweigh the cons.The art style is god damn adorable.  Oribe and Sonya are so cute together! So is Agiri!  I can't get over how cute this anime is.Secondly, this anime is just a great time. Even if the jokes aren't great, there isn't anything about watching it that isn't fun.  I really had fun watching this.THE MUSIC.  My lord the OST for this anime is really good.  The OP and ED more than anything are so fun(ny).The best thing about this anime is the voice acting.  Holy shit it is really, REALLY good.  You can tell from the OP that the voice actors fit the characters so well.  All of the voice acting here is so well done that sometimes it makes the jokes funny.  Oribe has a particularly adorable voice, and without it I would not have enjoyed the show as much.  In my opinion, the VA carry this anime.So overall the show is a lot of fun, but it isn't fantastic.  A lot is lacking in the comedy department, but I think the voice acting carries this anime enough for me to recommend it.

Its a random anime!Kill me baby is a short 13 episode Anime made by J.C. Staff during spring of 2012.If you want a random anime that doesnt take it self seriously then this is the anime for you.Content-The anime contains 13 episode along with several short speical episodes that count as one episode itself (OVA).As far as the genre it its a comedic slice of life that can get very random and will not feature a plot whatsoever,instead it uses the basic settings it gives the viewers as the base for the each...episode.This is also a SFW anime with mild cartoonish violence and little to no swearing. The whole anime itself reminds me of saturday morning cartoons,simple and fun to watch.Plot- The anime itself doesnt really have a plot,think of it as the simspons or a comedic sitcom,where it uses the basic settings of the show to make every episode possible.With that being said the setting its a typical high school with two main characters who fit the typical 90s cartoon style AKA the cheerful, and dimwitted character(yasuna) along side with the grumpy,and smart character(sonya).This works for this kind of anime,because it doesnt take it self seriously in anyway,if the anime was a plot driven, realstic drama then yes it would fail.Yasuna is the main character here,she is the typical high school girl..well she is unique by being being silly and loud,while sonya the blonde haired girl is a hitman who happens to attend school,obviosuly this anime just pokes fun at the ideas and never gets serious,you will never see a gun being pulled or anyone get killed,so the anime knows its limits.Yasuna often bugs sonya with any little thing she can come up with,such as playing hide and seek or playing a word game.This is where the anime often gets it punchlines from,where it always ends up as sonya being fed up and ends up hurting yasuna,followed by the classic quote of “sonya you’re so mean waaaa” There is also a ninja character who is really just another high school girl being a troll and messing around,often tricking yasuna and sonya with her magic tricks(illusions) many people say she makes the anime what it is,and i agree with that,she is an excellent character all on her own.Then we have unused character,i have no idea why is she even in the anime,she is useless.The creators barely give her screen time,it would have been nice if she became a main character as well and she redeems her self..but it doesnt happen.Music/voice-  The music is pretty simple and goes along well with the cheerful nature of this anime,and includes many japanese elements as well which is a plus. The opening song is pretty cute and well done as it includes the voices from the anime,while the end credits have a catchy dance music which is enjoyable as wel.Now this may be a surprise but i recommend watching this in english DUB,the voices are very well done.the voice acting is never monotone and the english voices sound very similar to the japanese ones,so if you enjoy watching animes dubbed then go for it.The english voice helped put the nail on the coffin for giving me that old comedic cartoon vibe.Animation/Art- this is a comedic anime,so perhaps the best animation isnt needed but it looks cheap and old,and for a short anime they could of done better…again its just a comedic anime so it doesnt nessarily need it.The art style is cute and goes well with the cheerful nature of the anime,reminds me of lucky star and yuyushiki.Appeal- This anime is only around a year old,but the anime has been well recevied by viewers and parodies such as the end credit’s dancing was done in yuru yuri so the appeal is there,and it is a likeable anime without a doubt.Final opinion -Kill me baby was a very enjoyable anime,filled with laughs and heart warming moments.However the main problem with the anime is the randomness it contains.At times the anime may have a hilarious episode while the next one may be dull and have too many missed jokes.it feels as if they tried a new idea every episode which isnt so bad,but at the same time i just wanted to skip an entire episode.Also i know this anime isnt serious but it was hard to beleive that sonya would even be yasuna’s friend after all the things she does to her(teases her way too much) other than that this anime was funny and cute so i recomemnd this for slice of life fans and ones who like random funny animes.Hope you enjoy this reviewArigatou ^_^ episode.This is also a SFW anime with mild cartoonish violence and little to no swearing.

Since it is merely an animation aimed at bringing 4-koma gags to life on the screens of the audience, its budget is a fraction of major shows that focus on graphical excellence, deep and intriguing plotlines, and of course character development that is well fleshed out.Nevertheless, Kill Me Baby is an anime that competently makes use of the meagre budget as well as handling the transition from 4-koma gags to an anime reasonably well. Considering that it is a comedy show, and as such aimed towards squeezing a laugh out of every person who watches it,...I have to admit that KmB does a good job in that respect, but is essentially a rather flat piece of work in all other respects. However, I should clarify that that is through no fault of the anime itself.4-koma gags do not make for a good story that can carry an anime throughout its airing. Based on its source material, we can safely conclude that KmB is not a series that attempts to develop that. It is basically a succession of animated material that is just slapped together and packaged as an anime. However, its main selling point is of course, hilarity. And I can guarantee you, hilarity definitely ensues. That being said, the anime does not have any semblance of continuity and parts of it do not make sense at all to the casual viewer. This again can be attributed to the nature of the source material. If I were to judge KmB while taking that into account, I would say that KmB is actually a game attempt by the studio to create a good anime. Not ""good"" in the sense of thought-provoking, loaded with heart-aching drama or having bucketfuls of fanservice, but rather that it achieves what it sets out to accomplish, which is to brighten up someone\'s day.Hmm... art. Now, the art of KmB is flat. Very flat. The show looks like something drawn by the moderately talented preschooler. However, one needs to remember that the show does not have excessive budget on which to blow on those gorgeous, brilliant graphics that cause people to stare, mesmerised at the screen. Thus, the art being of mediocre standard is actually forgivable in this case.The sound part is definitely mediocre. The same soundtracks are reused so often that by the time I finished the anime I could almost hum all of \'em. Mention weird songs and KmB\'s OP comes to mind. Honestly, I could not make heads nor tails of that song, from the animation to the lyrics. However, I feel that the ED is a significant improvement over the OP, not that it would rank in any charts.I don\'t believe that there\'s any need to talk about the characters in detail. Essentially, we have Yasuna = airhead girl, Sonya = paranoid assassin, Agiri = weird ninja and even an Unused Character just for the heck of it. Strange that they called upon Kugimiya Rie for Unused Character though. Overall, the characters are just there doing silly things for the audience\'s enjoyment. The voice actors were decent and were able to effectively convey the comical moments so that the mood pervades the audience.Frankly, even though its other aspects were not headed for excellence, KmB really tries very hard in trying to let the audience enjoy it through its funny, hilarious gags. In that, it has succeeded well, in fact exceeding all expectations. The main reason I had for giving KmB my rating was due to me enjoying the series so much and laughing till my sides ached. The hilarious moments will have people literally ROFL.Overall, KmB is still a decent anime. I\'ll say this again: its potential was severely hampered by both the funding and the original source material it had to work with. Despite that, KmB makes the most of its situation. Kudos to the people in charge for managing to eke out a thoroughly enjoyable anime from such limited resources. I\'m giving it a score of 6, mainly because I enjoyed the comedic interaction between the characters as well as the truly funny gags that successfully made the anime a must-watch for people looking for a comedy anime series.

Yasuna is simply adorable, to the point where it\'s like watching a puppy get kicked, over and and over again. If Sonya and Yasuna were a little more two dimensional it would have helped the humor immensely.  It also would have helped if the violence were a little less real and more along the lines of the clearly ridiculous instead of the possible.The same holds true for the art. Kill me baby does a really nice job of Chibi cute. Too bad that actually detracts from the humor after about the third episode.Final rating: It\'s a 4 maybe less.

So now that that is out of way Kill Me Baby is about two 'friends' in a high-school setting so nothing new there, however the characters are a bit odd as one is typical high-school girl while the other is also in the same role but is a assassin as well which leads to funny interactions between the two characters but gets a bit same like if you...binge watch this with it normally starting with first character Yasuna is a normal girl who comes up with a stupid idea and then baits Sonya the assassin into it, and then by the end Sonya has reacted violently beating up Yasuna.Though aside from this I found the jokes to be well though out and played well into each episodes overall 'story' as they made me laugh at least once an episode, which makes whole anime as a whole fun to watch up until the end as there is no real ending or cliffhanger it just stops which I found to not be, all bad but felt unsatisfying by the end.As mentioned before the characters can get a bit boring, due to repetitive humour and boring character designs that even with an additional to characters that are unoriginal though with that in mind, I found characters to be highly likeable as there personalities on one hand were fun to watch, even though they are a typical stereotypes and fairy uninteresting they grow on you as time passes; this is also due to the art direction even though the designs are average; the style is cute and helps mixing in well with the tone of the show, even if the animation is okay at best but similarly the soundtrack used helps immerse you into the shows and has a similar sounding tone.Also relating to cute style there is the Opening and Ending of the show which are really cute and fun to watch though the songs used get annoying  as the show progresses.Overall I believe you should watch this if you want a breather from heavy story anime as this is a relaxing show funny jokes, likeable characters and a cute art style that makes you feel released from high energy shows even though the show runs out of ideas after about 4 episodes and reuses the same ideas over and over again unless you take it slow, in which recommend you watch this every now and then instead of binge watching to get the better experience. binge watch this with it normally starting with first character Yasuna is a normal girl who comes up with a stupid idea and then baits Sonya the assassin into it, and then by the end Sonya has reacted violently beating up Yasuna.Though aside from this I found the jokes to be well though out and played well into each episodes overall 'story' as they made me laugh at least once an episode, which makes whole anime as a whole fun to watch up until the end as there is no real ending or cliffhanger it just stops which I found to not be, all bad but felt unsatisfying by the end.As mentioned before the characters can get a bit boring, due to repetitive humour and boring character designs that even with an additional to characters that are unoriginal though with that in mind, I found characters to be highly likeable as there personalities on one hand were fun to watch, even though they are a typical stereotypes and fairy uninteresting they grow on you as time passes; this is also due to the art direction even though the designs are average; the style is cute and helps mixing in well with the tone of the show, even if the animation is okay at best but similarly the soundtrack used helps immerse you into the shows and has a similar sounding tone.Also relating to cute style there is the Opening and Ending of the show which are really cute and fun to watch though the songs used get annoying  as the show progresses.Overall I believe you should watch this if you want a breather from heavy story anime as this is a relaxing show funny jokes, likeable characters and a cute art style that makes you feel released from high energy shows even though the show runs out of ideas after about 4 episodes and reuses the same ideas over and over again unless you take it slow, in which recommend you watch this every now and then instead of binge watching to get the better experience."", 'Ok, I think there are some people who really need to learn the definition of the word ""context"".Kill Me Baby is a pure comedy series. It never wanted to be something else and it never claimed anything else. It was advertised as such. Just like any other comedy show gets advertised as such and not as a deep Psycological-Horror-Thriller with a Sci-Fi-Twist.There is no continious story going on, cause why the hell should it be. You don\'t criticize shows like the Simpsons for that neither do you?Every episode is seperated in 2-3 different adventures that the main characters have. The humour is a mix of...crazy dialouges and situations combined with a lot of slap stick. Basically the interaction between the characters is the engine of each adventure. But what really puts this COMEDY anime over the top are the three main characters or better yet the three voice actors. The voice actors are doing an amazing job to make these characters sound as whacky as possible and going the extra retarded mile and I mean that in the most positive way. No ""kawai desu"", these characters are flat out savage in their manners, even tho those manners differ from character to character. Also some of the background sounds and noises are made by the three voice actors themselves which adds perfectly to the whackyness of the overall premise of the show.All in all this series is the perfect anime if you just want to relax and forget about your everyday life.

The premise, however, is extremely limited and it shows. It can be argued that this is because it's a 4-koma manga adaptation, but with many studios being able to pull this off and make must see series out of them, it leaves little excuse. The idea just isn't strong enough for an anime adaptation.The art style is a typical super watered down moe slice of life style, and the animation isn't particularly good. The backgrounds are actually more interesting than the actual characters.Sound usually doesn't bother me much in...a series so my opinion isn't worth its salt here. But I felt it just did the job, with the exception of the OP. I genuinely hate Kill Me Baby's OP.Characters are pretty bland. You have a ninja that's just a scam artist, the ditzy character, and the badass that's scared of stuff character. You get a feel for their interactions quickly and once you do the overused jokes get stale. I chuckled maybe once in my entire time watching Kill Me Baby.I don't think you'd be missing anything if you chose to just pass this one by without a second thought. I found the first episode to be annoying but whether I just got used to it after watching the rest or it got better I can not really be sure. It does it's job as a thing to watch, not so much to entertain. a series so my opinion isn't worth its salt here. But I felt it just did the job, with the exception of the OP.

There were times when I felt it would perhaps be served better by 10 minute episodes, but I got more into it the further it went and was just glad to be along for the ride. The characters are all memorable and very funny, Agiri the Ninja is probably my favorite, and the further you go in the show you start to pick up on certain recurring bits and gags that make the humor all...the richer. The animation does seem to be a bit low-budget but the show makes up for it with great style, character designs, and fantastic color. It's honestly a shame this didn't go on for longer, these characters and this format have tons of potential to be a long-runner. The English dub voices are also very well done with great inflection that sells the comedy and a sharply translated script. the richer.

Her everyday high school life might have consisted of endless pep rallies and air-headed trips to the mall with friends, had she the ability to make like-minded friends... Instead, she wound up making friends with the girl seated next to her in the back of the room in their homeroom class, the cold foreigner Sonya. It’s difficult to say what black magic lead these two oddballs to become so tight with each other, but ever since their paths became intertwined, Yasuma’s ideal school life has become nothing...but danger and abuse at the hands of her new BFF, who turned out to be an assassin!Assigned to their school as part of her career, Sonya has little patience for her bubbly friend, who interferes with her work, constantly ropes her into crazy schemes, and even more constantly sets off her PTSD, to which Sonya always has a wrestling hold and a broken wrist to give her in return. And if these two didn’t sound like enough of a classroom disruption, Yasuna soon meets Agiri, a mysterious acquaintance of Sonya’s who claims to be a ninja, and is always ready to supply her two pals with acme-style ninja gadgets, for a small fee of course. With these three nuts in the same basket, school life is sure to be anything but normal or average for everyone involved.I’ve talked about JC Staff before, to the point that I should probably replace Gainax Month with it. I won’t, of course. JC’s animation production tends to fall into three different camps; In one camp, you have beautiful animation that obviously had lots of effort and resources poured into it, like the first 7/8’ths of A Certain Scientific Railgun and most of Toradora.. Then you have bafflingly ugly anime that tries to look more expensive than it actually is, like Okami-san and her Seven Companions. Finally, you have the camp right in the middle... Anime with moderate budgets that save money wherever possible and make up for it whenever necessary. The majority of their work falls into this category, like Azumanga Daioh, Excel Saga, and of course Kill Me Baby.Keeping with the trend, Kill Me Baby isn’t a show that really demands a high budget... The characters are chibis, despite technically being in high school, and they don’t demand a wide range of movement to express their parts in any given situation. The budget is normally saved for the rare special effects and lighting techniques, as well as some surprisingly smooth action scenes. The money they do spend on slapstick and physical humor is well spent, causing little to no visible hiccups in the process.What’s equally impressive, though, is the art style and use of color. This show features a very restrained sense of artistry, using minimal and often recycled illustrations for the backgrounds of any given scene, but they’re still relaxed and detailed enough to blend and come to life in the story. The backgrounds are adequate at the very worst, but what I found myself more attracted to were the colored backgrounds that appeared behind the characters whenever the actual backgrounds disappeared. At first glance, you’d think they just took a bunch of white boards, gave crayons to a few elementary school kids, and pasted the result onto the background in place of actual environments.On closer examination, however, it becomes clear that each of these backgrounds is intended to express the feelings of the characters and what’s going on in each cut. Imagery similar to a sunrise will be used when Yasuna has what she perceives to be a great idea, and when you cut to Sonya bluntly explaining why it’s a bad idea, you’ll instead see what appears to be the last few rays of Yasuma’s sunrise being trapped under a blue screen that’s covered by vertical white lines... In other words, Sonya’s raining on Yasuma’s sunrise. Mixed colors, whether blended or overlapped, are used respectively to convey agreement or mixed feelings. Weird purple bubbles will look as though their pushing back a calm blue background to convey that Yasuna is disturbing Sonya’s piece, etc.It’s simple and not terribly deep, but it’s still a really nice touch, and once you start noticing it you likely won’t stop. The character designs should be somewhat on the generic side... The genki girl has messy short chestnut hair, the cold-hearted foreigner has blonde pigtails, and the mysterious girl has long dark hair... But the chibi aesthetic makes these choices feel like more of a deconstruction or parody than it actually is. The facial expressions are thoughtful and detailed, and expressive enough to serve their purpose. The music is kind of forgettable... It’s the kind of samey generic music that you’d expect from a slice-of-life gag show... But the opening and closing themes are just awesome enough to make up for it.The opening theme is called Kill Me no Baby, and I had a hard describing it until I read someone on ANN calling it sped-up polka music, which sounds about right. It’s catchy, and it’s sung by the main cast members, who repeat the title of the show over-and-over again in in the chorus. The ending theme, The True Secret Behind Our Feelings, is a bit slower, and features the same two actresses singing over a low-key techno beat The songs are cool, but what really sells them both are the videos, which I could watch over all day. The opening’s video features the three girls (and one unnamed character) fighting off an alien invasion! No, I’m not kidding, it shows a UFO attacking the earth, with the ninja, the assassin and the idiot fighting them both inside and outside of the ship. The ending is somehow even funnier, as it features Sonya and Yasuna doing a synchronized dance that looks like it’s going to be morning exercises at first, but turns out to just be a series of hilarious moving poses.The English dub is... Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but at least the good and bad points are very clear cut. This is a Sentai dub, and based on the period that it came out, it’s fairly obvious that the scripting and ADR directing was in the hands of one Stephen Foster. This isn’t Foster’s usual kind of dub, though... To start with the good attributes, he didn’t rewrite it. It stays very faithful to the original script, with the only real changes being the odd ad-lib from Luci Christian, and these normally work for the better, making her character’s snarky sarcastic humor more accessible to a western audience.Speaking of Luci Christian, one of the usual positive aspects of a Stephen Foster dub is still present here, and I’m surprised people never gave him enough credit for this... The acting in English is really good, maybe even slightly better than the Japanese. Luci growls and grumbles her way through the long-suffering straight man Sonya, and Hilary Haag turns her childish charm up to 11 for her role as the bubbly Yasuna, and the two of them work off of each other brilliantly. Rozie Curtis also does a fantastic job as Agiri, making her character sound aloof and nonchalant, yet with condescension and some distinctly bad intentions lurking below the surface. Brittany Karbowski is enjoyable as usual, playing a nameless character who’s only known by the descriptive term “Unused character,” and wants nothing more than to find some sort of purpose in the main cast.Unfortunately, such uncharacteristic quality comes at a steep price. This is a somewhat common thing in Foster’s work, and I plan on talking about it more if I ever review Medaka Box or Kids On the slope, but in order to stay faithful to the script of an anime, Foster compensates by completely ignoring lip flaps. Yes, he makes no attempt at directing his actors to match what they’re saying with what’s on screen, it’s ugly but true. What the characters are saying in English will begin before they’ve opened their mouths, and end afterwards, and no pause is acknowledged. I’d say to ignore it, but it’s really distracting, and it’s hard to get over just how well a better director would have been able to make the dub look and sound a lot better without having to sacrifice one for the other.I’m not the first person to make this observation, but comedy is hard to review. Humor is subjective, and thus there’s no way to predict whether or not other people will find the same things funny that you do. Kill Me Baby is a slice-of-life slapstick comedy, told mainly through extended vignettes, so I can understand many viewers will likely find themselves losing interest during the full length episodes of a show that ideally should have been presented in 12 minute chunks. I like to find other things to discuss when reviewing comedies, but in Kill Me Baby, the only thing I can really discuss IS the comedy, so bare with me through this.The style of comedy that Kill Me Baby uses is the classic ‘Straight-man-Goofball’ type of style... Where you have one character acting like a fool and trying to get on their counterpart’s nerves, and that counterpart delivers by either pointing out the goofball’s foolishness or just flat out smacking a bitch. This style is used often in the genre, and I must say I’m quite fond of it myself, but unless both characters take their roles to extreme levels, it’s hard for this dynamic to carry a series. Luckily, both Yasuna and Sonya take their respective roles and make them the central elements of their characters, so that the style can be carried to some very versatile places. Yasuna isn’t just a happy-go-lucky idiot, she’s a prankster, and thrives on the chance to get the better of her BFF, making her a very active goofball. Sonya is extremely edgy, and has a laundry list of trigger warnings, as she’s frightened of most animals, and is quick to become offended, making her a perfectly reactive straight man.The rest of the cast is small, consisting mainly of two-bit extras that we’re not supposed to commit to memory, such as “Girl who lost wallet belonged to,” “owner of annoying dog,” and “Old man who keeps getting roped into stuff.” Agiri makes for a great third wheel, as her weirdness and casual antagonizing is one of the only things that Yasuna and Sonya are ever on the same side about, giving us rare glimpses of camaraderie between them. Unused Character is, surprise surprise, kind of useless, and doesn’t do much other than act as meta-commentary on the small size of the main cast. She could have honestly been left out, basically, and she knows it. With her and Agiri acting as occasional crutches, this show survives primarily on the strength of it’s two central characters and the wide array of interactions they can have.For the most part, the story really only has three settings... Walking to school, hanging out between classes, and walking home from school, and the amount of material they can squeeze out of these settings is amazing. Yasuna always has something to bother Sonya with, and even when she doesn’t, she still has enough dimension to carry a satisfying vignette. Sonya herself does of course have the violent and sour reactions in good supply, but for whatever reason, she’s still more or less game to TRY and enjoy her time with Yasuna, and she even shows some shockingly real vulnerability in her occasional confusion over Japanese culture, as well as in the ways her PTSD has believably affected her reactions to otherwise non-threatening noises and events.I could easily file this show away under the long list of plotless slice-of-life shows, but when I really think about it, that wouldn’t actually be fair. Yes, there’s no long term plot, nothing over-all that the girls are trying to accomplish, despite Yasuma’s futile insistence of a motive in the final episodes. The plots, believe it or not, come in the lengthy vignettes that make up each episode. This isn’t like in Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star, where entire stretches of story can be made up of just interchangeable interactions that seemingly have nothing to do with each other... For the most part, an episode of Kill Me Baby will consist of quarter-to-half-length stories where something happens... Yes, things are constantly happening in this show, to varying levels of importance or impact... And there’s almost always a clear goal, even if that goal is just the two characters getting the best of each other.While this style of storytelling doesn’t wear thin easily, the jokes themselves can become kind of repetitive, and it can sometimes feel like the writers were stretching for ideas. Vignettes that remove themselves from the normal setting, such as Yasuma’s New Year’s dreams, kind of fall flat, and the humor can lose steam if you’re bingeing more than a few episodes per sitting, meaning a portion of one episode per day would probably be ideal. Having said all that, I still say that Sonya and Yasuna are the backbone of this series, and while the execution isn’t perfect, it’s still a great concept that the writers are at the very least having a lot of fun with, never having to resort to cheap fan service(Which is good, because seriously, how do you make small anatomically disproportionate bobblehead characters sexy without failing at it like Lucky Star did?). The writer of the original manga, Kaduho, clearly loved these characters, and you probably will too.Kill Me Baby is available from Sentai Filmworks, and is available on DVD and Blu-ray. It’s also available for free on Crunchyroll, and you can find pretty much the entire series dubbed on youtube. The original manga, by mysterious author Kaduho, is not available stateside. The follow-up OVA series, Kill Me Baby super, can be viewed online in many different places.Kill Me Baby is a really fun series built on the strength of one really strong concept, enthusiastically explored in enough creative ways to excuse the somewhat lackluster backdrops that it’s set against. But like many others of it's ilk, it’s biggest problem is just how simple it is. Sure, there’s some complexity to the characters, but there’s little to no depth to any of it. It’s not really worth a second look unless the humor really worked for you, but in my case, it definitely did, and as fast-paced as the jokes in it are, you’re sure to find at least a few moments per episode that’ll work for you to. It’s a decent comedy that promises some great laughs, and that’s all it really needs to be. I give Kill Me Baby a 7/10. but danger and abuse at the hands of her new BFF, who turned out to be an assassin!Assigned to their school as part of her career, Sonya has little patience for her bubbly friend, who interferes with her work, constantly ropes her into crazy schemes, and even more constantly sets off her PTSD, to which Sonya always has a wrestling hold and a broken wrist to give her in return.

The facial expressions are thoughtful and detailed, and expressive enough to serve their purpose. The music is kind of forgettable... It’s the kind of samey generic music that you’d expect from a slice-of-life gag show... But the opening and closing themes are just awesome enough to make up for it.The opening theme is called Kill Me no Baby, and I had a hard describing it until I read someone on ANN calling it sped-up polka music, which sounds about right. It’s catchy, and it’s sung by the main cast members, who repeat the title of the show over-and-over again in in the chorus. The ending theme, The True Secret Behind Our Feelings, is a bit slower, and features the same two actresses singing over a low-key techno beat The songs are cool, but what really sells them both are the videos, which I could watch over all day. The opening’s video features the three girls (and one unnamed character) fighting off an alien invasion! No, I’m not kidding, it shows a UFO attacking the earth, with the ninja, the assassin and the idiot fighting them both inside and outside of the ship. The ending is somehow even funnier, as it features Sonya and Yasuna doing a synchronized dance that looks like it’s going to be morning exercises at first, but turns out to just be a series of hilarious moving poses.The English dub is... Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but at least the good and bad points are very clear cut. This is a Sentai dub, and based on the period that it came out, it’s fairly obvious that the scripting and ADR directing was in the hands of one Stephen Foster. This isn’t Foster’s usual kind of dub, though... To start with the good attributes, he didn’t rewrite it. It stays very faithful to the original script, with the only real changes being the odd ad-lib from Luci Christian, and these normally work for the better, making her character’s snarky sarcastic humor more accessible to a western audience.Speaking of Luci Christian, one of the usual positive aspects of a Stephen Foster dub is still present here, and I’m surprised people never gave him enough credit for this... The acting in English is really good, maybe even slightly better than the Japanese. Luci growls and grumbles her way through the long-suffering straight man Sonya, and Hilary Haag turns her childish charm up to 11 for her role as the bubbly Yasuna, and the two of them work off of each other brilliantly. Rozie Curtis also does a fantastic job as Agiri, making her character sound aloof and nonchalant, yet with condescension and some distinctly bad intentions lurking below the surface. Brittany Karbowski is enjoyable as usual, playing a nameless character who’s only known by the descriptive term “Unused character,” and wants nothing more than to find some sort of purpose in the main cast.Unfortunately, such uncharacteristic quality comes at a steep price. This is a somewhat common thing in Foster’s work, and I plan on talking about it more if I ever review Medaka Box or Kids On the slope, but in order to stay faithful to the script of an anime, Foster compensates by completely ignoring lip flaps. Yes, he makes no attempt at directing his actors to match what they’re saying with what’s on screen, it’s ugly but true. What the characters are saying in English will begin before they’ve opened their mouths, and end afterwards, and no pause is acknowledged. I’d say to ignore it, but it’s really distracting, and it’s hard to get over just how well a better director would have been able to make the dub look and sound a lot better without having to sacrifice one for the other.I’m not the first person to make this observation, but comedy is hard to review. Humor is subjective, and thus there’s no way to predict whether or not other people will find the same things funny that you do. Kill Me Baby is a slice-of-life slapstick comedy, told mainly through extended vignettes, so I can understand many viewers will likely find themselves losing interest during the full length episodes of a show that ideally should have been presented in 12 minute chunks. I like to find other things to discuss when reviewing comedies, but in Kill Me Baby, the only thing I can really discuss IS the comedy, so bare with me through this.The style of comedy that Kill Me Baby uses is the classic ‘Straight-man-Goofball’ type of style... Where you have one character acting like a fool and trying to get on their counterpart’s nerves, and that counterpart delivers by either pointing out the goofball’s foolishness or just flat out smacking a bitch. This style is used often in the genre, and I must say I’m quite fond of it myself, but unless both characters take their roles to extreme levels, it’s hard for this dynamic to carry a series. Luckily, both Yasuna and Sonya take their respective roles and make them the central elements of their characters, so that the style can be carried to some very versatile places. Yasuna isn’t just a happy-go-lucky idiot, she’s a prankster, and thrives on the chance to get the better of her BFF, making her a very active goofball. Sonya is extremely edgy, and has a laundry list of trigger warnings, as she’s frightened of most animals, and is quick to become offended, making her a perfectly reactive straight man.The rest of the cast is small, consisting mainly of two-bit extras that we’re not supposed to commit to memory, such as “Girl who lost wallet belonged to,” “owner of annoying dog,” and “Old man who keeps getting roped into stuff.” Agiri makes for a great third wheel, as her weirdness and casual antagonizing is one of the only things that Yasuna and Sonya are ever on the same side about, giving us rare glimpses of camaraderie between them. Unused Character is, surprise surprise, kind of useless, and doesn’t do much other than act as meta-commentary on the small size of the main cast. She could have honestly been left out, basically, and she knows it. With her and Agiri acting as occasional crutches, this show survives primarily on the strength of it’s two central characters and the wide array of interactions they can have.For the most part, the story really only has three settings... Walking to school, hanging out between classes, and walking home from school, and the amount of material they can squeeze out of these settings is amazing. Yasuna always has something to bother Sonya with, and even when she doesn’t, she still has enough dimension to carry a satisfying vignette. Sonya herself does of course have the violent and sour reactions in good supply, but for whatever reason, she’s still more or less game to TRY and enjoy her time with Yasuna, and she even shows some shockingly real vulnerability in her occasional confusion over Japanese culture, as well as in the ways her PTSD has believably affected her reactions to otherwise non-threatening noises and events.I could easily file this show away under the long list of plotless slice-of-life shows, but when I really think about it, that wouldn’t actually be fair. Yes, there’s no long term plot, nothing over-all that the girls are trying to accomplish, despite Yasuma’s futile insistence of a motive in the final episodes. The plots, believe it or not, come in the lengthy vignettes that make up each episode. This isn’t like in Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star, where entire stretches of story can be made up of just interchangeable interactions that seemingly have nothing to do with each other... For the most part, an episode of Kill Me Baby will consist of quarter-to-half-length stories where something happens... Yes, things are constantly happening in this show, to varying levels of importance or impact... And there’s almost always a clear goal, even if that goal is just the two characters getting the best of each other.While this style of storytelling doesn’t wear thin easily, the jokes themselves can become kind of repetitive, and it can sometimes feel like the writers were stretching for ideas. Vignettes that remove themselves from the normal setting, such as Yasuma’s New Year’s dreams, kind of fall flat, and the humor can lose steam if you’re bingeing more than a few episodes per sitting, meaning a portion of one episode per day would probably be ideal. Having said all that, I still say that Sonya and Yasuna are the backbone of this series, and while the execution isn’t perfect, it’s still a great concept that the writers are at the very least having a lot of fun with, never having to resort to cheap fan service(Which is good, because seriously, how do you make small anatomically disproportionate bobblehead characters sexy without failing at it like Lucky Star did?). The writer of the original manga, Kaduho, clearly loved these characters, and you probably will too.Kill Me Baby is available from Sentai Filmworks, and is available on DVD and Blu-ray. It’s also available for free on Crunchyroll, and you can find pretty much the entire series dubbed on youtube. The original manga, by mysterious author Kaduho, is not available stateside. The follow-up OVA series, Kill Me Baby super, can be viewed online in many different places.Kill Me Baby is a really fun series built on the strength of one really strong concept, enthusiastically explored in enough creative ways to excuse the somewhat lackluster backdrops that it’s set against. But like many others of it's ilk, it’s biggest problem is just how simple it is. Sure, there’s some complexity to the characters, but there’s little to no depth to any of it. It’s not really worth a second look unless the humor really worked for you, but in my case, it definitely did, and as fast-paced as the jokes in it are, you’re sure to find at least a few moments per episode that’ll work for you to. It’s a decent comedy that promises some great laughs, and that’s all it really needs to be. I give Kill Me Baby a 7/10."", 'The best anime ever made. If you disagree do not share your opinion with me--if you agree with me let us rejoice; I have watched this show at least 5 times including the OVA at the time of writing this. The OST, drawings (especially the drawings of the OVA), story, VA\'s, relationships between the characters, structure of every episode & overall joy the show gives me makes this the best anime ever made. I am also a fan of the show\'s mangaka Motokazu-sensei but I wish he would make more Kill Me Baby manga instead of Kobayashi drawings. I was shocked to see this show...had recieved a 6-star on this website--the masses lack taste. This show is heavily misunderstood based on the top reviews I\'ve seen--the masses lack understanding.

There is a 4th teased in the opening and in early episodes as far as I can tell, and sadly it was hardly used. Not to say that the genre needs a ton of characters to be viable, but being the first slice of life I find boring, there might be a correlation to having only three main characters here.The ending is really catchy though.

This series may not be well known, or spoken of specifically, but Sonia and Yasuna, the main characters, are fairly recognizable when you see them together. I figured I might as well watch it. Laughed quite a bit at all the gags, and then looked for what to put on next.That’s the kind of show this is. It’s good when you’re watching it,...but ultimately pretty forgettable.This anime is based off of a 4-koma comedy manga and has a teeny tiny cast of characters. Sonia, is a JK assassin (which is what basically all the jokes in the show revolve around), Yasuna is her idiot friend, and Agiri is ninja of dubious ability. There is also the “unused character” (played by Rie Kugimiya, arguably the most famous VA on the cast), and a few extras. The series is essentially a slapstick, gag comedy, in the manzai format, which is extremely popular in Japan. Manzai is traditionally a two-person act, with a “tsukkomi” (straight man) and a “boke” (funny man). Occasionally a third party will enter, and the roles can get swapped around with the introduction of this third party, which helps change things up a bit to keep the jokes from getting stale.In the case of Kill Me Baby, Sonia is basically always a tsukkomi, and Yasuna is a really, really dumb boke. When ninja-girl shows up, she doesn’t change the greater order of things too much, but Yasuna will sometimes play tsukkomi to her. I’d say that honestly, the “dubious ninja” jokes in the show were some of the best gags. I actually found myself laughing out loud, which is super rare for me these days (since I’m mostly dead inside).All in all, the dynamic isn’t nearly as complicated as it is to explain; what’s important is that it works. It’s a very funny show, the jokes hit well, the running gags provide a nice laugh, and the way they vary those up works well too. Now, unfortunately I might be quite biased. I’m a big fan of manzai, so I enjoy seeing it done well, and this is pretty good in terms of pure manzai anime.There’s another reason I really enjoyed this series, simply because Sonia’s voice actress Mutsumi Tamura is really, really good; she’s probably most recognizable these days as playing Kobayashi in Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid (which happens to be one of my favorite shows). Her performance here really reminded me of the performance she gave in Dragon Maid, so I might be scoring this show a little kinder than I usually do (and I’m usually pretty easy going when rating anime).At the end of the day, I recommend Kill Me Baby. It might be better not binging it, but rather throwing on an episode whenever you need a quick, easy, forgettable laugh to cleanse your palette and improve your mood. Watching every episode back-to-back it kind of blends together, and you lose track of things.On a final note, you can find this on Hidive, which doesn’t have an option to skip the OP/ED, which is really a shame, because I found the opening song for this show to be extremely irritating, while I loved the ending.

And this...can also be depends on the time you were in especially with an old anime like this.Kill Me Baby is one of those old anime that used to be quite popular but then faded to obscurity, and i think is kinda logical why this anime is like that. Kill Me Baby is an CGDCT comedy anime about 2 cute high school girls doing shenanigans and is pretty much that, it Didn't actually bring something new to the table but it does kind of bringing some unique twist in to this genre, but it doesn't kind of suceeded in what they wanted to bring.(story)There are no story in this anime because that is not really purpose of this anime want to bring, story is the least important of what comedy genre wants to bring because the purpose of this genre is always the humor and adding story in a comedy genre is like pouring additional flavor in a ice cream because is not the main ingredient.(Character)Now a with a genre like this, one of the main ingredients is always the the characters, think of it like mr bean, or chaplin as the iconic part of this comedy series are literally the main character, what kind of situation does this character goes to and comedy effect will this character bring to this series. and this where the anime kinda suceed and failed at the same time, the charaters from the start is not really bringing that much comedy, 2 main charecter is yasuna the dumb girl, and the assasin girl from russia sonya,, and the main side character is the ninja girl asagiri. Neither of this character are unique in there own way except from maybe sonya a little bit wich to me, kinda cary the show to the end as her character is kinda what makes this anime is all about. but then she didn't really bring much flavor in each episodes and she falls flat kinda quickly. Yasuna is the dumb girl and the friend of sonya and most of the comedy comes from her antics but thats really what shes all about, other than that she's just another dumb cute girl, asagiri, the most famous character in this series had a rather unique roll in this series because she is a side character but the one that is in each episode and in most scene, as her presence kind of bring a different atmosphere in each scene but than she is just mainly an additional character that kind have unique profile. Other characters are just cardboard cutout and are literally cardboard cutout as they dont even have names.(Art)The art is simple and cute with no vibrant or elegant colour almost like low budget kids shows that you watch in the 2000s, character design are rather unique than other anime of this type as it is very very childlike almost like they were pre schooler instead of high schooller, not that i say high schoolers cant look like a little kid as there are many who look really young but is not the general 15-19 year old look even in anime, but its another one of those that makes this show unique.(Animation)Good animation, very typical budget animation of an anime.(Sound)The voice acting in this show really done a good job in what they trying to bring to the characters, same thing with the sound effect in bringing the comedy to light, this two department succeed in what they doing but no unique or high class things really happen in this two department. For music, same thing, is good, but no iconic ost ever come in this series and no unique experimental ost, is more generic than even kevin macleod music. The op is one of the most forgettable op in anime as it is so bland and flat. But the ED. I think ED is a seperate different topic already, because it is one the most iconic ed in anime, is so good i think the ed already paint the whole series. The ED it self is already way more famous and more memorable than the whole series.(Comedy)The last and final part is without a doubt the most important one, the comedy, and disappointingly they kinda failed in this one, but is not actually because it is repetitive. In fact this anime is pretty much using that repetitive comedy format, just like phineas and ferb for example, but what they failed is adding some unique twist or a creative idea in each repetitive jokes just like phineas and ferb so it wont actually feel repetitive. There are certainly unique comedic scene happen, but is so few. Most of the time is a very predictable repetitive joke scene in 24 minute 12 episode series and this is why this anime faded so fast and forgotten to many people. It didn't have the iconic comedic scene that other series like this had.Conclusion :Kill me baby aired in a time when anime about cute moe girls doing random stuff with no plotline are trending like fire in the mid 2000s to the early 2010s  usually either in the form of comedy, slice of life, or either both of them mixed together, it than evolved to include storyline also but the general concept is always the moe genre cute girls doing cute things. It start of with azumanga daioh in early 2000s and then getting popular in the mid 2000s all the way to the early 2010s birthing many other iconic moe anime like lucky star, k on, nichijou, and non non biyori, it is still popular until now with airing of bocchi the rock and they usually come out on its original form in a form of 4 koma manga wich is a 4 panel one page manga that had very different setting then the next page usually for gags wich is why is usually common to see it in newspaper also back when newspaper was a thing, think of it like garfield. Kill Me Baby is in the same universe as all this moe anime genre with a 4 koma manga as its original form and it is actually one of the popular 4 koma manga wich is why it adapted into an anime, but the anime didn’t really had the flow the 4 koma manga, because adapting 4 koma manga (especially the comedic ones) to an whole out series is very hard, either you have to change the baseline format of the manga (usually to a slice of life genre) or adapt it into a short 3 minute anime series with either 5 to 10 episodes. Kill Me Baby is very devouted in its source material but adapting it into a 24 minute 12 episode anime its not a great concept and rarely executed well cause you would then have to add additional comedic elements wich are usually pointless and not funny to stretch the time. Wich is why I would recommend reading the manga instead, but I should say that Kill Me Baby is quite an old manga with a quite an old comedic format also that didn’t seem to go along with time, its comedic format is similar to that of Garfield. Espacially now with humors that are either getting very weird, very relatable, or very politically correct. I wouldn’t really recommend it to the average new anime viewers now as maybe for them the comedy might feel to archaic (which means to bland for them) but if you want to try some old manga or on a nostalgia trip, I would recommend the manga but not anime. can also be depends on the time you were in especially with an old anime like this.Kill Me Baby is one of those old anime that used to be quite popular but then faded to obscurity, and i think is kinda logical why this anime is like that.

In fact this anime is pretty much using that repetitive comedy format, just like phineas and ferb for example, but what they failed is adding some unique twist or a creative idea in each repetitive jokes just like phineas and ferb so it wont actually feel repetitive. There are certainly unique comedic scene happen, but is so few. Most of the time is a very predictable repetitive joke scene in 24 minute 12 episode series and this is why this anime faded so fast and forgotten to many people. It didn't have the iconic comedic scene that other series like this had.Conclusion :Kill me baby aired in a time when anime about cute moe girls doing random stuff with no plotline are trending like fire in the mid 2000s to the early 2010s  usually either in the form of comedy, slice of life, or either both of them mixed together, it than evolved to include storyline also but the general concept is always the moe genre cute girls doing cute things. It start of with azumanga daioh in early 2000s and then getting popular in the mid 2000s all the way to the early 2010s birthing many other iconic moe anime like lucky star, k on, nichijou, and non non biyori, it is still popular until now with airing of bocchi the rock and they usually come out on its original form in a form of 4 koma manga wich is a 4 panel one page manga that had very different setting then the next page usually for gags wich is why is usually common to see it in newspaper also back when newspaper was a thing, think of it like garfield. Kill Me Baby is in the same universe as all this moe anime genre with a 4 koma manga as its original form and it is actually one of the popular 4 koma manga wich is why it adapted into an anime, but the anime didn’t really had the flow the 4 koma manga, because adapting 4 koma manga (especially the comedic ones) to an whole out series is very hard, either you have to change the baseline format of the manga (usually to a slice of life genre) or adapt it into a short 3 minute anime series with either 5 to 10 episodes. Kill Me Baby is very devouted in its source material but adapting it into a 24 minute 12 episode anime its not a great concept and rarely executed well cause you would then have to add additional comedic elements wich are usually pointless and not funny to stretch the time. Wich is why I would recommend reading the manga instead, but I should say that Kill Me Baby is quite an old manga with a quite an old comedic format also that didn’t seem to go along with time, its comedic format is similar to that of Garfield. Espacially now with humors that are either getting very weird, very relatable, or very politically correct. I wouldn’t really recommend it to the average new anime viewers now as maybe for them the comedy might feel to archaic (which means to bland for them) but if you want to try some old manga or on a nostalgia trip, I would recommend the manga but not anime."", ""Kill me baby left me with… well very mixed feelings, more on the negative side.The story is about two girls, Sonya, who is an assasin that hides as a high school student and her classmate. She’s very serious and rather violent person, always hitting or torturing her classmate, Oribe Yasuna.Yasuna is stupidly optimistic and always get on Sonya’s nerves because of that. She’s very kind and good hearted tho.There’s also a third girl, Goshiki Agiri, who is a ninja and just show up sometimes.Episodes are cut in three, not related to each other segments. They are mostly based on random and gag humor....And here is my problem- the comedy.The show is so absolutely unfunny that it’s so boring to watch. I had have to watch it at 1.5 speed because I couldn’t stand this anime.The characters have just one off personalities. They didn't learn anything through the show and stayed the same till the end.Sonya is bluntly violent toward her friend and I can’t sympathize or like her. She struggles her, keep hitting her for anything or even throw knives on her.Yasuna is just too stupid for my likeness. It’s tiring seeing her causing another problems. It’s also seems like they would do better if they wouldn’t be friends.The only character that carries this show is Agiri. She sounds so done with everything the other girl does.The art style is chibi inspired. I think that is rather alright. The backgrounds are simple, but nicely done. However the animation can be really lazy sometimes.Opening and ending are the best part of this series. It’s literally made to stay in your head for the whole day.If you looking for very funny, investing comedy, better skip this anime.

The girls are cheap Moes that are too cheap to be cute. they\'re all carbon cut out stereotypes or Archtypes. Whatever word you want to use.I appreciate that there\'s no fan service or Romance. There is some...violence but it\'s not gratuitous, and that\'s fine too. We shouldn\'t have a female cast not relying on fan service and romance to be entertaining, but there\'s no kind of substance to the production. I don\'t feel inspired to watch anything elf made by anyone connected to the staff of this project, unless they were connected with a much bigger name, and I didn\'t know they were affiliated.There are scenes of scenery use to replace motion. They didn\'t have much budget to animated, but the art is fine. the characters could have at least been cuter and the colors more vibrant and eye-catching. It\'s supposed to be a comedy but nothing about it is funny. Everything about this is bland. and it has the audacity to have some problematic elements of girls making negative comments about other girls bodies. They could have taken out the ""comedy"" and making made it a cheap moe Slice of Life, and at least it wouldn\'t been been insulting.Why make this? Why use the resources time and money to make this?

Love Live! School Idol Project OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20745/Love_Live_School_Idol_Project_OVA,"['Well, considering no one has written a review of this, I might as well. The Love Live! School Idol Project OVA is a 15 minute descent into madness that was bundled with the sixth single of the anime\'s μ\'s idol group and aired on November 27, 2013. Why do I call it a descent into madness? Because the story of this OVA is complete nonsense. There\'s something about being in a dream, Maki\'s piano not working, tiny Maki scaring normal Maki for no real reason which is never brought up again, Ayase forgetting a textbook and then chasing after a shadow, it suddenly being nighttime,...Maki being a child for....some reason, and a fireworks show. Oh, and apparently the entire thing is a dream. Whose dream? I don\'t know! The show never tells us. I\'m assuming it\'s Maki\'s, but it\'s never really explained. Maki as a child tells us that they are indeed inside of a dream, and that it is a ""never-ending party"", whatever that means. After that, Maki abruptly turns back into her usual teenage self via some sort of alien abduction or divine act of god, and then tells the other girls that she has always liked them.That is roughly the first 10 minutes. The remaining 5 minutes is devoted to a musical number, a song called ""Music S.T.A.R.T!!."" If you liked the music in Love Live, it would probably be worth it to you to watch this OVA just for the song. I don\'t particularly enjoy Idol music, but the same quality of music and animation in the show is clearly present here (for better or worse), so if you\'re into that go ahead and give it a watch.Also worth noting: I don\'t grade OVAs or specials; MAL forces you to pick an overall score to attach to your review.

We have a story about Maki being in a dream with everyone. Subtle, I know. Anyway, she admits, that she loved everyone else, even from before they turned idols, big whoop.This is a really materielistic OVA. What you'll get: a new music video, Maki in loli form and the characters interacting. You won't miss out on anything, if you just leave this one be, but it's not offensively bad, or anything. It's just a vaste of an OVA. But since...the series has an abundance of those, I'm not really heartbroken. This was the first I saw though, so that's kind of lame, but that is really the worst I can say about it.In the future, please just release the music video and leave out all the rest. the series has an abundance of those, I'm not really heartbroken.

And we\'re going to do it again. This little OVA was bundled with the group\'s sixth single. It\'s only fifteen minutes. So, we\'ll see how it goes.Story:We open with Maki having a nightmare where she\'s being chased by hooded figures. She finishes telling Hanayo about it. Which scares Hanayo, likely making it necessary for her to take solace between Rin\'s legs. The next day Maki\'s not at school and the rest of our cast decides to go visit her, leading to a slightly trippy sequence followed by a musical number. So, the ""story"" is basically...build up for the music video.The issue is that the build up is awkward. It\'s a bit surreal and has some magical realism shit going on that doesn\'t really go with the rest of the franchise. It doesn\'t help that a lot of it is stretches of a character running and it\'s not that interesting.I will say, it does have a few cute moments. Nico\'s face when they decide to visit Maki along with Nozomi\'s narration. That\'s cute. Little baby Maki telling the rest of the girls that she\'s always really liked them. That\'s cute. I also do like the music video bit.Characters:The regular μ\'s cast is all there. The OVA doesn\'t give us anything new but it is nice to see the group doing their thing. Even in a short OVA.Art:The OVA looks much like the series proper. About the worst I can say about it is that the running scenes are a little lazy in terms of their backgrounds just staying pretty much the same throughout. Other than that it all looks good. It\'s well put together. The music video is very much what we\'re used to from the franchise. With the costumes, choreography, lights and bright colours.Sound:The acting in this franchise has always been well done. The music portion features a really good song in terms of its performance. If you\'re a fan of that type of idol music, you\'ll enjoy hearing the song.Ho-yay:It\'s almost like Sunrise was pandering to me specifically with this one. There\'s a lot of homo-eroticism in the music video. The girls\' idea of a party is, apparently, getting in sleepwear, cuddling up to one another and staring at each other longingly. This isn\'t a Never-ending party, it\'s a never-ending Sapphic sleepover. Which is much better. And you might think ""But Ktulu, you wouldn\'t be allowed into a never-ending Sapphic sleepover."" Which is true, but I don\'t go to parties either. The most people I\'ll be in a room with is about seven other people for D&D.Areas of Improvement:1.Less surrealism in the build up.2. Fewer and shorter scenes of running.3. Maybe just lose the dream angle in favour of something that suits the franchise better. Like a Sapphic sleepover.Final Thoughts:Is this OVA as good as the series proper? No. Is it going to be enjoyable if you\'re not a fan of the series proper? No. If you\'re a fan of the series, will you enjoy it? Very likely, yes. It has its cute moments and the music video portion is great. So, if you\'re a fan of the franchise, you should probably watch it. If you\'re someone who likes the music but doesn\'t care much for the rest, watch the last five minutes. If you aren\'t sure whether you\'d like the series, watch the regular anime first. For myself, I\'m giving it a 6/10.

I'm not sure exactly why this exists, maybe they wanted to include a storyline for the music video (although it doesn't fit together very well).Regardless, it's quite an odd experience. If you're a fan of Love Live I do recommend giving it a watch but just be aware that you're in for a wild ride.(Spoilers)So the plot revolves around Maki being sick and the rest of Muse going to check on her. However, Eli stops when she sees loli Maki and decides to chase her down. Eventually the girls all...meet up again and loli Maki tells muse she's always loved them even before they were school idols together (I think I get what they were trying to go for here with the symbolism and the loli Maki but it's just kind of confusing to follow and they never really explain much so you have to make your own inferences). After that she's transformed into teenage Maki and they realize they're all having a dream together (I think they should have told us this from the beginning, it would have made the plot way easier to follow). The episode ends with the music video for Music:Start.I don't know that I would say this episode doesn't deserve to exist because the surrealism is kind of beautiful, it's a nice contrast to the typical feel of the show and I like how it does, in fact, feel like a dream. But it's hard to follow and just gets a little too weird. So at the end of the day, I feel 6/10 is an appropriate rating for it. meet up again and loli Maki tells muse she's always loved them even before they were school idols together (I think I get what they were trying to go for here with the symbolism and the loli Maki but it's just kind of confusing to follow and they never really explain much so you have to make your own inferences).

When little Maki suddenly show up or when Eli chasing little Maki around the school. You can also say that little Maki is causing all of this problem. This whole episode is just trippin.

Kurozuka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5039/Kurozuka,"[""It's often strange how some anime can divide opinions on how good it actually is, and the reasons for these divided opinions are often logical and plausible. In the case of Kurozuka however, there is a definite misinterpretation of the story as a whole.Kurozuka began life as a novel written by Yumemakura Baku, which was later illustrated by Noguchi Takashi in manga form. The manga was serialized in Super Jump magazine from 2003 to 2006, before being turned into an anime by Madhouse in 2008.The story in Kurozuka is where many of the divided opinions stem from. Many people consider the story to be confusing,...especially at the very end, however this can confusion can somewhat berectified by watching the first five minutes of the first episode again.At heart Kurozuka may seem to be a story about vampires, love, betrayal, and revenge, however I found it to be more than just the sum of it's parts. Kurozuka is very much a &quot;what if&quot; tale, and the ending is actually very appropriate when considered in this light. There is a lot of action in the story, and the viewer will sometimes wonder what the hell is going on (as I did), but if you stick with it then you may find the story strangely captivating.The art and animation are top notch in this show. Madhouse pulled out a lot of the stops when designing the characters and animating the show, especially during the numerous action sequences. CG is incorporated very well overall, with only a few minor faults that are barely noticeable. The characters are designed very well on the whole, and I especially liked the incorporation of traditional Kabuki players into the series as it gives the show a far more surreal feel. Each episode begins with a small kabuki play which recounts the events of the previous episode, and I found that the designs, animation and sound for these scenes were excellent.The sound is another excellent area, especially the music and sound effects. The BGMs never overpower the sound effects during the action sequences, and the use of non-traditional animation techniques for these sequences made them exceptional.The VAs are, again, excellent. Paku Romi is excellent as Kuromitsu, whilst Miyano Mamoru's monotonous tones are strangely suitable for the amnesiac Kurou. The other VAs are just as good as the two leads. Fujiwara Keiji, who plays Karuta, manages to imbue his voice with a certain &quot;roguish&quot; quality that suitably matches Karuta's design and personality.The characters are actually one of the bad things about this show, however I say this with a certain amount of trepidation. On the whole the characters are well done, however there is very little development given to them - they're just there for the most part. However, this would only really be a problem if you were watching this as a straightforward story rather than a &quot;what if&quot; tale. That said though, even a &quot;what if&quot; tale would need it's characters developed to a much greater degree than Kurozuka manages to do.That doesn't mean I hate the characters though. I thought the characters were. on the whole, fairly decent. My problem is that I would have liked to have known more about them as characters - their motivations and such.Kurozuka is a great action anime, however it can be very confusing at times. There is a definite story there, but many people will find it confusing for the most part, especially as the story doesn't really hint at what's really going on until the end (suffice to say I found it a very &quot;Dallas&quot; moment).This is a good show to watch if you're after some good action and aren't overly concerned with the story. It may not be everyone's cup of tea though, especially with the scientific angle it takes on the vampirism issue.  This is a story about love, loss, betrayal and revenge, and these aspects of the show are very much at the fore.

Viewers who crave cyberpunk animations consisting of time lapses and vicious fight scenes will have a pleasant taste out of this series. Yet there is much of the plot that may leave the audience hungry. Once you take a bite out of my review, you'll understand what I mean.~[ S T O R Y ]~ [6]Kurozuka focuses on the concept of immortality along with the quest for the meaning of mortality. Initially, I had assumed a vampiric aspect came into play [Kuromitsu sucking blood for example]. As the series progressed, the aspect grew more scientific. Here we...have the main character, Kurou, wanting to spend all eternity with Kuromitsu. I once thought it was a romantic struggle between the two protagonists, yet the plot grew more confusing later on. What with the beheading of Kurou to Benkei's murderous motives [due to his desire of having Kuromitsu to himself] to the Resistance against the Red Emperor's Army, just so many subplots made Kurozuka more like a staccato piece than a horror orchestra viewers probably wanted to witness. Even the end itself leaves so much to the imagination that viewers like myself wonder whether the creator intentionally wanted to mess with our minds and trigger heated discussions, or something else we have failed to notice. Other than that, the story could've been portrayed better...~[A R T]~ [10]Post-cyberpunk meets the essence of ancient 12th century art. The serenity of the 12th century atmosphere collaborating with the post-cyberpunk appeal of the anime was rewarded my thumbs up. It brought the animation out more, gluing me to my seat as I endured visual ecstasy. Even the swift fight scenes were brilliant, as expected from the gifted Kurou as well as those involved in battle alongside. Any fan of Death Note can understand that the art between the two animes are strikingly similar. Furthermore, the art was not overexaggerated at all. They were on the dot with their specific time periods, making the anime successfully attractive.~[S O U N D]~ [9]From the miraculous terror of the opening song to the soft tranquility of the ending, Kurozuka had played its music well. The flute and drums matched the ancient liveliness of Japanese culture. The instrumentals had presented the mood well as well as portraying the feel of scenes such as romantic moments, battles, times of agony, despair, hatred, et cetera. I knew what kind of scenes I was expecting from the sound. Nicely done.~[C H A R A C T E R]~ [7]I gave the development of characters a 7 due to the fact that I had expected more from their transformations. Moreover, I expecting a better explanation of the immortality concept. The manga explains more of it whilst the anime has left gaping holes for the viewers' minds to fill. Though Kurou was inconspicuous and monotonous in his expressions, we did have a sense of what he felt inside through his short monologues. I did hope to understand a little more of Kuromitsu, seeing as the series focused more on Kurou's thoughts than anyone else's. Romi Paku and Mamoru Miyano portrayed the voices of their characters well enough for me to give this category a high mark. The rest of the seiyuu's deserve credit. I suppose that the shortness of the series is to blame for cutting short every character's expected developments.~[ E N J O Y M E N T &amp; O V E R A L L]~  [7]Just to be fair, I'll award this anime a 7. Were it to improve in its character and plot development, it would've been awarded a higher grade. Though I do give immense praise to the development of the actual animation. It is different from any other post-cyberpunk anime to exist within the Japanimation realm. The rough grunge scenes, the splash of eccentric hues in the opening and battle scenes, the ancient softness of the 12th century lifestyle - it was all done quite well.

That is up to you to decide. have the main character, Kurou, wanting to spend all eternity with Kuromitsu. I once thought it was a romantic struggle between the two protagonists, yet the plot grew more confusing later on. What with the beheading of Kurou to Benkei's murderous motives [due to his desire of having Kuromitsu to himself] to the Resistance against the Red Emperor's Army, just so many subplots made Kurozuka more like a staccato piece than a horror orchestra viewers probably wanted to witness. Even the end itself leaves so much to the imagination that viewers like myself wonder whether the creator intentionally wanted to mess with our minds and trigger heated discussions, or something else we have failed to notice. Other than that, the story could've been portrayed better...~[A R T]~ [10]Post-cyberpunk meets the essence of ancient 12th century art. The serenity of the 12th century atmosphere collaborating with the post-cyberpunk appeal of the anime was rewarded my thumbs up. It brought the animation out more, gluing me to my seat as I endured visual ecstasy. Even the swift fight scenes were brilliant, as expected from the gifted Kurou as well as those involved in battle alongside. Any fan of Death Note can understand that the art between the two animes are strikingly similar. Furthermore, the art was not overexaggerated at all. They were on the dot with their specific time periods, making the anime successfully attractive.~[S O U N D]~ [9]From the miraculous terror of the opening song to the soft tranquility of the ending, Kurozuka had played its music well. The flute and drums matched the ancient liveliness of Japanese culture. The instrumentals had presented the mood well as well as portraying the feel of scenes such as romantic moments, battles, times of agony, despair, hatred, et cetera. I knew what kind of scenes I was expecting from the sound. Nicely done.~[C H A R A C T E R]~ [7]I gave the development of characters a 7 due to the fact that I had expected more from their transformations. Moreover, I expecting a better explanation of the immortality concept. The manga explains more of it whilst the anime has left gaping holes for the viewers' minds to fill. Though Kurou was inconspicuous and monotonous in his expressions, we did have a sense of what he felt inside through his short monologues.

However like most series, this one starts of grand but eventually wanes as it progresses.It begins with the main protagonist, Kurou being pursued for reasons not explained and one intense action sequence later, he and his companion seek shelter in some mysterious woman’s home. Kurou soon develops feelings for this woman named Kuromitsu but soon after he discovers her dirty little secret. Another insanely gruesome action sequence later and the real story begins, as Kurou embarks...on an all new journey of immortality. All I can say is that the 1st episode was awesome but soon after that the biggest flaw in the story soon appears, as early as in the 2nd episode. It is the story’s timeline and when dealing with this concept of immortals living through the ages, it doesn’t help when things keep jumping from period to period, making it easy to lose track of what’s going on in the story (until the action sequences wake you up). Heck by episode four, I gave up on trying to figure out the chronological order of events and just followed Kurou on his unexplained journey to find Kuromitsu. The thing is that the story was actually decent but it was executed poorly, with chucks of major plot points left unexplained.Another thing wrong with this short series is its characters. Sure the main 2 were fairly interesting but Kuromitsu was as much of a mystery to Kurou as she was to those who watch this. As for Kurou, he would have been more interesting if he actually got some back-story and maybe showed some emotion, instead of those random outbursts. There are actually other characters to mention but they are so bland and uninteresting that I even struggle to remember their names 10mins after watching an episode.With all the bad stuff taken care of, discussing the animation is a nice change in direction, because it can be described simply as awesome. This anime seems to go for very aesthetically pleasing environments with a sort of grudge textured look and the heaps of CG that actually goes well with it. Not to forget the reason why I think of the animation as perfect, which are the action sequences that have obviously been influenced by a lot of things. As for the music the soundtrack is certainly fitting for the series; with a mixture of tranquil tunes and high-octane beats for any given situation.Overall Kurozuka proved to be an enjoyable hack ‘n’ slash fest but there are more than enough action sequences for even an action lover to be bored with and having a poorly executed storyline as an alternative isn’t good at all.  Trying to make sense of the messy story is like trying to solve a sudoku puzzle; make one mistake and you’ll have to backtrack to where things make sense. Having a lacklustre ending doesn’t help either but those who are able to ignore these flaws would still enjoy Kurozuka for its awesome action and interesting concept. on an all new journey of immortality.

A surreal and poetic journey that turns into something more profound than what it looks like”REVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!-STORY: 8-""KUROZUKA"" it’s a well-founded and rich story. Its narrative could divide people, some by saying it’s boring and unadorned –or complicated- and by others –like me- saying that is meaningful, metaphorical and gorgeous.The story of this show could be like a stream, whether it calls you, takes you and embraces you leading you swiftly –although, trough some “what the hell is happening here?” moments- across the tale or it rejects you for it isn’t a plain and simple story of vampires...and war, it is complex.-ART: 8-The art depicted in this show is marvelous. The designing of the characters is believable and the action scenes are appealing and not exaggerated like most of the vampire/action shows out there.-SOUND: 10-The voice acting is a jewel. It is passionate, it is deep. It’s calculated for the type of show that “KUROZUKA” is. The voice actors are believable since they’re transferring the feeling of solitude shown in the show through their voices.Meanwhile, the soundtrack has a dream-like ring to it. It’s a delicate mixture of instruments. It is cold, sad and dark, like a mirror of the situation the surrounds the characters and their own feelings.-CHARACTER: 7-The deepness carried through most of the show –superbly if I may add- in most of its features: Script, voice acting, art and soundtrack is something amazing, yet lacking within the character department. Don’t misunderstand me, the characters are well-defined, distinct and incredibly well depicted –and I liked them, to be honest- but there’s an important aspect that the show didn’t display, the “backbone” of the characters –or in other words, their backstory and development-. To put it bluntly the characters look like they’re just there, like a superfluous, convenient and momentary entertainment without a direction or reason, just a cause. But let us remember that this “cause” this “reason” IS the backbone and the main focus of the story, making the character development/background faintly unnecessary. After all, we as viewers we want to know about the characters we are watching, we want to get “closer” to them, we want to understand the: “why’s, the where’s and the when’s” of each characters, even if the story doesn’t really depend on such things, which is clearly the case of this show.-ENJOYMENT: 7 & OVERALL: 8-“KUROZUKA” is a difficult show to watch. As I said before is complex, and for moments it looks like the show doesn’t know where its leading, but the end it’s what makes it a whole. Is it enjoyble? Yes, a lot.

The story opened with great visuals and fantastic animation. I loved the kabuki openings which summarized previous events. In short, Kurozuka started with great promise.*If you\'re worried about spoilers, you should probably stop reading here.*Alas, that promise was quickly broken. I don\'t mind a bit of confusion when it serves the purpose of the story, especially when it originates authentically from the character\'s perspective. There\'s a limit, however, and Kurozuka drives past it, swerves off the road, careens down a mountainside, and explodes in a fantastically animated and entirely gratuitous fireball....I watched to the end, and as Kuro promised, all was revealed.  Unfortunately, the ending leaves us with a plot hole so large, Karuta could drive his magic bus through it. (Apologies for packing my driving metaphors so closely together.) So are the two main characters immortals or are they immortals and time travelers? Clearly, there\'s a time ""reset"" that happens in the last episode. This reset seems to fall into the category of ""wouldn\'t it be cool..."". In answer, ""No, it wouldn\'t."" Absolutely nothing in the previous episodes suggests a time spiral or Ouroboros or that little infinite loop of paper whose name escapes me at the moment. This is laziness or stupidity on the part of the writers.The show should be praised for it\'s interesting take on vampire folklore. And also for bringing a genuine touch of horror to the fate of the main character at the end. In spite of these good things, where\'s a barge of cliches loaded in this anime. Here\'s one I\'m f-n sick of: generic demonic bad-guy shoots tentacles or spikes from his/her body. This anime does this not once, but three frickin\' times with different characters. That\'s when the show became risible to me (or was it when Karuta turned his bus into a rocket and blasted up a nearly vertical drawbridge...).Speaking of characters... What characters? Another barge of cliches: The femme fatale. The dashing rogue. The hooker with a heart of gold. The amnesiac hero. Shall I go on? The ""best friend"" betrayer. The nature-magic wise-woman. The gun-wielding bad guy acting as foil to the katana-wielding good guy. The two main characters never really say much of anything. Why should I give one damn about anyone? When a certain chick gets bulls-eyed near the end, you know what I felt? Nothing. Not a thing FOR HER. I felt massive annoyance at the writers for f-n with me, but that\'s it. This is bad storytelling, simple. I don\'t have to like or love the characters, but I do have to be interested in them. Did not happen.Without a compelling story and characters whose fates we\'re interested in, excellent art and animation is purely gratuitous. I\'m sorry this anime sucked; I wanted to like it.Your mileage may vary. I watched to the end, and as Kuro promised, all was revealed.

Rated R -17+ and up For it contains: Mild nudity, Suggestive Themes, Boring Violence, Repeated Scene Effect, Ear Bleeding Laughter, Vampires of The Non-Twilight Kind, Zombies, Demons, Mutants, The Quest to Tap it and Blood. Lots of blood. Not so much Gore just blood. They seem to censor or magic pixie fuzz any or all of the gore out.As we go along it’s good to know that this show aired back in 2008 and was animated by Madhouse studios. Go Madhouse! Another thing to notice is the extreme skinny people and bazaar limb length that...you will see quite often in this show.Right off the bat you’re slammed with the power of the Annoying Red Haired Masked Man With Fan while he spurts out what seems to be haiku’s sung with extreme Old Man’ness. It doesn’t get any better… just more reoccurring.Now I shall touch a bit on the shows Intro. I’m not a fan of screamo or screecho or whatever the hell people wanna call it. It sounds like someone was trying to sing while getting their entire head shoved into a fully functioning blender. The beginning song only fits because of the fantastic animation along with it. Yup, that’s about it.As for the outro, if you haven’t already muted or closed the player then you will hear the sounds of a slow paced song set to ease your heart as you escape the sounds of the intro.But you will still quickly move onto the next episode as the voice starts to slowly annoy you also. It’s like softer, slower paced screamo. It still doesn’t work. Some people out there might like it. Good for you. But this is mah lazyman review and my opinion is “Me No Like”. Mmmkay?This show by far has THE MOST ANNOYING RECAP EVER DESIGNED.Remember that Annoying Red Haired Masked Man With Fan I mentioned earlier? Of course you do, How could you ever forget him. Well, he reappears every single episode.That’s right, out of the 12 episodes of this show, you see his ugly mug a minimum of 12 times. You actually see him more than just 12 times but I’m giving you a heads up on what to expect. But hey, at least you get to watch him throw that fan in the exact same way each and every episode and watch that fan land perfectly in the center of their organization symbol each and every damn time. Oh… wait… That’s pretty damn annoying as well now that I think about it.Moving right along the action of the show is almost enough for some to continue watching until the end. For others, you will most likely be dropping this by episode 3 if you haven’t already. The beginning was still pretty good at keeping you interested in the things you don’t quite yet understand about the show. But even that has a limitation.They try to pick up the pieces of the action by adding in slow motion and more Vampire like fight scenes. Which I must say, they did damn nicely. Although the whole inverted colour or heat detection mode is like you went back into the 60’s for some fun with colours. Ignoring the fact they almost all have the bone structure and appearance of malnourished basket ball players, the animation is freakin’ sweet. You can notice parts where they got a bit lazy and threw in a quick flash of white or black before they would change to the next part. It saddens me to see that potential go down the drain. Whos to say you can’t have good action in a romancy kind of theme? Well, for now, you might be right. At least in the case of Kurozuka.The characters start off as interesting works of art and are slowly left in the pools of blood you will most likely see them lying in. Kurou is a love struck fool who just happens to have the ability to kill anything he wants. Kuromitsu is a siren-vampire-terminator who just happens to accept guests. Benkei… is a monk. The Red Emperor is a man of song. Rai is a rebel prostitute. I could go on but the list is long and the jokes only get worse.At the end of watching it all… I felt the ending was pretty damn bleh. Sure, I understood the bits the show left everywhere for us to pick up and understand like a trail of candy eggs. It just didn’t solve anything it may have explained it but there was no actual solution. It’s like hitting the reset button instead of wondering why you have to hit that button and working at the problem from there.The Story gets 6 Rusted Samurai Swords.The Animation gets 8 Gallons of Blood.The Sound gets 5 and a half Screams of Terror.The Characters gets 6 Close Up Shots.Overall the show should hold a 7 but it falls short of that mark and is left with the bitter taste of 6 Fans of the Red Emperor. you will see quite often in this show.Right off the bat you’re slammed with the power of the Annoying Red Haired Masked Man With Fan while he spurts out what seems to be haiku’s sung with extreme Old Man’ness.

In some ways, it is either more or less than the sum of its parts, depending on the point of whoever is watching it.The story is presented in a manner which involves a lot of flashbacks, dream sequences which are not clearly distinguished from reality, surreal imagery, explicated metaphor... in short, it is overwhelmingly confusing.Even after watching the entire series, all I can say about the plot is that it is designed to mess with my head... anything else is questionable, so even if I wasn\'t wary of spoilers, I can\'t really give you any...details (I mean, I could, but, not really).If you\'ve watched Serial Experiments Lain, or Memento, then this probably belongs in a similar category in terms of the way the story is presented as a plot.Sound, Art:both Great! (9/10)The sound and art have very high production values... but I would put the Art one step below perfect because, although somewhat intentional, they are so many time-jumps that not only the story, but even the action is at times difficult to follow.The characters... (8/10)well, they are somewhat well developed but I really had to think about that for a bit. For certain, it is an interesting way of presenting common themes by changing various details... so I will just say that the characters are very well thought out, but are overshadowed a bit by the non-linear presentation and even the ""flashiness"" of the art style.They are few ""slice of life"" moments in this series, so it is hard to connect to even the main characters... even when background history is being given, it is usually in the midst of a battle or tense situation.Enjoyment... (7/10)Ouch, my head hurts!I appreciate that the production values were high, and the plot was well thought out and spans a vary long time... but at the same time, I had to just stop the series and go to watch something else, whilst my brain adjusted to ""normal time flow"", least I start walking backwards or something.In that sense, I enjoyed it less than the more linear (in terms of time presentation, but perhaps, more incomplete in terms of story details) Serial Experiments Lain... and there was so much going on, involving several major ""players"", that I actually found Memento easier to follow.Overall... (8/10)I would say this series is very good, but its presentation pace will overwhelm even people who like non-linear story presentation (anyone who claims different, just shut off their brain or something and is lying to themselves), and the ambiguous ending sparks more questions... unlike Serial Experiments Lain, which I have re-watched several times, I am deeply hesitant to even glance at Kurozuka again... it does something to stretch the mind, but perhaps in ways that it would be best not to attempt too often.If ""Ringu"" and Serial Experiments Lain are mindfucks, then this is a hardcore mind-gang-rape... but by a very beautiful flock of fangirls.Or something. details (I mean, I could, but, not really).If you\'ve watched Serial Experiments Lain, or Memento, then this probably belongs in a similar category in terms of the way the story is presented as a plot.Sound, Art:both Great!

I really support and like some points made, but the show itself is of pretty poor quality at most times.You don’t know what to expect when you dive into Kurozuka. While this is true for a lot of other anime as well, Kurozuka is a special enigma. Being about vampires (especially the main leads) can turn people off, seeing how vampires are often portrayed nowadays. Sadly, thoughts hop to Rob Pattinson as Edward in the cringe-inducing soft pornography for girls known as Twilight. Sure, Twilight isn’t the only sinner, but due to it’s popularity, it is the most...stand-out. Onwards to Kurozuka, then.On first on-look, Kurozuka seems to be a love story about vampires, set in Feudal Japan. That preconception is quickly smashed to bits after the first episodes as we skip to a bleak future version of Japan that has been a-bombed. Back in the past, our hero Kuro (known as “Minamoto no Yoshizune”, a very famous and popular Japanese literature hero) was fleeing into the mountains, and came upon the lodging of Lady Kuromitsu. He and his close ally Benkei were allowed to stay under the condition that they do not approach nor enter Kuromitsu’s room. Of course, that promise doesn’t mean all too much and Kuro finds himself outside the mysterious woman’s room, where he sees her biting and drinking the blood of a man. The place is attacked, and Kuro is badly hurt helping his hostess. The two had quickly became attracted to one another, and Kuromitsu offers Kuro eternal life with her. Kuro accepts. Then the focus shifts to the future where Kuro has become separated from Kuromitsu and ventures to find her. He instead meets Karuta and Rai and becomes embroiled in what is basically a civil war between the Red Army and the rebels, both fighting for the very prize Kuro seeks: Kuromitsu.I was pretty excited to watch this, as it felt like vampires were treated as a big deal and it also seemed like a cool set-up for a powerful romantic saga, but alas, all the potential amounted to jack shit in this absolute train-wreck of a series.The series jumps from different time periods, usually at the start of episodes, without giving the viewer much warning or explanation, which is the major flaw of the series in my opinion. It’s very hard to get a grip on the characters as is, so there’s really no need to confuse viewers additionally.It’s hard to gauge what exact powers are afforded to the vampires of the series, as Kuro just seems to go all Goku on people at times when he needs to put another gear in. Besides obviously being more powerful than normal humans, there doesn’t seem to be much to vampires, other than whatever odd time dilution Kuro can cause when convenient. It’s never really explained what they can do. The reveal of how they work is also incredibly slow-played, so there’s not much in the way of flavour being given to us, except for some bursts of information at times.As is the case with the vampirism angle, characters in the series don’t really develop. They’re very static in personalities and in what they do. Not even the main character ever develops, he just learns more about who he was. Frankly it’s very disappointing, because when things happen to our tragic heroes, it’s hard to care about them as they’ve just been one-dimensional plot-points. That can work if you have strong characters to begin with, but as noted, these characters are dull as hell. You also get some unintentional comedy in the absolutely bonkers scientist with a penchant for torture, who starts quoting Stoker (because you have to fucking shoehorn that into a vampire show like your life depended on it) and Tolstoy, and is generally weird as hell.The story is equally odd. Parts of it just comes and goes as it pleases, like there’s a revolving door of relevance. It really is hard to care about what is happening when you don’t grasp the relevance of events to one-another. Characters just do complete one-eighties in order to provide more filler before the end finally arrives. It really is a shame, because it felt like it was to be a show that made vampires rather cool again, but the amount of plot-holes and contrivances really do get in the way of enjoying it. All of the reveals towards the end just made me laugh out loud with their increasing craziness, until we arrive in bizarro-world come the ending.Visually, it’s very pleasing for most of the time and there is a lot of incredible imagery, but then you get some absolutely retarded character designs that feel like they invaded from another series.The sound design is pretty decent, but many characters in the series are woefully miscast and a lot of the performances are really bad. The soundtrack, however, is pretty damn awesome. Both the OP and ED are great.Now, I’ve been shitting on Kurozuka a lot, but the final episode shows up and delivers the best possible ending the series could have had and I really freaking loved it, so I'm ultimately torn on where to go with the series; good or bad? Ultimately, with all the tomfoolery, I’ll go with bad, but there’s certainly enough good in here that a person that disagrees with what I found negative would find this to be a damn good show. It also increases my frustration with the series’ unfulfilled potential. The run-time of the entire thing is way too long relative to what it’s trying to convey. Honestly, remake this in film-length and condense the story a bit, and I’ll watch the hell out of it. I’m totally behind the point it makes about love and selfishness and I actually came away from it rather liking the vampire concept, but the length and general poor quality makes most of the series unbearable to watch. stand-out.

Sure the first 2 episodes were terrific. Great gore, great action and a bit of romance. However everything goes downhill. The anime is very confusing. There's many flashbacks which appear without warning which is confusing. Powers and abilities of all of these characters are poorly poorly explained. There's times when the anime doesn't make sense. The anime is a trainwreck.But to make matters even worst the ending is a catastrophe. You have not a clue what's going on at all. You don't know if time reset and a continuous loop happens, you don't know whether time is continuing or whether...Kuro actually gets that actual body. I'm sorry for putting in spoilers but this anime is a bellyache. I wouldn't recommend watching this EVER! Kuro actually gets that actual body. I'm sorry for putting in spoilers but this anime is a bellyache. I wouldn't recommend watching this EVER!"", ""I first watched this anime a few years ago out of boredom when I couldn't find anything else to watch, and I'm so glad I did! Now it's definitely ranked as one of my favorites.The balance of action & romance is perfect. The storyline is interesting, and leaves you wanting more. Rarely if ever a dull moment. It's definitely one of the first I would recommend. "", 'Although this series has a reputation of being confusing, it\'s actually very straightforward—it\'s just that the first three or so episodes are jumping around to different time periods, relying on flashbacks, peculiar editing, unfinished plot threads, a bizarre head trip where the main character doesn\'t know who he is, and jumbling it all up to create what looks to be a non-linear, experimental anime, but this doesn\'t last.We begin in 12th century Japan, and the story specific to the characters of Kuro and Benkei remains superficial. There is some kind of feud between warring factions and Kuro is on the run. These elements fade...into the background as Kuro develops an unhealthy obsession with an immortal vampire woman. Most of the male characters end up becoming enamored with her.The gore and visuals of these segments bring to mind Shigurui, but that doesn\'t last long—we\'re briefly transported to WWII Japan in what is little more than a battle sequence—then straight to a cyberpunk world reminiscent of Texhnolyze. I suspect there was a fair amount of influence from that series and there are also many aesthetic similarities, right down to using the katana as a symbol.About the only thing this show has going for it are the aesthetics. The music is a mixture of traditional Japanese folk and modern electronics. Both feudal Japan and the bombed-out wasteland are drawn lavishly. The animation is mostly smooth enough, although there are occasional icky CGI bits and moments with typical TV sluggishness. The directing form the Attack on Titan director is also solid. It\'s the characters and the script that are the main problems.1,000+ years apparently weren\'t kind to the immortal main character, as he behaves like an amnesiac, yet he doesn\'t necessarily seem to be written as a true amnesiac. The way the show is edited early on with these time skips, gives the impression that the main\'s journey through time and space is non-linear, but he seems to be subjected to very intense visions and flashbacks.The one and only motivation or interest he has in life is his immortal lover, Kuromitsu, and he spends the entire series hunting her down—yet he doesn\'t seem to remember or know anything about her. This is despite the two of them supposedly having been together for many centuries.

I would hesitate to call any of the characters archetypes or even criticize them as being flat. These are poorly written character sketches at best. They\'re just completely empty, and they don\'t have anything insightful to say, nor do they have notable motivations. Most of the males other than the main either want Kuromitsu\'s attention or want to become super mutants. Kuon\'s role here is especially stupid.The terrible script consists of the characters going from point A to B and back, flashy fight sequences with loads of plot armor and zero tension, and just random gibberish about a red army that spans all the way back to the 12th century or earlier that wants Kuromitsu\'s blood, so they can become immortal and continue on to the next step of evolution. The exact relationship of the red army to the city is not adequately explained, but they kill people at random or abduct them to perform experiments on them.Then there\'s the intoxicating stupidity and obsession of the ""love"" between the two main characters. They\'re so banal and empty as characters and seemingly know nothing about each other. There\'s also a reason we have short lifespans. Can you imagine anyone being so alluring that you fawn over them for 1,000 years? For what? To be loved, to love? To touch her hair and kiss her and string together poetry? uwu. It would be about the same if the main character spent 1,000 years looking at porn or sending money to e-thots on Only Fans. This shallow undying romance stuff just makes me want to hurl. Think about what a man could accomplish with immortality, and he spends that time staring at her and asking to kiss her boo boos. What a loser.While there is a plot twist at the end that adds a little more poignancy, and creates somewhat of a ghastly rumination on immortality and mortality and the possibility of a cyclical plight for the main character, if not just another confused recollection on his part... what I described above does hold up as the reality for one of the characters. Kuromitsu is a beauty to be sought after, and that\'s it. There\'s no reason for her to be sought for, however. She\'s so indescribably dull, and this kind of allure was pulled off better in Babylon—but at least that character didn\'t have to draw the men in for eternity.A central problem is that the series has so little plot and so much action—this story could have easily been summed-up in half the time, and we would lose nothing—then we might be closer to a mediocre production rather than this poor offering of a series. into the background as Kuro develops an unhealthy obsession with an immortal vampire woman.

Do not take that statement lightly.At the beginning of this anime (for what seems several episodes) it is extremely hard to stay interested because of the perspective the story. It does however, change so that the watcher can follow along and begin making sense of the earlier scenes.Considering the actual content of the anime, the story was interesting with intriguing art. The action primarily in the middle of the anime is fairly graphic, which was almost unexpected... But very entertaining.Saying those few things, I appreciate the different approach in story telling, however...daunting it was. It almost makes me think they did it so the watcher would be as dazed and confused as the main character. I stayed long enough to get past it because of the art and the hints of mystery at the beginning. The mysteriousness was redundant, but the redundancy serves a purpose.Overall I would recommend this more to those who are primarily interested in action, thrillers or just up for something different. I do think it is good though, and worth watching for its other aspects. Even though it contains supernatural mystery the action is what you would probably stay for, because the mystery takes a bit to reveal itself...

By the second or third episode I confirmed in my mind that I had indeed already completed Kurozuka & my uncertainty wasn't due to confusion or imagined deja vu- but due to themes of eternity, reality, fate and life and death and life again being wonderfully executed in the story telling. The unclear progression & perception of truth all succeeded in making this Alice in Wonderland- Ergo Proxy journey enthralling (Brownster's 'engrossing' was well chosen).

Maybe.Anywhoo.Let's say you're a toppled Japanese Lord running from demonic usurpers in the chilling mountains with your seemingly loyal retainer and stumble upon a large manor presided over by a beautiful woman who is all alone in this dangerous climate. Moreso, this woman is completely willing to let you spend the night on one request: don't go into her personal chambers only to discover her getting her freak on with a bloody corpse...Clearly no good will come of wanting to have sex with her and be her eternal lovemonkey slave...because she'll cut your head off and you'll be forced to time travel through apocalyptic worlds in endless search of this demon who on one hand lavishes her love upon you and on the other endlessly eludes you.So that's the premise. Kuro, the retainer dude, becomes an immortal vampire head thing, and searches for the mysterious Kuromitsu vampire chick across time--falling in love over and over again. There are some Jade Empire guys who eternally seek her because her blood can make you immortal, but there's a catch (isn't there always). And there are some recurring characters that span the ages, but it's all confusing and contrived, and irrelevant to the main story.The style of this is clearly retro cyberpunk with new production values. There's a hint of Ninja Scroll and Fist of the North star in the character designs, backdrops, and apocalyptic wasteland. There is over the top bloody violence, and the fight scenes are nicely done. Also, there is the classic theme of a ragtag band of adventurers seeking a princess in a castle taken by a dark lord (which more or less describes the generic cast of extras that follow Kuro along--but most have amusing traits, like the quiet and ruthless Kuon who seems to remember useless details about kids cartoon with great enthusiasm).There isn't much to the plot, just the endless pursuit of Kuromitsu and the typical Demon-play we've come to expect, but the character design is creative and the pacing is decent. There are flashbacks, which add to the timeless plight of Kuro and his amesia (the core of the premise), but overall this is just a grindhouse flick so there's little to fault on something that isn't being too pretentious.Of note there's an amusing episode that totally goes overboard in regard to a bag of shit and a wheelchair (you may not want to see it, now that I think about it).With all that said, the ending polarizes you. I hated it the first time, the second I decided to accept that it wasn't that bad to reiterate the central theme of pursuing an unreachable goddess.Make up your own minds. because she'll cut your head off and you'll be forced to time travel through apocalyptic worlds in endless search of this demon who on one hand lavishes her love upon you and on the other endlessly eludes you.So that's the premise.

The plot is a complete and total clusterfuck and does not even begin to make sense no matter which way you look at it. If the ending says what I think it says, being Kuro is the worst hell.

The art is really well polished, on par with Hellsing Ultimate.Animation: Smooth fight scenes, lots of slow-motion and special effects.

The show follows the relationship between an immortal woman who tuns her lover into an immortal. Now the main story is what happens when a man fells deeply involved with a very toxic narcissistic woman. I think it serves as a warning to men in general to stay away from crazy women. I think they did a great job with the animation and the sound. I am unsure why but they do not seem to drop clues at proper intervals so...for people that do not have a great intuition everything will be revealed in the last two episodes.

This only meant to be a metaphor and not my opinion of the source material, which was a novel, turned manga, turned anime. I haven’t read those (which are hear are far more entertaining) and I am only going to talk about the anime version.So basically, the problem with this show is that it lacks context. And by that, I do not mean action, cool looking warriors, explosions, and the like. It has lots...of it and it is artistic up to a point to boot. The problem is that it lacks ANYTHING ELSE other than that. The characters never manage to become sympathetic to you, the story is simple and still manages to be confusing, and there are no oversexualized lolis and boobs all over the screen every five minutes to keep you interested into watching just for that. As cool as the action and the cinematics are, people would gladly choose something with no action and no art, as long as it has likable characters and erotic service.The production values are downright amazing as long as superficial looks go. This is Madhouse we are talking about and it poured lots of cash to make everything look eye-catchy, dynamic, and cool, with lots of cinematics and artistic overtones, ranging from a traditional Japan to a futuristic steampunk dystopia. They even went as far as deliberately drawing characters in an almost grotesque way, with spider legs and bizarre faces as to further make it look special. The action scenes are also very good to stare since they are usually very brutal and gory, while the soundtrack and the voice acting fill in just fine.Most who watched the first episode were simply amazed and impatiently waited to see what follows next. And then they watched the second episode… and then the third… and then most lost interest. Why? THERE IS NO CONTEXT! Why is everything happening, for which reason, why should we care, and how long can we just be content with fancy visuals and over the top action? Everything and everyone are downright basic.- The setting switching from past to future has been done numerous times in the past, mostly in videogames, and the result is always the same: It looks good as a button-mashing action game but it sure as hell makes a boring story.- The characters are distant from the viewer; they feel too unsympathetic, cold, stuck on a one-track mind. Most of them are nothing but mass produced freaks without personality, existing only to be killed by the hero who simply looks for someone major to kill. That is all.- For most of the duration, all you see is the hero going around, butchering freaks, and gathering bits of confusing information that by the end of the series don’t even offer anything of importance. It’s just all about finding the Big Bad and to off him/her; all the rest of the plot is a completely uncaring-for-the-viewer witness of repetitive search and destroy missions. It gets boring really fast.- The action, as cool as it may be, still is too unreal and over the top to tolerate for many episodes. Improbable motions, scene mistakes, injuries not being important, and characters doing some really basic mistakes for the sake of the script pile up so fast that you can’t ignore them after a few episodes. And since the action is about a distant super warrior and a bunch of faceless freaks, there is no emotional bond with all that happens and again you have no reason to keep watching.There you have it, a show that tries to pass as cool without first winning your sympathy. This is why I always say the characters are the backbone of any series; if you don’t care about them, then you might as well be watching a WW2 documentary. A similar title which did the same mistake is the “Highlander: The Search for Vengeance” movie; equally flashy without any actual context (and duration) to back it up. A title which did it right though is Samurai Champloo; it has a simplistic plot but its characters are very likable early on and you watch for THEM and not the two-lines-long story.I do not recommend this anime.

For those who are unsure of what, precisely, pertains to being an idealist. An idealist is simply someone who is guided by an ideal rather then (a) practical purpose or consideration. I don\'t wish to be rich simply because being rich is more practical to being poor- no. I want to be wealthy because I chase an ideal that emphasizes that being affluent will help me end my lifelong pursuit of happiness. It other words, I believe being wealthy is not the be-all/end-all, and that being rich will not directly result in happiness. There has to be...something else- an ideal- that would be better accomplished through being wealthy. For me, that ideal would be raising a family. A consequentialist, on the other hand, would simply do anything necessary to accomplish his/her goal. (In this case, being rich.) Let\'s just say we were both struggling businessman. The practitioner would be willing to screw over both other businessman as well as customers simply to accomplish the goal of racketeering as much profit as possible. However, as an idealist, the goal of making money is secondary to the ideal. Even in the face of financial difficulty, that ideal is not sacrificed. It remains constant, whether the idealist becomes wealthy or not.You, the reader, are probably wondering at this point why the hell am I going so deep into Idealism vs. Consequentialist in an Anime review. (After all, this is not a Philosophy lecture.) If that is the case- You, dear reader, are absolutely correct. The reason, to put it simply, is that ties directly into my review. It is the point of view I had going into this anime. It\'s vitally important that you, the reader, understand that. When I viewed Kurozuka, I didn\'t necessarily just see it singularly as a product, but also as the ideal is represents. One must remember that Anime, after all, is a form of art. As a product, I\'ll be the first to admit that it\'s a very lackluster series. However for the emotional impact (Think of the primary ""WTF"" feeling it gives you.) it succeeded -very- well; leaving me thinking back to this show days after it had ended. This, obviously, makes this show a bit of a paradox to review. Worry not, though- after hours of contemplation I finally feel resolve with my opinion of this show. I will share it to you now.Just like we start any story, (Regardless of the medium) I wish to start my review from the point by which everything else starts to fall into place- the beginning. In the beginning, Kurozuka was the literal incarnation of perfection. If the show had finished as strongly as first forty minutes, then this could have been one of -the- anime classics of our generation. It\'s sad, really. Idealistically; Practically; it does not matter. There is no debate, and there is no question. Both realistically and literally this show has more or less one of the greatest opening sequences of all time. (A sequence many other anime, such as Beserk, Gungrave, and Ga Rei Zero have all tried but haven\'t gotten quite right.) But, alas, as the saying goes, \'The Brightest Flame burns the fastest.\' So soon does the bright light all but disappear.*Minor spoilers ahead.*The main premise of this show is that of a journey of two immortal lovers who can not die. (Sounds interesting, right?) In the beginning, we see how the two primary characters meet and fall in love with each other. We start with a prince named Kuro who has suffered the ultimate price of being royalty- death. His family\'s political enemies want him dead, and have chased him from his home. Death chases him wherever he goes- and because of that, he\'s always on the run. However he already knows it\'s only a matter of time. (We even see him tell his assistant that he should simply kill him so he could survive.) The story starts when, having just barley survived an ambush- he takes shelter in a remote home in the mountains. It\'s there that he meets Kuromitsu; a beautiful woman who agrees to let the two fugitives take shelter in her home- on the single condition that they do not go into the basement. However, soon after Benkei- Kuro\'s loyal assistant- leaves to find medicine for the injured and sick Kuro, the house is attacked. One thing leads to another, and Kuro finds himself killed protecting Kuromitsu. Because he was the only person Kuromitsu had ever met who hadn\'t been afraid of her, and protected her, she makes him an offer to ""chase eternity,""- together with her forever.The only problem (And this is were this series starts to go downhill.) is that things do not go according to plan. Kuro, before he could become fully immortal, is betrayed and killed by Benkei- his loyal assistant and fellow warrior. Instead of chasing eternity with Kuromitsu; Kuro finds himself stuck in a loop where, though he is immortal and can not die, he has no body- and must change bodies every 100 years. (Or he really will die.) When he changes bodies, for whatever reason, Kuro also loses his memories. The show (or the rest of the ten or so episodes) starts about a two thousand years later. The world has ended and started again, and Kuro is still afflicted with his curse. Since he lost his memories, for about nine episodes we see Kuro do nothing but search for a woman whom he scantly remembers; (Kuromitsu.) only seeing her through random flashbacks. Literally, nearly nothing happens plot wise for the entire series up until the very last episode. In the very last episode, it is revealed in a climactic revelation that Kuromitsu had planned to finally break Kuro free of the cycle, which had plagued their chasing of eternity. Her plan failed, but being an immortal she simply made herself content to try again. And so, the show ends right where the series starts.In the entire 12 episodes that this series encompasses, there is only about three episodes worth of story. In fact, this show would have done much better as a five episode anime short; like Afro Samurai. Or, even better, as a movie. (Like Ninja Scroll, which this show is clearly based off of.) If that had been the case- the score of this show would have undoubtably been in the eight to ten range. Sure, it would overshadowed and constantly compared to the earlier examples, (Afro Samurai and Ninja Scroll) but by being too ambitious and dragging out this story much longer then it should have been- this show only served to bring itself crashing down.Again, unfortunately, this is not the case. This story is not told in a hundred-minute movie or a five episode anime short. The reality is we, the viewers, are left hanging around watching about nine and a half straight episodes of absolutely nothing but action. Sure, the action\'s good. Sure, we are introduced to really cool villains and get some strong backstory on them so that they are relatable. But this show, in my humble opinion, presents the action secondary to the plot. When the show (seemingly randomly) shifts focus from being an amazing story to simply being nothing except a series of amazing action scenes; I think there isn\'t a single viewer out there that didn\'t feel left out. To tell you the truth, I felt like breaking down and crying at the missed potential.  And yet, the action is what encompasses and highlights the majority of this show. So it makes it very hard for me (as an idealist) to judge this show based off the assumption it was meant to be a story-related show. In hindsight, and after much contemplation, it\'s really quite clear (Though I don\'t want to believe it.) that this show was never meant to be known or remembered for its story. One only has to refer to the absurdly choreographed action scenes, or the sudden and random use of slapstick humor, or the restart ending. (The only reason that I could come up with for a complete restart ending is so they could continue the non-stop action in a potential second season- which would have undoubtedly been created had this show been positively received and/or successful.)I know at this point I should go into other detailed aspects of this show. The action, the characters, the sound. But it\'s really all unnecessary at this point. All the side characters are simply there to continue the action. (Old wise woman states that Kuromitsu is being held somewhere else? Sorry, all that really did for me was remind me of how Toad would tell the player that Peach was in a different castle in the original Super Mario Bros.)  There is no story related to them; and it didn\'t take a genius to figure out what their fates were going to be once the show (unsurprisingly) started killing them off. The sound, with the exception of extremely rare cases like Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo- where they serve to be a deeply rooted theme found in the very foundation of the show- is simply something that exists to most of the time... A necessary burden for most TV series to help portray what they want to portray. This show is no exception. The sound simply wasn\'t exceptional or memorable. The sound didn\'t serve to be a deeply-rooted theme of the show, and there were no catchy soundtracks that one would want to go back and listen to. (Like in Black Lagoon or Darker then Black.) The animation was good, perhaps even great. However, the extreme feeling of disappointment I felt whilst watching this show all but cancels out the otherwise superb choreography and animation.In conclusion, I recommend watching this show only if you really want to see what missed potential looks like. Never before have I seen something THIS close on the edge of greatness or glory. Perhaps if one were addicted to Ninja Scroll-type sword action and had all but exhausted all other options... (Very unlikely.) then perhaps they would be interested in watching this show. However, for everyone else- this show will not do anything for you except give you a depressed feeling of missed opportunity.Thanks for reading,Blitzburns4 something else- an ideal- that would be better accomplished through being wealthy.

However, for everyone else- this show will not do anything for you except give you a depressed feeling of missed opportunity.Thanks for reading,Blitzburns4', ""Kurozuka was a potentially intriguing story that whiffed due to hollow characters, a stuffy atmosphere, and a confusing, labyrinthine story that attempts to provide you with food for thought that's mostly (unfortunately) made of rubber.  I don't believe it's worth your time.As is tradition, the art in this anime is pretty good, courtesy of Madhouse.  The inclusion of CG is as close to flawless as possible, with one or two moments that stick out a little bit, but overall was very well done.  The sound was pretty standard and did its job, although the use of the stormtrooper laser rifle sound during...sword fights in a few later episodes was weird and threw me out for a bit.  Together these create a fairly tense, serious atmosphere that may have become excellent if the story had the chops to match, but it doesn't;  In fact, it reminds me quite a bit of Shigurui in that the atmosphere is almost too stuffy to let me comfortably enjoy the story.  It was overdone, and loses points for the attempt.The characters...I'm honestly not sure where to begin.  Kurou is as bland as they come, and is supposed to be the generic-ish protagonist that allows us to jump into his shoes and suffer through the same confusion he does - to feel the same feelings of anger and frustration, love and longing, but most of the time he just feels like a disconnected zombie.  Had we felt more of his struggle, love, yearning, desires, or past, it may have been possible to connect with him, but we received none.  Kuromitsu is much the same - hollow - and the beginnings of their relationship in the first episode just lack a certain...connection.  A relationship which lacks substance at its core doesn't allow the viewer to get attached to it, and is one of the main flaws of the series (and turned into a great disappointment for me, as I'm a huge fan of a love story).  Had their flaws lined up to cover each other, or their stories met in the middle with a need or desire that fit perfectly, this could've been amazing...but none of that existed...so it wasn't.  The supporting characters come and go with little impact other than being minor plot devices.  The storyline(s) tend to jump back and forth, which is a bit confusing when you first encounter a new one, and it takes an episode to accept where you are and what's going on.  That was exciting at first, but as it progresses it fails to fulfill on the fascinating premise it puts forth.I've struggled quite a bit internally as to whether I should attempt to discuss the most interesting parts of the anime, but I really, really don't want to spoil anything for you.  I would like to say, however, that as potentially interesting as they could've been, or should've been, or I would've liked them to have been, they don't meet expectations.  They do not make this worth watching.  The first four episodes or so left me interested, fascinated, yearning for more, and then as I watched more episodes, what I wanted just never showed up.  The end arrived not with fanfare and revelation, or intrigue and shock, but like a scoop of icecream falling from your cone onto hot pavement.  The icecream is your time.  Don't let it melt away with this anime. sword fights in a few later episodes was weird and threw me out for a bit.  Together these create a fairly tense, serious atmosphere that may have become excellent if the story had the chops to match, but it doesn't;  In fact, it reminds me quite a bit of Shigurui in that the atmosphere is almost too stuffy to let me comfortably enjoy the story.  It was overdone, and loses points for the attempt.The characters...I'm honestly not sure where to begin.  Kurou is as bland as they come, and is supposed to be the generic-ish protagonist that allows us to jump into his shoes and suffer through the same confusion he does - to feel the same feelings of anger and frustration, love and longing, but most of the time he just feels like a disconnected zombie.  Had we felt more of his struggle, love, yearning, desires, or past, it may have been possible to connect with him, but we received none.  Kuromitsu is much the same - hollow - and the beginnings of their relationship in the first episode just lack a certain...connection.  A relationship which lacks substance at its core doesn't allow the viewer to get attached to it, and is one of the main flaws of the series (and turned into a great disappointment for me, as I'm a huge fan of a love story).  Had their flaws lined up to cover each other, or their stories met in the middle with a need or desire that fit perfectly, this could've been amazing...but none of that existed...so it wasn't.  The supporting characters come and go with little impact other than being minor plot devices.  The storyline(s) tend to jump back and forth, which is a bit confusing when you first encounter a new one, and it takes an episode to accept where you are and what's going on.  That was exciting at first, but as it progresses it fails to fulfill on the fascinating premise it puts forth.I've struggled quite a bit internally as to whether I should attempt to discuss the most interesting parts of the anime, but I really, really don't want to spoil anything for you.  I would like to say, however, that as potentially interesting as they could've been, or should've been, or I would've liked them to have been, they don't meet expectations.  They do not make this worth watching.  The first four episodes or so left me interested, fascinated, yearning for more, and then as I watched more episodes, what I wanted just never showed up.

I think this anime was comical, but, I also feel like it was rushed and not really...put together well, I believe some parts were.

But there are some series that have our imaginations soar, that have those thought-provoking questions, allowing both anime- and non-anime fans to dig deeper with the theoretical discussions they offer.This, and I would not be surprised while having a discussion with a fan of director Tetsuo Araki that we both agree Attack on Titan is one of our least favorite Araki-directed shows for that matter.

Only lightly touched upon, most of these antagonists are masked, rarely show their faces, and rarely have a lot of dialogue - this, however, makes it twice more terrifying; and provides a lot more attention on it's two important characters: Kuro and Kuromitsu.The female character Kuromitsu exhibits a vulnerable side, providing a deep sense of 3-dimensionality with the very first episode when she apologizes to the main protagonist for her horrifying thirst for human flesh.Fast forward, the future. After Kuro's incident with Kuromitsu, he becomes immortal and must battle an army that is looking for Kuromitsu's blood. This transitioning from a spiritualistic cult to an army using advanced sciences, is an aspect of the series that causes for speculation.The time and space that Kurozuka captures methodically wants us viewers to be more curious, and introspect with questions similar to the experiences had with Death Note and Aoi Bungaku.My nerdish side for Araki-directed anime wants the famous animator to go back to this really thought-provoking and philosophical stuff and that meanwhile provides a throwback to some 90s anime when the OVAs were more inspiring, more often than not, cutting-edge - which is really now conflicted by the streaming format.

The ending wasn\'t even bittersweet like you would expect, either; it was just bitter. Also, how the hell this got classified under ""Romance"", I\'ll never know. The first two episodes could be considered romance, but anything beyond that is definitely not romance, and it\'s misleading as hell to classify it as such.I don\'t mind how the story was non-linear, or how almost every...character was one-dimensional...

There's a beautiful looking Prince and an immortal and equally stunning looking vampire who fall in love with each other and these two vs the world. There are some anime that go deep into the characters when so little characters are of essence but that is not needed in here.

This anime directions are very weak... i'm totally confused during the flashback & illusion... are they the same? i really want to understand, do kuromitsu love kurou? if yes, how & when? the story doesn't convincing me at all, if the romance between them started when they met eye to eye, it's a poor-executive especially to show they love each other thats why its so plain & too dull for the plot to...go forward. Kurou partner (Benkei) decapitate him then what happen next, did he runaway? did he explain to kuromitsu? he's not confessing his love? why does he work with red army, does love made him go crazy? maybe yes as we can see he confessed her (12episode) but its not effective at all for the plot... its full of overused of suspension & mysteries. she fell after getting shot during WW2 (1945) later kuruta team extract blood form her and guard it then izuna used it during emergency & die, why was he's so obsessed? kurimitsu was captured? the cave people was killed by the old guy & ivy girl working for the red army to capture kurimitsu who is working with the red army to crate her new body for kurou with the support of Red army leader who doesn't care if kurou dead or alive...  after kurimitsu was carried away after she fell (after getting shots) according to karuta & saniwa (when they explain to kurou) said after 20years later i.e. present day, what the hell? means 1965 this events took place? how is it so modern? the looks of the story seems like kuromitsu just playing with kurou as a play thing, she's like a child who love her play thing too much then play with it forever. In one scene kurimitsu said she had given blood to someone once by letting him bite her neck while they are naked, turns out he's Kuon all along even though he was create during 1962 or 1963 (if present day took place 1965), the scene when kuon met original kuon was just to set up that kuon clone will go crazy just to let him know the truth about himself & it seem he remember he love kurimitsu? also we did not see his dead body after falling (when kurou intend to loose his hand grip), does this mean kurou relives in a loop, fight the same enemy with the same fate again and again, thats even worst to moved the plot forward. In this anime do they work with magic or science i don't know its not clear at all, seems they do magic then with science ... its a supernatural beings covert with science tech, its ridiculous, there's only a few animes outthere that 'magic & science' were put in a plot & worked, many failed including this one. i guess my opinion on this because the anime was made only 12 episodes so that the plot sped it up but i'm pretty sure it will be an absurd version if it was made 24 episodes or another 2-3seasons continued, its too boring if they extend the plot.Overall: i'd say the anime have a potential to be a fine one especially episode one its 10/10 i love it then episode 2 to 6 its a 2/10 (awfully bad) but what irritates me the most was the goddamn flashback... is it really happening or an illusion? this really disappoint me. go forward.

Macross Flash Back 2012,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1504/Macross_Flash_Back_2012,"[""This OVA is a treat for the Macross fan, best viewed after having watched the original series and Do You Remember Love. It brings closure to the Hikaru, Misa, and Minmei stories through the Macross series' keystone, music. Lynn Minmei's songs are presented through a series of music videos, most of which use footage from the TV series and movie. However the best is saved for last. My favorite part of the new animation is when Minmei is visiting the stage before departing and she has a vision of Hikaru and Misa appearing to show their support for her before the sequence transitions to the...concert and departure of the Megaroad-01. I have to rate Character as only Fair since the viewer is assumed to already be familiar with the source material and thus there isn't that much development other than of Minmei's. concert and departure of the Megaroad-01.

I think it’s supposed to be about the pointlessness of war, but I wish they’d just kept all real life imagery out of it in the first place.At the very end of Flashback 2012, we get the proper ending to the DYRL movie.

NieA Under 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/800/NieA_Under_7,"[""Crazy to me that this show is rated under a 7 with 6000 views. This is a simple show with simple humor, art, and characters. It's like eating tasty food with a goofy old friend from grade school. Every episode leaves you feeling relaxed and happy to carry on your own normal life.Watched this because I loved Serial Experiments Lain, and while in some ways this show is the absolute opposite, both shows aesthetically deliver in their own way through relate-able looks and feels. Recommended for adults who like slice of life plots displayed through subtle and relaxed art styles. "", ""NieA 7 - 7.5/10A diamond in the rough. For a series with such a lowly average on MAL, it's surprisingly good. It's reminiscent of Haibane Renmei because of its slow, dialogue heavy and relaxing style.After watching the first volume, I wasn't too taken with it. It started off reasonably well, showing the struggles of a very believable young woman, Mayuko, as she tries to survive with little money and, at the same time, studies to get into college. But my interest levels dropped as soon as it was revealed that an alien, NieA, lived in Mayuko's closet, eating some of her food and causing her...trouble. My interest continued to decrease as more cartoony aliens got involved and the usual anime silliness ensued.Why did this bother me, you ask? Because NieA 7 didn't need an alien living in a closet and attempting to build a UFO. The highly enjoyable and realistic slice of life elements were, from my perspective, getting damaged by the random slapstick comedy elements. I can see and fully understand one of the reasons for the involvement of carefree NieA - to show the contrast between stressed Mayuko, trying her best to survive, and NieA, an alien so carefree that she comes across as thoughtless - but I feel the main reason was to take the anime away from the realm of the real. The thinking probably was that most viewers want to use anime to escape, and that if the story was too realistic it would've taken away from the enjoyment. This sort of thing is viewed as a negative by me because I like to see some anime that contain believable stories.The good news for people like me is that after the mixed opening volume the series started to focus more and more on realism and less on anime insanity. Rather than having a UFO blow a hole through the roof and the like for giggles, the second volume had an episode where an arcade gaming competition was used for laughs, involving the staff at the bathhouse where Mayuko lives and works playing against a small army of kids. I found it funny because it wasn't over the top; because it tried to be real. In my the eyes, the best kind of comedy is the kind I can imagine happening in the land of the real - not just on some nutty planet on the other side of the galaxy.After the first volume, there were also a lot of episodes that focused on the serious sections of the story without resorting to slapstick humour in an attempt to brighten up the mood randomly. My favourite depressing episode is probably the one where Mayuko gets invited to a 'Go-Con' (basically random group dating) and eventually decides against going because she doesn't have any nice clothes to wear and can't afford to have her hair cut. Simple, I know, but the feelings and thoughts Mayuko had during that episode are the kind many people have over the course of their lives and it was effective on an emotional level because of that. Slice of life is at its best when it allows you to go into the shoes of the characters and feel how they feel, and Niea 7 achieves this on a number of occasions.Really, the reason Niea 7 is so endearing is because the cast, aliens aside, come across as real people. Mayuko struggles to get by and lacks a goal to work towards; the owner of the bathhouse attempts to handle two jobs in order to keep the bathhouse running, despite it bringing her debt because of her ties to the people who work there; Genzo, the shy guy with a crush on Mayuko because of her helping him when they were kids, tries to help Mayuko by bringing her rice, yet struggles to express his feelings for her...etc, etc. It's very easy to get into the heads of the cast and see things from their points if view, and that's what makes NieA 7 a fantastic series to spend time watching.The message of NieA 7 is to live life to the full, instead of worrying about everything constantly. Life flies by very quickly and there's little joy to be had if everything is always too difficult. That's why Mayuko is envious of NieA for being so carefree, like nothing can bother her. As Mayuko lives with NieA, she understands how it feels to be 'free', and I'm sure the objective of the series when it was created was to make the viewers feel the same way as Mayuko.Watching the series is a relaxing, occasionally depressive and mostly fun ride - a journey worth the time of any bored anime fan looking to unearth a gem. Do I recommend the series? Providing you can handle lots of talking and little in the way of action, yes. It's a charming series that fans of Haibane Renmei and its ilk will lap up. trouble.

It's a charming series that fans of Haibane Renmei and its ilk will lap up."", ""Representing about a 60:40 ratio of contemplative slice-of-life to lighthearted comedy, all blended and dropped into a slightly sci-fi setting, my first thought about NieA Under 7 was this: It is one tough show to classify.It's evident that, from an artistic standpoint, this is a pretty bare-bones production. Expect relatively flat backgrounds, lacking any real depth or detail. Movement is regularly stiff and unnatural looking. The character designs bear the obvious stamp of the esteemed Yoshitoshi ABe, and they're just as distinctive as anything else that he's made, but their quality fluctuates, sometimes becoming more blocky and rough-looking on a scene-to-scene basis. The closest,...most direct comparison I can make is to Haibane Renmei; if you've seen that, expect a similar or slightly lesser degree of visual quality from this. NieA's art is never offensively bad, just decidedly shaky and awkward at times. In its defense, I'll say that we're hardly dealing with an action-packed thriller or anything that would have truly benefited from eye candy. A little more consistency in the presentation would be nice, but I personally don't see the budget-afflicted art as a significant detriment to the series. Make of it what you will; I'll leave it at that.The bulk of the music seems to be devoted to the quieter, more contemplative moments of the series. It's slow and meditative, often consisting of a few gentle notes played on a pair of stringed instruments, or even a lone acoustic guitar. That's not to say it doesn't have a little bit of range in it to meet the interjections of comedy; some tracks are more upbeat, and an intentionally lackluster “trumpet charge” effect that plays during some of those moments adds a nice bit of sarcasm to the score. Like much of the series, it's all a little minimal, but in some spots it's a surprisingly good soundtrack, and it always consistently matches the tone of what's happening onscreen.The aforementioned humor isn't terribly high-brow. Goofy slapstick is par for the course, and when the humor is verbal or situational, some of it isn't particularly clever. Gags centering around Niea's massive appetite or Mayuko's status as a broke student are common, and none of these represent a breakthrough in comedy. But the characters are endearing and defined well enough that it's easy to laugh along with jokes that might otherwise be labeled as disastrously typical. And, truth be told, there is a certain uncanny, understated bit of wit present in some of the goings-on; for example, an obnoxious alien's antenna accidentally picking up a radio signal from a Chinese restaurant, or Niea trying to fly away in a UFO using a cord to an electrical outlet as the power source. The best jokes in the show aren't complicated, they're just simple, well-timed, effective plays on the setting and underlying concept of the show, often laced with a bit of gentle sarcasm that some will appreciate greatly. There are plenty of hits and plenty of misses, but on average I found myself liking the lighthearted, chuckle-inducing aspects of the show. They balance nicely against its weightier side, seldom feeling out of character.For all of its general weirdness, ultimately the elements of NieA that work the best are its down-to-earth characters (pun, please believe me, not intended). In particular, the lead, Mayuko, is a surprisingly complicated individual, likable and relatable in the first degree. She's a top student who balances multiple jobs against crushing amounts of schoolwork, yet it isn't through any ambition of her own. She lacks real direction, and her own desires elude her. Constantly on the cusp of being penniless, she has no idea what she wants from life, so instead she does what she needs to do to survive. Her shy and humble nature hides fierce independence; it hurts to watch her take a handout of food from a friend, knowing that she's trading her innate pride for pragmatism. In short, she feels like a real human being, internally confused but trying hard to gather herself. I must admit that I had no idea what to expect from NieA Under 7, and this instance of high-caliber character writing was a wholly welcome surprise.Niea herself doesn't receive quite the same treatment, but as a point of comparison for Mayuko, she's also a valuable character. She's simple-minded and childish, without a worry in the world beyond what her next meal will be, seemingly lacking any ambitions or grand desires. And therein lies some cleverness; part of what makes Mayuko and Niea so interesting is that they're two sides of the same coin. Both are adrift, without goals, surviving rather than flourishing, but Niea grins and clearly enjoys every minute of it with an air of freedom while Mayuko always looks like a bird in a cage. As time wears on, the series twists and plays with this relationship in increasingly strange ways; Niea, haunted by the alien mothership that floats near the town, slowly becomes more despondent and begins to act differently, further amplifying the intrigue. It'd be easy to mistake the pair as the archetypal “normal girl and weird friend,” but the saving grace of the show is that there's much more to them than that. It's always great to see something complex hiding within something that seems simple at first glance.I can't ignore a key fault, though; specifically, the series is haunted by incompleteness in several aspects. Some key elements of the setting go largely unexplained. It's an interesting world, but one that's not put to full use. The ending feels anticlimactic and overly explanatory, but paradoxically, it resolves very little. NieA takes frequent jabs at social problems such as discrimination and class warfare, but it feels like it's scraping the surface of these themes rather than delving into them at any real level of significance. Perhaps worst of all, the series periodically hints at an additional point of comparison that could make both of the lead characters shine even more—actually a pretty elegant and potent metaphor—but it takes a step back at the last second and pulls its punch, which is a real bummer. I derived plenty of enjoyment from the series, but I also can't shake the feeling that it's essentially two-thirds of a show. It's missing some things that could have elevated it substantially.And yet I recommend it. I don't quite know who to recommend it to, because it's in a strange no-man's-land of genres, but I'll recommend it anyway. Occasional moments of less-than-great comedy and some degree of incompleteness hurt my impression of NieA Under 7, but the show is just so darn charming and, at times, so surprisingly clever that it's impossible for me to actively discourage anyone from watching it. most direct comparison I can make is to Haibane Renmei; if you've seen that, expect a similar or slightly lesser degree of visual quality from this.

Thematically down-to-earth and occasionally depressing, NieA_7 inspires young adults to be hopeful no matter their personal situation. Reputed as ‘the forgettable Yoshitoshi Abe anime’, its lukewarm critical response severely undermines how relatable, sympathetic, and empowering this series can feel.Today’s young adults are stereotyped as socially awkward, riddled with financial problems and unsure about the future. Mayuko Chigasaki is the poster girl for these characteristics, presented as a hardworking student who is busy making ends meet by working several jobs. She lives with NieA, a rude,...hyperactive alien who sells junk and builds faulty UFOs, much to Mayuko’s annoyance. Set in retro-future Tokyo where aliens have peacefully integrated over generations, the pair reside in a sleepy bathhouse with their friendly neighbours. With traditional bathhouses on the decline, the residents resort to drastic measures to save the business, with predictably hilarious consequences.The first half of NieA_7 is composed of comedic slice of life adventures, where in typical Yoshitoshi Abe fashion, the eccentric is juxtaposed against the mundane. Battling carnivorous plants and surviving UFO crashes are no big deal compared to bathhouse promotion events and staying overtime at work. These early episodes illustrate Mayuko’s difficulty adjusting to living independently. Working three jobs and studying to re-take her university entrance exams leaves little time for social or personal activities, yet the bizarre adventures and amusing interactions she experiences reminds her that fun is in the eye of the beholder.Mayuko is a stellar lead character. Her basic struggles with finance, unbearable roommates and maintaining a healthy social life are universally relatable to young adults, while her unassuming, multifaceted personality is a joy to watch. Central to her character is insecurity, which externalises as shyness to those she wants to impress (bosses, classmates, old friends) and as aggressiveness to those she looks down on (NieA and the other aliens). Her markedly varied approach to social interaction is brought to life by excellent character animation and Ayako Kawasumi’s versatile voice acting.NieA_7 thrives in presenting realistic, likable side-characters who simply want to help each other succeed, ensuing plenty of wholesome exchanges. Mayuko’s co-worker ‘Chie’ is a remarkably mature child character who presents a realistic, endearing impression despite her limited screen time. The alien community features a diverse set of memorable personalities who primarily handle the comedic relief. Most importantly, Mayuko’s employers are dedicated and motivated individuals who unwaveringly promote their unorthodox businesses, despite lacking consumer demand. Mayuko draws enthusiasm from her employers, among others, to energise her own daily endeavours, even if it amounts to doing chores and studying for exams.While good-natured and hard-working, Mayuko lacks the perspective and experience to place her efforts in a constructive place, instead working day to day with no clear direction. Summarising this aspect of her character are the closing moments of the early episodes, where Mayuko dwells on how motivated and driven her peers are compared to herself. Whether an artifact of her young age or her ambivalent personality, her search for direction in life becomes the encompassing facet of her character, which she must overcome despite the overwhelming stress and self-doubt she comes to face.On the other side of the coin is NieA, the freeloading alien who spends her time trying to find things to do, sometimes causing trouble for Mayuko. She is categorised as an ‘Under 7’, the lowest social class of alien, based solely on the absence of an antennae. Under 7s are denied education, work and even citizenship, such that NieA is essentially an animal in the eyes of their society. Despite being seemingly free spirited and unbound by human rules, at heart she desires respect and a useful way to spend her time, which she struggles to achieve given the restrictions on her social class. While NieA appears to be the antithesis to Mayuko, they ultimately share the same dilemma of lacking a place to apply their efforts constructively, despite the causes of their problems being essentially opposite.The underlying tension between NieA and Mayuko is the centrepiece to their relationship in the first half of the series. Mayuko grows irritated of NieA’s frivolous use of free time, while NieA is spiteful of Mayuko’s well-constructed, privileged occupation and connections, with both parties fundamentally wanting to live more like the other. This friction is usually dissolved in comedy routines, but as they enter deeper emotional waters, it becomes the key motivator for their relationship growth and development.NieA_7 is an adult-contemporary comedy at heart, and as such, the humour is more audacious than typical anime standards. Jokes involving drugs, poverty and racism are plentiful, but remain light-hearted enough to avoid the dark comedy label. Ranging from elaborate and sophisticated to low brow and slapstick, the comedy will vary depending on the mood of the episode, while collectively becoming more consistent as the series progresses.The most distinguishing aspect of NieA’s comedy is the Indian influence, which manifests on several levels of the production. ‘Dalgit\'s Tidbit of Indian Information’, the bizarre live-action segment which plays after the ending theme, features Dalgit telling a lame joke in broken Japanese for no apparent reason. In typical Bollywood style, tone shifts are instantaneous and jarring, most commonly between light and humorous to moody and depressive. Such abrupt tone changes may be unnatural to the preestablished mood of the episode but are nonetheless effective room brighteners to keep the series balanced and watchable.The inclusion of so many Indian references feeds into the light social commentary, which is never boldly involved in the narrative, but remains a quirky and interesting sugar-coating to the production. The alien community is used to explore the dysfunctional attitudes of modern Japanese society towards increasing immigration, where some aliens adopt an identity based on the stereotypes of other cultures. Enter Chada, the Indian-impersonating alien who runs a corner shop and is desperate to share his homemade curry, and Karna, a high-class Chinese-impersonating alien who is completely insufferable and rude. It should be unsurprising that Indian and Chinese people are victims of significant discrimination in Japan in recent times, and these aliens represent the major stereotypes assigned with their respective nationalities. The alien hierarchy bares resemblance to the Indian caste system, and the metaphor between aliens and immigrants speaks for itself. While a deeper approach to the social commentary would have further supported NieA’s character development, it remains a memorable edge to the unique comedic style.The visuals maintain a consistent, solid look which is characteristic of early 2000s anime. Produced by the same team of Serial Experiments Lain, expect similarly detailed line work, limited mechanical animation, and robust colours. The urban design shares the same fetishization of wires and clutter but does not attempt to be as absurdly detailed or abstract as its 1998 cousin. Instead, NieA_7 puts its energy into a diverse set of rural backgrounds, ranging from luscious jungles to vast open plains. The town of Enohana is drawn to be dusty, run down and isolated, which is accentuated by the hazy, bright colours and warm glaze to every scene. Evenings are showered in vivid, fiery sunsets which are accompanied by obligatory cicadas or suzumushi (depending on the season), and nights are bathed in looming shadows and lonely blues, which incidentally comprise the soundtrack for those scenes as well.The animation is a mixed bag. Character animation is often impressive, with motions customised to each character giving an extra dimension to their personalities, especially to Mayuko’s awkward body language. Unfortunately, the framerate will drop to frankly unacceptable levels at times, with jagged movements and choppy panning shots. Complex animation sequences are rare, so this is not a major issue, but it remains a blight on the otherwise commendable visuals.Yoshitoshi Abe’s character designs possess the instantly recognisable aesthetic balance which he is renowned for and are faithfully adapted from his manga. With such diversity in age and ethnicity, his designs are as eclectic and beautiful as ever.Tomokazu Tokoro applies the same emotional intelligence to NieA_7 as he would late perfect with Haibane Remnei. Peppered throughout the production are transient moments of the characters quietly performing their daily duties or just chilling out, further deepening the relaxed vibe that permeates the entire series. When the characters enter more intense emotional territory, these scenes are placed more thoughtfully to focus on the silent introspection which the characters undergo. Blurry nostalgic flashbacks are scattered throughout, with increasing relevance to the characters as their personalities and histories are more extensively explored. Scene composition is superb, with expertly balanced and thought-provoking layouts and angles which punctuate the loneliest, most desolate scenes.Yoshio Owa’s soundtrack is sublime. Nostalgic acoustic pieces provide a soft melody to the slice of life scenes, while solemn violin tracks deepen the more poignant moments. The psudo-rural setting is perfect for blues inspired songs, with winding guitar noises permeating the final moments of each episode, providing the 2000s version of low fli hip-hop for Mayuko’s evening studies. The ending theme functions almost as a dream sequence, with Maria Yamamoto’s ""Venus to Chiisana Kamisama"" perfectly encapsulating the peaceful countryside atmosphere with precise acoustic instrumentation, overplayed on illustrations of Mayuko’s earliest memories. The overall effect of the soundtrack is to produce a sentimental atmosphere, which is fully achieved once combined with the commendable sound design.Spoilers from this point onwards, so enter at your own risk. Skip to the last paragraph for the verdict.Episode 7 sees Mayuko invited by a friend to attend a mixer (contextually referred as a Go-Con, essentially a group blind date). She hesitantly agrees to attend, and subsequently informs her neighbours (who have taken the role of a pseudo-family by this point) that she will go. However, despite being pushed to enjoy the opportunity by her older neighbours, her overwhelming self-doubt results in her turning down the invitation last minute. The aftermath is an entire two episodes of saddening contemplation as she grapples with the shame of disappointing her friend, while facing her own unbearable social ineptitude. Heart-wrenching scenes of Mayuko soaking in her depressing state fill the runtime as she is battered by her painful introspection, while simultaneously dealing with her difficult routine. Tokoro’s excellent framing drives these lonely moments to even greater heights, while the more emotional pieces on the soundtrack find their moment to shine.The eventual resolution to this arc involves Mayuko letting an old friend pass through her defensive walls, realising that she needs an external voice of reason to combat her wandering, destructive introspection. This arc is will deeply resonate with anyone who has experienced similar circumstances, who’s low self-worth also interferes with living a functional social life resulting in such depressive episodes.As these issues subside, her narrative turns to her dealing with the sentimental attachment to her past, specifically how she must separate from these feelings to move forward in her current life. Despite being surrounded by such driven, understanding people, Enohana is little more than a steppingstone for Mayuko, as it is often contrasted against the big city of inner Tokyo, with more ambition and opportunity inferred on the other side. Whether a subconscious effort to give her life direction or a natural consequence of her life circumstances, she realises how the biggest roadblock to finding purpose is her tendency to live in the comfort of the past and the what is familiar to her, rather than advancing with confidence in herself. Flashes of Mayuko’s memories, drawn in serene, wistful strokes, are more frequently utilised to reveal her reflective, pensive state.Running parallel to this arc is NieA’s dilemma. She receives a signal from the alien mothership, and while the contents of the message are vague, NieA comes to understand that only she, as an Under 7, can hear it. After finally feeling validated and gaining the small possibility of escaping her current life, she abandons Enohana in search of the source. Mayuko becomes worried by NieA’s absence, and upon asking others for her location, realises that her neighbours view NieA closer to a pet than a resident, and officials treat her disappearance as a non-issue. Left alone as she comprehends the terrible circumstances NieA has been dealing with, while feeling regretful for participating in such discrimination, Mayuko again enters the depressive state of just episodes prior.Episode 12 sees these character arcs entwine, resulting in their simultaneous conclusion. Tomokazu Tokoro flexes his creative muscles by using a multimedia approach to the visual presentation, with the daunting urban setting vividly abstracted with colour inverted, high contrast photographs, a tangible insight to Mayuko’s experience of those intense moments. Imagery of lost children and pets are used metaphorically to parallel Mayuko’s newfound perspective of their friendship. Sion’s incredible insert song ‘Kage’ is used to full effect here, giving the resolute lyrical support to Mayuko’s dispirited search for NieA, perfectly contextualising her hopeless state. To fully understand the gravity to Sion’s inclusion to this series, his appeal as an artist needs to be briefly examined.Sion is a perfect for NieA_7. His borderline unbearably sore vocal performance quite literally feeds into the narrative of his songs; that he struggles to connect with others because the inherently abrasive aspects of his personality repels the attention he craves for. Borrowing from the likes of Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash, his songs ride the line between melancholy and optimism, wrapped up in excellent storytelling. He takes you down to the abyss of disparity which he is all too familiar with, and lifts you back up to feeling defiantly hopeful, using his soulful lyrics as buoyancy. Rough around the edges yet truly from a place of genuineness and solidarity, his empathic, impassioned performances of ‘Koko Made Oide’ for the opening and ‘Kage’ as the insert song, are just two hits from his exceptional discography.NieA_7’s opening is monumentally powerful, featuring seemingly tailor made, multi-layered lyrics which smash home the most emotionally involved moments of the series, which are supported by similarly cryptic and vivid imagery. Sion’s singing evokes a feeling of brokenness, of lethargically as life is beating him down, exemplified by Mayuko’s jaded character animation as she struggles to wake up to the lyrics ‘Right next to where you’re crying, right next to where I’m blue’. To highlight just a few more great moments from this opening:‘I can’t be close to sadness because I’m not surrounded by people’. This line fucking kills me. It speaks to anyone who is trapped in the cycle of avoiding people to avoid being hurt, but in doing so, feels the hurt from being alone. The episodes where Mayuko experiences those exact feelings are made exponentially more devastating once these lyrics match up with her depressing circumstances.  Those hopelessly self-validating lines are highlighted by quickfire flashes of her childhood, to highlight her tendency to live in the security of her past rather than pushing herself to outgrow her protective shell and embrace the changes she faces.‘I can’t change anything, so I can at least manage this’. Emotionally and physically weathered, Mayuko sits in her leaky apartment room as it rains, sheltered by the thin veil of her umbrella rather than fixing the source of the problem, while looking to the sky for hope. Even though she’s impoverished, overworked and has nothing meaningful to work towards and with few resources to change that fate, her face lights up as she understands that she’ll be okay regardless. Sion delivers his uplifting, empowering lyrics like crashing waves, as the opening reaches its climax with those very lyrics. This moment perfectly encapsulates the appeal of NieA_7: hope is always there, even if you don’t feel like you deserve it.Returning to episode 12, and much to Mayuko’s relief, NieA returns home. With few words exchanged between them, the implication is that NieA’s life with Mayuko gives her purpose, and she is willing to persevere existence at the bottom of society if it means that she can continue that relationship. While much of their communication is obscured through fighting and backhanded compliments, Mayuko is quietly happy with this compromise.The episode climaxes as NieA and Mayuko watch the mothership spontaneously evaporate and disappear. The dying mothership visually reminds Mayuko of a memory from her childhood, and realises that in the same way NieA is currently accepting her reality as an Under_7 who no longer has a mothership to return to, she must accept that she can no longer return to her past for security and needs move on with her own reality. Even if indirectly, Mayuko finds the resolution to that problem through her empathy towards NieA, and in turn, deepens their relationship significantly.NieA_7 is not without its criticisms. The realistic, slice of life approach to storytelling has disappointed fans of other Abe classics like Serial Experiments Lain, especially considering that NieA_7 lacks the wealth of fascinating concepts which support his other works. The character motivations are frequently open ended and left for interpretation, which may be uneasy for viewers who prefer a more straightforward approach to character writing. The comedic elements can also appear immature or repetitive, particularly in the first half, and the aforementioned rapid tone shifts may be too sudden at times.The biggest criticism of NieA_7 is that it lacks a clear narrative through-line, with character motivations and story arcs seldom feeding into a single message. Side characters drift in and out of the story without accomplishing a substantial arc and several questions are left without conclusions. However, the chaos of narrative elements and the lack of conformity to traditional storytelling is arguably a strength rather than a weakness, if interpreted less as a conventional story, but more as a truer depiction of reality.NieA_7 presents the imperfect reality we live in, where things don’t happen like they do in the movies. Nothing is black or white, personal problems take years to heal rather than being solved in an instant, and drama is ephemeral, unpredictable, and usually unresolved. To highlight this with a quote: “A drama has a progressive thought, an emotional climax, and a resolution, but our lives aren’t like that. All we get day after day, are a bunch of vague anxieties that are never really resolved.” – Kaoru Yamazaki, Welcome to the NHK. Whether the narrative messiness was the intention of the creators or simply creative incompetency, is up for debate, but the overall effect is the tremendously relatable, understanding, and hopeful series which NieA_7 is.This reasonable approach to storytelling makes NieA_7’s messages hit much closer to home. Mayuko’s eventual conclusion is that she will remain positive and approach life at her own pace, and even though there are aspects about herself and her life circumstances which may interfere with that hope, she will be optimistic, nonetheless. This broad resolution to her character arc is far from a sweeping thesis to understand her entire character, but is a specific, believable approach to handling her circumstances which suits her and the series by extension. As an archetypical young adult, Mayuko’s triumph over her lack of direction is reassurance that being unsure about your future is perfectly fine and normal, and taking things one step at a time is more constructive than beating yourself up over your perceived incompetency. If anyone needed to hear that message, it was me.NieA_7 is an endearing, powerful series which provides countless moments of relatability, connection, and warmth to anyone who properly resonates with its realistic, multifaceted approach to storytelling and characters. Judging by its MAL score, NieA, absolutely does not deserve to be, Under 7.10/10 hyperactive alien who sells junk and builds faulty UFOs, much to Mayuko’s annoyance. Set in retro-future Tokyo where aliens have peacefully integrated over generations, the pair reside in a sleepy bathhouse with their friendly neighbours. With traditional bathhouses on the decline, the residents resort to drastic measures to save the business, with predictably hilarious consequences.The first half of NieA_7 is composed of comedic slice of life adventures, where in typical Yoshitoshi Abe fashion, the eccentric is juxtaposed against the mundane. Battling carnivorous plants and surviving UFO crashes are no big deal compared to bathhouse promotion events and staying overtime at work. These early episodes illustrate Mayuko’s difficulty adjusting to living independently. Working three jobs and studying to re-take her university entrance exams leaves little time for social or personal activities, yet the bizarre adventures and amusing interactions she experiences reminds her that fun is in the eye of the beholder.Mayuko is a stellar lead character. Her basic struggles with finance, unbearable roommates and maintaining a healthy social life are universally relatable to young adults, while her unassuming, multifaceted personality is a joy to watch. Central to her character is insecurity, which externalises as shyness to those she wants to impress (bosses, classmates, old friends) and as aggressiveness to those she looks down on (NieA and the other aliens). Her markedly varied approach to social interaction is brought to life by excellent character animation and Ayako Kawasumi’s versatile voice acting.NieA_7 thrives in presenting realistic, likable side-characters who simply want to help each other succeed, ensuing plenty of wholesome exchanges. Mayuko’s co-worker ‘Chie’ is a remarkably mature child character who presents a realistic, endearing impression despite her limited screen time. The alien community features a diverse set of memorable personalities who primarily handle the comedic relief. Most importantly, Mayuko’s employers are dedicated and motivated individuals who unwaveringly promote their unorthodox businesses, despite lacking consumer demand. Mayuko draws enthusiasm from her employers, among others, to energise her own daily endeavours, even if it amounts to doing chores and studying for exams.While good-natured and hard-working, Mayuko lacks the perspective and experience to place her efforts in a constructive place, instead working day to day with no clear direction. Summarising this aspect of her character are the closing moments of the early episodes, where Mayuko dwells on how motivated and driven her peers are compared to herself. Whether an artifact of her young age or her ambivalent personality, her search for direction in life becomes the encompassing facet of her character, which she must overcome despite the overwhelming stress and self-doubt she comes to face.On the other side of the coin is NieA, the freeloading alien who spends her time trying to find things to do, sometimes causing trouble for Mayuko. She is categorised as an ‘Under 7’, the lowest social class of alien, based solely on the absence of an antennae. Under 7s are denied education, work and even citizenship, such that NieA is essentially an animal in the eyes of their society. Despite being seemingly free spirited and unbound by human rules, at heart she desires respect and a useful way to spend her time, which she struggles to achieve given the restrictions on her social class. While NieA appears to be the antithesis to Mayuko, they ultimately share the same dilemma of lacking a place to apply their efforts constructively, despite the causes of their problems being essentially opposite.The underlying tension between NieA and Mayuko is the centrepiece to their relationship in the first half of the series. Mayuko grows irritated of NieA’s frivolous use of free time, while NieA is spiteful of Mayuko’s well-constructed, privileged occupation and connections, with both parties fundamentally wanting to live more like the other. This friction is usually dissolved in comedy routines, but as they enter deeper emotional waters, it becomes the key motivator for their relationship growth and development.NieA_7 is an adult-contemporary comedy at heart, and as such, the humour is more audacious than typical anime standards. Jokes involving drugs, poverty and racism are plentiful, but remain light-hearted enough to avoid the dark comedy label. Ranging from elaborate and sophisticated to low brow and slapstick, the comedy will vary depending on the mood of the episode, while collectively becoming more consistent as the series progresses.The most distinguishing aspect of NieA’s comedy is the Indian influence, which manifests on several levels of the production. ‘Dalgit\'s Tidbit of Indian Information’, the bizarre live-action segment which plays after the ending theme, features Dalgit telling a lame joke in broken Japanese for no apparent reason. In typical Bollywood style, tone shifts are instantaneous and jarring, most commonly between light and humorous to moody and depressive. Such abrupt tone changes may be unnatural to the preestablished mood of the episode but are nonetheless effective room brighteners to keep the series balanced and watchable.The inclusion of so many Indian references feeds into the light social commentary, which is never boldly involved in the narrative, but remains a quirky and interesting sugar-coating to the production. The alien community is used to explore the dysfunctional attitudes of modern Japanese society towards increasing immigration, where some aliens adopt an identity based on the stereotypes of other cultures. Enter Chada, the Indian-impersonating alien who runs a corner shop and is desperate to share his homemade curry, and Karna, a high-class Chinese-impersonating alien who is completely insufferable and rude. It should be unsurprising that Indian and Chinese people are victims of significant discrimination in Japan in recent times, and these aliens represent the major stereotypes assigned with their respective nationalities. The alien hierarchy bares resemblance to the Indian caste system, and the metaphor between aliens and immigrants speaks for itself. While a deeper approach to the social commentary would have further supported NieA’s character development, it remains a memorable edge to the unique comedic style.The visuals maintain a consistent, solid look which is characteristic of early 2000s anime. Produced by the same team of Serial Experiments Lain, expect similarly detailed line work, limited mechanical animation, and robust colours. The urban design shares the same fetishization of wires and clutter but does not attempt to be as absurdly detailed or abstract as its 1998 cousin. Instead, NieA_7 puts its energy into a diverse set of rural backgrounds, ranging from luscious jungles to vast open plains. The town of Enohana is drawn to be dusty, run down and isolated, which is accentuated by the hazy, bright colours and warm glaze to every scene. Evenings are showered in vivid, fiery sunsets which are accompanied by obligatory cicadas or suzumushi (depending on the season), and nights are bathed in looming shadows and lonely blues, which incidentally comprise the soundtrack for those scenes as well.The animation is a mixed bag. Character animation is often impressive, with motions customised to each character giving an extra dimension to their personalities, especially to Mayuko’s awkward body language. Unfortunately, the framerate will drop to frankly unacceptable levels at times, with jagged movements and choppy panning shots. Complex animation sequences are rare, so this is not a major issue, but it remains a blight on the otherwise commendable visuals.Yoshitoshi Abe’s character designs possess the instantly recognisable aesthetic balance which he is renowned for and are faithfully adapted from his manga. With such diversity in age and ethnicity, his designs are as eclectic and beautiful as ever.Tomokazu Tokoro applies the same emotional intelligence to NieA_7 as he would late perfect with Haibane Remnei. Peppered throughout the production are transient moments of the characters quietly performing their daily duties or just chilling out, further deepening the relaxed vibe that permeates the entire series. When the characters enter more intense emotional territory, these scenes are placed more thoughtfully to focus on the silent introspection which the characters undergo. Blurry nostalgic flashbacks are scattered throughout, with increasing relevance to the characters as their personalities and histories are more extensively explored. Scene composition is superb, with expertly balanced and thought-provoking layouts and angles which punctuate the loneliest, most desolate scenes.Yoshio Owa’s soundtrack is sublime. Nostalgic acoustic pieces provide a soft melody to the slice of life scenes, while solemn violin tracks deepen the more poignant moments. The psudo-rural setting is perfect for blues inspired songs, with winding guitar noises permeating the final moments of each episode, providing the 2000s version of low fli hip-hop for Mayuko’s evening studies. The ending theme functions almost as a dream sequence, with Maria Yamamoto’s ""Venus to Chiisana Kamisama"" perfectly encapsulating the peaceful countryside atmosphere with precise acoustic instrumentation, overplayed on illustrations of Mayuko’s earliest memories. The overall effect of the soundtrack is to produce a sentimental atmosphere, which is fully achieved once combined with the commendable sound design.Spoilers from this point onwards, so enter at your own risk.

If anyone needed to hear that message, it was me.NieA_7 is an endearing, powerful series which provides countless moments of relatability, connection, and warmth to anyone who properly resonates with its realistic, multifaceted approach to storytelling and characters. Judging by its MAL score, NieA, absolutely does not deserve to be, Under 7.10/10', 'A title born from the people responsible for the creation of Serial Experiments Lain. NieA_7 was based of a doujinshi of the same name by the esteemed Yoshitoshi ABe. Apparently, the staff of Lain wanted to create a very light-hearted title to follow up the sever tone found in Lain. In short: this doesn’t really work out in the show’s favor. Why? I’m getting there.The story revolves around a hard-working high-schooler Mayuko (Mayu), who lives on her own and struggles to make ends meet between her three low-wage jobs. Mayu is a shy, introverted, and to make life worse, has an obnoxious, food-swiping, UFO obsessed...alien named Niea for a room-mate (ranked as an “under 7 alien as per her alien class system for some reason). Did I forget to mention? Aliens have colonized on Earth years prior and now live alongside humans. I’d have gone on longer with the synopsis, but the fact that I did not points to my first issue regarding the show, the lack of explanation regarding just about everything regarding the setting. Not that I’m implying that leaving a number of questions open for the viewer is bad thing mind you. A later work based off of another ABe title, Haibane Renmei, did “leaving stuff to your imagination” in a way that NieA_7 is far, far off from. In Haibane Renmei, questions are left behind, but not a way that affects the narrative or renders elements of the plot pointless, as is the case with NieA_7 unfortunately. Gaps in information have everything to do with the “alien” aspect of the show. For the most part, this a show that mostly does not really care much for it’s sci-fiesque setting and keeps a more grounded focus on mostly the human characters and their daily interactions.  It’s unfortunate in this case since the show lightly touches upon themes of alienation, discrimination, and the idea of adjusting to new settings that could’ve gone much further then what ended up happening. What we got instead was far less compelling (more on that a bit later since now I’m harping on what the show didn’t do as opposed to what it did). The opening episode leaves behind a number of questions and they only accumulate as the show progresses. Like, why did the aliens come to earth? What’s up with the mother ship? Why does it send out signals to Niea? How can Niea hear the signals even though she’s the only antennae-less alien in the entire series? I could go further, but the point is clear. Have any questions regarding the setting? Well, they’ll likely remain just that, only questions. The show’s tiny focus essentially renders most of the setting as pointless add-ons. I’m still not really sure what the point of the aliens were in this show at all. Even though we hardly learn a thing about their species, they still appear regularly to perform their comedic shtick which I felt to be hit or miss. The aliens also ultimately add nothing to the show and have no involvement in the show’s central conflict: Mayu’s inner conflict (asides from Niea, whose mostly only adds to Mayu’s stress) . The sub-plot regarding Niea and the alien mother ship was not given nearly enough detail since it mostly happens off-screen and no one cares enough to ask about it by the time the show’s over. Easily the biggest head-scratcher of the entire series.Yeah, so this is a series that tosses some potentially cool elements at the viewers only to say ""screw it, let\'s do some comedy"". Disappointing maybe, but that\'s not really what sinks the show. This would not be as big a problem for me if the comedy was actually good, but that\'s not the case. Mostly the result of one big nasty wrench that was thrown into my enjoyment of the show the titular character: Niea. She\'s basically Edward from Cowboy Bebop, except she puts all her time and effort into being downright annoying. She consistently torments Mayuko by gathering trash in her apartment, blowing up parts of her property, and worst of all constantly whining about food, or being hungry. Oh god, every time food ends up being the subject you can expect the exact same thing: Niea: FOOOOOD! GIMME MORE FOOOOD Mayuko: NO, THIS IS ALL WE HAVE Niea: FOOOOOOOOD! So much effort was put into making Niea is wacky and annoying as possible that the creators forgot to make her likable. The humor is passable when Niea is not  around (kinda liked Chiaki and Karna, and the Weed Bath house episode is pretty darn funny), but that\'s nowhere near being enough to make up for when she is. The audio doesn\'t really much to praise either, asides from the voice acting (watched it mostly dubbed, the voice actors did a good job of trying to sell the humor, but they were fighting an uphill battle to begin with).The soundtrack, I\'m not even sure if there was one, If there is, it\'s either too muted or extremely unnoticeable since I can\'t recall taking notice of background music outside of the last episode. The ending theme, however, I found to be catchy and I dug the stringy instrumentals. The opening? Ghastly. Sounds like some dude who walked into a recording studio and tried to sing with strep throat. Lastly, I can\'t remember having ever given much attention to a show\'s sound effects, but  NieA_7 is an exception. The creators of the show literally ripped several cheesy sound-bites from the Hannah Barbara library and tossed them into the show to enhance the already weak comedy. The sound effects are often times the closest the show is to being funny sadly enough.This show does at least have more to it then missed opportunities and mostly sucky comedy. Mayuko herself is an interesting character when Niea is not involved. Her struggles come off as very as very easy to relate to. She starts off as a the ""straight man"" of sorts in an annoying comedic duo, but the later episodes shed light on her surrounding circumstances that are common and cause most people stress in some way or another. Whether it be her monetary troubles, social anxiety, living away from home. I have to give the show some props for appropriately portraying these issues, even in-spite of all the baggage. Don\'t expect any catharsis though. The show doesn\'t really end so much as just ""stops"" without much spectacle or payoff.The strengths of NieA_7 underscore (lol) just what this series should have been all along: A tale of a young, hard working introvert trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. Instead, we have a title that bogs itself down with unnecessary elements before coming to a somewhat unsatisfying stop. If slice \'o\' life comedy is your anathema, you\'d best look elsewhere since there\'s nothing here that will change your mind. For everyone else, your probably better of watching stuff like Planetes, a SOL/Drama that succeeds on all both fronts, or Haibane Renmei for mysterious elements that are thought provoking, rather than rage inducing.PS: You probably shouldn\'t watch this show if you are Indian and easily offended alien named Niea for a room-mate (ranked as an “under 7 alien as per her alien class system for some reason). Did I forget to mention? Aliens have colonized on Earth years prior and now live alongside humans. I’d have gone on longer with the synopsis, but the fact that I did not points to my first issue regarding the show, the lack of explanation regarding just about everything regarding the setting. Not that I’m implying that leaving a number of questions open for the viewer is bad thing mind you. A later work based off of another ABe title, Haibane Renmei, did “leaving stuff to your imagination” in a way that NieA_7 is far, far off from. In Haibane Renmei, questions are left behind, but not a way that affects the narrative or renders elements of the plot pointless, as is the case with NieA_7 unfortunately. Gaps in information have everything to do with the “alien” aspect of the show. For the most part, this a show that mostly does not really care much for it’s sci-fiesque setting and keeps a more grounded focus on mostly the human characters and their daily interactions.  It’s unfortunate in this case since the show lightly touches upon themes of alienation, discrimination, and the idea of adjusting to new settings that could’ve gone much further then what ended up happening. What we got instead was far less compelling (more on that a bit later since now I’m harping on what the show didn’t do as opposed to what it did). The opening episode leaves behind a number of questions and they only accumulate as the show progresses. Like, why did the aliens come to earth? What’s up with the mother ship? Why does it send out signals to Niea? How can Niea hear the signals even though she’s the only antennae-less alien in the entire series? I could go further, but the point is clear. Have any questions regarding the setting? Well, they’ll likely remain just that, only questions. The show’s tiny focus essentially renders most of the setting as pointless add-ons. I’m still not really sure what the point of the aliens were in this show at all. Even though we hardly learn a thing about their species, they still appear regularly to perform their comedic shtick which I felt to be hit or miss. The aliens also ultimately add nothing to the show and have no involvement in the show’s central conflict: Mayu’s inner conflict (asides from Niea, whose mostly only adds to Mayu’s stress) . The sub-plot regarding Niea and the alien mother ship was not given nearly enough detail since it mostly happens off-screen and no one cares enough to ask about it by the time the show’s over. Easily the biggest head-scratcher of the entire series.Yeah, so this is a series that tosses some potentially cool elements at the viewers only to say ""screw it, let\'s do some comedy"". Disappointing maybe, but that\'s not really what sinks the show. This would not be as big a problem for me if the comedy was actually good, but that\'s not the case. Mostly the result of one big nasty wrench that was thrown into my enjoyment of the show the titular character: Niea. She\'s basically Edward from Cowboy Bebop, except she puts all her time and effort into being downright annoying. She consistently torments Mayuko by gathering trash in her apartment, blowing up parts of her property, and worst of all constantly whining about food, or being hungry. Oh god, every time food ends up being the subject you can expect the exact same thing: Niea: FOOOOOD! GIMME MORE FOOOOD Mayuko: NO, THIS IS ALL WE HAVE Niea: FOOOOOOOOD! So much effort was put into making Niea is wacky and annoying as possible that the creators forgot to make her likable. The humor is passable when Niea is not  around (kinda liked Chiaki and Karna, and the Weed Bath house episode is pretty darn funny), but that\'s nowhere near being enough to make up for when she is. The audio doesn\'t really much to praise either, asides from the voice acting (watched it mostly dubbed, the voice actors did a good job of trying to sell the humor, but they were fighting an uphill battle to begin with).The soundtrack, I\'m not even sure if there was one, If there is, it\'s either too muted or extremely unnoticeable since I can\'t recall taking notice of background music outside of the last episode. The ending theme, however, I found to be catchy and I dug the stringy instrumentals. The opening? Ghastly. Sounds like some dude who walked into a recording studio and tried to sing with strep throat. Lastly, I can\'t remember having ever given much attention to a show\'s sound effects, but  NieA_7 is an exception. The creators of the show literally ripped several cheesy sound-bites from the Hannah Barbara library and tossed them into the show to enhance the already weak comedy. The sound effects are often times the closest the show is to being funny sadly enough.This show does at least have more to it then missed opportunities and mostly sucky comedy. Mayuko herself is an interesting character when Niea is not involved. Her struggles come off as very as very easy to relate to. She starts off as a the ""straight man"" of sorts in an annoying comedic duo, but the later episodes shed light on her surrounding circumstances that are common and cause most people stress in some way or another. Whether it be her monetary troubles, social anxiety, living away from home. I have to give the show some props for appropriately portraying these issues, even in-spite of all the baggage. Don\'t expect any catharsis though. The show doesn\'t really end so much as just ""stops"" without much spectacle or payoff.The strengths of NieA_7 underscore (lol) just what this series should have been all along: A tale of a young, hard working introvert trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. Instead, we have a title that bogs itself down with unnecessary elements before coming to a somewhat unsatisfying stop. If slice \'o\' life comedy is your anathema, you\'d best look elsewhere since there\'s nothing here that will change your mind. For everyone else, your probably better of watching stuff like Planetes, a SOL/Drama that succeeds on all both fronts, or Haibane Renmei for mysterious elements that are thought provoking, rather than rage inducing.PS: You probably shouldn\'t watch this show if you are Indian and easily offended', ""Ahhhh NieA_7. If you've never heard of this anime I wouldn't blame you. As it is not one of Yoshitoshi ABe's most famous since he is one of the masterminds behind the ever talked about mindf**k that is Serial Experiments Lain. If I had to compare NieA_7 to anything that ABe has done it would be more appropriate to compare it to that of Haibane Renmei as it's not all dark and philosophical, but rather, very calming and easy to take in. This show would best be described as the crew who worked on Lain taking a little break. This show is a very light-hearted...comedy that is honestly a joy to watch. I would say I watched it at the perfect time as I got exactly what I wanted out of it since I had watched a lot of anime recently that consist of heavy drama and very compelling storylines. (It was Fate/Zero if you were wondering)STORY: 8/10Some would argue that NieA_7 lacks a constat story, I would disagree. As this anime is about a world where it is the year 2000, the turn of the century, and Aliens live amongst humans. And among those aliens is a girl (an Under Alien) named NieA. She freeloads at the Enohana Bathhouse. The main protagonist of the story is a Cram School student named Mayuko Chigasaki, who works 3 jobs just to get by. She lives at the Enohana Bathhouse with NieA and must deal with NieA crazy shenanigans or just have to deal with NieA constantly complaining about being hungry. The part of the story that I really resonanated with was that it was about Mayuko really trying her hardest to get by and showing all of these overarching depressing themes that ABe throws out there. But at the end of the day, the show is a fun to watch light-hearted comedy.CHARACTERS: 9/10I'll start with Mayuko ChigasakiMayuko is a down on her luck Cram School Student who has to work 3 jobs just to get by as she does not want to bother her parents die money. She barely makes enough to have dinner at night, much to NieA's dismay. While she doesn't make much, she is a very hardworking girl, and never complains about what is asked of her. She constantly is butting heads with NieA wanting to eat all the time or building random UFOs or other contraptions bringing junk into their room. She has another friend named Chiaki (named after Chiaki Konata) whom she hangs out with from time to time. But Mayuko is a generally socially awkward person who would rather stay at home and study than go out with friends. Mayuko came off as a very relatable character and one that I really connected with. While I am not at the same age as her, I just could really feel what she was going through. A lot of the themes presented in this anime are quite depressing and very real. All in all, Mayuko has become one of my favorite female anime characters.Now there's NieANieA is an Under Alien (Under 7) who lived in the Enohana Bathhouse before Mayuko got there. She is constantly causing trouble, by gathering random junk in order to make UFOs to sell so she can pay for food that she so desperately covets. When she's not causing trouble, she can be found sleeping on the roof or just being lazy somewhere. She is a very lovable character who just wants to have fun. Her relationship with Mayuko is one that I really enjoyed watching.ART: 7/10The animation was done by Triangle Staff who obviously did Serial Experiments Lain. The animation is what is to be expected from an anime that was made almost 15 years ago. Though the animation can hit some really high points that are very noticeable.SOUNDS: 8/10The sound consists of pretty normal set of tracks with acoustic guitars in the mix. Very calming little soundtrack that fits with the show very well. The opening song features the raspy voice of SION. The OP is an acquired taste but it's up to opinion. Solid voice acting on both ends. In the Japanese dub, Mayuko is played by the same voice actress who did Saber of the Fate/  series.I would very much recommend this anime for anyone who would like to just take a break with a good light-hearted comedy.

You first think you\'re watching a light-hearted comedy, then a seinen, sometimes sci-fi, but wait a second, it\'s a comedy again. It\'s like this show doesn\'t have an identity, and it suffers tremendously.You\'d think that since one of the main characters is a discriminated, ""unique"" sort of  alien, the plot would involve something about that identity. In the earlier episodes, Niea is clearly discriminated against, and I would suppose that her being an ""under seven"" would have some sort of meaning. Well,...you\'re absolutely wrong.Instead, the first 7 episodes or so is just comedy, not so good, not so bad, whatever. Then, the last 6 episodes is where it takes a huge nosedive. The plot tries to redirect itself to being coming of age, seinen, sort of plot focused, almost no comedy involved. It\'s pretty slowpaced, and nothing really happens. It mainly focuses on Mayuko\'s development as a character, and the revolving circumstances that surround her. It\'s kind of just very mediocre.Niea makes little to no appearances, and when she does, it actually makes the story seem interesting since its about her hearing things about  the mothership. It makes you wonder if the latter half of the show wouldn\'t be garbage if it just focused on Niea more. Instead, you get this half assed run of the mill coming of age plot about Mayuko. Great.Characters are also divided in between ""serious"" characters and comic relief characters. There are characters in the first half of the story that serve as comic relief that never come to show again because the latter half is coming of age, and so they served their purpose. The ""serious"" characters are the more ""mature"" characters that help Mayuko come to terms with everything and help her move forward. As if there really are two different plotlines in two different stories.Typical of a 2000\'s anime, this show\'s art, while aged somewhat badly, probably was pretty normal at its time.Conclusion: If an anime is pretty damn old and isn\'t really recognizable, it probably faded to obscurity for a reason. This anime is one of them. It tries to experiment with too many things, and because of it, this anime is a jack of all trades and a master of none. It tries to be serious, it tries to be funny, but it just fails at both.

Thinking back on it, I now realise that this show is probably better described as a slice of life. And by that I mean it\'s a REAL slice of life, not one of those fake ones like ""Clannad"" that people slap the genre label onto just because it doesn\'t contain mecha and it\'s set in a school.""NieA Under 7"" contains all the telling signs of a slice of life - even though it\'s undoubtedly a...comedy, it\'s not constantly cracking jokes like in ""Galaxy Angel"", and when they\'re not doing comedy, they\'re doing... well, nothing really. You could call it drama, but it\'s not very dramatic. The storyline meanders around and doesn\'t really get anywhere, so yeah, pretty close to your standard definition of a slice of life.The comedy side of ""NieA Under 7"" does not really appeal to me. It\'s the typical slapstick, random, over the top humour so characteristic of anime in general. The only thing I remember being amused about is the video game tournament in episode 5... and I guess that probably has something to do with the premises being appealing to me.As anyone can tell you, the key to a slice of life is the cast, so it\'s fortunate that the ""NieA Under 7"" has quite a good one that offsets the not-very-funny comedy. The characters are likeable, especially the central character Mayuko. I later found out that she\'s voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, who happens to be my favourite voice actress (she voiced Lafiel from ""Crest of the Stars"", Nodame from ""Nodame Cantabile"" and Fuu from ""Samurai Champloo"" amongst many other roles). What annoys me though, is that she has these tendencies to suddenly explode as the show goes into comedy mode, which seems very out of character as she\'s supposed to be a really shy girl. Other characters like the Indian guy also have these crazy sides to them that just seem to be there for comedy value, and I don\'t really like the fact they sacrificed good characterisation for the sake of comedy, which really isn\'t that funny.The ending isn\'t much of an ending as absolutely nothing is concluded. But then again, after watching the previous episodes, I wasn\'t really expecting much of an ending, and so wasn\'t really surprised when there was none.I noted two things about the music of the show. The first one is that the ending theme, which I quite like, suits the anime pretty perfectly - quiet, charming, with no notable features but not bland either. Second thing I noted is that the opening theme absolutely sucked. The hideous vocals made it sounded like they pulled some old tramp off the street to sing it.Overall, ""NieA Under 7"" is a bit boring and not very funny, but despite this, I don\'t feel particularly negative towards it. It\'s probably because the show and its characters possess a kind of quiet charm (when they\'re not too busy being silly) that I found appealing. The result is a show that, while not exactly engaging, is not a burden to watch either. So I feel kind of neutral towards ""NieA Under 7"", and in fact my feelings towards it is so neutral that I can\'t think of many shows that I feel more netural about. comedy, it\'s not constantly cracking jokes like in ""Galaxy Angel"", and when they\'re not doing comedy, they\'re doing... well, nothing really.

But instead of being a hostile invasion they just end up integrating in to society and living as any other human and nobody seems to mind nor does this bring any significant change to Japan.These aliens are a thinly veiled allegory to Indians (real Indians, not native Americans) since they have a class system very similar to the one used in India. There\'s even one alien character that has an Indian skin tone and accent. Their appearance is basically the same as humans except they have elf ears and antennas on their heads.The main character Mayuko, is a cram student working a part time job who\'s kind of a loner and socially awkward. She lives in an apartment complex that is also a bathhouse run by a middle aged woman named Kotomi. She also has an alien roommate called Niea who\'s a deadbeat and a freeloader, constantly making Mayuko\'s life harder than it already is.Mayuko\'s relationship with Niea is the heart and soul of this series. Both Mayuko and Niea are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their class in their respective societies. Niea is an ""Under 7"" which is the lowest class among the aliens and Mayuko is incredibly poor and living hand to mouth. So they basically find comfort in each other.At its core this series is all about how Mayuko can\'t stand having Niea around but also realizing that her life is much worse without her since she\'s the only one she feels comfortable being herself with. We know this because when Mayuko interacts with other characters she\'s a lot more polite, shy and reserved. This is especially obvious when it comes to her friend from cram school whom she likes but doesn\'t quite feel comfortable with, even going as far as looking for excuses to not go out with her and her friends.. Only to regret doing so later. Or the landlord Kotomi whom she looks up to as kind of a mother figure and a role model since she\'s a hard worker who works two jobs and generally seems to have a hard life while being seemingly unphased by it.She\'s also no different with her work colleagues at a restaurant, which is this middle aged man who\'s dependent on his cute 8 year old daughter (who\'s relationship clearly mirrors that of the main duo).It\'s also worth mentioning that Niea is envied by both Mayuko and the landlord since she is free of responsibilities and holds nothing back (like a child) in every way they can\'t.All of these things really make this cast and Mayuko in particular to feel incredibly human and relatable.I also want to bring up some of the series\' symbolism like Mayuko\'s watch she got from her father symbolizing her fear of losing her childhood or the apartment complex she\'s living in (being a place she vacationed in with her dad as a child), being a clear parallel to the alien mother-ship since the things that happen to both coincide with one another. clearly communicating that we should all say goodbye to our childhoods at some point. There\'s lot\'s of little details like that which just flew over my head in my first viewing.  This is not much of a sci fi series, the sci fi ideas here are only important for how they are relevant to its characters. It\'s mostly indirect, but we do also get bits and pieces of information about the alien society and how they function within our own spread throughout the series.But I don\'t wanna get too deep in to that. Since I want this to be a review, I\'ll just speak in a broader way from here on out.Narratively, the series starts out fairly episodic comprised of little funny adventures in each episode until it gains more momentum and has more continuity in the second half until it ends with quite a satisfying conclusion. A passage of time is shown to us through the changing of seasons but there\'s no way to know exactly how much time is passing. Also there\'s not a single wasted episode, every single one gives you more information about the characters whether it be through dialogue or having their actions speak for themselves. What makes these characters feel so well defined is that each of them have at least 2 distinct relationships with two other characters in which they seem to behave differently with each, which is a good way to highlight their personalities and fully define them as characters. And the main character specifically ends up being a very deep and identifiable one mainly through her actions and interactions with other characters as well as hints we get throughout the series about her past.The series\' tone might be hard to digest at first (an issue I had in my first viewing) since it ranges from wacky comedy hijinks to relaxing and meditative to even becoming quite depressing and somber depending on the characters\' mood. Most of the wacky comedy comes from Niea who\'s loud, hyperactive and generally just a useless pest. One thing I\'d say in defense of this, is that the show is much heavier on comedy in its first half where it switches from a relaxing tone to a wacky comedic one, but it rarely interrupts the depressing atmosphere that it gains in the second half since it really highlights what\'s truly important in this series.Another important thing is that the comedy is effective in creating a strong contrast and a sense of nostalgia or appreciation for this lighthearted tone in the later episodes (the same way the main character comes to appreciate it). In all respects, the series simply wouldn\'t be the same without it.This really works too since the series is excellent in terms of atmosphere and it knows how to make you feel exactly how it wants you to feel whether it\'s happy, depressed or relaxed. It\'s all done with great patience.Comedy might be subjective but I do think it is well handled here, both in terms of delivery and timing. Very often jokes seem to be set up way ahead of time (and often are an important part of the story) have a clear pay off point and don\'t overstay their welcome. Even to the point where the editor cuts away seconds before is acceptable making the jokes hit harder as well. I didn\'t think it was always funny but the show does have very sharp dialogue both comedic and otherwise so some of the jokes were able to land and catch me by surprise.Visually the show might have a cheap look at first glance since the characters can look a little wonky and off model on occasion and nothing looks particularly detailed. But the reason for this is because the characters have very elaborate motions and expressions quite often. This show goes for a kinetic or movement based style of animation. Although the more the series goes on, and the more depressing it becomes the show does tend to linger on shots more often giving us nicer single images (usually wide shots of empty spaces to convey the main character\'s loneliness).Also the series has Yoshitoshi Abe\'s distinct character designs, a bright color pallet with lot\'s of greens and blues, as well as good attention to detail when it comes to the changing of seasons.In terms of voice acting, everyone sounds like they\'re giving it their all. As I\'ve said the dialogue in this series is very sharp and character defining and the actors did a good job of selling that.Much of the series is quiet and without any music, especially the later half which I quite appreciate. But what music there is are these soft acoustic guitar pieces or pianos. At most you have some wacky comedic music in places and cartoonish sound effects (also there\'s one insert song by the singer of the OP).The OP and ED both seem to fit the series in terms of their lyrics. But the OP just sounds weird and the ED is actually very nice.Overall this series is brilliant and I feel stupid for not appreciating it when I first watched it only a few short years ago. The characters have real depth, the atmosphere is great, the directing is incredibly efficient and good at telling you exactly what you need to know at any moment without overdoing it.It\'s a little odd and not for everybody, but those who like slice of life should definitely give it a shot. contemporary Japan where aliens landed with a huge mother-ship and its inhabitants started spreading across the country.

Or the landlord Kotomi whom she looks up to as kind of a mother figure and a role model since she\'s a hard worker who works two jobs and generally seems to have a hard life while being seemingly unphased by it.She\'s also no different with her work colleagues at a restaurant, which is this middle aged man who\'s dependent on his cute 8 year old daughter (who\'s relationship clearly mirrors that of the main duo).It\'s also worth mentioning that Niea is envied by both Mayuko and the landlord since she is free of responsibilities and holds nothing back (like a child) in every way they can\'t.All of these things really make this cast and Mayuko in particular to feel incredibly human and relatable.I also want to bring up some of the series\' symbolism like Mayuko\'s watch she got from her father symbolizing her fear of losing her childhood or the apartment complex she\'s living in (being a place she vacationed in with her dad as a child), being a clear parallel to the alien mother-ship since the things that happen to both coincide with one another. clearly communicating that we should all say goodbye to our childhoods at some point. There\'s lot\'s of little details like that which just flew over my head in my first viewing.  This is not much of a sci fi series, the sci fi ideas here are only important for how they are relevant to its characters. It\'s mostly indirect, but we do also get bits and pieces of information about the alien society and how they function within our own spread throughout the series.But I don\'t wanna get too deep in to that. Since I want this to be a review, I\'ll just speak in a broader way from here on out.Narratively, the series starts out fairly episodic comprised of little funny adventures in each episode until it gains more momentum and has more continuity in the second half until it ends with quite a satisfying conclusion. A passage of time is shown to us through the changing of seasons but there\'s no way to know exactly how much time is passing. Also there\'s not a single wasted episode, every single one gives you more information about the characters whether it be through dialogue or having their actions speak for themselves. What makes these characters feel so well defined is that each of them have at least 2 distinct relationships with two other characters in which they seem to behave differently with each, which is a good way to highlight their personalities and fully define them as characters. And the main character specifically ends up being a very deep and identifiable one mainly through her actions and interactions with other characters as well as hints we get throughout the series about her past.The series\' tone might be hard to digest at first (an issue I had in my first viewing) since it ranges from wacky comedy hijinks to relaxing and meditative to even becoming quite depressing and somber depending on the characters\' mood. Most of the wacky comedy comes from Niea who\'s loud, hyperactive and generally just a useless pest. One thing I\'d say in defense of this, is that the show is much heavier on comedy in its first half where it switches from a relaxing tone to a wacky comedic one, but it rarely interrupts the depressing atmosphere that it gains in the second half since it really highlights what\'s truly important in this series.Another important thing is that the comedy is effective in creating a strong contrast and a sense of nostalgia or appreciation for this lighthearted tone in the later episodes (the same way the main character comes to appreciate it). In all respects, the series simply wouldn\'t be the same without it.This really works too since the series is excellent in terms of atmosphere and it knows how to make you feel exactly how it wants you to feel whether it\'s happy, depressed or relaxed. It\'s all done with great patience.Comedy might be subjective but I do think it is well handled here, both in terms of delivery and timing. Very often jokes seem to be set up way ahead of time (and often are an important part of the story) have a clear pay off point and don\'t overstay their welcome. Even to the point where the editor cuts away seconds before is acceptable making the jokes hit harder as well. I didn\'t think it was always funny but the show does have very sharp dialogue both comedic and otherwise so some of the jokes were able to land and catch me by surprise.Visually the show might have a cheap look at first glance since the characters can look a little wonky and off model on occasion and nothing looks particularly detailed. But the reason for this is because the characters have very elaborate motions and expressions quite often. This show goes for a kinetic or movement based style of animation. Although the more the series goes on, and the more depressing it becomes the show does tend to linger on shots more often giving us nicer single images (usually wide shots of empty spaces to convey the main character\'s loneliness).Also the series has Yoshitoshi Abe\'s distinct character designs, a bright color pallet with lot\'s of greens and blues, as well as good attention to detail when it comes to the changing of seasons.In terms of voice acting, everyone sounds like they\'re giving it their all. As I\'ve said the dialogue in this series is very sharp and character defining and the actors did a good job of selling that.Much of the series is quiet and without any music, especially the later half which I quite appreciate. But what music there is are these soft acoustic guitar pieces or pianos. At most you have some wacky comedic music in places and cartoonish sound effects (also there\'s one insert song by the singer of the OP).The OP and ED both seem to fit the series in terms of their lyrics. But the OP just sounds weird and the ED is actually very nice.Overall this series is brilliant and I feel stupid for not appreciating it when I first watched it only a few short years ago. The characters have real depth, the atmosphere is great, the directing is incredibly efficient and good at telling you exactly what you need to know at any moment without overdoing it.It\'s a little odd and not for everybody, but those who like slice of life should definitely give it a shot.', ""NieA_7 is, surprisingly, a mixed bag. It isn't mediocre the whole way through, far from it, but instead it has stellar highs and irritating lows. To summarise: I found the human side of the story (ie Mayuko's) extremely compelling - if the entire show were simply devoted to that, I would be willing to recommend it much more readily. The alien side (Niea's), however, I have little praise for.Mayuko is a deeply relatable character and navigates the common stressors of life with a certain elegance. I felt her story delivered lacklustre answers to her questions at times, such as what she wants to do with...her life, or how to deal with student-derived poverty, which I actually consider a strength. These problems are commonly discussed because they have no definitive answer. Maybe you're approaching 30 and still have no savings, or sometimes you enter university or the workforce with an ambivalent heart whilst your peers may have had lifelong career goals that they are now pursuing. Dispassion is not a bad thing, and I'm glad NieA_7 doesn't seem to present it like it is, the mundane nature of life is quite enough. The bathhouse is shown to provide a valuable community service, and when its situation develops (no spoilers!), you have an investment in the standing of this business, care for its well-being, and those reliant upon it. I enjoyed Mayuko's story from start to finish, and on its own I would give it as high as an 8-9/10. On the other hand, all of Niea's scenes, and those involving aliens in general, are consistently just awful. None of the jokes land, and Chada's characterisation frequently enters racist territory. The hierarchy of the alien society is never expanded or commentated upon in any meaningful way, and I felt it presented it as a force of nature rather than anything socially constructed. I understand that it can seem that way on an individual scale, and Niea does at times appear to try and make peace with it, but again, there isn't any substance to it. I would give Niea's story a 2-3/10.Is NieA_7 a bad anime? Not at all, there's gems of beautiful sentiment woven into it. Is it a good anime? Only just, Mayuko, Kotomi, Nenji, the Karitas, and perhaps Genzo do the heavy lifting, the rest are just dead weight. Be prepared to find the show boring at times, especially in comparison to ABe's other works (to me, it doesn't hold a candle to the magnificent Haibane Renmei), which was how I discovered it. 6/10. her life, or how to deal with student-derived poverty, which I actually consider a strength.

I didn't even remember it existed, but I'm glad I found it. I was pretty surprised to find that it had a rating of “under 7” (on MAL, I guess that means a show is pretty much terrible, given the tendency towards rating inflation of MAL users), but of course I was going to watch...it anyway. I thought it would be interesting how a team that had just gotten out of the creative world of SEL would ease themselves into a lighter show. Of ABe's four late-90s/early 00s anime (SEL, this, Haibane, and Texhnolyze), this is certainly the least well-known and least well-liked. And it's true that it's weaker than the masterpiece Serial Experiments Lain, and fails in a lot of the ways Haibane Renmei succeeds. Texhnolyze spirals off into a completely different direction, but for me is about on equal footing with Niea Under 7.Niea Under 7 is no masterpiece, but it is good, and criminally underrated. It's mostly a comedy/slice-of-life deal, and the premise should be familiar to anyone who watched Gintama (hold on, was this an influence?): aliens have come to Earth, but life continues relatively unchanged (much less in this than in Gintama). The premise and the fact that both are comedies are pretty much the end of the similarities, though, as the cast, general atmosphere, and comedic style are much different in this. Niea Under 7 is slow and sleepy and imbued with all the sluggishness of a hot summer, and it's all the better for it, as this atmosphere is a major contributor to some pretty genuinely emotionally affecting moments, which I will get back to.But first, the comedy. Of course, the central duo is comprised of Mayuko, an exaggeratedly poor college student, as the straight man, and Niea, an unemployed freeloading alien, as the funny man. It's pretty standard stuff, but certainly better than more typical incarnations. Mayu is tired, overworked, and filled with a world-weariness and cynicism that feels very real – she is as lost as any of us, a good person without any real means of applying her virtues. A particularly telling sign of her character comes in the first episode, where Niea crashes a spaceship through the roof of her apartment; Mayu simply accepts the blame without even trying to explain that she's not at fault. Niea comes with a stock defect, the absence of an antenna and a lower-class status. Neither of these are really all that convincing (I mean, we believe them, but sometimes they do seem “stock”), but I'm not sure if it really matters – the sadness that causes Niea to act out also feels genuine, regardless of whatever contrivances cause her grief.There is a lot of humor in Niea Under 7, but it's not exactly refined or witty; the funniest bits come from the editing, the voice acting, the visual choices, the sounds. It's not situational humor, particularly, but instead based on the characters or director behaving outlandishly against the more subdued tone that otherwise pervades. However, comedy is not necessarily the defining feature of Niea Under 7; it vanishes for extended periods, and when it returns, it really possesses a kind of emotionality unto itself, a revelry in the idea of comedy itself, rather than proper comedy. In essence, the main duo isn't that funny to the viewer, necessarily - they enact comedic routines more as a materialization of their bond as friends than as entertainment for the viewer. Because of this, there's a genuine pathos that undergirds (and sometimes undercuts) many of the comedic moments, especially later in the series.In other words, while Niea Under 7 could technically be classified as a slice-of-life comedy, it is really much better at being serious than comedic. All of the characters are deeper than they might be in an ordinary comedy; their motivations are subtle, fickle, and altogether human in a way that separates itself from the show's comedic elements (even with the “comedy relief” characters). Hell, Chie shows up in episode 4, and 5 minutes later, she's already more well-developed than most characters in the last 5 years' worth of anime history. Even Karna, who just abruptly drops out about halfway through the series, manages to have her moments of character development (where does she go, though?). The issue is, and others have pointed this out, that characters sometimes do drop out, and their presence is missed. But the characters that stick around explore facets of life that feel very authentic.In many ways, the concepts Niea Under 7 explores are relatively basic. We all know about family, personal pride, being ashamed, finding the courage to speak, and being tired. Niea Under 7 explores those concepts without what I would call sophistication – its successor, Haibane Renmei, was more sophisticated – but it remains grounded as a result of its lack of sophistication. More importantly, the show's lessons are delivered with a remarkable gentleness. Unlike in many comedies, these characters are not idiots – they have real motivations that supply humor when they are meant to but still remain legitimate, understandable, and fresh, if not entirely organic. For the kind of show that it is, the mechanisms of it are perhaps a bit too visible. (In Serial Experiments Lain, the mechanisms were more visible, but the constructedness was always essential to those characters; in Haibane Renmei, ABe finally achieves what he didn't in Niea Under 7 as the storycrafting completely disappears into the organic cast of characters.) Occasionally, this constructedness is put to good use, when, for example, all the characters happen to gather in the same place, or whatever. And later in the series, character development happens more and more naturally, although the sense that some elements of the show are intended to drive that character development never completely vanishes. But I can forgive ABe that, since the ways that the characters react to these events are so novel and so achingly subtle. Often while watching the show, I felt like ABe and co., after contributing to one of the coldest, darkest shows of the 90s, wanted to do something that's just warm. And this one is so warm and also so bittersweet, it has so much of the bittersweetness of stasis.On some technical aspects: there's not much music during the show, and the sound effects come straight from Hanna-Barbera's playbook in a curious reference to cartoon history – perhaps to demonstrate the poverty of the characters (even their sound effects are public domain!). It is a “domestic poor animation,” after all. The opening and closing songs, however, are both brilliant. On the OP, “Come Here,” and the subdued mood of the instrumental and creaking voice of SION himself portray a kind of weariness that persists throughout. And the ED is stunningly beautiful, especially paired with the montage of pictures from Mayuko's past; the line “Everybody will grow up and pass away eventually, but they will be born again here so it will be merry” is an emotional wellspring that tints every episode with bittersweetness, even right through the slapstick comedy. (Anybody who enjoyed the show would do well to look up the full-length song, which makes me choke up every time I listen to it.) Here the OP and ED really work with the show to build something bigger. What music is featured throughout the episodes is good at buttressing the sort of listless mood of the show overall.The animation certainly has its issues, but it's not particularly bothersome or important: it's good enough. The character design is, characteristically for ABe, fantastic, and the sets are also well-designed to contribute to the aura of quiet decrepitness that is so important to Niea Under 7.Some have pointed out that Niea Under 7 is perhaps too arbitrary and too incomplete, and it is so. For a show 13 episodes long, it tells a story that could've just as easily been told in maybe 7 or 8 – even less; this really could've been a feature-length film and hit all the major plot points, introduced all the major characters. So it seems bloated, right? Not exactly. Characters come in and out, and when we expect it all to build to something or to go somewhere, it stubbornly doesn't. Drama happens and it doesn't happen. Niea Under 7 imitates slow processes of life, where things don't quite happen as they do in the movies, where people take months to learn that they care about each other, where sudden tearfulness is a powerful emotional climax. More modern slice-of-life shows could learn a lot from NieA's subtlety.Of course it never exactly goes anywhere. One could never call Yoshitoshi ABe a genius specifically for having thought of this; the incredible depth, complexity, and philosophical deftness with which the team navigated a world like Serial Experiments Lain is gone here. But as if everything has to be the work of a genius. NieA Under 7 instead demonstrates that it's the work of people who have experienced happiness and sadness, comfort and unease, who have seen the cycles of the world fold over onto themselves, that everything is here and not. It is a celebration of ephemerality that is decidedly unprofound, and proud of that fact. Is that in itself profound? No, and to think it was would be to misunderstand the point. Here we have a warm, enveloping show that reminds us that the powerful messages driven home by other, more pointed, and often better shows aren't really the basis of life. NieA is a show about the seasons changing, and about saying goodbye to the moment that is now even when another one will surely come. Everything that is said is pregnant with emotion, and yet nothing is ever said; and yet, isn't that life? And just like that, NieA Under 7 is swept away by the wind.EDIT: Despite its technical deficiencies, I can tell this show is going to stay with me for a long, long time, so I'm going to bump it to an 8, which puts it cleanly in masterpiece territory. Yeah, you absolutely should watch this show, especially if you're a fan of ABe's.

The first thing that is unique about this, and why many will probably pick up this otherwise generic looking slice-of-life is that it\'s from the person that bought us Serial Experiments Lain. Yeah, this is NOTHING LIKE Serial Experiment at all. But it has a very unique charm, enough to give it an 8. And with the scoring out in the open for people just scanning to see, let\'s get to the meet of the review.OK, I\'m not great with names, so I\'m just gonna be describing characters - set in a rural town in present time (though the...rural setting certainly gives it a 60s/70s/80s syle), the main female is a poor cram student who earns just enough by working for the local bathhouse (where she also resides) to put a roof over her head and travel to Tokyo to study. However, she lives with an unusual roomate... An alien. Known as an under-seven, who are the scum of the alien hierarchy (more on this in a min), she just sponges off the female lead for food and shelter, and is definitely more trouble than she\'s worth.While I will talk about the characters soon, Nea (god knows why she\'s only the one I know the name of.... Suppose it\'s cuz the shows named after her) is SO annoying. I was constantly turning down the volume because of her whiny voice complaining she was hungry all the time, and the moments she\'s quite are some of the best moments of the show.Which leads to my next and last major complaint - the alien sub-plot. Firstly, humans and aliens are just OK with another. Just ""hey, there\'s a person with an antenna on their head, oh you\'re an alien, sure, you don\'t have lazers or anything""... Like, what? Also, and this just a sliiiiight complaint - THIS SUBPLOT DID NOT NEED TO EXIST! Seriously, there was no point - all it added was Nea, two men who had no lines, and old man who had no lines, an indian man (who, admittedly, was hilarious) and a chinese women who was a rival to Nea but just as annoying. I seriously could have enjoyed the show just as much, if not more (well, providing the indian dude was still in), without the alien subplot. OK, onto the massive draw of the show:-CHARM. BUCKETS AND BUCKETS OF CHARM. The lead female is  a really genuine character just trying to earn an education, the engineer who fixes up the bath-house and female leads roof (because Nea, the idiot, smashed it with a UFO she made cuz, aliens) is just a really nice guy, there\'s an old woman who\'s your stereotypical wise woman who, in a brilliant twist, thrashes everyone when the owner of the bath-house holds a retro videogame tournament, and the owner herself is a genuine, hardworking, independent woman. The only other three characters of mention is the chef of a little shop who lead female also works for, again just genuine nice guy, his daughter who\'s mature for her age, in a good way, and again, the indian. He\'s brilliant. If you do nothing else, search up this guy, sure there\'s gotta be clips on youtube, he\'s hilarious.Sound and animation were nothing special, animation was very similar to that of Serial Experiments, if you liked that style you won\'t mind this, I wasn\'t a massive fan, and there\'s hardly any music to talk of, and the opening and ending are also nothing worth mentioning.So this is really just a charming country-style SoL that I found so enjoyable just.... I really think it was just the charm. The setting, the lead females quest to scratch up enough money each month, the citizens of this rural town... I don\'t know, I just love it. Certainly deserving of a 9, but Nea and aliens ruins it enough to peg it down to 8. Definitely a recommended show for those who don\'t need mind-screws or massive battles or an epic tale, just those looking for some relatable characters and a good setting. rural setting certainly gives it a 60s/70s/80s syle), the main female is a poor cram student who earns just enough by working for the local bathhouse (where she also resides) to put a roof over her head and travel to Tokyo to study. However, she lives with an unusual roomate... An alien. Known as an under-seven, who are the scum of the alien hierarchy (more on this in a min), she just sponges off the female lead for food and shelter, and is definitely more trouble than she\'s worth.While I will talk about the characters soon, Nea (god knows why she\'s only the one I know the name of.... Suppose it\'s cuz the shows named after her) is SO annoying. I was constantly turning down the volume because of her whiny voice complaining she was hungry all the time, and the moments she\'s quite are some of the best moments of the show.Which leads to my next and last major complaint - the alien sub-plot. Firstly, humans and aliens are just OK with another. Just ""hey, there\'s a person with an antenna on their head, oh you\'re an alien, sure, you don\'t have lazers or anything""... Like, what? Also, and this just a sliiiiight complaint - THIS SUBPLOT DID NOT NEED TO EXIST! Seriously, there was no point - all it added was Nea, two men who had no lines, and old man who had no lines, an indian man (who, admittedly, was hilarious) and a chinese women who was a rival to Nea but just as annoying. I seriously could have enjoyed the show just as much, if not more (well, providing the indian dude was still in), without the alien subplot. OK, onto the massive draw of the show:-CHARM. BUCKETS AND BUCKETS OF CHARM. The lead female is  a really genuine character just trying to earn an education, the engineer who fixes up the bath-house and female leads roof (because Nea, the idiot, smashed it with a UFO she made cuz, aliens) is just a really nice guy, there\'s an old woman who\'s your stereotypical wise woman who, in a brilliant twist, thrashes everyone when the owner of the bath-house holds a retro videogame tournament, and the owner herself is a genuine, hardworking, independent woman. The only other three characters of mention is the chef of a little shop who lead female also works for, again just genuine nice guy, his daughter who\'s mature for her age, in a good way, and again, the indian. He\'s brilliant. If you do nothing else, search up this guy, sure there\'s gotta be clips on youtube, he\'s hilarious.Sound and animation were nothing special, animation was very similar to that of Serial Experiments, if you liked that style you won\'t mind this, I wasn\'t a massive fan, and there\'s hardly any music to talk of, and the opening and ending are also nothing worth mentioning.So this is really just a charming country-style SoL that I found so enjoyable just.... I really think it was just the charm. The setting, the lead females quest to scratch up enough money each month, the citizens of this rural town... I don\'t know, I just love it. Certainly deserving of a 9, but Nea and aliens ruins it enough to peg it down to 8. Definitely a recommended show for those who don\'t need mind-screws or massive battles or an epic tale, just those looking for some relatable characters and a good setting.', 'NieA_7 is hidden gem. Too bad most people watch it solely for the comedy parts and get disappointed.It\'s a slice of life/comedy/drama anime. Please note the drama part, even I was able to feel their despair at some scenes. I wouldn\'t recommend it to people who just wants to laugh.-Story 8/10The only flaw of the show. It introduces too many elements and abandons some without explaining much. This can be justified since it\'s only 13 episodes long. It starts as comedy and slowly builds up a serious existentalist tone, which was a suprise for me.-Art 9/10I took lots of screenshots. Think it as a...happier Lain.

They either got lucky at choosing seiyuus or a genius chose them.OP is bad as a song but it fits the show perfectly, gave me ""I can\'t do anything and my life is going worse every day but I\'ll try my best anyway"" vibes. ED is pretty pleasant and hopeful.-Character 10/10ABe knows how to design them, one of the most unforgettable cast I\'ve seen.

Comedy parts were funny and drama parts were properly done & realistic.-Overall 9/10One of the best slice of life anime you can watch.

Not only that, but she also has to put up with her roommate .NieA. that sleeps in her closet and is also an alien, yes an alien.

However none of these are properly explored even though it had the chance to do so, and when it tried, it barely even scratched the surface.The actual story of the anime is just about Mayuko’s life a she tries her hardest to maintain her grades as well as work multiple jobs in order for her to able to purchase a decent meal. Yet that comes to head with the fact that many of the places she’s working for are in the red, and are close to shutting down, and that she also has to deal with NieA who is leeching of her even though she is for the most part broke. This leads for some of the episodes being about the bathhouse, a place she both lives and works at, and trying to find some way to get some customers and revenue in yet never go as successful as they hope. Other than that there are several quiet and contemplative moments in the show which are very down to earth and are what make the show shine and frankly i think are the most well done i’ve seen in the slice-of-life genre. However that comes to head with the show having a lot of slapstick and for the most part unfunny comedy that is really upsetting and ruins a lot of the show. Now while not all the comedy is bad, there are more misses and hits which makes watching this show insufferable.What makes this show at least entertaining is that most of the cast of characters aside some of the alien character are very endearing and down to earth. Our main character, Mayuko,  is a really good character as she works really hard when it comes to school and her job and while she plans to go to college she lacks much direction in where she is heading in life. She is really shy to many people, but becomes more open to those she knows better. She is independent as she tries not to receive handouts from people although she sometimes gives in. however her character and many of the other cast really do come in conflict with the comedy as the show as it sometimes really brings them out of character which is really jarring.NieA on the other hand doesn’t have the same level of character as many of the other cast despite having a lot of screen time, and for the most part comes off as a gag character who for the most part is there to be childish and bother the rest of the cast. She’s also there as a sort of contrast to Mayuko since one is really serious about things; while the other one is laid back.  There was something in the story that changed her personality a bit, but it never goes the extra step and reverts back to her being the same. Oddly enough for a show that has some discrimination undertones the aliens really come off as flat and annoying characters.One of the more bigger troubles that i had with the show is the relationship that Mayuko and NieA have. Throughout the show it’s really hard to see them as friends and is more with Mayuko having to put up with NieA. it feels very one sided with most of the emotion coming from Mayuko like it was a person taking care of a pet.No one really has some sort of character development in the series yet it’s due to their interactions and personality that makes the worth watching, some times.The production value is decent to say the least. The voice acting for most of the characters is good. The soundtrack is very sparse with the anime being mostly quite yet there are soundtracks the consist of string instruments and an acoustic guitar. It also has some generic gag sound effects and music when it comes to the comedic moments.The character designs are really good with the way the characters look being a easy representation of how they act. Yet it is sometimes the way that they are presented through the show with changes in quality that really bring it down. The animation does have some high points when it comes to its animation, but for the most part it’s rather stiff. Not to mention that the shifts when it comes to comedic moments which are for the most parts its lowest moments.Overall I believe that there is something to be had from this show that is genuinely good.

Niea Under Seven has an extremely untypical format that may not be for everyone, so beware before entering!When the series starts off, it establishes itself in ways that are deceiving, which is why probably many who would have liked it ended up dropping it too early to find out what they were missing, or people that wanted what it promoted itself as were disappointed by the end. You may think you’re in for a generic slice of life comedy, but don’t get it wrong- it slowly...culminates into an almost-existential-like-drama before taking a hard left down sentimentality-to-the-maximum lane. The pacing changes at the drop of a hat in the most jarring and weirdest ways possible, it has an incredible amount of random joke breaks in the middle of semi-important sequences creating completely disoriented moods, and overall, the show is just so disjointed that it’s hard to enjoy any of its genres to the fullest capacity if you’re not used to its antics- However, in any case, it is hard to ignore that Niea Under 7  has many many subtle but well-done aspects that are almost too faint to sense upon your first look at the series. It expects you to want to get familiar with it before it reveals its true purpose and emotional themes, so hang on a while- we’re not done yet.Its is not as shallow as it portrays itself. It dabbles in emotionally-heavy and bleak topics such as finding a purpose in life, using its spontaneous humor and lighthearted tones to bring about profound messages about the meaning and the sentimentality of the small things in life in an unexpectedly unique and refreshing fashion. It also addresses an individual's impending and unavoidable responsibility for themselves and life, as well as topics of the value of familial connections- more than just by blood, but friendships as well. In that way, it’s sweet, homey, and relaxing, yet its bit of comedy that exaggeratedly proclaim themselves at the start would never make you think it could be so. The  humorous way Niea Under 7 delves into the themes of discrimination some may find as tasteless humor, but its true intentions behind such acts require patience, in which it later reveals its underlying message that all people- and aliens- are equal in a non-generic, humanistic tone that applies for much more than fiction. Honestly, I hate to admit how profound and great it develops such themes, and it's a darn shame if you only take it surface level upon a glance. This series runs much more deep than that and is shockingly complex.In stating all of these points, it still has its flaws, which some may find harder to ignore than others. It takes no effort to accommodate anyone, and many people may take this boldness to offense. You’ll see that Niea Under 7 finds its footing over time and proves to become flawed in progression. I think that anyone will be able to discern its true intentions by episode 7, so try to hang on until that point. Its subtleness makes it great, and the way that each character develops in such realistic and relatable ways is superb. Its worldbuilding of the alien society is very subtle yet realistically done in that you don’t know everything about it, but it's enough for you to understand the story and feel the impact of certain events. It’s extremely personal in that way, and the show feels like a friend who won’t leave your side that you need to observe and understand before you can appreciate who they are. The themes it tackles are engaging and worthwhile, and enriching beyond almost any anime I’ve seen. It’s so unique that I doubt you’ll come out from watching it with the thought that you’ve witnessed everything it offered before. I just wished it wasn’t bogged down by so many tedious acts of criminally drastic changes in pace, mood-killing jokes, and unnecessary genre switches or supposedly ‘filler content’ that downplays its amazingly done plethora of qualities severely.In short, Niea Under Seven’s a great show buried in flaws and misconducted introduction- mostly because it purposely subverts you for greater impact later. Everyone will probably have a different opinion of it, so try to enjoy it in your own ways and take time to understand it and appreciate it for what it is.

I don’t really know, and to be honest, I don’t think the show does either.Niea_7 is an anime based on the doujinshi, and with character designs by, Yoshitoshi ABe. You might know him from his involvement in Serial Experiments Lain, Texchnolyze, and Haibane Renmei. It’s thought the people who made Lain made this show to cool down after it, as it has a fair amount of similar people who worked on both.The story, put in the most basic terms possible, is...that in a world where aliens have arrived and become commonplace and nobody really seems to care, Mayuko, a poor student living in a bathhouse is living with a freeloading under alien known as Niea. This base actually provides a very enjoyable setup. The setting and all it’s oddities are intriguing, I really wanted to learn more about how the aliens came and what exactly is going on. The world and atmosphere has a lot of depth, and feels surprisingly realistic. Along with that, pretty much every character in this show is enjoyable and unique. Even characters I was skeptical of I came to love as the show went on.We’ve got Niea, who’s ridiculous and over-the-top, yet whom we begin to see is a lot deeper than we think, and Mayuko, from whom most of the show’s perspective is oriented, with a fair amount of inner monologue from her. She’s incredibly relatable, and just all around a really human and grounded character, whose dynamic with the people around her is brilliant. Even some of the weaker characters, like Genzo and Chiaki, are still very enjoyable overall, and I loved Chie’s dynamic with her father and Kotomi’s with the bathhouse staff. These great characters make the few bits of drama that are in the show work incredibly well. When there was some character conflict in the later episodes, in most series’ I would’ve thought it forced and poor, but in the way it was presented, and in the context of the show and it’s characters, it worked really well.The soundtrack is perfectly simplistic and calming, and it does well to contribute to the setting. I even really enjoyed the ED as well, though I can’t say the same for the Opening, which makes my throat hurt just listening to it. As well as that the dub is really good. If a dub’s enjoyable enough I’ll watch it that way, and I found the voices for almost all the characters to be perfectly fitting.This show, however, is far from perfect. You’ve likely heard the phrase “Jack of all trades, master of none” and I feel it’s pretty applicable here. There’s a clear lack of focus, which leads to a very anticlimactic ending, tons of unanswered questions, along with unresolved character conflicts. The ending message of the show just seems to be “Life moves on” which is a rather tired, cliche, and lazy way of writing yourself out of a corner.  The Main Character seems, much like everyone else, not to really care for figuring out what’s going on by the end, but after all this buildup you’re just left sitting there thinking “That’s all?”The comedy as well is also very hit and miss, leaning towards the latter half of that. Particularly earlier in the series the humor just completely bombs. I haven’t even watched that much anime with this old style of humor, but it still feels tired and overused. It’s as generic as comedy gets. There are some jokes that work, like I found the Indian cosplaying alien to be completely hilarious, and towards the later parts of the show the quality of the jokes improved, though it never got that amazing, and generally at most got a chuckle or two out of me.Along with that, the focus on humor is honestly kind of disappointing, considering we have this super interesting setting and characters, with so much mystery begging for exploration, and the focus of the show is comedy?! Really?! It lightly touches on issues such as class and racism, but it never really fully explores them, and just seems to skim the surface of it.The animation isn’t much of improvement either. It’s pretty obviously low budget. I mean it did air 2000, but that isn’t much of an excuse considering how Trigun, Cardcaptor Sakura, and Serial Experiments Lain all came out two years prior and they look miles better. It’s oddly inconsistent. Sometimes it looks nice, sometimes it doesn’t, and the level of detail fluctuates wildly. It isn’t particularly smooth or detailed, and while the character designs bear Yoshitoshi ABe’s signature unique style, I’d say they’re far from his best work. I do harbor a particular liking towards the background designs. While they’re simplistic, it suits the show, and they have this nice pastel-like atmospheric look to them, that really added to the enjoyableness of the world.Overall I give Niea_7 a 7/10 (quite fitting might I add). It’s a well-done show with an interesting setting, compelling characters, and lots of heart. However, the poor humor, inconsistent animation, wasted potential, and oh so many unanswered questions holds it back from being as brilliant as it could’ve been. It’s a unique show for certain, and I don’t regret picking it up.(Originally Written November 9th, 2014)https://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/ that in a world where aliens have arrived and become commonplace and nobody really seems to care, Mayuko, a poor student living in a bathhouse is living with a freeloading under alien known as Niea.

The main director for the series was Tomokazu Tokoro (Haibane Renmei), and it aired from Apr 26 2000 to Jul 19 2000. NieA is an adaptation of a doujin manga with the same name, created by Yoshitoshi ABe. The manga would later go on to be published by Kadokawa Shoten on their monthly Shounen magazine Monthly Ace Next.The story goes something like this. Aliens have come and invaded the earth. But rather than taking over, they have decided to live among the humans, as their mother ship...has broken down and they can not leave the planet. We follow the dirt-poor student Chigasaki Mayuko who finds herself living with one of these aliens named NieA. NieA is what is called an Under Seven alien who does nothing buy laze around, eat lots of food, and builds space ships. While Mayuko is trying to go to cram school to get into college, as well as earn enough money for herself to be able to eat everyday, which proves very difficult with NieA around.This show is mostly a comedy slice of life type of story, but it's also got a lot of themes of class difference and discrimination. This makes the show not just a fun watch, but also makes it interesting to see what will become of a girl living by herself and an alien who officially doesn't even legally exist.The most important characters in this show is obviously Mayuko and NieA. Mayuko is a dilligent student and a hard worker, who's just doing her best to survive, and NieA is a lazy freeloading slob who won't do anything. But other than them you've also got some minor characters like Chiaki Komatsu. She goes to the same cram school as Mayuko and is a total geek for aliens. She ends up becoming Mayuko's friend. You've also got Kotomi Hiyama who runs the bathhouse that Mayuko stays at. She is a hard worker who is doing everything she can to keep the bathhouse from closing, even though it seems like an impossible task. She's also a character that Mayuko can turn to and vent her frustrations or just get advice from.The animation in this show is nothing to write home about. It moves, but it can be very clunky at times. Kind of annoying since there isn't so much movement to animate. That said though, a lot of the animation is pull and stretch techniques to try make situations more funny.Overall I enjoyed this show. Going into it I didn't really know much about this show, so at first I thought this was just gonna be a straight comedy. The comedy was funny, but when the themes of discrimination and class difference started to appear, as well as Mayuko's very real struggles of trying to make ends meet financially in an unstable economy, as well as the lonliness she feels being away from her family, and with no really close friends to speak of, seeing her find a home in the Enohama bathhouse, as well as make friends was a lot more heartwarming than I was expecting from this show. I would honestly recommend you to check out this show if you are at all curious, but if you're not into random comedy or very slow paced shows you might just want to give this show a miss. has broken down and they can not leave the planet. We follow the dirt-poor student Chigasaki Mayuko who finds herself living with one of these aliens named NieA. NieA is what is called an Under Seven alien who does nothing buy laze around, eat lots of food, and builds space ships. While Mayuko is trying to go to cram school to get into college, as well as earn enough money for herself to be able to eat everyday, which proves very difficult with NieA around.This show is mostly a comedy slice of life type of story, but it's also got a lot of themes of class difference and discrimination.

Imagine if Tom Waits was Japanese, and there\'s your op. However, for as fun and relatable as so much of the anime is, the reality is that it is deeply flawed in enough ways to keep it from being truly great. To begin, the story itself is very solid as a concept. Aliens come to Earth and get stranded here, and the Human governments end...up assigning classifications to them all, most of them ending up as second-class citizens. They look humanoid save for their ears and antennas, and one of these aliens, a bubbly and mischievous girl named NieA, ends up living in the home of Mayuko, who herself lives and works in a bathouse her parents used to own. The two get into conflicts over everything, but they are playful by nature and deep down they care for each other. I enjoyed the subtle twist of making the presence of aliens so mundane, even the fact that the Mothership is a feature of the sky at all times is framed as simply normal. I also really enjoyed the fact that the story followed a simple, almost episodic rhythm, which made the show a relaxing watch and even more relatable. Though, given the run time, I almost feel like the deeper themes they wanted to work with weren\'t fully fleshed out, so some potential is definitely left on the table in regards to the story. The art was good throughout, and perfect for this type of show. The fact that it came out in spring of 2000 was palpable and made me nostalgic for the anime I watched when I was a kid. It shows not only in the animation style and visual gags, but also in the art direction itself. The design of the mothership, the antennas of the aliens, and the subtle details throughout the show itself like in wood textures, fields of grass, and food, speak to a care and dedication that let us know this show was special to the people who worked on it. Also, the faces of the characters are able to express a wide range of emotion, and this anime thusly avoids the dreaded ""mask"" as I call it. However, it\'s not perfect. The reuse of animations is frequent and obvious, and sometimes things which aren\'t the absolute main focus of attention suffer as a result, looking downright shoddy. The sound is much the same, with the music being a perfect fit for this show and again making me nostalgic for times gone by. It is folksy and amateurish while being pretty and calming at the same time. However, these songs are also reused quite often, though I don\'t mind this very much at all. The sounds of life are perfectly serviceable, though at points they really shine through and almost have an ASMR-like quality to them, especially the sounds of rain or fabric blowing in the wind. However, the immersion that those moments bring is positively shattered by the liberal use of Looney Tunes sound effects. I thought I was having a stroke when I heard them use the Scooby-Doo ""running fast but going nowhere"" sound effect, and they only really learn to reel that shit in around episode 7. The characters are perhaps my favorite part of the anime, however. I love the sheer humanity of it. Almost all of them feel like real, authentic people who I can believe exist and are living the lives they do in the show. Mayuko\'s interactions with NieA are genuine and have an almost sibling-like quality, and they\'re both exquisitely characterized, to the point where everything going on in their heads and hearts are almost felt by the viewer as well. This goes for the rest of the human cast as well. However, while most of the alien cast is also pretty good, there is one major failing in the case of Chada, an alien who sought to fashion himself after a stereotypical Indian, who even manages an ""11/7"" convenience store. Anyway, my problem with him isn\'t the race thing at all, I really don\'t care and it\'s obvious that the intentions of the animation studio Triangle Staff are 100% innocent. My problem comes with the fact that he\'s meant to be comedic relief and he isn\'t funny. Whenever he shows up he just ends up disrupting the flow of the show, and interrupting whatever was happening in the story at that time to make a joke about curry or sexual harassment. But, he\'s not bad or frequent enough of a character to ruin the show. At the end of the day, I enjoyed watching this anime, and the good things like the nostalgia, unique story concept, and slice-of-life comedy outweigh the bad things like repetitive animation, incomplete story, and sometimes shoddy gag comedy. up assigning classifications to them all, most of them ending up as second-class citizens.

NieA Under 7 is a very unassuming series, and at first glance, it looks like any old slice of life anime from the early 2000s. On top of that, our titular character can be really grating at times, and with other characters like the...walking Indian stereotype? (wow, that...has to be racist, right?) It makes sense why so many people would be quick to write this one off.But, with only thirteen episodes, I highly recommend you hang on.NieA Under 7 is the type of...SOL show that digs deep into the aspects of every day life, and contemplates the characters' feelings and circumstances. It paints the picture of a marginalized immigrant living with a poor college student and their every day lives trying to get by. The marginalization of the aliens is mostly treated as set dressing at first, so the small moments where they dig deeper into it tends to be insightful. Mayu's poverty is treated similarly; it's not necessarily treated un-seriously, but rather it's such a normal factor of life it tends to be brushed over and joked around about---much like how living in poverty actually is. So, just like the marginalization of the aliens, it hits so much harder when they take the time to reflect on it and how deeply it affects the characters. NieA Under 7 is a quirkly SOL, but it manages to capture the exhaustion and misery that the hollow acceptance of your poverty brings.And it's not just marginalization and poverty. Mayu as a character is one just coming into her young adulthood, the age of discovery and figuring yourself out, but she's much too stressed from work and school to be doing that. She struggles socially and isn't sure what she wants to do with her life. She internalizes her problems and sabotages things for herself even though everyone around her likes her and wants to help. It's such a frighteningly realistic depiction of what it's like to be this age in such dire circumstances that suck the life right out of you.NieA under 7 is an odd slice of life series that seems rather mediocre at first glance, but it also touches on themes of identity, discrimination, coming of age, melancholy, cultural assimilation, class, and social alienation. It may not be perfect, but these reflective moments hit somewhere deep and resonant within.Don't pass this one up.

Guess who's back (briefly) for another anime review again? Me, Nyo! Yeah, sorry for kinda vanishing for a while, I'll explain why in my post-review ramble. Literally just finished watching the last episode of this one and I've got a bit to say on it so let's dig into the final nugget of the ABe Anime Tetralogy (my little umbrella name for Lain, Niea, Haibane, and Texhnoylze cause I can't think of anything actually cool to say) and close it off right!:The Story/Narrative [8/10]:A simple story about Humans and Aliens living together in harmony on...Earth...sort of. There's some divides between higher and lower-class Aliens just like there are with humans it seems too... rather depressing, but I guess that's what ABe shows all kinda have in common. It mainly revolves around Mayuko, a stressed-out girl trying to make money and get into college while studying at a cram school at the same time while dealing with the tough world of growing up, the world changing, and just dealing with everyday problems...mostly Niea being a mischievous little bugger and Chada being a weirdo. Not much else really to the show other than that. It's a short, simple, and sweet story with some light character drama that closes off nicely, with all of the main characters all getting plenty of screen time to develop (though I DO wonder where Karna went, she vanishes after like episode 9 or something, whichever episode they had the bathhouse arcade tournament.) It's nothing spectacular, but it's nothing bad either and the explanation of the lore of aliens themselves and the concept of things like the mothership and different classes of aliens makes it a much more interesting show, it's sort of a blend of the depressiveness of what Serial Experiments Lain did was Mayuko's side of the story (at least towards the latter half of the series and whenever she's just by herself) and the lighter moments that Haibane Renmei would later do more balanced in conjunction with the serious theme, which manifests in the form of Niea's development. In a way, this show is like the in-between to both of those shows and it shows, it's still got that charm that I've loved from the rest of ABe's series and that's all I really wanted at the end of the day. I just kinda wish we could've seen what came of the bathhouse, even if yes, I still think the ending we got is fine and closes out the series nicely much like Haibane would go and do later...yeah, let's just stop comparing this to other ABe shows. The story's good for what it is, A-.The Characters [9/10]Now, you think I'd hate most of the characters given the fact they're either just one-note exaggerated character traits or blatant stereotypes of other cultures (especially since I'm not the type of person to usually enjoy comedy anime, they just never do anything for me cause [I know this is gonna sound cliche] I've got a stupidly five-headed sense of humor, so it's a little hard to impress me), but nope, I actually really like the entire cast, even Chada. There's a lot of variety in these characters and as the show goes on we get to see other sides of them (like I said earlier with Mayuko being depressed and also being a hothead on her other side) and it's all well and good. It's hard for me to complain when all of the characters are just so interesting to me and definitely form the wackiest cast of anime characters I've seen.That's honestly all I've got to say, asides from the main cast having the depth I already sort of dumped in the story section. I think everyone (again minus Karna) got enough screen time to develop themselves, by the end, I wasn't so much laughing as much as I was actually feeling pretty bad for everyone in the Enohana Bathhouse crew...and for a comedy slice of life anime...that's pretty impressive. A+ stuff.The Visuals [9/10]Well, with the same team that made Serial Experiments Lain working on this anime...is it really any surprise I really love this show's visuals? Sure, its animation and visuals look a teeny bit rough at times, but the scenery, the character designs, and the use of different types of animation even if it's only brief, it's all really vibrant, creative, and definitely in line with ABe's other anime work. It once again really feels like a neat little in-between from Lain to Haibane and yet it still has all of the charm and style from both, especially in the opening, it gives me a mixture of vibes from both shows in terms of its visuals. The visuals in this show in particular I'd say help give off certain vibes that the show wanted to convey to the viewer and never goes too overboard between sad and wacky in any scenes, it strikes a nice balance that Haibane would later tighten upon, I'm sure the experience from making this show really helped in making Haibane the emotionally robust show it was.It's cutesy, neat, creative and it's definitely wacky, perfectly fitting for a show like this, just another reason I liked it so much. A+ from there, ABe-san!The Sound Design [9/10]Aaaaahhh, ABe shows...they always have such amazing soundtracks...and this show's no different! From the melancholic opening theme to even the briefest songs used for cutaway skits, this show's got a PHENOMENAL soundtrack. I wouldn't say it's better than Lain or Texhnolyze good, but it's at least up there with Haibane Renmei's soundtrack. There's acoustic tunes, electronic tunes, and ambient music, it's just...pure ABe at its finest. What else is there to say? If I could buy a CD of every anime soundtrack for these shows, I'd do it in a heartbeat...or just pray they all get put on Spotify which sadly is...probably not gonna happen for us Western listeners...anyways, great OST! A+.Gotta love all that beautiful environmental ambiance too...that stuff ALWAYS gets me really invested.The voice-acting is great! The Japanese cast absolutely sells their roles and all sound distinct and fit the characters perfectly, which was definitely needed for a comedy show like this, it's all about that vocal range and hitting the right chords. Meanwhile, the dub is uhhh...hehe...not great...it's definitely a year 2000 anime-dub, so I guess there was still room for improvement. I'm glad I only have seen clips of the dub cause man, that dub probably would've made me not like the show. ABe Anime English Dubs have always been sort of a hit or miss type deal, Lain's dub was...off, Haibane's was fine, and Texhnoylze's is decent as well. I guess things just got better as time went on.Solid A, no + or - needed.The Verdict/Conclusion [8.5/10]I really liked this show and I'm definitely glad I FINALLY got around to watching it, it's been a long time coming and now that I'm finally finished with all of the ABe anime as far I know (...if there is any more out there like it, shoot me a message on my profile, I'd be quite curious to know), I can finally say how much of hardcore fan I am of these shows. They're truly something special, especially Niea's case cause going in, I thought I was gonna hate it (even if I'll admit yeah, there are some tasteless jokes in there, but it was Japan in the year 2000, I guess it's just something I gotta accept as part of the times, so who cares), but I turned to really like this show, just as much as the other ones I'd say. Sure, it's no masterpiece like Lain and Texhnoylze, but it wasn't trying to be, it was just simple anime comedy fun and it did give me a few laughs and chuckles, so I guess it worked on me in the end.I'd say if you want a more laid-back show, an older comedy anime to spice up your anime portfolio or laugh at some dated humor, or just a mini anime to kill some time like it was for me (I'll explain in a moment what I mean by that), or you're like me and wanted to see more Yoshitoshi ABe anime, then this show's for you![Post Review Ramble:]So yeah...again, really sorry for vanishing on you all. I've been getting a lot more attention from my reviews recently (thankies for that!) and I had a little bit of a situation come up that gave me the time to finally get around to watching this show. So...because I guess I didn't clean my PC out regularly enough, I had my GPU Artifact on me and I thought it was a goner, but once I cleaned it the next day, it was fine and has been fine ever since. I was in the middle of my SUDA51 binge with The 25th Ward (and I was starting to get really invested into it too...), so I'd decided to take a break from that game because I thought THAT was what caused it to glitch up...which was probably part of it cause I WAS running the game at double the resolution my card's supposed to be able to support...doesn't help my monitor's 2K and my RX 580's only built for 1080p Gaming at most...gotta love how my new rig died out less than a month and my 5-year-old rig here is still going strong...it's whatever. I've been binging through the Yakuza games (I'm on Yakuza 5 as of writing this and I love it just as much as the other games) and it's been doing just fine. That's been all done and solved now and I got to watch the last ABe show I've wanted to watch for a while now and really enjoyed it.Aaaand now that I have this show done, I'll be promptly returning to The 25th Ward and my SUDA51 binge...I've still got Red, Blue, and Green (both the fangame AND Manga) along with the Kurayami Dance Manga to get through after The 25th Ward...so I've got my work cut out for me. I'll try and get through this all ASAP (especially since I want to finish these games before No More Heroes 3 launches on PC with Steam on October 11th, SUDA's been connecting the dots, so to speak, so I need as much context as I can get for THAT game.)My next anime review...I'm honestly not sure when or what it'll be. I've been REALLLLY eyeing Blood+, though, it looks really neat, but that's a lot of episodes for me to get through and my reviews for these 13-episode animes are already long, imagine me trying to review a 50-episode-long show without it looking like a college paper on your screen...makes me wish I could just have good editing and make anime reviews instead, but oh well, this is the best I can muster with my dumb brain. Anyways, we'll have to wait and see. Again, thanks for the continued support and I appreciate all of the friend requests and nice comments you all send my way. I'll start accepting friend requests a little more, maybe give out my Discord eventually if you wanna chat up about our lord and savior Yoshitosh-nah, I'm just kidding with ya (though maybe I'm not so much considering I've started trying to collect as much of his art in terms of art books, manga, and stuff, so uhh...uh oh, hehe~), but we'll see, maybe if people ask for it enough.Believe In The Niea! Earth...sort of.

I guess things just got better as time went on.Solid A, no + or - needed.The Verdict/Conclusion [8.5/10]I really liked this show and I'm definitely glad I FINALLY got around to watching it, it's been a long time coming and now that I'm finally finished with all of the ABe anime as far I know (...if there is any more out there like it, shoot me a message on my profile, I'd be quite curious to know), I can finally say how much of hardcore fan I am of these shows. They're truly something special, especially Niea's case cause going in, I thought I was gonna hate it (even if I'll admit yeah, there are some tasteless jokes in there, but it was Japan in the year 2000, I guess it's just something I gotta accept as part of the times, so who cares), but I turned to really like this show, just as much as the other ones I'd say. Sure, it's no masterpiece like Lain and Texhnoylze, but it wasn't trying to be, it was just simple anime comedy fun and it did give me a few laughs and chuckles, so I guess it worked on me in the end.I'd say if you want a more laid-back show, an older comedy anime to spice up your anime portfolio or laugh at some dated humor, or just a mini anime to kill some time like it was for me (I'll explain in a moment what I mean by that), or you're like me and wanted to see more Yoshitoshi ABe anime, then this show's for you![Post Review Ramble:]So yeah...again, really sorry for vanishing on you all. I've been getting a lot more attention from my reviews recently (thankies for that!) and I had a little bit of a situation come up that gave me the time to finally get around to watching this show. So...because I guess I didn't clean my PC out regularly enough, I had my GPU Artifact on me and I thought it was a goner, but once I cleaned it the next day, it was fine and has been fine ever since. I was in the middle of my SUDA51 binge with The 25th Ward (and I was starting to get really invested into it too...), so I'd decided to take a break from that game because I thought THAT was what caused it to glitch up...which was probably part of it cause I WAS running the game at double the resolution my card's supposed to be able to support...doesn't help my monitor's 2K and my RX 580's only built for 1080p Gaming at most...gotta love how my new rig died out less than a month and my 5-year-old rig here is still going strong...it's whatever. I've been binging through the Yakuza games (I'm on Yakuza 5 as of writing this and I love it just as much as the other games) and it's been doing just fine. That's been all done and solved now and I got to watch the last ABe show I've wanted to watch for a while now and really enjoyed it.Aaaand now that I have this show done, I'll be promptly returning to The 25th Ward and my SUDA51 binge...I've still got Red, Blue, and Green (both the fangame AND Manga) along with the Kurayami Dance Manga to get through after The 25th Ward...so I've got my work cut out for me. I'll try and get through this all ASAP (especially since I want to finish these games before No More Heroes 3 launches on PC with Steam on October 11th, SUDA's been connecting the dots, so to speak, so I need as much context as I can get for THAT game.)My next anime review...I'm honestly not sure when or what it'll be. I've been REALLLLY eyeing Blood+, though, it looks really neat, but that's a lot of episodes for me to get through and my reviews for these 13-episode animes are already long, imagine me trying to review a 50-episode-long show without it looking like a college paper on your screen...makes me wish I could just have good editing and make anime reviews instead, but oh well, this is the best I can muster with my dumb brain. Anyways, we'll have to wait and see. Again, thanks for the continued support and I appreciate all of the friend requests and nice comments you all send my way. I'll start accepting friend requests a little more, maybe give out my Discord eventually if you wanna chat up about our lord and savior Yoshitosh-nah, I'm just kidding with ya (though maybe I'm not so much considering I've started trying to collect as much of his art in terms of art books, manga, and stuff, so uhh...uh oh, hehe~), but we'll see, maybe if people ask for it enough.Believe In The Niea!""]"
Hetalia World★Stars,https://myanimelist.net/anime/43591/Hetalia_World★Stars,"[""I first watched Hetalia in 2011, and when I learned that after 10 years, my country, Portugal, was finally gonna get animated, I was ecstatic! It was a shame it was only half an episode, tho.Everyhting else was typical Hetalia, the jokes, the cute animations... It's great!I'm just surprised that after 6 years since the last season, they decided to do the series again, but only for 12 episodes.It's something you watch really fast, it's relaxing, and you learn some cool stuff from it! Totally recommend, if you watched the other seasons, this one shouldn't be left out. "", ""I wasn't planning on writing a review for Hetalia world stars, especially this early, but the surprisingly low rating on the very first day it got released had caught me off guard and had me wondering if it was another April fool's joke for a second. I mean...a 6.4??? Really? And it was also just the first episode, which also happens to be no more than five minutes, so I just find it hard to believe that so many didn't like it right off the bat, and why so many dislike it so far.I, for one, thought that it was really good. The animation was...very pretty and smooth overall. It also seems to be loyal to the manga so far, which I'm really glad about, not to mention the amazing theme song that was both catchy and super adorable. The only thing I could think of was the change in animation and unfortunately short number of episodes, but other than that, it was a great first episode, and the other three that followed keep getting better and better, with the appearance of new characters and an improved style of humour when compared to the previous seasons, so I hope the rating goes up soon instead of seeing so many hating on it just for it being hetalia, and cling on to whatever reputation or fandom it had in the past as a basis to why they think it's the ultimate disgrace to all anime that should be taken down, it's just ridiculous at this point. very pretty and smooth overall.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

Episode 6 got me to ship something I\'d never thought of before, so that was great.My...favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.

World Stars made me fall in love with every character all over again. 10/10 Would recommend.For those who hate Hetalia, I suggest you put your opinion on the fandom and the ""cringy fangirls"" aside and give it at least a shot, because it\'s really funny and historically accurate. favorite so far is definitely episode 7 though.
