Sensei no Ojikan: Dokidoki School Hours,https://myanimelist.net/anime/533/Sensei_no_Ojikan__Dokidoki_School_Hours,"[""I'm the first person to review this? Okay...Story: The description of this series sounded interesting but it is executed poorly. 'Doki Doki School Hours' is like the inbred offspring of 'Azumanga Daioh'  , 'Pani Poni Dash', and 'Digi Charat'. Series begins 'in medias res' and has no real plot or drama. The pace is really hyper, and throws me off. Each episode is a series of short gags, like a 4-koma comic or something, interspersed with character profiles for scene transitionsArt: It's drawn well, but I highly dislike the extreme 'manga-ness' of it. 'Manga-ness' includes things like large Japanese text on the screen 80%...of the time, displaying a character's name every scene they are in, and &quot;profiles&quot; of the characters appearing on screen for two seconds (Not enough time to read it, and I am a very fast reader).Sound: The opening theme was forgettable, the ending theme was not much better, but what I really want to talk about is the LACK of sounds. Instead of having actual sound effects, the animators just write the sounds in kana on the screen. ALL THE TIME. So, instead of putting the sound of a heartbeat in when a character is nervous, there's just these HUMONGO &quot;どきっ! どきっ! どきっ!&quot; all over the screen. The same is done with regard to the sounds of walking, eating, laughing, etc. IT IS REALLY ANNOYING. Also instead of maybe putting some damn music in to convey the mood, the mood of the character is just written in GIANT kanji above/behind/next to them. Look, writing things like &quot;concerned&quot; or &quot;serious&quot; everywhere is okay IN A MANGA. This is just ANNOYING.Character: The characters are actually done well. This is the thing I had no problem with. But you must be constantly reminded what character is currently on screen, usually with big flashing text at the top and bottom. ANNOYING.Enjoyment: Like reading a manga without having time to properly look at each panel. NOT ENJOYABLE.Overall Doki Doki School Hours is just poorly done. You just have to watch it for yourself to get a feel of how s***y this anime is. of the time, displaying a character's name every scene they are in, and &quot;profiles&quot; of the characters appearing on screen for two seconds (Not enough time to read it, and I am a very fast reader).Sound: The opening theme was forgettable, the ending theme was not much better, but what I really want to talk about is the LACK of sounds.

And if you want to see epic stories, great storylines and stuff like that, you\'r in the wrong Genre. I mean, if your girlfriends says, she wants to go to the cinema and you can decide the movie,...you wouldn\'t pick ""Rambo"", would ya?Anyways, the important thing for a slice of life comedy Anime is, that the characters got different personalities, so that everybody can find his favourite. DDHS is a perfect example of how it should be done:We\'ve got a girl, who\'s only attracted to girls, a boy who\'s only attracted to boy\'s, a narcissist who likes to wear girly clothes, a loli-teacher, an excited girl, a huuge fangirl, a guy who acts like an old man, a clumsy guy, a girl with a big mouth, a guy who\'s all into drawing manga, and a little girl who\'s attracted to him.Now you can try tell me, that this Anime doesn\'t fill your needs. HAR! =DEven this shows us an the world, that this anime won\'t get boring so fast, this could also be the weakness of this Anime. Because there are so many characters, but only 13 episodes (or 12, because in the first episode we happen to know each and every character) which could be a little bit too less airtime for every specific character.But from what i\'ve seen (3 episodes) i really like Doki Doki School Hours because of all the different characters and awesome slapstick moments. In points of sound and artwork it defintily isn\'t something to get excited about, but the slapstick, differences in personalities of the characters and the cuteness as well as the charme of this Anime ""zero"" this point.So i\'ll give it a 10/10 so far. you wouldn\'t pick ""Rambo"", would ya?Anyways, the important thing for a slice of life comedy Anime is, that the characters got different personalities, so that everybody can find his favourite.

And as expected this show took inspiration from the original, but they still managed to expand the plot and characters nicely. Adding male characters helped balance it out, especially since Azumanga only centered on female characters. Adding both yaoi and yuri characters were also a good choice. At some point the show tried to cram too many best-of-the-best jokes that we've seen from other anime show. But it's not so bad. This is the kind of anime I don't mind leave to play on the...background. When I re-watched it recently I'm surprised that I still remember some of the catch phrase, especially the fireworks scene. This was the show that first introduced me to the Kaguya-Tamaya tradition. And many other Japanese culture references I also first heard it from here. I won't mind showing this to 5 years old, since most of the adult jokes are subtle yet still hilarious for the younguns to learn Japanese for the first time. background.

Each character has an simple yet unique personality cliche that could have been perfect is use proper but instead the show decided to focus on each of their personality by stating it over and over again instead showing some kind of interaction between the personalities or playing with it. It just keep stating their unique overused cliche over and over again all at once with all the main characters throwing it out there instead of dividing an few characters interaction at once they decided to throw them...all together so each time you watch it you kind of get sick of the characters and you learn nothing about them except their core personality that is given to them. Also the show decided to focus on the boring and edgily characters that won't felt weird if they do once a while but they the whole show is just doing that it makes you felt embarrassed even if you share one similar aspect with those character after a while . It felt like the show is trying to prove something about the class and the teacher but fails to deliver it. Each time it tries to dissect a character it just keep stating their cliche that brings it to no where. The whole show is basically a mess full with cliche characters put in one place trying to attract your attention through their overuse personality while showing no character development or anything beyond their personal cliche.  As the characters interact they cliche all explode at on each other bring the story to no where except back at looking at the characters basically the whole show is without an story trying to explore the characters but it won't go beyond their cliche.  While it it an slice of life story, character development shouldn't be consider however the show constant try to show some kind of character development that leads to nowhere. all together so each time you watch it you kind of get sick of the characters and you learn nothing about them except their core personality that is given to them.

And the result, after watching 12 episodes, is that... it was hilarious and funny at times.Okay, Sensei no Ojikan (Teacher\'s Time) tells us about Mika Suzuki, a teacher who, despite being close to her thirties, is very short so her students don\'t take her seriously.Well, basically all its episodes do not follow any sense but are sketches of each student doing something with Mika-sensei or with another student, from something normal like talking about a random topic to the surreal...with one of their characters attached to their own imagination. If you have seen other comedies in the style of Azumanga Daioh, Paniponi Dash or Lucky Star, probably in Sensei no Ojikan you will get a similar experience of cute everyday school life.Although Mika-sensei is the protagonist, her students are the ones who steal most of the show. In fact, there\'s a range of characters with personalities typical of a Japanese sitcom, but also other types of characters that you wouldn\'t normally see in a moe sitcom (the inclusion of male characters is one of those): we have the class representative, the energetic and naive girl, the ""ojou-sama"", the one who is obsessed by the teacher, by the feminine side. On the masculine side there\'s the transvestite, the ""old man"" (although he\'s really a teenager), the manga-drawing otaku, the dumb athlete, and his best friend who he\'s in love with (and doesn\'t know it). Yeah, even if it seems absurd, but this works on many occasions where different personalities mix for different jokes throughout the show.Of course, which can have its disadvantages since it may be difficult for you to identify a bit with any of them. Likewise, this show is made for a more niche audience with ""very Japanese"" jokes in which you need to know a little more about their humor and culture. On the other hand, if you feel ready enough to go further down the iceberg of cute Japanese shows, then I\'d say Sensei no Ojikan would be an interesting option if you have no idea what to watch for the week. There are episodes where there is comedy, but in others there are moments where Mika-sensei spends good times with her students in her day to day (The Festival episode is one of my favorites).Despite that, its artistic section is not very striking. The design is much more ""pretty"" simple and short than if you compare it to Azumanga Daioh (which many will think is inspired even though Sensei no Ojikan\'s manga was published two years before it). Likewise, don\'t expect excellent animation either, it\'s just average and nothing out of the ordinary.Both its opening and ending theme songs are simple but strangely catchy J-Pop songs. The first, played by can / goo, has a more pop rock style that describes Mika-sensei\'s day-to-day life, her personal life and her family life, and her life as a teacher with her students from she. The ending, by DROPS, has a more 80s-synth-pop style that, curiously, is a cover of the original 1984 version played by Tom Cat, another Japanese band.Too bad there aren\'t many voices that you may have heard from Sensei no Ojikan before. In itself it doesn\'t seem appealing to an audience looking for a predominantly female cast in moe comedy. But the biggest problem is how it is presented:Something that Sensei no Ojikan abuses a lot is the use of large texts in each dialogue, joke, action or even when representing the feelings of the character. On some extreme occasion, it seems as if you are watching an animated manga than an anime. Likewise, the show\'s sound effects can sometimes be missing in favor of using text to represent said sound. It is as if they had saved a budget to even limit the movement of the characters at various times.Also, said before, if you haven\'t gotten very far with the anime, it\'s probably that picking Sensei no Ojikan as one of your first animes can give you a long experience of jokes that are better understood by speaking the language, repetitive structures and some characters that you may find annoying.However, personally, Sensei no Ojikan was a pleasant experience. Having seen several moe comedies already, Sensei no Ojikan was an experience not so out of the ordinary. The characters were what kept my spirits up as I watched every skit on the show. Also, it has its merits of granting male representation, such as even experimenting with new types of personalities, in a type of show where only cute female characters exist. It can make you laugh a few times, other times it may seem annoying or boring, it will depend on your mood.And yes, indeed Sensei no Ojikan was... hilarious and funny. with one of their characters attached to their own imagination.

Shinkon Gattai Godannar!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1103/Shinkon_Gattai_Godannar,"[""This is a review of Season One of Godannar.  My problem with the current reviews on the site of Godannar is they seem to be taking it way too seriously.  It's an homage to older Super Robot anime and should be seen as such, not compared storywise to something like Spirited Away or what have you.  It's like comparing G Gundam to Zeta Gundam and assuming it has a horrible storyline because it doesn't take itself seriously instead of seeing each show on their own merits.Story: 6/10 - The story isn't heavy, especially in this first season.  Your average super robot...story basically - flavor of the week monsters that fight the main character.  However, some of the arcs have better storylines than the rest - the Cosmo Base arc ( From the destruction of Cosmo Base to the final episode of the season with Ken and Lou fighting side by side ) was especially good, in my opinion.Art: 9/10 - Really high quality art that stays consistent throughout the season.  The fanservice is a bit excessive, but it's obviously meant to be like that.Sound: 8/10 - Great, catchy OP.All the voice actors fit their characters well and the use of music during the episodes are nominally great.  However, the ED leaves a bit to be desired, but that seems to be the norm for EDs.Character: 7/10 - The problem with charaterization in this series is simply that there are a lot of characters, and in a single 13-episode season you can't exactly have episodes devoted to each character.  However, the main characters (Go, Anna, Shizuru and Shinobu) all have pretty well cemented personalities by the end of the season.  Additionally, any character that has gotten a character episode ( at this point, the Dragliner team, Lou and Ken ) also have developed personalities, even if some of them are somewhat generic.  Hoping the second season develops the rest of the characters, esp the other mecha pilots.Enjoyment: 10/10 - This is where the anime really shines. It just has so much fun with itself that its hard not to have fun yourself as long as you aren't trying to take it too seriously.  The fights are excellent, the cliches are hilarious at times. story basically - flavor of the week monsters that fight the main character.

While both series are separated into two halves, they share the same overall story as a whole.Story: 4/10And speaking of which, there really isn&rsquo;t too much of one to speak of! Basically the whole series revolves around these creatures called &quot;Mimesis&quot; that seem to be attacking earth for some unknown reason, and its up to a select group of mecha style fighters (most of which contain exaggerated busty women) to save the earth from this...threat. Now I know this probably sounds nice and all, but everything throughout the anime is pretty much one battle after another. There are nearly no episodes that take a break in order to develop the actual story and characters. (though the main are introduced alright enough) Even in the end we never really know why earth was being attacked in the first place. Instead its nothing more than mech on mech action (which isn&rsquo;t too shabby actually) and up close shots of the female&rsquo;s body. The character development is pretty low as well, with the exception of Anna, Goh and Mira.....we never really get much story from the other characters. (there are literally tons) At least not something that will actually make you want to care about them like you normal would, not to mention everything in this series feels very generic. To its credit though the action scenes are pretty descent, and the mecha designs I actually found kind of neat. No real story here, but the fighting parts and fan service might keep some into it. Oh and this series actually does have a descent cliffhanger leading into season 2.Artwork: 8/10Easily the best part, all the character and mech designs are all very well done here. They both boast colorful and detailed body suits and armor, and you can tell that each one went through some thought on how to give it flare and appeal. The backgrounds are also nice, you get some pretty lush environments, from the deep jungle scenes, to the large city scape ones. Very nice to look at, though some may be turned off by the extremely robust bouncy women, as all are quite exaggerated in this respects.Soundtrack: 6/10Decent enough, even though you really only get one catchy background track (which is a non-vocal version of the opening), but other than that however, there really isn&rsquo;t much to say about it. The opening theme was pretty darn awesome though, you get this raspy male pop singer that has a pretty distinct voice to him, though I doubt it will appeal to a major part of the audience, it still is and interesting tune. Ending theme was okay, and played as a somewhat low key melody, but nothing really too distinct about it.Characters: 6/10Well all the characters are likable, and there are a bunch of them in this anime, sadly though you really only get some actual back story and character development with about three or four of them, and even that is pretty shallow. Though I did kind of like watching Ana and Goh interact with each other. Its one of the few series that has both leads already married, and a big part of the show is all about them trying to keep things together, which especially becomes hard once Mira shows up, its nice since you don't see this kind of situation very often. Nothing too special, but it will probably catch your eye.Bottom Line: 6/10While there are quite a few things that just didn&rsquo;t work out too well for this title, it isn&rsquo;t really a bad series. Indeed everything about it is pretty run of the mill and not new, but it does add some interesting fight scenes and watching Goa and Anna interact is pretty fun to watch. Not to mention there is actually a pretty good cliffhanger that sets the mark for season 2. So long as you don&rsquo;t mind watching an anime that has elements which have been done the same way many times before, you might just want to Go-Go-Godannar!!!! threat.

The characters lack a background and introduction, it's like they were just placed there. Also, the way some characters conduct themselves seems irrational and unreasonable, and might get to your nerves, eventually. The mecha designing isn't bad, but their attacks and actions are too monotonous.A poorly-written, very-ordinary romantic story. It at least has a good art and animation.Watch it if you have a lot of free time or nothing more important to do. "", ""This review is for the entire series.If you like anime with no real story and girls with big cleavage, this is for you.Godannar is unoriginal and nothing new. First the plot could have been very good had they taken the anime more seriously. Instead the creators turned it into another romantic comedy, with giant robots, and girls with large cleavage. Don't get me wrong I like looking at girls with large cleavage, but at least give me a decent story and some good action. I can get large cleavage from a hentai or porn. Again to the story which had no urgency, and made me...not care about any of the characters. Who by the were paper cut out characters which I didn't care whether they lived or die.Now don't get me wrong this is now way the worst anime I've seen, but it is bad. not care about any of the characters. Who by the were paper cut out characters which I didn't care whether they lived or die.Now don't get me wrong this is now way the worst anime I've seen, but it is bad."", ""This show can be described in one word: excess. Subtlety doesn't exist in its dictionary; everything is big, bright, and brash. Giant robots, giant monsters, giant boobs, giant emotions, giant melodrama. It's both a parody of super robot shows and an unabashed love letter to them. Speaking of love letters and excess, that's the other ingredient of the show: romantic comedy. Like everything else, this is dialled up until your ears bleed. Why have one or two romance arcs when you can wallow in the love lives of every single character in the show? Sometimes it's played for laughs, other times it's played straight, but...it's always over the top.If this sounds chaotic, it is. Though a lot of fun in general, the madness does get away from it sometimes. In the middle of the series we get a lot of filler focusing on the seemingly endless parade of robot pilots from around the world. They're a weird and distinctive bunch, and inevitably every two-person team has some kind of repressed romance going on, but I start to wonder why so much time is being spent on them. When it gets to the point where we spend an episode focusing on the arranged marriage of a random engineer who has no bearing on the plot, I'd rather it just got on with the main story. That's not to say these parts aren't entertaining, but the series does spend too long spinning its plasma drives instead of moving forward.Fortunately, the majority of the show works better. The action is all good, being one of the last shows to use all hand-drawn animation for the robots. There are plenty of mysteries and twists. And the central age-gap romance between the main robot-piloting couple works as a great source of comedy and drama, ultimately becoming quite poignant by the show's surprisingly heartfelt conclusion. If the show had spent more time focusing on these elements, it would have been a solid 8, but as it is, it just about slips to a 7.That's what my head says, at least, but I love this show anyway. it's always over the top.If this sounds chaotic, it is. Though a lot of fun in general, the madness does get away from it sometimes. In the middle of the series we get a lot of filler focusing on the seemingly endless parade of robot pilots from around the world. They're a weird and distinctive bunch, and inevitably every two-person team has some kind of repressed romance going on, but I start to wonder why so much time is being spent on them. When it gets to the point where we spend an episode focusing on the arranged marriage of a random engineer who has no bearing on the plot, I'd rather it just got on with the main story. That's not to say these parts aren't entertaining, but the series does spend too long spinning its plasma drives instead of moving forward.Fortunately, the majority of the show works better.

The story isn't to amazing, but at the same time it doesn't need to be. It never takes itself to seriously which is just the right approach. The anime is a fusion of Mecha, Ecchi and Harem all rolled into one package, meaning you can expect great mech battles, fanservice moments, LOTS of fanservice moments. The art in Godannar is outstanding the characters look great and the backgrounds are amazing. The sound is really good to, I don't really care for the voice acting but the music is awesome. Well to sum it all up, for those...who are new to anime or looking for a good ecchi then this is a good place to start. who are new to anime or looking for a good ecchi then this is a good place to start."", ""The storyline does not keep you hooked up with interest. To make it brief, the anime is repetitive: Monster appears, kill the monster, ladies with huge breasts and outrageous cleavage, female robots with ridiculous and far-fetched bust.From an ecchi standpoint, it has a somewhat decent amount of fanservice but there are tons of other better titles that deliver this type of thing. From a Mecha standpoint, the action is not interesting, same attacks over and over each episode, predictable, dull action scenes, again there are way better Mecha titles out there to enjoy.The comedy the anime delivers is not that funny. The anime does...not excel in anything but it also isn't outrageously terrible. I will watch the second season to see if anything changes or improves to conclude the series. not excel in anything but it also isn't outrageously terrible.

It felt like it had gone far too far into the realm of an ecchi comedy show with its enormous cleavage, absurd outfits and sexually themed super robots (I\'m looking at the combination between the male and female robots, or the dominatrix robot.)Add to that very uninteresting enemies and a strangely convoluted plot which never engaged me, and it\'s a show which I can\'t recommend at all unless you really like breasts and super robots. And for me, the robots weren\'t interesting enough and the breasts were...too prominent. Many of the female characters are grossly endowed in a hentai-esque manner, and the ""gimmick"" of a husband-and-wife robot team was curiously misogynistic. Anna was portrayed as a transgressive wife who wasn\'t sufficiently domesticated and Goh\'s sweetheart was the more passive figure.This didn\'t sit well with me.There was always the potential within the show for it to be good fun, but when you\'re cringing at the absurd proportions of the characters (And even some of the robots) it\'s just not that good in the end. Similarly, had the fights been more interesting and the enemies better than simply bug aliens, I may have enjoyed it more.So, to conclude (for this is only a short review), Godannar has awkwardly portrayed relationships which didn\'t sit well with me, mostly uninspired super robot action which wasn\'t as engaging as something like GaoGaiGar, and comedy which falls flat a lot of the time.

Tokumu Sentai Shinesman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2097/Tokumu_Sentai_Shinesman,"[""Note: This is my 1st ever review so please bear wit me on dis.Today I am reviewing Tokumu Sentai Shinesman(Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman in America).Based on the Manga by Kaimu Tachibana,and Hideki Sonoda and directed by Shinya Sadamitsu. Character design by Akiharu Ishiivideo produced by Gakken,Aniplex Inc and Movic dubbed to english by Media Blasters. The video is based on the super sentai series of tokusatsu programmes.anyway as the story goes the king of the alien planet Voice has declared war on the planet Earth.However,their way of war is peculiar. the war of big business(I know it's weird but if I must say so...the show is not ordinary itself and that's what makes it great). The plan is to send Prince Sasaki and stratieist,Seki to Earth to form a corporation big enough to take over the world. they plan on doing this by funding and marketing  a popular television series called &quot;Greatmen&quot; which is a power rangers type show. however planet earth fights back with a group of heros known as the shinesmen created by the Right Trading Company. The shinesman team is inspired by the superhero televison shows of the day, however the color of the costumes and weapons are just absurdly lame (I mean who has ever heard of a tie clip bomb or business card cutters).Each chararcter enterestingly enough is named after their original voice actors/actresses who performed their voices,many of whom are well known actors  in their field.The script of the show is pure genius. I must confess it had me laughing like crazy. The characters are well memorable and the animation is impressive. the only thing i have to complain about is oddly enough what the characters in the anime complain about themselves, what is it you ask? the colors of the costumes and the lame weapons. sure I know that red is a great color i must agree but who in the heck would run around in a sepia colored costume throwing tie clip bombs, TIE CLIP BOMBS. that aside there are even some pop culture references in the show from Godzilla to The artist formally known as Prince,the humor metor is pretty high and don't worry for those of you that like drama and even romance theres some of that too.Seriously the anime is so good i wish they would've more than 2 episodes.also last but not least the theme song is sung by none other than Hironobu Kageyama.who is famous for singing the themes to Chojin Sentai Jetman, Hikari Sentai Maskman,and Dengeki Sentaii Changeman.In my opinion this anime is one of many greats I've seen so far and I say if you are looking for something a little out there( who am i kidding almost all anime is kinda outhere and that's what makes it awesome). then check it out for yourself if you never seen it and if you seen it watch it again and again you won't be dissapointed.

The main guy would do anything for this kid and he is his sole interest, you might say it's pretty romantic.Other than those two there are way too many characters which hardly have any character to them, most of them get no development or get half a story at best and holds no real weight in the show as a whole.The only developed characters in the ova are the main guy, his...brother, and a female villain who falls in love with the lead to her dismay (he only cares for the kid). The three of them form the main story of the 2 episodes, or at least what it would've been had the script been tighter.The production value is fine, I like the shoujo-ish art and in a mecha show. Had the creators actually allow themselves to focus what seems they set out to do, which is a sentai shounen ai with huge age gap, it could've been a solid 8, but they didn't and this is what brings this otherwise unique and interesting shoujo anime to a pretty average mess of thin stereotypes and awkward comedy. brother, and a female villain who falls in love with the lead to her dismay (he only cares for the kid).

Terra Formars: Revenge,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31430/Terra_Formars__Revenge,"['I honestly don\'t know where the low ratings for this show are coming from. It\'s like a bandwagon effect every other user wants to dislike the show because they heard from him, her, or the other that the first season sucked... which it didn\'t. It had a rough start but does turn itself around.  All that aside, I believe that Terra Formars revenge does a pretty good job redeeming itself through its intense dramatic scenes along with a reasonable amount of unforgettable action and mayhem.Story 8.5/10Season 2 \'s plot is straight-forward, right to the point, and focuses more on drama and having ""goals"" rather...than having the main & supporting characters get involved in random, unexciting, and dull circumstances.  This worked out well in season 2\'s favor because during season 1 it felt like things like the pacing was slow, and the new plot developments felt lackluster at best. The new director and team of producers working on this must have payed close attention to what was wrong with the season 1 to improve what they thought was best! Lastly, the improvements of the plot for each episode was well executed. From the story-telling narrative I was impressed with how well new developments in the story-line were made. My initial concerns during the beginning of season 2 (which were bad story-telling, lack of interesting new developments, gore for the sake of being edgy) were thrown out the window like a cold lifeless corpse as soon as I  started watching. I began thinking to myself ""Hmm, you know, this new team is doing a lot better than whoever worked on season 1."" I enjoyed knowing that I could be fully engaged in the story & plot for each episode, and not complain the entire time about the directions of certain events were going. Now one thing I didn\'t like was that the story, at times, felt like both backstories, flashbacks, and often times new developments would drag on too long. Too much dialogue between characters was another re-occurring issue I had a hard time dealing with because I felt like the characters would converse so much that it would take away my enjoyment for the story.  Lastly I would have also liked to see more detailed backstories on the Terra Formers because I felt like the additional information explained by Boa wasn\'t the least bit useful. Overall I was very impressed with the direction that the new team went with in the story of Terra formars revenge.Animation quality looked pretty damn good. There are lots of obvious moments where I saw that CGI was used to improve the appearance of the Terra Formars in groups, often times ready to attack or die. CGI was used a lot last season so I cannot really add too much about the subject.  Character designs and the appearances of both humans and roaches look a lot moderately better. I mean when you compare the anime character designs to the original manga, the anime versions look 1000% better. The quality of the special effects are also pretty good, again not too much I can add.  I\'m going to assume that the quality of animation was a bit better due to TYO Animations & LIDENFILMS working on it. Lastly, the background settings are very detailed.  The work the animators did on objects like computer monitors and electronic devices was pretty amazing.I have never been impressed with the soundtrack to the Terra Formar series. None of the opening & ending songs get me excited enough to watch the show. The background music sounds bland and boring, it sort of sounds like stock music. I don\'t think the composer put much effort into enhancing the shows dramatic moments and action scenes. The voice actors were pretty good. I actually don\'t have too much to add on the actors performances. Sound effects were alright, still sounds like the same effects used in season 1, JOHJ JOHJ. Overall I think the sound, voice actors special effects for vehicles, weapons, need to sound just a bit more realistic to enhance the quality of the show.The old and new characters were alright. Like other viewers, I did notice that most main characters do seem to be ""softer"" and maybe just a little sillier in the personality department however, it that really doesn\'t have a big impact on how I enjoyed viewed the characters.. Personally I don\'t think that the comedy works with characters like Michelle because she\'s always been strong-minded along with having a serious personality. Having her be a ""straight-man"" to Joe\'s naturally hilarious & every-man personality felt kind of awkward at times. When characters do need to be strong and take action, for example Michelle, then she\'ll be strong. As shown in I believe episode 5 or 6. She\'s still the same bad-ass we loved regardless of how ""toned down"" her personality seems, same goes for the others too. Character growth and development is still relied upon in season 2. In a weird way, everybody learns something or the other to help them harness their strength and knowledge.Enjoyment for this series would honestly be about a 7 and a half. While I did feel like this was much, much, better than what season 1 had to offer, the series wasn\'t exactly too exciting at times and had few to many  moments of boredom.. I mean, episodes do feature moments where tension begins to rise and dramatic scenes are almost incredible unfortunately though, what damages the series enjoyment factor is that those moments aren\'t really consistent. Improvement that I think would work best is to tone down the overly dramatic scenes or make them less lengthy because as I mentioned early, certain episodes do tend to drag on with the ""Oh my God we are going to die"" and ""Oh no, what are we going to do?"" moments.Overall I can say that season 2 was a major improvement to all categories listed above, and leaves a better impression of what the show is really about. What that thing is varies from person to person however, I\'d have to say that it\'s determination and the will & strength to never give up. The final product was indeed ""very good"" and I had a lot of fun watching it. 8/10 from me mates. than having the main & supporting characters get involved in random, unexciting, and dull circumstances.

But I\'ll leave it at that because those weren\'t the reasons why most people enjoyed Terra Formars. I was also really hyped for the second season, as I expected the same viewing experience that I had with the first.Moving on to this so called second season : ""Terra Formars Revenge"" ( although ""revenge"" is probably what most of the Terra Formars fans want against the producers ).-First off let\'s talk about animation... One of the main...reasons why this season falls short of our expectations :The animation has changed for the worse. In the first season we had well executed and fluid animation which made the fighting scenes exciting and appealing, without getting boring and repetitive.In the second season they give us a lackluster, seemingly ""lower budget"" animation which makes the fighting look unimpressive as it loses the ""punch"" that it once had in the prequel. This makes the action as boring as it gets. It makes you feel like this might be some kind of bad joke.-Moving on to the art :The art style has shifted from a very realistic and dark representation of scenery and characters, to a very bright and colorful art style. This is what takes away most of what the anime was about... The cruel environment and situation have now become more lighthearted as they take a different direction from the foundation that was built in the first season.-Speaking of lighthearted, let\'s head to the story/characters :Probably the only positive thing is that the plot does continue in this second season.And now back to the negatives : now here is where it starts to get uglier, although the plot remains, the representation of the characters and situations is a disgrace. Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you : fan service !!!! You can start guessing how glad I was to see that in a supposedly dark and gory survival anime. Fan service is probably what you\'d least expected to find in Terra Formars, even though it only occurs in the first episode it is still disgraceful.Complementing the lightheartedness, the characters seem to take the situation they are in less seriously as we also have the addition of ""comedy bubbles"" ( don\'t really know how to call them ).To wrap this up, Terra Formars Revenge is an excuse of a second season as it does not in any way bring justice upon the first season or the manga...Hopefully this will be enough for people to understand how disappointing this sequel is...Even though it is not unwatchable, I wouldn\'t recommend ""Terra Formars Revenge"" to anyone who loved the first season or the manga. reasons why this season falls short of our expectations :The animation has changed for the worse.

Many of them died whilst being overpowered. This creates that ""cling to reality experience"" that makes a good plot like AoT. I felt as though they disregarded that and went full dragon ball z which is a strict fantasy power up plot like tengen toppa. Im not saying dbz or tengen is a bad anime but what made the first season good was that slice of reality that they could at anytime die. The drawback mechanics of the source of their power up , which is the medicine,...was disregarded I felt like. They were popping the medicine like crack whore addicts when taking 2 or 3 of those were fatal if I remember correctly from the first season. In summary, they didnt stick with their guns and just went for ""convinient for the plot"" route.  This really a mediocere season at best. was disregarded I felt like.

But hey, at least it was grim and gritty and we don't get nearly enough grim and gritty works of media, if you ignore the tens of thousands too many that we get. Okay, so the last series ended with our heroes stranded on Mars. One full squadron has been killed, one is made up of traitors, and I'm sure it's not the one that was reported dead but we saw alive and well, and our heroes have to find their way back to Earth with some living...derp roaches in order to stop a disease. Let's look at where things go in Terra Formars: Revenge, and see if we can find any reason to care.Story:We pick up where the last series left off. In this one the focus shifts to the struggle of the traitorous fourth squadron against the other squadrons, primarily the first and second since the fourth wants to capture what's her name and that one guy. So, the 4th squadron takes control of the fallen ship, making it their base and goes all out, doing whatever it takes, to capture that one guy and whatever her name was. Meanwhile, the first and second squadron have to evade the derp roaches and find a way to strike back at the 4th squadron.I will give this series some credit over the first. There's a lot less of an issue with both exposition, since those scenes are shortened quite a bit for this one. There's also less of a problem with solutions for various problems being completely pulled out of the writer's posterior. This series focuses much more on largely mindless action sequences coming one after the other with the series' attempt to add some depth betwixt them. That being said, flashbacks are a massive pain in this one. The first series used them quite a bit, mainly in attempts to make us care about the characters, but this one takes it to the next level. A lot of the big climactic stuff at the end gets interrupted by long, drawn out flashbacks. Plus, we get the same flashback of the protagonist boy talking to a sick child from the first series so many times you'd think it would be showing us how he learned that “with great power there must come great responsibility.” Granted, I wouldn't have remembered such a dull scene without them doing a flashback but I didn't need them to keep bringing it up. This series is also overly fond of fake-outs. The series loves to move things to a bleak note only to reveal that there's still a glimmer of hope or that things went okay after all and we just didn't see it. Here's the thing with both flashbacks and fake-outs. They're both useful tools when used in moderation but when they're overdone, like they are here, they quickly become tired. Fake-outs in particular since they don't work when you expect them. This series also has some tonal issues. There are scenes that attempt to add some levity which is a good idea, in concept. The problem here is that they'll stick the scenes in randomly during moments that are supposed to be tense. For example, they have two characters who are surrounded by derp roaches and they insert a comedic bit about skunks, which just undermines the tension completely.Again, the concept has potential and I do still give them credit for trying to be more than just mindless action, but the execution is just poor and the effort doesn't ultimately mean much.Characters:I feel like I could basically copy and paste my whole rant about the characters from the first series with some minor tweaks. I won't, but I could. The big problem with the characters in this is just that they're boring. There's nothing to them beyond the same trite action archetypes that we've seen time after time. The most attempts we get at developing them are in flashbacks that serve to show us that they had equally bland families who they're fighting for or some generically tragic back stories. But there's nothing in there that really adds depth to them or that fleshes them out as a character. The result is that there's no reason to care what happens in the fight betwixt squadron four and the others or betwixt the humans and the goofy roaches.The roaches continue to be weak villains. Yes, they have numbers and they can overwhelm the heroes we don't have any reason to care about, but at the same time they just look absurd. The changelings in Friendship is Magic looked scarier than these things. Plus, every major hero can still slaughter a large number of them with relative ease.Art:The artwork continues to be the area where I can give the series some praise. The backgrounds are nicely detailed. The human characters have some nice designs, particularly when you factor in their transformations. The action sequences, though incredibly violent, do have some nice intensity.Sound:Like with the first series, I have to give the cast some credit. They take characters who really have very little to them and they still manage to turn out passable performances. Not good by any means, but passable. This time around Wada Takafumi handles the soundtrack and, I have to say, it's not as good as Murai Shusei's was in the first series. It's all right, but that's about the best that can be said for it.Ho-yay:There might be a little. There's a girl named Hong who seems to have a thing for one of her comrades, Miss Xi. But it's hard to say since the character interactions are so... meh.Final Thoughts:That's Terra Formars Revenge. It shares some of the weaknesses of the original, improves in some areas and gets worse in others. Overall, it's a dumb action series that's trying to be more, but failing. Ultimately, I don't think it's worse than the first series nor do I think it's better. My final rating is going to be the same a 4/10. I still have no reason to care what's happening. If your only issue with the first series was the excessive exposition that interrupted the action sequences, you might like this one better. If you, like me, were not fond of the first series or you didn't bother with it because it didn't look like something you'd be into, I don't recommend this one either. If you really liked the first series, the flashbacks, fake-outs and comedic attempts might make you dislike this one but I suspect you'll be fine with it. Next week I'll take a look at Non Non Biyori. Until then, have a fantastic week. derp roaches in order to stop a disease. Let's look at where things go in Terra Formars: Revenge, and see if we can find any reason to care.Story:We pick up where the last series left off. In this one the focus shifts to the struggle of the traitorous fourth squadron against the other squadrons, primarily the first and second since the fourth wants to capture what's her name and that one guy. So, the 4th squadron takes control of the fallen ship, making it their base and goes all out, doing whatever it takes, to capture that one guy and whatever her name was. Meanwhile, the first and second squadron have to evade the derp roaches and find a way to strike back at the 4th squadron.I will give this series some credit over the first.

It\'s good to mention that this make the Terraformars FAR LESS odd and scary.-Would need some work in the pacing department. Things either happens way to fast or sometime not much seem to happen at all....PERSONNAL NOTE:Like mentionned in the synopsis, humans traitors are the main antagonists of the 2nd season and, in my opinion, they made humans go against humans way too fast.Humans are boring.I\'m far more interested in the Terraformars\'s weird and terrifying lore and culture.It\'s sad that they went for the usual ""humans are the worst animal"" before we even got a proper look at the nightmarish Terraformars society...

But unfortunately, this second season happened. Stripped off of all the exiting stuff, the ridiculous story flaws and annoying characters shine in all their glory:- implausible twists and turns- everything overdramatized to the max- people dying while they actually don't over and over- super strong abilities utilized as...stupid as possible- sense of threat completely lostThe show got more painful to watch episode by episode. Can't recall the last time I was so disappointed in a sequel. stupid as possible- sense of threat completely lostThe show got more painful to watch episode by episode. Can't recall the last time I was so disappointed in a sequel."", 'I was among the many who was expecting that this 2nd season would fare off from it\'s 1st season, so:................................Storywise, I agree when a lot of reviewers stated that the violence was tone down, unlike the 1st season were it doesn\'t have a solid plot and relies only on the sheer violence, blood and gore, this time the human drama has been added and a betrayal plot was added as well, it was no long them humans fighting to survive against the terraformars onslaught. But I still can\'t ignore this story\'s multiple anachronisms that  are present in this anime or manga, the so called...anachronism simply violates every laws of medicine, physics, astronomy, biology, economics and engineering, even so I\'m gonna rate this category a 7 over 10 for the toned down violence and the addition of the human drama.Artwise, I give it a 5 over 10 since, nothing much has change at all pertaining to the illustrations of the character, but in this season 2 we see new illustrations of terraformars, from the youngest to those who fly, still not enough for me to give this category a high score......Fanservice? Well it was only limited to Xi, but even so, don\'t expect any nipples on her top and bushes on her bottom. Btw I also gave the same score for the sound, since this isn\'t about the VA\'s who does Michelle and Akari\'s voice, it now about the support VA who did the voices of the other support characters, but I do have a certain thing for the 3rd closing theme ""Revolution"" by Nao.Character, like I\'ve said, in this sequel it no longer about Michelle and Akari, nearly other support characters here were given a chance to shine even for a moment, like Ms. Pepe Le Pew....I\'m referring to Yaeko and them civilians like Wolf, Peggy, Erika, Amelia and Joe Newton. But the real stars her were them Terraformars which I\'m giving this category a 3 over 10 cu\'z of them, since they basically represent as the main parachronism of this anime, since it was kinda puzzling as to how in just a short period of time they were able to manage to master the art of organ transplant, now let\'s not not for get that in order for such transplant to happen they (Terraformars) have to solve some problems, like the condition of the appendage is it still alive enough to be transplanted, will their body accept the organ being transplanted, were they able to have the necessary equipment for the transplant. Also there were the character parachronism were I find it hard to accept that in that timeline were U-NASA were able to genetically combine anime and human DNA, they weren\'t able to control the AE Virus epidemic, and does the setting show any AE outbreak? No. QAlso if them U-NASA do plant to go to mars to kick some Terreformar butt, wouldn\'t be much cheaper to make more Joe Newtons and Hongs, instead of giving each BUGS participant a custom DNA make over? One more reason for my score.Enjoyment, despite of the tone down violence and the addition of the human drama, I\'m barely hanged on to this anime u\'til its last episode, too bad they gave it a typical Zombie ending, where the characters live to fight another day, so it\'s 6 over 10 for this category. And the overall, despite of my reservations, IMO it was decent enough to be watched, so, it\'s a 4 for this part.OUT! anachronism simply violates every laws of medicine, physics, astronomy, biology, economics and engineering, even so I\'m gonna rate this category a 7 over 10 for the toned down violence and the addition of the human drama.Artwise, I give it a 5 over 10 since, nothing much has change at all pertaining to the illustrations of the character, but in this season 2 we see new illustrations of terraformars, from the youngest to those who fly, still not enough for me to give this category a high score......Fanservice?

It is also common for somebody to watch a whole series with a good first episode only to be extremely disappointing with the ending or last few episodes or halve the episodes. I find it rare for people to say a first episode is horrible but the show is good.I remember watching the first season of Terra Formars when it was airing a year or two back and thinking it is a pretty decent show. So when I watched the first episode of the second season of Terra Formars...I was on the point of giving the series an overall score of four and dropping. After watching the full season of Revenge I have to say this show had a good comeback from the cruddy first episode it gave us.When I watched the first episode of Terra Formars Revenge I had the same problem as other people. The show felt like it turned from a dark sci-fi series to an episode of Dragon Ball Z. This was mainly due to one of our main hero's going super Saiyan or should I say super Moth resulting in a big unrealistic explosion like I was watching some Michael Bay movie. Instead of dropping the show I said to myself I keep watching to see how much more they will wreck this show. To my surprise the show actually got better in terms of story with being fateful to the Manga by adapting some of the best arcs in the manga in the right way and of course completely erasing unnecessary explosions after episode 1.Apart from episode one which was a big joke that roughly came out on April fool’s Day (coincidence?). Every episode carried the story well and allowed a lot of characters both major and minor to develop freely. The show had each minor arc a battle between groups of characters. The best were the ones between the minor characters which was the case in the final part of the show and the part of the show that focused on Alexander. The arc with Alexander was one of the best from the Manga, seeing it done fatefully gave me hope for this show. Apart from the first episode the only other problem with the story is that it’s too short for 13 episodes.The Art was the only other thing people went crazy about. The art in season one was a lot darker, characters and environments had a lot more detail and the cockroaches looked less hilarious then they do now. In this season everything is a lot more shiny and bright. The characters designs have changed and the level of detail for the whole cast are downgraded. When the human characters transform to use their powers, most look like they just got tattoos applied to their faces rather than go through a major transformation.Now the art when it comes to action scenes is far different then the actions scenes from the first season. When someone were bruised they looked like they were bruised they had bruises. When someone were cut they looked like they were cut. When someone was missing and arm or a leg it was extremely gory. The show kind of lost some its extremes that made it appealing to a mature audience by doing this. .The Music In revenge was sometimes really good especially in the fights. The opening and ending themes where ok but were nothing compared to the opening in the first season. The voice cast in the Japanese Dub of the anime differentiate with different members of the cast. Some voices were pretty plain while others stood out in terms of emotion.The characters in the series include the return of our surviving main cast from the last season of the show. The series does not force us to keep our eyes on the main cast the whole time. It keeps our eyes on the characters that have the most influence on what is currently happening in the story. This includes minor characters both fighters and non-fighters. I hate it when an anime forces the main characters into the centre of every situation because they are the main character. So seeing Revenge give the wheel to some others for a change is refreshing.Overall I enjoyed the show, I am hopeful for a season 3 with better art but I will have to wait and see.

This season tries to build stronger ties to earth but did not fully show the weight of most actions occurring.My biggest Problem, but may be a big nit picky so its down here:...The viewers general understanding of this world is lacking in terms of the possibilities, so we the viewer do not know what the surgery truly is or what capabilities it unlocks. This didn't pose a problem due to the first season sticking with characters you already mostly understood their powers and motivations or telling you and sticking to that very much, but in this season the mass of characters just introduced that are unique and feels almost overpowering in comparison whereas we the viewers still aren't familiar with the surgeries basic capabilities. They also didn't explain the whole plan so this whole season pretty much just feels like a WHAT THERE'S A SWORD ON MARS? and a few of these are explained that the crew aren't supposed to know is here, but then there's a ton of vehicles and equipment that the audience didn't know was there.TL;DR - Generic art lessens the coolness, much important details and story elements weren't told the audience at first such as the original plan on mars which they manage to circumvent in the first season but not having anything the viewer wouldn't expect but season 2 falls prey to that many times.

Narrative stagnant fights filled 90% of the season so plot progression basically happens during Episode 1-2 and 12-13 respectively. Terra Formars had a great sense of direction by involving Fear evoking events to entertain; It is factual that Fear-induced entertainment is a common method for series to become popular in the Anime community (e.g Tokyo Ghoul, AoT, Parasyte, Owari no Seraph etc.) because it produces a pretense premise which questions Humanity\'s intelligence i.e ""What if a life form with greater intelligence/capabilities/adapatbilities  than humans existed?"" That being said, unfortunately Terra Formars failed to provoke this...hidden potential and thus isn\'t seen in a similar light as the aforementioned giant series.Also, seeing how the supposed \'winner\' of every fight walks away without confirming the other parties death is a lazy way to add shock factor (especially when it occurs all the time) e.g Episode 11-12, Keiji Onizuka fights the evolved Terraformar which reveals information to other Terraformars that infiltrated Annex I\'s Space Craft. He had the opportunity to kill the immobilized enemy but chooses to leave it which led to the failure of his team capturing and sending information from the communication room...Story: 3/10The main hook for Terra Formars Revenge was essentially a betrayal among the divisions which was an attractive hook at the end of the controversial 2014 adapted prequel. However, the execution of it was a different story, although I did enjoy the story hook it became inferior when the entire 13 episodes was each division playing cat and mouse to obtain XO and Akari and not much emphasis on the indecisive battles between Terra Formars and Humans. I would have have suggested to use the next arc at Episode 6/7 instead of Episode 13 because there were a lot of wasted opportunity to provoke a controversial event/decision by the communication broadcast from Mars. Overall, excited to see whether the next arc will carry the series...Art & Sound: 5/10For the most part, the art was great but the consistency lagged behind quite a bit; Most likely a compromise to maintain the high quality and proportion. Most of the episodes were still frames with zoom/pan movement which was very disappointing since the action scenes had the highest priority. I did notice CGI but it was well blended with the 2D elements which were surprising. VA were good and SFX~Character: 2/10Flashbacks are a great way to provoke a character in driving out their rage with adrenaline, However it becomes obsolete when every character has the chance to do it several times. Character development in this sequel is plentiful but innovative and structured - that is development that flows with the story line - is scarce in Terra Formars Revenge. With a smaller character palette, killing off characters isn\'t a passable way to develop characters anymore and thus flashbacks were intensified to allow the viewer to grasp the background of our characters with no effort to the producer. It may look like I am bashing the story and characters but I was genuinely enjoying the flow of the series and the climax of Season 1 set a high standard that wasn\'t met . Therefore, it has been reflected in the rating~Enjoyment: 5/10I will admit that the series was enjoyable personally despite all the flaws but the character talk a lot which spoiled the viewing experience. hidden potential and thus isn\'t seen in a similar light as the aforementioned giant series.Also, seeing how the supposed \'winner\' of every fight walks away without confirming the other parties death is a lazy way to add shock factor (especially when it occurs all the time) e.g Episode 11-12, Keiji Onizuka fights the evolved Terraformar which reveals information to other Terraformars that infiltrated Annex I\'s Space Craft.

I would have have suggested to use the next arc at Episode 6/7 instead of Episode 13 because there were a lot of wasted opportunity to provoke a controversial event/decision by the communication broadcast from Mars. Overall, excited to see whether the next arc will carry the series...Art & Sound: 5/10For the most part, the art was great but the consistency lagged behind quite a bit; Most likely a compromise to maintain the high quality and proportion. Most of the episodes were still frames with zoom/pan movement which was very disappointing since the action scenes had the highest priority. I did notice CGI but it was well blended with the 2D elements which were surprising. VA were good and SFX~Character: 2/10Flashbacks are a great way to provoke a character in driving out their rage with adrenaline, However it becomes obsolete when every character has the chance to do it several times. Character development in this sequel is plentiful but innovative and structured - that is development that flows with the story line - is scarce in Terra Formars Revenge. With a smaller character palette, killing off characters isn\'t a passable way to develop characters anymore and thus flashbacks were intensified to allow the viewer to grasp the background of our characters with no effort to the producer. It may look like I am bashing the story and characters but I was genuinely enjoying the flow of the series and the climax of Season 1 set a high standard that wasn\'t met . Therefore, it has been reflected in the rating~Enjoyment: 5/10I will admit that the series was enjoyable personally despite all the flaws but the character talk a lot which spoiled the viewing experience.', 'Terraformars: Revenge, Sagasu Yu & Tachibana Kenichi (2014), is an atrocious slight to the rather enjoyable first season, with its notable stylistic and cinematic aspects. With the change in director, music director, and the addition of a new studio TYO Animations, Terraformars: Revenge is a farce of a continuation that drops the formal elements of sound, mis-en-scene, camera work, and editing, that resembled an apocalyptic or dystopian style. The visual and aural motifs (the black swirls resembling swarms, the ringing synthetic music, the conflation of a lost past and lost present) are obliterated for a shounen-like cheery anime with no gore, no remarkable motifs, and...a tone-deaf narrative. Terraformar’s implied or implicit meaning, in its staticky use of color, silence, and conflation of lost-past to lost-present, which was its strength, is tossed aside for a superficial narrative.The diegesis and narrative no longer fulfills science fiction tropes, in relation to technology: the odd pseudoscientific explanations and the biological presuppositions posited by characters are absent and if there, are only empty plot or action progression devices. The narrative is still quite troublesome, logically. There had been slight humor before, only as a mature defense mechanism, but this work has plenty of fanservice, ecchi frames, and slapstick measures that take away from its previous somber and bleak visual and aural tonality.The characters previously displayed an understanding of the illogical nature of their diegesis, and as a seinen work, addressed character backstory brilliantly, with deliveries such as: “Does losing money mean that your wishes get stolen away, too!?”; “Sakurato! Is there something you want to do when you get better?” from an evidently distressed Akari; “Judging from the lack of hesitation in all your actions, that leader has a vision”. In Revenge, this is dropped for deliveries that contradict earlier depictions: “I’d get to see your shower scene!”; “Is it true that you’re going to Mars”, when Sakurato Harukaze had no idea of Annex 1 in the first season; Akari and his childhood friend crying together when they had not previously; and most idiotically, “Let’s all go back to Earth! Go, go!”. Complete turnaround in both narrative content and narrative tone. “We sent our best men and our kids with the brightest futures” one world leader states, but as viewers can recall, the children and young adults selected volunteered out of desperation, and were not selected for their bright futures. Moreover, the extradiegetic narrative, the little bubbles with comical visuals and deliveries, adds to the slapstick tonality. Infuriating!Previously, the cinematic elements had been artistically significant. Now the cinematics are generic, even subpar given the bland and undetailed faces. The hues, the technology, the intertitles, all resembling traditional science fiction frames, had utilized darker hues with interspersed dulled whites. The use of black, silence, and space was notable in the first season: several frames are dedicated to the scurrying movement of cockroaches, the black in the frames is dynamic, like a writhing mass of cockroaches/insects; moreover, the blackness creeps over the screen not with distinct lines but with the staticky formlessness of swarm. This visual motif was rather impressive. The colors are now too-bright, too-cheery given the death and dismemberment, and the bug transformations look comical and prevent a suspension of disbelief. In fact, for most of the second season, it evokes only disbelief. The camera movement through cinematic space is generic, with few notable shots and transitions. The off-screen space is no longer key: in season one, Adolf Reinhardt, who’s past and present conflate and blur in-out of focus during the action sequence in a notable manner: “Are you saying we’re going to take their entire lives away?” states an off-screen voice as the camera moves over and through a cinematic space comprising a restrained Adolf and the equipment used to modify his base of electric eel. This is all done away with for generic cuts and transitions.Aurally, the anime bears no distinct science fiction sounds: the synthetic music of the first season that resembled several video games of the same genre and the use of Gustav Holst’s “Mars: The Bringer of War” for Adolf Reinhardt, a striking character and perhaps the most intriguing part of both plot and story is all missing. The sound mixing was well done: often, the vital aspect of a scene overpowers the other elements; sometimes everything is overridden by the silence that resembles the sound of a swarm, and particularly the violin during Adolf’s initial strike and his memories of his wife’s affair are replaced by generic fighting music that complements the screaming-based transformation of the character, like a Dragon Ball move. Atrocious!The character design has clearly shifted from seinen to shounen, with most looking outright comical. The facial movements and clothing detail are restricted and flat. In season one, the use of light tones, particularly white, in character’s eyes and tears was a brilliant juxtaposition against the use of the black color in a swarm-like dynamic manner. Here, everything is comical and generic, perhaps to complement the laughingstock status of this season. The less I speak of the actual narrative content of the anime, the better: “Bring it on, 100-dan judo man!”; “The virus goes against everything we know about virology”, these deliveries alter the fundamental personality of major characters. The characters are subject to, what we call in psychopathology, Capgras Syndrome or Capgras Delusion, an [irrational, but not so irrational here] belief that someone known has been replaced by an imposter. And that loss, more than the stylistic and cinematic quality loss, is what makes this work unpalatable. Final unforgivable sin: the green drawing/outline of the Johj looks like a children’s sticker in comparison with the first season’s anatomically complex depictions. a tone-deaf narrative.

However, the focus of the story is not to make you, the reader or viewer, to believe the sci-fi that gets mentioned over and over in the story. but rather, the result, which is a sci-fi survival story set in mars. In a way, the enemy reminds me of the titans in AoT. Numerous, with many abilities, and with so much information unknown about them that it brings about a sense of terror.Yet, it also reminds me of something like...Jojo's bizzare adventure, where every individual has a unique power to themselves, each with their random quirks and uses. The gist of the story is ridiculous, but sets up a simple premise and foundation for the actual meat of the story to flourish: people possessing powerful abilities of animals to a superhuman degree, fighting equally superhuman cockroaches that are as big as humans.It's definitely satisfying to watch the 6 crews struggle against cockroaches, and how the cockroaches always seem to one up their strategies despite being more primitive and less cunning.Yet, even amidst this battle for survival, there are betrayals due to political allegiances, and a crew that had a good chance of fighting the cockroaches fall apart due to infighting, providing a good contrast to the bee-like hivemind that the cockroaches have, to the politically driven crews of Annex 1. Despite the story being ridiculous and the powers questionable, filled with plot holes, the political schemes on earth and the proxy wars on Mars definitely are built good enough to feel realistic, yet not too complicated that the action packed story feels dragged down by it.Overall, a good story. Characters definitely could use some work, and showing the backstory of every other character is kind of unnecessary. There's definitely a formula of a character getting beat up in a life or death situation, them awakening their latent potential through a series of flashback sequences, and powering up and killing the cockroach enemy. I would have liked some more organic development and better chemistry amongst characters. Adolf's arc especially excruciatingly slow and painful to go through.People say that the second season sucks compared to the first, but as a person that just watched both seasons consecutively, I've got to say, the animation definitely is better. By no means is the second season a masterpiece, but the first season had little to no good action sequences, and a lot of the fights are extremely unsatisfying to watch, the show utilizing a lot of tricks to abstract the fights. Compared to the second season, where yes, some fights are poorly made, but there are a decent number of fight choreography's that aren't choppy at all, and much better than the first season's. I liked the first season's cockroach CGI a lot better, and the details in the cockroach models in the second season only accentuate the poor CGI, as compared to the first, where it was simple, but served its purpose, and there was less of a contrast to the hand-animated characters. The story definitely takes a turn from survival to the aforementioned political proxy war, but that's also part of the manga, so if you don't like the plot, you also just don't like the original story, which is fine, but it's a faithful adaptation, to say the least.

I loved the first season for how dark it was, and the gripping story. When I watched the first ep of this I thought this was gonna be total shit, but after the first ep, it increased in quality and quickly picked up the pace.The main issues everyone has with it is the change in animation. At first, I was quite surprised and really didn't like it, but after ep 1 it almost seemed like it reverted back to the old animation style. Personally except for ep 1, I had no problem with...it. The fight scenes and action as the series progressed got better and better, and as the fight scenes got better, it started to feel more and more like the last season.An issue I found was the second season lost a lot of the darkness and horror vibe that the first season had. A lot of the deaths in the first season had so much weight and chilling feel to them. I still can't get over the girl who killed herself in the fire cause she was so scared. Each ep was gripping and frightening, the terraformers were scary and disturbing, I felt none of that while watching this season. In fact, it felt a lot more like a shounen show than a thriller/horror.Nevertheless I still very much enjoyed the show, and really enjoy the story. Even though a lot of this seasons story was about humans against humans, and I more enjoy the back story and culture of the terraformers, the story and motivations behind the humans were still very gripping.And no, I will not talk about the end of the last episode it.

I think far enough that I will also read the manga.The second season of Terra Formars was almost as bad in quality and content as the first. Why the reviews differ so much is probably due to the content. Whereas much more happened in the first season, the second season just went around in circles and felt extremely empty and unnecessary. This is also due to the slow pacing. This season had neither animation, dynamics, tension nor atmosphere. What...we were left with were relatively average backgrounds, Seven Deadly Frames animations and some of the most boring fights, against some of the most boring enemies there are.[Story 3]After the story was so far advanced, one wondered ""Who are the traitors and what will develop?"" Well, the traitors were more than obviously unmasked by episode 2. Honestly, they were even brought into relative focus by the end of the first season. But without their confirmation ""Yes we are the traitors"" which they said almost 10 times, the viewers wouldn\'t seem to understand it, shame on you viewers.Otherwise, the plot just consisted of them reclaiming Annex 1 and fighting some more super bugs that are extremely hyped and completely defeated in the end.[Characters 3] Flat, one-dimensional and boring. The only things I can credit here are some at least satisfying backgrounds and the characters\' will to survive. Most of the characters here are either strong-willed, badass, wansinng or Joseph.

They are way too convenient to be a coincidence, making me think the world is too small, probably not a way to connect everything together. In addition, some mysteries are not being explained properly, they are more like a rough explanation in order to be able to say that the show is not totally illogical.The overall story is a serious theme but containing multiple weird and off-themed moments, such as cooking competition or drinking competition between characters who were just fighting each other to death.Animation - 5/10The animation quality is at the standard level but contains obvious flaws, which are stiff action scenes and intentional chibi-style art.

I think the number thing really fits the story, even if the series seems to have some stuff they really need to clear up. A big problem with Plunderer is its direction. The plot twists become pretty confusing and at the point where I am I have no idea what is what anymore. The plot seems to kind of go too quickly, and its not even that amazing either. Even if the number part is sort of unique to it,...later making the abyss not a scary thing pissed me off. A big part of the original glamour was its scary factor. If you take that away from it the series just seems dull.The point where an enemy is introduced is kind of late-ish, and dissapointed me in many ways. The more the manga advances the more confusing it becomes apparently. A supernatural feature made me hope for something bigger but we only got a helicopter instead, like why. I could just go on about the list of dissapointing factors in the plot.What I like about the plot is its characters. Many of them are likable, even the evil guys. The development is currently quite smooth as well. The only problem here may be how original these characters actually are; Hina for example is pretty generic.Plunderer needs more relaxing and bonding time instead of throwing the characters constantly into new scenerios. It also needs to clear up on whose an enemy and whose not, though only time will reveal that one. Hina is a different case but the other characters don't get enough time to develop since its all protagonist time.Rating: 2/10 later making the abyss not a scary thing pissed me off.

Can I say the same applies to “Plunderer”? Well, as someone who was once a middle schooler thumping my feet to Slipknot and Green Day as I scrawled in the margins of my homework, I’d like to think my capacity to conjure a competent narrative was at least marginally better than whatever...the fuck I just saw.I’m going to keep this review...of Plunderer as brief as possible because I’d rather it vacate the mental real-estate it has occupied in my head-space now that it has finished airing. You think of anime like “One Punch Man” and “Attack on Titan” where absolutely every aspect of production had to fall perfectly into place in order for the celluloid to properly translate to screen, in other words, lightning in a bottle. Plunderer is like the inverse of that, imagine, if you would, a 2-liter bottle of shit filled to its absolute brim over the course of 24 weeks until...well...you get the idea. Plunderer is the type of legendarily bad anime that you only get once in a decade because anything that can go wrong with an anime during its syndication absolutely did go wrong.Plunderer is juvenile, it seems to be under the impression that a good story is predicated on otherworldly plot-twists, tragic heroes, and romance, but that’s just not the case. At the core of Plunderer’s story is a horribly unlikeable protagonist, Licht Bach. Licht checks just about every box for how not to write a compelling protagonist. He sexually assaults any woman in sight, has a happy-go-lucky attitude about it, and hides behind a shield of tragedy to force some degree of emotion out of the audience.I’m an unrepentantly perverse and salacious bastard, the furthest thing from a prude, but even I have to draw the line somewhere. For a character like Licht Bach to have as many love interests as your run of the mill harem protagonist is nothing short of insulting. The number of women queued up to swing their legs open for this dude is staggering, it gets to a point where they are actively embracing being sexually assaulted just to have this man’s dick. I don’t normally allow my convictions to bleed into anime, because applying real-world logic to a cartoon can have varying results. But in Plunderer’s case, I just can’t ignore how these female characters are presented, because it’s nothing short of reductive and dangerously exaggerated.Is the story at least good enough to distract from the chaos of its forced character relations? Well...no, not really. Trying to explain the story of Plunderer would be like asking Charlie Day to expound on the modalities of Pepe Silvia. It’s mired in minutiae and messy plotting, so for the sake of it, I’ll highlight some of the essential bullet-points. Licht Bach is some kind of super-soldier from the past that was forced to kowtow to his superiors to spare his peers, he bastardized his ideals when he was forced to kill others even though he was in a fucking military academy, and now in the present when the world is virtually unrecognizable he’s seen as a pariah known as the “Legendary Ace”, also there are aliens involved?One of my absolute favorite scenes in Plunderer is when the main cast is forced to visit the past and during the school’s opening ceremony, the Commander straight up pops 3 punks in the crowd. It was jaw-dropping, to say the least, but it’s not until after the back and forth with Licht does he reveal that he actually shot them with a paint gun...even though they acted like they were dead the entire time. Like “Oh yeah, golly, I’m not dead!” Seriously, I checked out from this anime when I saw an attack-helicopter slowly rise from the smoke of the abyss.The music is terribly anachronistic, mundane, and poorly integrated from scene to scene due to poor directing. The animation doesn’t even have to be spoken for in this case, but for the sake of it, I’ll say that Plunderer is so poorly animated that you can count the number of smear-frames per episode on your fingers. The coloring and linework is incredibly flat to the point where this show looks and feels like it was released over a decade ago.Plunderer is…awful, irredeemably so. But it was never boring, far from it. With a bit of grandad’s cough medicine coursing through my system, it was actually raucous fun. Can I recommend it? Well honestly, that’s for you to decide whether or not I want the rest of you curious viewers at large to...share in my pain. of Plunderer as brief as possible because I’d rather it vacate the mental real-estate it has occupied in my head-space now that it has finished airing. You think of anime like “One Punch Man” and “Attack on Titan” where absolutely every aspect of production had to fall perfectly into place in order for the celluloid to properly translate to screen, in other words, lightning in a bottle. Plunderer is like the inverse of that, imagine, if you would, a 2-liter bottle of shit filled to its absolute brim over the course of 24 weeks until...well...you get the idea.

I was kinda worried it would be mediocre, or maybe it would be just a small 12 episode ""prologue"" arc or something, but I didn\'t expect it to be THAT terrible. It really takes some skill to turn a pretty solid manga into this abomination. So here is the list of problems:1. Visuals. Here it feels exactly as it did with the latest season of Seven Deadly Sins: face animation and emotions are almost non-existant, all cool fights with great moves are a static image + some blinking ""special effects""...(and don\'t forget screaming AAAAAA for the whole fight). I swear, I have seen gifs with better animation, and to add insult to injury - even manga had better drawn static panels and frames for that exact fights. Why didn\'t you just colorise it if you didn\'t want to bother with actual animation? I have no idea. And outside of fights all charachers either barely move or it is animated ""on budget"" by two-three students who just did a part time job to get some food. It is trully terrible.2. Sound. There are only 2 types of sound here: so dull you forget it at once and so irritating it makes your ears bleed. First category consists of openings and endings, second - of all the bgm. Military theme was so bad that I nearly skipped all the scenes where it was playing. If visuals were drawn by students, the sound was more likely made by a hobo for a bottle of cheap wine. I think even if you took a cat and pulled its tail - it would still be a better ""music"".3. Pacing/story. Boy oh boy, THIS is the problem. The real one. While I have some degree of tolerance to bad looks/sounds, pacing just kills the source completely. Imagine a perfectly normal source, with nice fights, good plot turns and some ecchi jokes. Now take all the ecchi jokes, that take a panel or a page at most (with chapter being about 50) and stretch it to be 5 minutes long in a 20-minute episode. And now tell me, how can any joke keep up if you make it from a 2% time gag to a 25%? The answer is: you should not even try to do it, as this joke will become way too annoying and way too pushy and it simply will not be funny. And it is EXACTLY what they have done. All jokes - stretched, like they wanted to make it a full-time hentai but chickend out after prelude, all worldbuilding - infodumped in a few seconds, all battles consist out of 2-3 ""moves"", as heroes just repeat some 2-frame animation. Also there are a lot of lost moments, that may not feel like anything but a filler, but later it actually adds some lost elements to puzzle, as some characters did stuff that is really hard to justify without those small elements.I think I didn\'t mention a number of smaller issues, but to be honest after mentioned 3 big problems I have already critisized 90% of the anime, at this point any more criticism will be just beating a corpse.TL;DR: this anime is a horrible adaptation. The only reason I didn\'t give it the worst score is as a token of appreciation to the source material, wich is good, but this whoole anime is a waste of time, efford (although not much of it) and potential. (and don\'t forget screaming AAAAAA for the whole fight).

It started of as a typical generic ecchi show but went on to pretentiously try and disguise itself as more than just a self-insert power fantasy. It expects you to feel invested in the dramatic moments but because it\'s so amateurishly executed it becomes laughable. I think that if anything this is where...the enjoyment of this show lies. Characters doing bizarre actions or random plot-conveniences are not rare in this show which made for some entertainment gold. But it doesn\'t do enough to make up for how poor everything else is.Plot holes are pretty frequent and a lot of things are left unexplained, some of which were in the manga but not here for some in-explainable reason. The world-building especially was very lacking even though it\'s focused on a lot. For example in the world of Alcia, everything is ruled by a number/count. The count goes up or down depending on if you succeed or fail a certain task, the higher your count the more powerful you are. Can this task be changed? Are there rules of what you can/can\'t have as a task? Is it balanced or are some tasks just easier than others? It\'s a very interesting concept that sadly lack depth and only exist to tell how strong a person is. Instead of focusing on interesting things like this they focus everything on the shitstain that is our protagonist Licht.Pretty much everything centers around him while leaving no room to expand on the rest of the characters. Leading to a boring cast of shallow individuals that\'s hard to care about. Most women are there to be sexualized and/or fall in love with his ""irresistible"" personality and looks. Especially Hina and Lyne, two blockheads that have no will of their own besides Licht\'s safety and having his children. They had some ambitions in life before meeting Licht, but realized that he is much more important than them. Jail was the only decent character since he at least changed into a man that starts to value people over his duty. It wasn\'t mind blowing development, but it was something.Licht himself is the least likable out of them all. He pervs on girls in the open who clearly dislikes it and he never suffer any severe consequences for it. He even molest the daughter of his dead childhood friend. It leaves the impression of an egoistic asshole who doesn\'t give a damn about others. But he is also shown to have a kind side which clashes with his extremely perverted nature. Leading to his morals being very confusing and made me anything but invested in him.But was there some visual pleasantries at least? No there\'s no saving grace here either. The artwork is bland with undetailed backgrounds and unimaginative lighting. Character movement is often stiff and disproportioned which leaves a lot to be desired during the lackluster fight scenes. Of higher value than I expected coming from such a new studio but was as a whole below average.Good soundtrack and voice acting? Not really. The music is forgettable and falls on deaf ears due to how little weight it\'s contribution have. The voice acting was also far from extraordinary. I can\'t blame the actors for it because of the awful script they had to work with. It\'s a shame because there were some talented actors in this, but it at least made for some stupid over the top dialogue.So would I recommend Plunderer? While it had some entertainingly bad moments and twist that spiced things up, it\'s not enough to be worth your time in my eyes. But if you\'ve finished it and enjoyed it for the same reason I did then I can recommend Ousama Game for a similar experience. the enjoyment of this show lies.

While it's premise surely is very different, and the ecchi themes aren't over the top that make you turn away, and the art style is well detailed and colourful. But it's slow pacing at the start can really be a bit of a turn off early doors, but I will say the latest episodes have been smash hits.We're introduced into a collect bunch of characters over time. From a traveling sweet girl who wants to fulfill her mother's dying wishes. To a confident bar owner, to the wacky and weird legendary ace himself. Fair to say...they have a great mesh of entertaining characters for sure.Like I stated earlier, the art style for this show really is colourful. Where it be the characters outfits themselves. Or certain parts of the show, like backgrounds, powers, and all sorts. Really nicely done. While the sound fits the scenes as per normal.The story is what really made me want to watch this show. As the idea of numbers that determine your fate is a really interesting concept. Proven more so within the show. With how sometimes these numbers can increase. Makes you wonder how other counts go up.All in all, Plunderer has a bit of a slow start, but it gets better as it goes along. A neat anime that I'm gonna continue watching, and you should give it a go too! they have a great mesh of entertaining characters for sure.Like I stated earlier, the art style for this show really is colourful.

It’s art created by self-taught or naive art makers who are not familiar with the established art culture, including art by the straight-up mentally ill, which leads to their creations being strange or different in ways you wouldn’t normally see.This is what Plunderer feels like. While technically it’s a battle shounen with some comedy and ecchi elements, its real substance is a rolling snowball of plot twists that happen every five minutes and are about as intelligent as wearing pants on your head. You can’t see those plot twists coming by virtue of them being...idiotic, you can’t predict how the characters will develop because their development is insane and you’re not sure what the story is trying to tell you because it has like three speech impediments at once.Make no mistake though, that does not mean at all that this show is “lol random” or “so bad, it’s good.” “So bad, it’s good” is a garbage concept in the first place. If something truly fails on artistic or technical level, then, no, you can’t enjoy it “ironically.” “Bad show” and “unenjoyable show” are literally the same exact thing, so either it is good or you are larping being ironic. Anyway, plenty of people will tell you that Plunderer is an objectively bad series. I can guarantee you that those same people would think that their favorite generic entry-level shounen or “mature and deep” drama rated 8.50+ on MAL aren’t unwatchable trash - and they’ll be wrong in both cases. Plunderer isn’t a good show, it’s not a smart show, I’d even call it an impaired show, but it’s not impaired mentally. It’s plot is bullshit, but it IS a plot, it checks all the proper storytelling checkboxes. The storyline is cohesive and was clearly planned ahead, with the writer knowing what he is writing and why. The earlier set pieces properly foreshadow later revelations. The later set pieces build upon the previously established concepts. The characters’ development is a legit development - growth they undergo as the result of experiences they lived through. Even the bizarre fanservice eventually has a narrative purpose (to make you feel bad, Emergence-style). The gun that hangs on the wall in the first act might be purple and shaped like a dildo - but it still fires in the third act like it’s supposed to.To reiterate, this is a show that rescues itself from mediocrity by being unique (obnoxious) enough to notice it. It’s pros are a solid mystery element, decent character designs, and unique ecchi comedy of varying cringe-worthiness. It’s cons are below-average production values and a slow start with the first ~8 episodes that probably should have been 4 episodes instead.8/10 for “At least it tries.” idiotic, you can’t predict how the characters will develop because their development is insane and you’re not sure what the story is trying to tell you because it has like three speech impediments at once.Make no mistake though, that does not mean at all that this show is “lol random” or “so bad, it’s good.” “So bad, it’s good” is a garbage concept in the first place.

The first half of the show features a tremendous amount of fan service and If you don’t enjoy those types of things, this will be a very hard watch for you. However, if like me, you don’t mind such tropes you will be treated to one of the most under appreciated and interesting stories of the year.Plunderer takes place in a world where everyone has a “count” which can go up or down depending on your actions in life. Once you hit 0, you will be sent to the abyss. A mysterious world from which nothing has...ever returned.The concept of the count was very interesting to me and the dynamic of the world managed to keep me engaged consistently. On a weekly basis, this was always the show I looked forward to the most simply because I found the mysteries of the show and the characters to be great. The story takes a while to get going, so if you’re someone who likes instant return on investment, you won’t find that here. But, I can promise you that if you stick around, the second half of the show has some fantastic storytelling and development.For many people, having to wait for a show to “get good” would be a reason to rate it lowly or drop it. For me, I think those lighthearted/fluff moments you get at the beginning of a show take on more weight once a twist or major tonal shift occurs. They allow you to form a connection with characters and emphasise with them during emotional sequences. To that end, I believe the fan-service and light hearted moments during the first part of the show were actually very important to the overall story and added to my enjoyment.The one are where I feel Plunderer was weak, was animation. The art is really bright and character models are solid. But, during fight scenes, I just didn’t ever notice a real “umph” factor and motion felt bland. For a series with a lot of fights, I would have liked to have seen a little more in that department, but it didn’t hamper my enjoyment too much.In conclusion, Plunderer is a show that will reward you for sticking with it. It features likeable characters and a genuinely interesting story and world. It was a very enjoyable watch for me that got me reading the manga, and remains one of my favourite anime of the year. Plunderer gets 8 counts out of 10 from me. ever returned.The concept of the count was very interesting to me and the dynamic of the world managed to keep me engaged consistently.

Yes there is some ecchi and the main girl kind of seems a little wuss but I think shes cute and this anime was a great watch to pass the time.The premise starts off where people have numbers on their body. The higher the number the higher you are ranked in societal standards. There was alot of unexpected things I saw in this anime. I dont know if its because I haven't watched...anime in a really long time, but I didn't thing its as bad as everyone makes it out to be. The music is pretty decent and the art is pretty good as well. anime in a really long time, but I didn't thing its as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

Plunderer shines entirely-because of how intense its Mystery, Pseudo-Romcom Drama, Seinen-like Action, and World-Building are - and I listed ‘Mystery’ first for a reason. It’s hard to call Plunderer a ‘Thriller’ - mostly due to how a Thriller combines a tonne of varying narratives ‘that are clearly understood only to the viewer (aka “beyond the 4th wall”) to converge on a single point - as Plunderer does the opposite wherein, whilst there’s many varying narratives that you can clearly grasp ‘are converging on a single point’, it’s ‘the cast of characters and the world they inhabit’ that understand what’s going on (and not “you”)—but, due to how extraordinary the vast-world of charming and unique characters - with their own motives that all feel like a complicated product of the World-Building of ‘Plunderer’ - are slowly & methodically [I used that phrase earlier for a reason] etched out to the viewer, it’s also hard to call it a Mystery. Honestly: it’s a bit of both for varying reasons.Stick with Plunderer. The first few episodes are a ruse in many ways. They act all silly, and the hints they drop (towards ’a grand mystery’ that, supposedly, they entail) easily have us fooled as “nothing more than a false promise or just a coincidence or accident in the Writing” due to the nature of Plunderer’s core elements—but don’t be mistaken or fooled. Every single aspect of this story/show is an act of subversion for the sake of heightening its Mystery, and for the sake of veiling just how “forsaken” the world of Plunderer is.Stick with it.

I got the feeling akin to fairy tail where there is a great back story to the fantasy world that has yet to be uncovered.

I literally sat up all night binge watching it until i was completely caught up. I think this show is really good, and similar to The Seven Deadly Sins, it had a ""village expedition""  kinda theme, and the plot was amazing.The art gave a modern yet still ""Old time village"" theme, and the dubbing was okay. Some of the characters sounded a bit funny in the english dubbing, but I think that the Japanese dubbing was a bit better ( My opinion! If you wanna give it a try, go ahead, and see what you think!) All the...characters showed their own personalities, and each had their own kind of look, with completely different outfits that still completed the ""Villager"" kinda look.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime, and in my opinion, will keep you interested until the end, and most likely even rewatchable. characters showed their own personalities, and each had their own kind of look, with completely different outfits that still completed the ""Villager"" kinda look.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime, and in my opinion, will keep you interested until the end, and most likely even rewatchable.', 'Unpopular opinion but here goes.By the whole idea and concept of the world itself in the anime is pretty good yet a lot of it was taken away by really random horny stuff. If someone would cut up those 24 episodes into your usual 12-14 episode anime, it would be way way better.Premise - 8/10The whole idea of everyone having a ""count"" which goes up or down depending on your oath to yourself is pretty good. Considering the idea arose from essentially WW3 (Waste Wars), it\'s a really nice concept. Only and major flaw is that quarter of the anime in it wasn\'t worked on...anymore and became more of a regular fighting comedy.Art style - 10/10Character clothing, design, animation style is top notch yet this is still opinion based. Nothing I can add here. For me it was perfect.Story - 6/10While the story itself is quite good looking from an idea stand point, execution wasn\'t that great. The anime focused on Licht too much through out his journey, leaving other character stories with gaps between their character development. It leaves a lot to be desired as I\'d happily learn more about Jail, Hina and Nana as they are one of the main characters yet all focus is on Licht. Having the universe set in a modern time jumping back to medival times is a really nice concept but slightly underworked.Episodes - 4/10As stated above, if we cut out some moments from the episode where it\'s too much horny stuff, the episode total would drop by almost half and only then the anime itself would actually be better by a huge margin. As stated, if someone would cut out the unneeded bits and bobs, it would easily be an 8.5/10 anime.All in all, I think it\'s worth a watch if you don\'t mind watching through those random moments.

An intriguing  story line- comedy , adventure a little titillation and relatable human emotions.I won’t go into the normal review about what’s happened or ruin the view factor for those watching it - but the story is completely different to any other anime I have watched .Ive never seen an anime based on a ballot system which defines your life total  .I’ve been on tenterhooks when episodes have left me asking questions...about certain events and character interactions. As this episode finished I was satisfied finally have answers to questions that have bugged me for weeks and yes I could have wikis but what would that do??!I think people should be more fair on this anime and give it a fair chance . It’s got great art and storyline and deserves a look .FYI licht is amazing - totally amazing:) about certain events and character interactions.

That was mainly because of the super generic characters and the very basic looking world design.Story 5/10:To be fair, Plunderer has quite a unique premise, which is btw. the only reason why I kept watching it at the time. To put it shortly, everything is ruled by numbers, the higher your count is the stronger you are. A little bit later into the series, there is quite an interesting plot twist which made the show much more enjoyable in my opinion. For spoiler reasons I won\'t say what happened.Art 7/10:Plunderer\'s art style is...pretty standart, but not bad in any way. The animations are smooth and the linework is pretty good aswell. The only minor issue i had was the bad CGI, but it only is a minor issue because it only appears very shortly in only a handfull of episodes.Sound 7/10:Just as the Art, the soundeffects in this show are decent but far from great. The background music also isn\'t very noticable but still not bad, it just isn\'t any banger that you would listen too in your freetime.Characters 4/10:Honestly the biggest issue that I have with plunderer is that it\'s characters do have some character traits, but these just get really annoying after a short period of time. For example the protagonist Licht or often refered to as ""Pudding"" is a big pervert that likes himself some booty, but the show is just overdoing this and almost every other trait shown throughout the series, which makes most of the characters really annoying.Enjoyment 6/10:I really had to force myself to continue watching this, but the main plot twist really got me interested in terms of how the story would play out or how certain characters would develop after the twist. This show really needs like 10 episodes to get going, but it really hooked me afterwards.Overall 6/10:If you don\'t have a high minimum estimated quality bar, you surely will find some sort of enjoyment in Plunderer. It certainly is not a good show but still worth watching, especially after said plot twist kicks in and flips everything upside down. Plunderer just really is a total mess at the beginning but slowly unfolds into a more complex story while the characters turn from annoying twat\'s into quite loveable people. pretty standart, but not bad in any way.

Honestly my rating would be a 1, if not for the fact that the manga is the complete opposite. I'm not one for Ecchi, but I'm not bothered by it. Still, there was simply too much of it. Honestly the anime prioritizes the Ecchi over the very essential Plot of this series and I absolutely hated it.I stumbled upon this anime by chance, when I was suggested a scene of Episode 9 where Licht was revealed to be the Ace of Flashing Strikes. I was interested despite the plain animations, because hey, not every anime studio has sufficient budget....So I took the liberty to binge watch the series up to the latest episode, episode 10. And yes, there was so much filler it was almost painful to watch. What kept me going was my curiosity of this universe, which episode 9 had shown the tip of the iceberg of.So, episode 10. I was curious, and went ahead to read the manga. Oh boy, how my impression of Plunderer skyrocketed. Other than its beautiful art, this manga really took me by its world building. There was minimal Ecchi, just a couple panels here and there with some sneaking in, which is the optimal amount and what the anime should have been. Anyway, I started reading where episode 10 dropped off, so i didn't read the first dozen chapters, but I can tell you that I couldn't stop reading the moment I started. Licht's past was so tragic and beautifully executed, I cried my eyes out. The poor children, I wish them to be spared (from the author lol) and lead a happy life without regrets...Anyway, the manga is still ongoing, and I'll definitely support it. The anime... Let's see if the studio can redeem themselves with our dear MC's arc. Otherwise... Nope.In conclusion, read the manga. Just... Read the Manga. Treat the anime as a side item. Only then can you truly enjoy what this tragic series has to offer. So I took the liberty to binge watch the series up to the latest episode, episode 10.

And by that I mean Plunderer is a good anime with some very bad qualities that drag the whole show down.I understand the low rating and every complain people have with the anime and wholeheartedly respect every opinions (at least all the sane opinions). That doesn\'t mean I\'m agree with them but I understand why people don\'t like the anime. All the (sane) opinions to me is always valid.Story:If you are a very unpatient viewer...and can\'t handle some prologue, I think this anime is not for you. But to every person that feels like this anime don\'t even bother to tell a story after 10 episodes, I must say that you\'re only a fifth into the manga and it barely scratch the surface. The real story is yet to be told and now that we are done with the prologue (I assume you\'ve already made it through ep 7), some plot elements are gonna kick in. The author does have a story to tell and you are about to see it if you haven\'t dropped it already.Characters:Regarding some problems people have with the characters, I have no reasons to blame them since they are just not familiar with Minazuki Suu\'s writing style. He tends to introduce very generic, trope-ish and one-note characters to throw us off but later on developes them to become more interesting and likeable. Minazuki doesn\'t write assholes, he writes characters that have a backstories which shaped them into the kind of person they are today and I really like that. The dynamics among the characters are enjoyable or even hilarious at times.Comedy:Comedy is as subjective as it gets so no arguments about that. All I can say is the comedy is not overused and never gets into the way of the plot. No comedies nor ecchi are to be found in serious moments (yes this manga have serious moments, and many). Minazuki only shove in the fanservice at the end of an arc or when the problems are already resolved. Hell, some characters even used them as a coping mechanism when they have to confront with their past trauma. All in all. I think it\'s well done.(Plus, if you enjoy the comedy of this show, you are still a perfectly normal human being and nothing is wrong with you. You have the right to enjoy anything you like)Music and Art:I put these two together because I don\'t have much to say. The music is fine, I don\'t have any major problems with it, the ED was cute, I liked it, the rest are just meh. The art is fine coming from an inexperienced studio like GEEKTOYS but only when the characters don\'t move. The sakuga is atrocious and makes me want to vomit while bleeding from my eyes (I watched Kimetsu the night before). It is just soooooo bad. I think that\'s the main reason why some people didn\'t even make it through the first half. I really hope GEEKTOYS will improve in a very near future.That\'s it for the review, there are so much more I want to address but this is getting very long and I don\'t want to waste your precious time so I\'m gonna end it here. If you are interested in my opinion and want to hear more you can find me on the official Plunderer discord, my username is ""diepiepew"".Oh wait almost forgot the ratings, I usually don\'t want to rate things but if you desperately want it, here you go:Story: 9Art: 4Sound: 6Character: 9Enjoyment: 10Overall: 8 and can\'t handle some prologue, I think this anime is not for you.

Tries to tell an ""adult"" story, but with children\'s logic. The whole world it builds is based on silly concepts that does not make sense. It is like somebody read old conspiration theories and based their worldview on them.The whole logic of the ""waste war"" is flawed, starting a war to gain enemy resources is one thing and it could make sense, but bombing your enemy with nukes while your objective is to obtain more basic resources (like food)from them is retarded. Resources...will not magically spawn out of nowhere when you destroy your enemy, you need to take them and transport them back to you. Not to mention if the longterm plan is to feed your population, then your objective is to aquire fertile land, so irradiating it is quite the opposite.Also famines are always temporary, you either gain enough food to feed people or loose the people that you can not feed.Also, can you imagine a goverment that would be still capable to wage a war after a year of famine and mass civil unrest? There would be no stable goverments, at all. Bunch of rebellions and civil wars (I know that ""warfare is banned"", but somehow skirmishes are not (a mob with basic weapons attack a bunch of army cadets is OK)) would be on daily basis. The word coup d\'état would define that era.No-kill army is dumb concept, if guns are involved.On top of all that, ""the numbers that govern the world"" are neamingless and serve basically no purpose, not even the purpose of establishing hierarchy like it is explained in first episode and never brought up again. Not even the later explanation for numbers makes sense, at all.All off this could be ignored, but the anime takes itself too seriosly.Twists do not make any sense, they are just deus ex machinas, nothing more.Random tone shifts that make no sense at all.Characters repeat the same dialogue over and over like they are dumb.The whole timetravel part is pointless and serverves only as exposition.There is just too much unfunny random nonsense.

I seen that a LOT on this site. It\'s gotten to the point where I know I\'m going to like a romantic reverse harem anime if the rating\'s 6/10 or very slightly above. Take Diabolik Lovers or Meji Tokyo Renka for example The thing with anime, is that it\'s naturally expected that the viewers read between the lines to figure out what\'s going on and what the the true intentions were. If done well, that immersive tactic is the whole reason why anime\'s so enjoyable in the first place! Given that the show probably won\'t...ever get a sequel, the staff did a great job with the overall story structure pacing and character development.

What really bothers me is all the unnecessary fanservice and at times that are supposed to be serious or sad. The whole joke of ""she\'s wearing a short skirt because she wants people to see her panties"" and the sexual harassment is just disgusting, and sometimes make it so close of a hentai. And what was that at the end of episode 17 when Hina put Rihito\'s hand in her breast and gave that serious speech?  Should this be...an heart touching scene?and then floating and saying goodbye without a shirt. WTF? It was one of the most ridiculous scenes I\'ve seen in all the anime I\'ve watched. LOL an heart touching scene?and then floating and saying goodbye without a shirt. WTF? It was one of the most ridiculous scenes I\'ve seen in all the anime I\'ve watched. LOL', ""As I've heard from some people who read the manga , The manga is much more different than the anime in a good way but the anime itself unfortunately wasn't good . It's actually sad that the studio wasted this story's potential , the story is really good and has a lot of potential for improvement it could be a masterpiece if it's written well and with care but sadly enough it wasn't .The anime didn't really focus on the story and was making characters goof around for maybe more than half of the anime's episodes . There's nothing that makes the characters unique which...makes them always repeat the same things over and over again . The anime focused on the relationships between the characters in the anime more than it did focus on the story . In addition , the events were also really slow at times because as I said the characters were goofing around too much for no reason , there were a lot of episodes that had no meaning for real which is why the pacing of the anime is slow and it wastes the potential of the story and also for the characters .The characters background were cliched ( Can't help it sometimes ) but they were understandable and it was good to see improvements in the second half of the anime ( barely tho ) .The OSTS and the themes were great . The OSTS were used perfectly in some scenes in the anime . Although , The anime did have a decent amount of fights but they were poorly made . The animation sadly was not good and there were not enough movements and moves as it's to be expected . The power system is great but then again as I said before , this also is wasted potential , they could've made the fights much better in many ways but almost all of the fights were not satisfying at all ( except maybe one fight ) .In conclusion , It's really sad to see such potential wasted like that because of the studio or maybe because of the author himself ( don't know that for sure but it's really sad if that's the case ) . I did enjoy the atmosphere of the anime and some of the fights but the feeling of unsatisfactory was overwhelming and it made the anime sadly boring and not worth the time to watch it .

Right from the get go you notice something, this anime takes perversion in Shonnen to new heights. I already know what you may be thinking, ""But Kakori, you\'re complaining about Ecchi in a Ecchi anime?"", but here\'s the thing: I don\'t mind Ecchi.When I say I don\'t mind ecchi, I really mean it, for me it doesn\'t make a anime any worse or any better, it\'s just there. I don\'t really factor ecchi when choosing what anime to watch, instead I watch whatever feels interesting story-wise. But Plunderer...is a exception. This is one of the very few occasions where the amount of ecchi and, most importantly, sheer perversion actually annoyed me. Sexual harassment turned into comedy and cheesy ecchi scenes mixed with serious plot moments made me roll my eyes not once, not twice, but many times throughout the anime.Now, maybe you don\'t mind ecchi, maybe you even like it, I don\'t have anything against it. So let me go to my next point: pacing. My god, the pacing. I swear that the plot only starts 7 or 8 episodes in. Plunderer, specially in the first half, is littered with ""filler"", having entire episodes that could easily be cut barely affecting the plot and it really made me want to drop this anime.Thankfully I didn\'t drop it, as the story is actually intriguing, but maybe not because of the reasons you imagine. Starting with episode 8, new plot points are introduced and they are very intriguing, but the initial concepts that made you start to watch the anime in the first place are not very well explored. The counter, which are the selling point of the anime, almost become like energy levels in Dragon Ball Z: they represent power, they keep going up with each new villain and really start to lose importance after a while. A real shame for anyone wanting a ""In Time"" vibe from Plunderer.But in the end it was all worth it, right? Well, kinda. The story overall is not bad and I\'m actually looking forward to a possible second season, but don\'t expect anything too exceptional. The problems I mentioned persist throughout the anime, even if to lesser degrees, and the story as a whole could be better. The character relationships are somewhat forced, no pun intended, but I don\'t usually mind it that much, I\'ve come to accept weirder for the sake of entertainment.Don\'t get me wrong, Plunderer sure has its qualities. Intriguing concepts, some deep philosophical questions and even some really funny moments, including some ecchi moments that made me laugh my ass off. Overall, it started bad to worse, but ended up pretty decent, so it was a fair anime. If the story was shortened from 24 episodes to 13 or maybe a few more, with much of the filler cut out, it could have been a 7 or even 8. But the way it is, I\'ll stick with a not-quite-as-good 6. is a exception. This is one of the very few occasions where the amount of ecchi and, most importantly, sheer perversion actually annoyed me.

The start is your typical ecchi anime, with pervert MC and a lot of cliche moments like beating the MC for doing perverted things. Though in the first 8 eps it had a few moments that were good but that was shadowed by the awful pacing and overall ""cutesy"" feel of the story. But as soon as ep 9 came around the story went from 3/10 to 8/10 in terms of what the actual f**k was going on. SO if you are considering starting or dropping this series,...watch till ep 9/10. Then decide what to do next.Edit: So it goes downhill in the latter episodes. So much so that the last episodes are a joke to watch. The series went from 5/10 to 8/10 to again in the end 5/10. And I am going easy on it watch till ep 9/10. Then decide what to do next.Edit: So it goes downhill in the latter episodes. So much so that the last episodes are a joke to watch.

Currently there are 54 chapters of it (with english translation) and i read all of it so there will be some things in the review that not certainly were at the current stage of the anime.Second: At the current pace 1 episode is like 1 chapter in the manga. It is a little bit of help to those who will want to read the amnga after the anime but not want to read it from the start. (Which would be a mistake in my opinion).If you like ecchi animes, it has some ecchi and perverted scenes but it\'s not...in the main focus of the story.If you love plot twists and traitors this could be your style of anime/manga at some point.Unfortunately the anime changed quite a bit according to the manga, so some things might be confusing. There are a lot of plot twists later on in the manga and it could be a little confusing but it is followable.The ""base"" of the story is that numbers decide everything: your social status, your lifestlye, your power, your strength... everything. Technically that\'s not always the case in the story (fortunately), but there are a lot more to it than you can ever imagine.The story is not perfectly focused on just 1 character (the main protagonist), the whole cast get their own protagonist times in the story.There are a lot of yet unknown mysteries in the story right now. A lot of misunderstandings, heart breaking parts (a whole lot), GREAT CHARACTERS!!!!As for me I really love the characters. Especially Rihito (Licht) and Jail. All the characters are great, well written and has deepness.I definitely recommend everyone to read the manga, because it\'s one of the best manga if not the best i\'ve ever read.The anime is kind of average until now, but i hope as the story progresses they will make it better. in the main focus of the story.If you love plot twists and traitors this could be your style of anime/manga at some point.Unfortunately the anime changed quite a bit according to the manga, so some things might be confusing.

For me the story was a solid 9/10, but the only thing that bothered me - which will most likely tie in with the characters- was how the story was told.The creator (author of the manga) rushed way to quickly into the story and even disregarded a few character development, like i said before because the story concept is so great I feel that the creator could have left some blank spaces to create some massive and amazing character arcs.Yes there are some fast paced anime out there, but for this kind of story I feel that Plunderer needed that type of story telling that needed to be dragged out or prolonged a bit to create meaningful character progress and build close relationships. The characters in this story seem hollow and to easy to understand and some are are just too generic, they needed to be an underline so they had more room for emotion and pain.The execution in my opinion was done completely wrong. I also did the mistake of reading the manga thinking it was going to be better and i thought maybe it\'s just the anime that was bad, but it seems the manga is even worse, because I noticed the subtle changes the anime did to the manga, like how the two characters meet or adding in a few scenes to make it last longer, which I can say did a good job on, and maybe that\'s why I realized after having watching the anime and reading the manga that I though maybe the anime could have made the manga better but no they just cancel each other out.I can make so many other points on how bad this anime is it\'s still going to be my ""trash"" show unfortunately, which is the really sad part because even though it\'s crap I\'m most likely going to finish the anime and come back with even more criticism lol.Overall score: 4.7/10 it could have been.Let\'s start with the story line first, which I think was one of the stronger aspect, I mean having numbers to define your life span whether it\'s walking distance, how many criminals you\'ve arrested, or how many people you\'ve helped is such a unique concept, with the fact that if you reach 0 you\'ll be sent into the abyss.

At first glance it seems like a standard ecchi fantasy romp, but the way the show evolves had me shocked. I havnt seen a show that blew away my expectations like this in a long time. Although my expectations werent that high to begin, to be fair.Maybe I'm overhyping it, but I didnt expect to binge 20 episodes in one sitting. Its not...perfect, and it can get complicated at certain points but it was an enjoyable ride that kept me guessing til the end. perfect, and it can get complicated at certain points but it was an enjoyable ride that kept me guessing til the end."", 'The problem with Plunderer is its fanservice. Or better, the way it uses fanservice.I have nothing against it when it\'s taken lightly, but here it goes way beyond the simple ""let\'s show boobs and asses for our male audience"". Here there are scenes of harassment and groping that are treated like it\'s a normal thing to do. I mean, come on. That\'s gross.Now that we have taken this out of the way, let\'s talk about the anime. Which is a pretty average work of fiction, with some interesting ideas and some pretty bad moments.Plunderer is a fantasy anime set in the world of Alcia, where...everything is decided by a count carved in your skin. The higher it is, the stronger you are, and when it goes down to 0, you fall into the abyss. What is the abyss? No one knows. The counts are different from person to person: some counts the kilometers they walk, some the people they satisfy, and so on.The protagonist, Hina, is a girl whose mother was taken into the abyss. Before this could happen, she asked her daughter to find ""The Ace"", who would have somehow helped her.Plunderer has many ideas (the count, for example, and also the mistery surrounding Alcia and its history) that are pretty good. Many times, along the series, I told myself ""wow, I wasn\'t expecting that"". There are a lot of plot twists and arcs that are very well conceived.However, this is also from where most of the problems of the series come from. To reach the second arc of the series, for example, a certain female character does something that makes you ask ""Ok, so why she hasn\'t done that before? Why hasn\'t she used that power to save that character, or to beat that enemy?""Many characters have interesting backstories, but their characterization is very bland and formulaic, with only two characters that I can actually say I liked a lot. And that are also the reason I wait the second season.Also, it has a bizarre pace.You need to wait 8 episodes before the series actually starts, and after that, you also get an episode of, well, fanservice.Yes, fanservice is all over the place, and it even becomes a part of the plot at a certain point. Kill La Kill taught us a lot.On a technical level, there isn\'t much to say. Art and animation are pretty average, with the final fight of the series being however well directed, and the soundtrack has some good tunes that I found quite original.In the end, Plunderer is not that bad as many of the reviews make it look like, but is certainly not that good either.

The main issue here is the characters are really uninteresting, cliched and just plainly boring, there is really not much worthwhile to say about them, the setting is barely explored outside of some exposition and the main focus of the first 10 or so episodes is an ecchi filled wild goose chase between two...of the main characters.After episode 10 or so the story goes in a different, unexpected direction and went exploring the ""origin"" story of the aces and I found myself interested yet again. However, that particular arc leads nowhere outside of some shock plotwists that really are not impactful to the story at all and that is when I realized there is nothing really going for this anime.What this anime has is tons of ecchi, and while I do not mind it when it is used in moderation, this show just takes it overboard to levels of retardedness i did not think were possible. Literally every time when it is possible the show producers will just cram some stupid ecchi moment. Often times what should be serious moments (and mind you, the producers I think expect you to care about) are interspersed with poor taste ecchi that just completely ruin the pacing of the scenes.It is really sad, because this could have been a genuinely good anime, the potential was there, and this is why it\'s even more painful to review it. The base was there, but the execution of the overall concepts and the characters were handled with lack of taste, common sense and really any creative license.Apparently the manga that this was based is much better. I have no idea as I did not read it, but if you are interested in any way in this show you should probably just read the manga and completely skip the anime. of the main characters.After episode 10 or so the story goes in a different, unexpected direction and went exploring the ""origin"" story of the aces and I found myself interested yet again.

That was an instant put-off for me at the start of the series; However, upon reaching episode 14 there is still much more Plunderer offers - Specifically speaking, it's not uncommon for time-travel related series to become oversaturated with beginner viewers (i.e Steins;Gate, RE:ZERO, Erased, Zankyou no Terror.

When watching this, you can clearly see that adaptations 1:1 just don't work out. People responsible for this anime haven't try to make a good show and instead decided to go with simply taking the original and transferring it into another media.  Because of that, the tv adaptation has a...lot of flaws, which include wrong pacing and lack of any rhythm. Also, the animation looks just terribly bad and the colour palette reminds me of this in Paint. I do not recommend you watching this. I think if you are interested in the premise, you should instead try reading a manga, because the anime takes all the good things from it and serves it in the most repulsive form possible. lot of flaws, which include wrong pacing and lack of any rhythm.

And the characters act clichéd, the most the girls, it is very annoying. Also the way how lynn is calling licht ""pudding"" is exaggerated.Also the story construction is poor, for example the system with the counter, it haves so many logic mistakes.But it could be worse, so look forward and hope for some improvement.I think that the boob sizes in this...anime are not equal to each other what found interresting. anime are not equal to each other what found interresting.', '(short review) many were hyped about this anime and honestly it couldve been so much more in the hands of a good studio.... basically one must read the manga to enjoy plundererSTORY:- [7/10] i am all for slice of life ecchi stories but you cant just switch from SOL to full fledged action without setting a premise but i will admit that the story is pretty good when i reaches its peak (especially the manga).SOUND;-[1/10] for god s sake GEEK TOYS why would you use hollywood style orchestra (that  is anyway too bizzare and out of place when present)in a japanese anime? the sound...is bad like real bad i almost dropped it for this very reason the voice acting is probably average at best you cant tell the difference MC rage mode and MC slice of life mode.CHARACTERS:-[6/10] the chars are boring and uninteresting the only reason i give it a 6/10 is because they atleast got the ecchi parts spot on and i still believe this may be a good show if only you consider the ecchi elements but that again is niche preference of genre and many are actually put off by it.ART and ANIMATION:-[8/10] plunderer did rather well considering it was a anime with non existent  budget and unknown studio the animation was satisfactory and the fights were mildly amusing if you can ignore the few nitbits like the fights itself being not very original and using the basic hack and slash and shoot  and a couple of martial arts thrown around, the environment destruction seems a bit over the top too. the characters had  a design that looked very similar to fairy tail for some reason and no complaints there.....honestly its not a bad anime its watchable if you can ignore the horrible ost and can appreciate its unique plot twists (although not well explained). is bad like real bad i almost dropped it for this very reason the voice acting is probably average at best you cant tell the difference MC rage mode and MC slice of life mode.CHARACTERS:-[6/10] the chars are boring and uninteresting the only reason i give it a 6/10 is because they atleast got the ecchi parts spot on and i still believe this may be a good show if only you consider the ecchi elements but that again is niche preference of genre and many are actually put off by it.ART and ANIMATION:-[8/10] plunderer did rather well considering it was a anime with non existent  budget and unknown studio the animation was satisfactory and the fights were mildly amusing if you can ignore the few nitbits like the fights itself being not very original and using the basic hack and slash and shoot  and a couple of martial arts thrown around, the environment destruction seems a bit over the top too. the characters had  a design that looked very similar to fairy tail for some reason and no complaints there.....honestly its not a bad anime its watchable if you can ignore the horrible ost and can appreciate its unique plot twists (although not well explained).', 'Ahh Plunderer. Something that could\'ve been a very intriguing and interesting story. The first few episodes were somewhat promising. It showed potential, besides the obvious generic tropes it had this mysterious feeling. The main problem ill get into first is the story.Story: 3/10 The reason it\'s a 3 is simply because the show is trying to add too many spices to the pot. it tries to dabble with too many different things at once. It doesn\'t understand if it wants to be a mysterious Shonen, power fantasy Isekai, etc.This results in the viewer being confused at times. another thing this does is alter the...feeling of the show, it ruins serious moments one episode going from characters trying to kill each other to the next drinking becoming ""best buds"". How are people supposed to get attached or into the story if it just seems to not take itself seriously at times.Characters: 5/10 The characters are just mediocre, while there are some favorable characters, the other ones just cancel it out by being bland or flat out one dimensional.Music: 7/10 I thought the music was above average honestly it was great at times and it adds so much to some of the scenes and makes them so much better, Although there are sometimes where the music could\'ve been chosen better. Overall it was solid.Animation: The animation overall was solid. It can be at times kind of bland or generic but at no means is it bad I think it was solid. They played it safe when it came to the animation. The only nitpick I have is when characters eyes are drawn over the characters hair and that is seen many times during the show.Overall, I wouldn\'t go out of my way to recommend the show. The reason I finished the show because I just wanted to see how it would end. The show to me isn\'t bad enough to drop as there are some redeeming qualities and good moments sprinkled in here.

This show is actually bad I don't understand how anyone can actually like this its boring the animation is bad the characters are shit just how the FUCK did this get an anime adaptation. It has NOTHING going for it - maybe that’s why it got a no-name studio with subpar animation. It’s not a surprise that this show has a 5/10 score on Ani List. This is a long intro let's get into the other sections.The Pros:Did you read the intro? THERE IS NONE !!Ok maybe one(NSFW)...The Cons:Animation:Not much to say here its shit - how the fuck am i going to get this review over the characters count… shit. Well the studio that animated this season is called “Geek Toys” - what type of sex brand is this - and they have animated such INSTANT CLASSICS such as “Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?” or “Hensuki: Are you willing to fall in love with a pervert, as long as she’s a cutie?”. Do I even need to say anything? ReallyHowever, it does have one good-ish scenePacing:The pacing is ok. Like everything else in this anime, its completely mediocre or worse. Flashback arc was ok on pacing. However, everything past this arc felt very rushed and un satisfying literally nothing to say here it gets a 5/10 on the pacing score. COMPLETELY averageCharacters:Oh, my this is going to be fun because I HATE all of these characters. They are so unlikeable its almost funny - only characters I like is Nana (the dark-skinned girl with the Pseudo Brother Complex.. and a BIG personality)Licht:His whole characters is that he was a pervert and had a MASSIVE transformation in to an edgy pervert. This anime tries so hard to make Licht a badass but he’s just a generic edgy character with not much to him. He is unlikable and the flash back arc doesn’t make him any more likeable either. AND ESPECIALLY HIM HAVING A SEXUAL RELTIONSHIP WITH HIS FUCKING NIESE. WHAT THE FUCK JAPAN?!?!?!??!?!?!?Hina:She has no likeable straits she’s the MC, she’s a little pretty and she tried to rape Licht. You read that right it happened but we just gone gloss other that I guess .I don’t even want to talk about this bitch no more. Thinking about her is bringing flashbacks of her shouting“LICHT-SAN” and making me want to commit not alive.Jail Murdoch:He’s a sort off edgy virgin whose the silent type and lawful… I think.. He doesn’t really have much of a characters BUT he did have the one funny bath house scene and that’s his whole character. He also has MAD daddy issues.Lynne:She is just fanservice , that’s all she always in lewd situations and she can’t fight so you already know she only got one purpose in the story… that’s… P L O T(NSFW)Somethings rising and it’s not the shield heroThis is not funny next characterNana:She’s dark skin and hot.

If there is no reveal for season 2 in the next year I will read the manga of it. 10/10 ya fuckheads stop reading my comment and start watching it right now, every minute counts.

', 'tl;dr: An anime that starts off enjoyably light hearted and simple, but becomes a convoluted mess trying too hard to have depth.Firstly, I’d like to state that I in general do like Minazuki Suu works and downright loved Sora no Otoshimono, so I have no problem with there being a perverted protagonist or random and major shifts from serious to comedic. Now, I’d like to give him the benefit of the doubt and just assume that the anime adapted the manga terribly, but to put it simply this anime is nothing like his other works and does a pretty bad job at pretty much everything.The...anime starts off kind of feeling mostly like his other works. There are definitely some hints about there being some pretty dark things going on and that a serious story is going to pop up eventually, but it’s for the time being it’s just pretty light hearted with a very strong emphasis on comedy above all, with a heavy portion of that being related to the protagonist’s pervy antics. It introduces a lot of the main characters and begins some world building, though with most of the world building leading to more questions than answers. It feels somewhat slow at times, but it’s a pretty fun ride.This stage lasts for the first third or so of the anime, after which it changes dramatically, and its all downhill from there. It suddenly gets extremely dark in what felt like a major shift. As mentioned, other works by the original author also have major shifts like this, but they’re usually more reversible, having long lasting impacts on character development and such, but otherwise returning to the standard light hearted tone with the overall status quo only improving. This story is completely different. Once it starts going down that path, it changes completely, and though it does try to return to the light hearted tone at times, it just doesn’t work because it’s impossible to just ignore the dark elements of the plot that persist.Unlike the original author’s other works which seems to focus on characters over plot, this seems to have a much larger emphasis on the plot itself. Unfortunately, the plot just isn’t strong enough to support the anime. There are a lot of long term plot threads, lots of things left mysterious only to be revealed later, and lots of elements that end up seeming unimportant but become much more important later on. However, it feels like all of these are being made up on the spot. The explanation behind most plot elements feel incredibly forced, in that it has to try to write around a bunch of other stuff that contradicts it, and even then it still feels like there’s an abundance of gaping plot holes. Especially when it comes to anything involving the out of nowhere but incredibly important time travel arc which ended up having a large amount of straight up infodumping. It’s a complete and utter mess that feels like it’s changing direction constantly, and thus even if you’re willing to look past the inconsistencies, it’s hard to get into the plot enough to properly get invested in it and really want to know what happens next, which considering this is a plot focused anime is simply a critical flaw. I would also normally talk about the pacing here, but everything just seems so messy that I have no idea how to even begin to judge it. I will say that the pacing on action in the second half became pretty bad with some battles being over instantly, and others like the final battle feel like they were dragging on forever.The random plot also seems to screw things up with characters. It doesn’t feel like there’s any definitive vision of what the characters are supposed to be. Characters grow and change over stories of course, but here it just feels like the story didn’t really know what it wanted to do with characters and just gave them random roles, but then that didn’t work with where the story eventually needed to go, so the characters were turned into something completely different, but because the plot kept changing a lot the characters in turn end up changing a lot to. There’s no real sense of progression. Just character’s behaving really randomly and often what feels like absurdly. The end result is really inconsistent characterization, which combined with the fact that it feels like the plot itself treats most of the cast like garbage, makes it really difficult to get all that invested in any of the cast. This is especially prominent in the romance. Romance is actually a focus in this anime, and things actually make major progress over the course of the anime. But it isn’t satisfying at all because it doesn’t feel well built up to at all. I feel like this was originally going to be a harem series, but the plot changed halfway through, and instead became a normal romance where relationship drama is actually important and there are a bunch of different intertangled relationships developing which really did not flow well at all, and on top of that the anime is terrible at pretty much all relationship drama with essentially all of it being cringeworthily bad, and that’s coming from someone that has a really low bar when it comes to stuff like that.The art and animation were disappointing. The character designs and general art style are decent enough, but the art and animation were incredibly subdued and general not very nice to look at, and at times it felt like they were intentionally going out of there way to be so which makes no sense. The action also looked pretty bad at times. The soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable but I suppose was decent enough. The first OP was somewhat interesting in how it changed in terms of visuals, but otherwise was only decent in terms of song and visuals. The second OP and both EDs were similarly decent in terms of both audio and visuals, but not particularly memorable. anime starts off kind of feeling mostly like his other works.

And at first, it's not bad. The world has interesting lore, the characters are decent, even if not all that interesting, and ecchi was delivered. I was happy. After a few episodes, though, things seem to slow down: the same questions are being asked again and again, with only the most minuscule of answers being provided. Perphaps worse still, the ecchiness quickly became stale, limiting itself...to talking about panties colors.This slog reaches its peak on episode 8, with 20 minutes that might just have been copied and pasted from episode 7. On the flip side, after 20 minutes of garbage, it ends with a 3-second twist that actually moves the plot forward in an absurd (but interesting) way. The next episode capitalizes on this to push on the plot forward and answer those pesky questions that were being ignored from episode 1. Finally, we reached the start line.Episode 9, then, could mark the turning point for Plunderer, where an uninspired ecchi battle anime finds its own identity and pace and courageously takes its first step into meaningful story-telling. Except the production sucks.I hadn't really noticed until now, but the technical level of Plunder is low. Bottom-of-the-barrel low. Empty, repeated background, stiff animation, characters that change proportions between scenes, some very lazy design that drinks way too much from the Fullmetal Alchemist fountain, and just terrible dialogue writing, that makes almost every conversation cliched and boring. This really becomes apparent when the main characters finally reach a city. There's absolutely no background sound effects, all buildings are identical 2-story houses the whole town over, and even though it's supposed to be a huge city, there's only about 20 people living in it (all of which are probably twins, given their similarities). It's hard to believe this comes from a professional animation studio, given that it exudes amateurism from every aspect.And its a shame, because Plunderer has the foundation laid for a good anime. It probably would never be amazing, given that the source manga also lacks a bit of imagination, but it could be a good action anime with tantalizing fan-service sprinkled here and there. What we got, however, was simply a mess of lazyness and shame. to talking about panties colors.This slog reaches its peak on episode 8, with 20 minutes that might just have been copied and pasted from episode 7. On the flip side, after 20 minutes of garbage, it ends with a 3-second twist that actually moves the plot forward in an absurd (but interesting) way. The next episode capitalizes on this to push on the plot forward and answer those pesky questions that were being ignored from episode 1. Finally, we reached the start line.Episode 9, then, could mark the turning point for Plunderer, where an uninspired ecchi battle anime finds its own identity and pace and courageously takes its first step into meaningful story-telling. Except the production sucks.I hadn't really noticed until now, but the technical level of Plunder is low. Bottom-of-the-barrel low. Empty, repeated background, stiff animation, characters that change proportions between scenes, some very lazy design that drinks way too much from the Fullmetal Alchemist fountain, and just terrible dialogue writing, that makes almost every conversation cliched and boring. This really becomes apparent when the main characters finally reach a city. There's absolutely no background sound effects, all buildings are identical 2-story houses the whole town over, and even though it's supposed to be a huge city, there's only about 20 people living in it (all of which are probably twins, given their similarities).

It\'s that, but it\'s also just full of straight up sexual harassment as a ""joke"" or fanservice - our male MC is straight up harassing and touching women against their will. To me, the way this show portraits that as a running gag is honestly really embarassing. I know that for some reason this is a common trope in some shows, but it is so much worse here because at its core Plunderer has a really imaginative story to follow....If Plunderer got rid of a select few deus ex machina moments during its run and would have scrapped about 90% of this ""fanservice"" stuff and instead focused on exploring its themes more, it would have been a lot better to me and could well have been one of the best shows of the last 10 years. It would be a very different show for that matter, so I can only say that better or best is obviously subjective here.Regarding the story itself, I really enjoyed some of the ideas it was trying to explore. The world is interesting, there are multiple plot points that are really worth exploring and honestly it\'s feeling like a fresh concept while exploring a lot of genre tropes at the same time. Some characters feel not quite fleshed out, same goes for some story points - if the time spent on random sexual harassment could have been used for this purpose I think it would remedy a lot of the flaws this show has.Usually, a show like this would rank at about 5 for me. I would not give it too much thought and just move on. But Plunderers world IS compelling to me. The story intrigues me, no matter how flawed its execution is. It makes me look past all of the botched fanservice and this potential is what elevates the show to a 7 to me.

A mysterious, magical, alien force called ""Allthing"" that governs contemporary society, time travel, ""Ace"" abilities that cover forces like speed, explosions, gravity, pursuit (etc), this show packs in just about every potential concept it can and it\'s all too much. The show is saturated with events and abilities and antagonists. Even the theme of the show can\'t decide whether it\'s really serious (moral dilemma\'s), shallow (MC with plot armour winning world wars without killing a single person) or a comedy that doesn\'t take itself seriously (The numerous cases...of slap stick inserted at seemingly arbitrary points).I watched until the end, begrudgingly, because one of the shows few redeeming qualities were some of the character designs; and the fact that there were just so many mysteries presented at the beginning i felt like i needed to understand at least part of the show for some sense of closure.Normally this is where i\'d point out the 1 or 2 plot holes and/or where the show could have improved its consistency or whether certain characters were believable or not, but i feel like there\'d be no end to it. It\'s hard to even know whether the show was supposed to be satirical or not because the main character is so outrageously strong and full of cliché\'s there\'s almost a sense of meta or self-awareness, but it doesn\'t ever cash in on that absurdism.

It was well done throughout and never appeared derpy or of poor quality.Sound (6/10) - While largely forgettable, the soundtrack never felt...out of place.Character (5/10) - This is probably the worst part of the show, mostly because the characters are illogical and often act irrationally.

But aha there is things that can prevent these things such as ballots. Ballots are this magical orbs that has some numbers stored in them and even if your...own number drops to negative your Ballot will prevent it and it seems to make you stop aging which explains why the Legendary Aces can live for over 300 years. There are 2 different types such as Artificial ballots and Original Ballots. Artificial ones are gifted to high ranking military members and they do improve your powers. While the original Ballots can be compared to Dragon Balls since there are 7 and if you collect them all you can control the earth or something like that.The story: Hina sees her mom get dragged away and she has time to giver Hina a ballot and she also said ""Find the legendary ace"". So Hina starts her journey to find these 300 year old legends. She goes to a town with the hope she can find him there. He meets a Legendary Ace impostor and loses most of her count but then the real Ace arrives and saves the day. We follow Hinas adventures trying to find him again and also The legendary aces adventures while trying to run away from the army. Well, Our Ace named Licht does not want company form Hina and runs away but they meet eventually. I think the greatest part of this anime is the Time Travel arc bs. So our gang go back to the past and meet young Licht before anything bad happens. They attend some military school and such. Since they are a young bunch of pussies they want to become the army that doesn\'t kill but that really doesn\'t work out. In this arc we see how Legendary Aces are made. After they returned to the future everything was changed for the worse I suppose.Characters are somewhat interesting. Hina isn\'t the greatest character but isn\'t the worst. She has developed feelings for Licht during their time together and she also became a very good drinker. Most of the time she just ""sucks"" the aces dick. Her whole character is just about finding the Ace. But after she found the ace she became better. Licht Bach is the so called Legendary Ace. His number is -1000 but his ballot has 5700-57000. He is not a ladies man since he has been rejected 1000 times. He is somewhat of a funny character. Now he is known under the alias Pudding after trying to pass through a city in a pudding costume. Jail Murdoch is my favourite character. He is this high ranking military official but not too high ranking since the highest ranks do paper works while he wants to capture criminals. He has the power to summon and utilize Iron and he does it well. He is quite the bad ass. Pele Poporo is this laid back military man who usually hangs with Mei Lyne. He isn\'t much to look at but he is an assassin and a good one at that. Appearance it scary. Mei Lyne is also a part of the military and she is dead set on helping people out. The common joke with her is that everyone can see her panties due to the short skirt she has to wear. Finally Roy Mustang got his wish.The ost is mostly good. There could be some improvements here and there. Both of the openings are pretty decent even though the first one is better.I think if you like ecchi anime then you should watch. Of course this is as cliche as you can get and it suffers from the same things as Seven Deadly Sins season 3 like not the greatest animation and character models look weird from time to time.

This anime was like a mash-up of characters from Seven Deadly Sins and world building from Gate and SukaSuka.Story (6/10):The concept with the living with the rules of numbers and their count reflecting their power capabilities and social standing seemed original and full of potential. If someone came to me and told me that this is what Plunderer was about, then I would be all-in. Sadly, I would be facing disappointment.The anime and how it portrayed its story in the first three...episodes almost lost me. The plot build-up was so slow and uninteresting at first that if you didn\'t have the patience or the determination to finish what you started watching then you would drop this anime then and there.Luckily, despite my disgust with the generic and almost copied character archetypes (I could swear that the main characters in Plunderer have their exact counterparts in Seven Deadly Sins), I decided to sit through it. This anime somehow turned itself around episode 4 and 5 because they dropped a ""bomb"" to the whole idea of the world building they were doing.This anime has so many concepts and ideas it\'s trying to put together. All of which, are remarkably interesting ideas, and if combined right, it would have been so much more than what was presented. The story deepens as you move along but, despite seeing so much of this story, it was more or less predictable.Art (6/10):The art was sort of stale. It didn\'t exactly bring to life the emotions the characters were trying to portray. And in some cases it felt lacking.Sound (4/10):The OST was not at all helpful. When I get emotional scenes, I expect music in the background accompanying the scenes to make it more come to life. I got the music but, it just didn\'t match the scenes they were accompanying.Character (5/10):Too generic. I mean I could swear that Licht Bach is Melodias from the first Ep alone with Hina being his Elizabeth. And not to mention the other deadly sins (not all) also have there counterpart in Plunderer. And their motif is also quite similar.Well the characters in Plunderer are quite developed and I like how it offers room for the viewers to imagine how these characters came to be. But, I think that they could have done that in a much shorter time compared to how much episodes they allocated for it.You could see that the anime was focusing on character building compared to action sequences. That would have been great if the anime focused on drama and had a good story going for them but, this was not the case.Enjoyment (6/10):Overall (5/10):!!LITTLE SPOILER AND RANT AHEAD!!This anime would have been good for someone who was just started venturing out into anime. I would probably recommend this for beginners more compared to Sword Art Online (yes, a bit of shade there).But as someone who has seen so much of these archetypes, I could say that Plunderer\'s most redeeming factor was its concept with numbers but along the way, these numbers seemed to get irrelevant. Sure in the first few fights, you get the idea that how much his count is, that\'s how strong he is. Then later on, you get fights wherein someone with close to a zero count beat someone with utter plot convenience and conviction?! It just gave me the idea that the numbers that they worked so hard to introduce to us just became obsolete in the long run.I rest my case. Watch this if you\'re new. If you\'re a veteran weeb, watch this if you have some time to spare. episodes almost lost me. The plot build-up was so slow and uninteresting at first that if you didn\'t have the patience or the determination to finish what you started watching then you would drop this anime then and there.Luckily, despite my disgust with the generic and almost copied character archetypes (I could swear that the main characters in Plunderer have their exact counterparts in Seven Deadly Sins), I decided to sit through it. This anime somehow turned itself around episode 4 and 5 because they dropped a ""bomb"" to the whole idea of the world building they were doing.This anime has so many concepts and ideas it\'s trying to put together. All of which, are remarkably interesting ideas, and if combined right, it would have been so much more than what was presented. The story deepens as you move along but, despite seeing so much of this story, it was more or less predictable.Art (6/10):The art was sort of stale. It didn\'t exactly bring to life the emotions the characters were trying to portray. And in some cases it felt lacking.Sound (4/10):The OST was not at all helpful. When I get emotional scenes, I expect music in the background accompanying the scenes to make it more come to life. I got the music but, it just didn\'t match the scenes they were accompanying.Character (5/10):Too generic. I mean I could swear that Licht Bach is Melodias from the first Ep alone with Hina being his Elizabeth. And not to mention the other deadly sins (not all) also have there counterpart in Plunderer. And their motif is also quite similar.Well the characters in Plunderer are quite developed and I like how it offers room for the viewers to imagine how these characters came to be. But, I think that they could have done that in a much shorter time compared to how much episodes they allocated for it.You could see that the anime was focusing on character building compared to action sequences. That would have been great if the anime focused on drama and had a good story going for them but, this was not the case.Enjoyment (6/10):Overall (5/10):!!LITTLE SPOILER AND RANT AHEAD!!This anime would have been good for someone who was just started venturing out into anime. I would probably recommend this for beginners more compared to Sword Art Online (yes, a bit of shade there).But as someone who has seen so much of these archetypes, I could say that Plunderer\'s most redeeming factor was its concept with numbers but along the way, these numbers seemed to get irrelevant. Sure in the first few fights, you get the idea that how much his count is, that\'s how strong he is. Then later on, you get fights wherein someone with close to a zero count beat someone with utter plot convenience and conviction?! It just gave me the idea that the numbers that they worked so hard to introduce to us just became obsolete in the long run.I rest my case. Watch this if you\'re new. If you\'re a veteran weeb, watch this if you have some time to spare.', 'I think that the plunderer is an intriguing anime. At first when I started it, I would have given it a 5 as while watching it was good, but didn’t have the thick plot I wanted. After a few more episodes though I was hooked as the story became more interesting and we learn more about the main male protagonist and what created the society. It was very great to watch, that I couldn’t even wait for a week to watch the next episode, so I read my first manga, and from there I learnt it was going to get a lot more interesting.I feel...that while this anime is good it doesn’t get the credit it deserves, so I highly recommend people to give it a try and watch till episode 5. This is because you just learn more and more things in each episode, which makes the whole experience better as you grow closer to each character. that while this anime is good it doesn’t get the credit it deserves, so I highly recommend people to give it a try and watch till episode 5.

But if your count goes to zero, you will be yeeted from the particular world ruled by numbers.Actually the story seems interesting for a change, but the execution is mediocre and renders the whole anime bad. At least it is bearable to watch. I watched every episode of this production because it is actually hilarious to see how bad it is.

I won't lie; it raised a lot of questions for me, and I understand why everyone is so disappointed - it had the potential to be much more. Let's hope for season 2, I guess.While the poster, the first few episodes and ecchi elements give the impression that...this would not be a show that would leave viewers with heavy emotions, the further the story goes, the darker it gets (I even cried). There were times when the plot and direction of the story really disturbed me, so be mindful of that.Nevertheless, I really did find it enjoyable.The laughter was plentiful, the visuals weren't bad either, and the characters were very likeable.If you want to watch it, just do.

It\'s got the art quality of a low budget series spanning ~100 episodes, though its real total is way smaller. Every episode has about 5 plot twists (all trying to outdo themselves in stupidity). Yes, there\'s a time travel portion. No, it\'s not handled well. To anyone saying ""it was better in the manga"": yeah no....You can\'t undo this level of writing. Don\'t lie to me.This is peak trashy shonen, but I reckon most shonen fans won\'t like it much because it\'s got less emphasis on the fighting and more on the characters. (Or as many of them would call it, ""too much filler"".)  I myself don\'t like shonen very much and would prefer a plot like this with less fighting and more character development, but see the thing is, the characters aren\'t fleshed out well and the story beats aren\'t consistent overall. It\'s pretty hard to give the story much credit, when it\'s more notable for the awful issues with the writing than the plot itself. You may notice, for example, that the entire main cast will magically walk up around the bend when two characters are having a plot-relevant conversation. It\'s like everyone was just hiding around the corner for no reason lol. There\'s so many other bizarre things too, but this was just so..jarring.Honestly, going in blind I was expecting some female-targeted isekai trash (my favorite) w Hina as the MC and then Licht as the ML. Well, I guess it\'s sort-of an isekai (though technically not) and they ARE the show\'s main pairing (with Lyne and Pele being the secondary ship [and actually kinda cute]), but this was faaaaaaaaar from that. It\'s more male-targeted, with tons of misplaced ecchi groping. Though I will say Althing giving Hina the thumbs up when she got self-concious about her small bust made me laugh. Althing\'s a bro. Gotta love that guy(?).If you\'re looking for a laugh, this is 10/10. The stupid plot and the drama of it all is funny.But if you\'re looking for a good anime....?Sorry dude, it\'s a straight 3/10. This is not the kinda thing you\'ll be watching for the plot nor the fights...And it\'s certainly not something you should watch for the art.

It wasn\'t great to begin with, so it\'s really hard to tell.)Anyway, I\'m enjoying it. I hope they make more. You can\'t undo this level of writing.

TL;DR at the end of the reviewStory 2/10 (slight spoilers for episode 1):The premise is really interesting, a world where you\'re assigned a number, which changes according to certain actions. Your influence is dependent on that number - someone with a high number can order a lower numbered person around. Starts good.But it all starts crumbling down once ON THE FIRST EPISODE they introduce the idea of ""hey, guess what? numbers don\'t mean anything because anyone from the military can challenge you for your points, even if they have a lower number""...bruhhhhh. And they take it even further beyond - you can have an object, called a ballot, which has a separate hidden number that adds to your initial one.Because of this, the story at one point turns into a complete fiesta: ""Aha, you thought you were stronger than me? Let me just pull out this secret ballot!"". ""Aha, you were fooled into pulling out your secret ballot, because I also have a ballot!"". ""Aha! You thought I only had one ballet? I HAVE TWO"" Bruhhhhhhhhhhhhh wtfffff. The story is full of twists that are so nonsensical and just made to purposely subvert our expectations.Not only that, the character\'s motivations are so weak. The MC is a huge perv, who all the girls are apparently cool with because lol MC chick magnet power, am I right? And the echhi, my god...

Lack of budget, huh?Sound 5/10:Average. There wasn\'t a single OST that made me go like ""Oh, what is this called? Let me check on youtube"". You won\'t remember any of it, from how little memorable it is.Character 1/10:What is this nonsensical character writing? The girls all fall in love with the MC for absolutely no reason. The MC is a massive perv who\'d get jailed for sexual harassment were it the real world - he\'s supposed to be like this goofy person on the outside who\'s actually very cool, edgy, mysterious, heart of gold guy (something which has already been overdone a million times), but fails completely at it. He completely fails to capture the admiration or empathy of us, viewers.And the girls are equally trash. They have 0 personality, are generic, have weak motivations, follow around MC for the sake of doing it. I don\'t even know how the deuteragonist (the blue haired girl who\'s following MC), who\'s a complete naive moron to the point of getting nearly raped in the first episode + losing all her points, even survived on her own so long. Maybe cuz of PLOT ARMOR, am I right?Enjoyment 2/10:Man, I seriously had to force myself to watch this. People on the internet kept saying ""ohhh it gets better""; ""oh, there are nice plot twists"" - it doesn\'t.TL;DR The story looks written by a 13 year old. The plot twists are nonsensical asspulls that the author does for the sake of being a plot twist. The characters are generic and dumb. The plot is frustrating. The art isn\'t out of the ordinary.

Lack of budget, huh?Sound 5/10:Average. There wasn\'t a single OST that made me go like ""Oh, what is this called? Let me check on youtube"". You won\'t remember any of it, from how little memorable it is.Character 1/10:What is this nonsensical character writing? The girls all fall in love with the MC for absolutely no reason. The MC is a massive perv who\'d get jailed for sexual harassment were it the real world - he\'s supposed to be like this goofy person on the outside who\'s actually very cool, edgy, mysterious, heart of gold guy (something which has already been overdone a million times), but fails completely at it. He completely fails to capture the admiration or empathy of us, viewers.And the girls are equally trash. They have 0 personality, are generic, have weak motivations, follow around MC for the sake of doing it. I don\'t even know how the deuteragonist (the blue haired girl who\'s following MC), who\'s a complete naive moron to the point of getting nearly raped in the first episode + losing all her points, even survived on her own so long. Maybe cuz of PLOT ARMOR, am I right?Enjoyment 2/10:Man, I seriously had to force myself to watch this. People on the internet kept saying ""ohhh it gets better""; ""oh, there are nice plot twists"" - it doesn\'t.TL;DR The story looks written by a 13 year old. The plot twists are nonsensical asspulls that the author does for the sake of being a plot twist. The characters are generic and dumb. The plot is frustrating. The art isn\'t out of the ordinary. The fan service isn\'t delivered in a satisfying way. The sound isn\'t memorable... Why the hell should you even watch this??', ""This is the first ever review on MAL so sorry if I messed up.First I want to start by saying that the story is super good 10/10 as in for the MC I can easily say that during the first episodes I was thinking that his personality was just gonna be just that of a typical ecchi MC but as the episodes start to go into his story you start to really love his character.I honestly don't understand why this anime has such low rating like I was reading the comments and they were all talking about how this is so perverted and how its...so disguising how the MC acts, like damn have you never seen an ecchi anime before and honestly people like that piss me off, like the tags literally says its an ecchi anime.

But honestly, it is so hard to focus when you are saying hmmm....what happens here or there. I mean its not the worst anime, there are rock bottom anime's which are just not close to add to my list even tho I watched them.In many ways...this anime has to fix the approach of the story cause mate. It's not going well as soon as you reach episode 6-7. If you like a bit of Ecchi go ahead watch but if you are looking for more plot driven anime's with more knowledge of backstory and plus more of an idea of what is going on.

"", ""This anime normalises sexual abuse against women.Fan service, the sexualisation of characters (especially female ones), are common in animes. To\xa0be honest, I don’t mind it.\xa0Where this anime\xa0leaves a bad taste, is when the male characters impose themselves on the different female characters. In first few episodes Hina, one of the lead female characters, legs are regularly forced open by men and 'mystical hands' to see the count that sits the inside of her upper thigh. She is sketched in a short skirt, and it's impossible not to pick up on the sexual undertones. Her reactions to their inappropriate touch are embarrassment, dismay and fear. One...of the main perpetrators is the hero himself, Licht Bach. He is seen forcefully pushing his face near Hina's crotch, while she tries to push him away. The seriousness of this scene is defused by showing multiple women beating him up afterwards - cartoon style. Later he gropes another main female's upper legs, only to continue his groping to her panties. His hands are drawn under her skirt moving around as she tries to stop him. She is seen shouting, commanding him to stop touching her. All her pleases falls on deaf ears as her fellow male officer stands and watch, bored. He was also the one to suggest that Licht grope her panties, while asking her to allow Licht to\xa0touch her in a way that makes her uncomfortable. His reasoning: it will be a 'charitable work' :/ The whole scene is portrayed as 'funny,' 'innocent' and 'normal.' No means NO. It's not funny or acceptable to touch someone where and when they do not want to be touched\xa0- no matter the gender of the individual. Should this anime want to take on sexual abuse themes, WHICH IT ALREADY DOES, it should take up the appropriate tags and intended audience. In my opinion, as a shounen anime it reproduces a harmful expression of masculinity that normalise and encourages rape-culture. of the main perpetrators is the hero himself, Licht Bach.

This is gonna be one of the longest and disappointing reviews I\'ve ever written in my entire life.There\'ll be some major spoilers though I\'ll try to keep it as minor spoilers. If you\'re anticipating to see this series due to a friend\'s recommendation, ignore this and go ahead to watch, but I warn thee you\'ve to TURN YOUR BRAIN OFF for there are jarring plot holes that\'ll be difficult to ignore.If this is your very first anime to watch, then it shall be fine unless you\'re here for coherent & naturally srious storytelling, then abandon this series. Don\'t say I didn\'t warn thee.Alright! Now...my verdict...You know the saying of ""Too many cooks spoil the broth.""? Don\'t get me wrong. I\'ve read good reviews and a professional reviewer at ANN whom I still wonder if he\'s immune to all kinds of frustrating plot holes & characters\' random behaviour without common sense.Heck! I\'m still shocked that this series has 100+ people worked on it, mainly the ones working key animators & background. I can assure you I appreciate these people\'s efforts for making an anime isn\'t easy & they get way less pay than the production committee. BUT! I can\'t un-see the many wrongs happening within the storytelling range.To those loving this series by rating it above 6, I can see your POV on why this series has made you buy the source material. Hence, let\'s be ""I love what I love and you love what you love and no hate get involve"". Ok! Now back to that said proverb...The manga series is surprisingly written by only one author. I\'ve ""sneaked in"" to see the early arcs right after watching an episode) while there\'s unfortunate stuff that really happened in the manga, mainly with main protagonist Licht forcing a girl\'s legs apart of main heroine Hina & groping on Soldier Girl Lynn, the anime adaptation is written by the same scriptwriter of Isuca & Rail Wars!, which are infamously have bad scriptwriting.But! I try to give this scriptwriter the benefit of doubt...Unfortunately, the anime becomes 100x more illogical, inconsistent & offensive to me. Actually, this series is still suffering from the Problematic Shounen Battle Tropes & the anime makes it 100x more problematic than in the manga. I believe the categorization below will help you read and understand clearly.CHARACTERSUnfortunately, everyone except Jail turn on a dime randomly for plot progression & suspence convenience. This is where I get disappointed for I was expecting coherent character development for every character. The dialogue and actions of some main characters contradict their emphasized goals that this kind of writing is lazy & offensive for these characters have the worst stereotyped DID/bipolar that\'s indirectly insulting towards real-life people having it. Lynn suffers from it, but she\'s a secondary character so I\'m not bothered about that with her. The primary ones I\'m bothered are Licht, Nana & Hina.Think about it.Nana & Licht are OVER 300+ YEARS OLD!; yet, they act like they didn\'t expect their enemies to come back at them in EP 8. So the first 7 episodes, why are they living peacefully or acting blissfully unaware of the ugly history?Also, EP 18 & 19 sees Licht going after the Alcian Army first then SSU.Proof with Nana saying in ep18:""After 300 years of regret, Licht\'s decision is to take on Alcia. To fight the entire army all by himself...""Again! Why does Nana looked so surprised he\'s going towards the SSU HQ? Those words of hers prove her nonsensical personality.I mean if she knew about that, why does she look so oblivious/dumb when Hina told her he\'s heading towards the army?! Nana looking surprised hearing Hina\'s words proved that she turns on a dime for cheap suspense or has amnesia or suffers from ""women/girls are always dumb"" problematic shounen trope... 😩It\'s like she and Licht were goofing off just for comedy & fanservice timing. Serious storytelling has been wasted by being replaced by those kind of ridiculous scenes. This is why I can\'t see any balance tonal shift in this series because the seriousness of SSU & Alcia\'s origins got overwhelmed by the incoherent and convoluted random comedic behaviours of the main characters.I mean, after watching EP 11, I wonder why they\'ve been keeping a very dangerous secret about the Demon Abyss (attack helicopter) & SSU from Jail & Hina & Lynn. I thought they trust them enough, but no! It\'s for building suspence & plot twist convenience happening in EP 9! That\'s not how you build suspence/plot twist value for this kind of method is offensively nonsensical regarding them having inconsistent personalities! 🤦I did turn my brain off when I notice the first few episodes are illogical in terms of characters turning on a dime randomly, but subconsciously, I feel like it\'s one of the most frustrating dialogue/screenwriting I\'ve ever seen.Oh! Hina becomes one of the worst written main heroines I\'ve ever seen in this medium because of the ""cursed turn on a dime"" concept, her only character development is becoming a sex maniac/obsessed baby-maker. Worst is that she hasn\'t state her age at all (not even in the manga too) and she forgets very scary events happened to her 1) punched & sexually assaulted by a corrupt Alcian soldier, 2) has a gun to her head TWICE, 3) forgets #1 that she forgot to hide Ballot in many cloths (ep21) all in the name of suspence & plot twist convenience...🙄I know she\'s cute and pure for the target demographic, but when she\'s like that, she\'s the most boring. I get why she became a sex maniac for maybe the manga author is pressured to make her change a personality, but that\'s proving that shounen battle series have the worst-written female characters, especially non-powered, cute-looking ones.Shockingly, Hina is a brave badass in one early arc/important scene but the anime seems to make her annoying and dumb 100x more in the anime. Most of the lines she say in ep17 & ep22 belong originally to other characters in the manga so first time watching it, I knew something was wrong for those lines made her more stupid than her manga counterpart.As for Licht well like many people agree, saying ""He\'s one of the worst-written main protagonist I\'ve ever seen.""""There\'s nothing sexy about forcing a girl\'s legs apart."" - EcchiHunterLicht too suffers from the awful screenwriting (ep19 he forgets his revenge by goofing out with them, ep20 he decides to go fight the army when he wasn\'t thinking about it & just went groping main heroine in ep1) though that actually happens in the manga but that\'s salvaged by the manga\'s art & genuine expressions drawn.STORYHa~... This is where everything has fallen apart for me. It has a realistic speculative fiction of a future where food shortage and wars happening due to mistrust/betrayal hidden beneath the stupid & goofy comedic scenes...Nevertheless, I can\'t help, but it\'s all laid out randomly without the manga author thinking carefully. Heck! Most of the plot twists has made the most ridiculous & stupid plot holes that I\'m unable to ignore them.e.g. Hina\'s mother is one of the most irresponsible beings I\'ve ever seen in this medium. Stealing the Ballot without thinking about the dangers her daughter will face once Hina have it. I mean, she gave her thinking she has full plot armor right?Yes and no! She could\'ve told Hina all about SSU & Alcia\'s origins because I\'m sure a 12-year-old has the ability to remember and understand what she\'s saying. Instead all her mother taught her was this stupid advice: ""If you fall in love, spread your legs and don\'t let them escape!"" So everything happened in ep1 is all Hina\'s mother\'s fault...😑The anime seems to be heavy dialogue/exposition dump when it comes to revealing the plot twists happening in it. It\'s like In/Spectre, but 100x worse for many changed scenes from original manga are favoured in supposedly finishing fast before its running airtime.Heck! Even uncomfortable fanservice scenes could\'ve been omttied and replaced with important info existing from the manga, especially ep11 where that cabin fever scene didn\'t need to happen but it did & ruined Jail\'s serious conversation with his dad regarding the Aces. The way they look has been omitted in favour of unnecessary & uncomfortable groping scenes. Mind you this 5-minute long scene doesn\'t exist in the original source. Nevertheless,...BEING GROPED AGAINST ONE\'S OWN WILL DOESN\'T COUNT AS ECCHI. THAT\'S NOT SEXY. 👊Oh! Over-padding dialogue is the worst crime any writer could do because I get it\'s to fill up and max out the 22-min time duration...Ep 20 is the full proof of having the most over-padding dialogue. I mean Hina watched that video so why does Licht keep on reminding her that Ballot grants wishes?! Either he has amnesia, Hina has amnesia or both! Da-dum! 🤦...it feels tiring since you already know what they\'re thinking and planning to do especially Sonohara and Douan\'s anime-exclusive arc. Boy! There were so many dilly-dallying and repetitive words made by the over-padded dialogue/script. 😩ANIMATIONNow that\'s related to this, many important serious scenes are completely changed due to this anime studio being their 3rd project that supposedly it\'s for finishing convenience. Of course I should be glad there are no ripping clothes by enemies portrayed in the manga, but the anime seem obviously have censorship especially in ep9 where Licht does his killing again. Heard Blu-ray never get upgrades at all so it\'s no point purchasing if you\'re wanting good quality animation regardless of the messed up plot/storytelling.Nevertheless, the art is fine to look at. Many close-ups are consistent. It\'s only when they animate some important scenes far away from screen POV that you notice they\'re really finishing fast under pressure before the episode is needed to be aired.ENJOYMENTYes, I\'m sure I turned my brain off/trying not to use my brain to enjoy this series for anime/manga isn\'t meant to be realistic. However, this series depends so much on ridiculous stuff that I\'m unable to take its story seriously for I felt mixed feelings at that time. Not to mention, obvious problematic shounen tropes in this series doesn\'t help lessen the ridiculousness; instead, it amplifies and has made me feeling more frustrated after each episode.Yes, you must have your beliefs suspended while watching this entire series; if not, you\'ll be feeling 9:1 ratio of frustration & enjoyment respectively. 🙁OVERALLI only recommend this series if you\'re into ""So Bad It\'s Good""or Trainwreck entertainment. Unless you\'ve the strength to ignore the characters turning on a dime randomly and messed up concepts of Count being thrown completely out of window, be my guess.I kept watching because I thought it\'ll get better especially the Time Travelling Arc. Unfortunately, I received splitting headaches, lost brain cells, and my expectations being shattered to smithereens once I finished them completely. This is not how you do a prologue for season 1. Dr Stone and Fire Force are the actual worthy ones to portray padding-less dialogue/script.I believe the only reason I kept going was because of Jail, the only character that never bothers me except when he too suffered from over-padding dialogue. Not to mention, the speculative fiction concept, including Licht\'s past friends having to die regardless doing that is pointess for them, hits close to home/reality check. And yet, these weren\'t enough to make me rate this series higher than it is.If only the series has been made under a convenient schedule (I don\'t care if it takes 5 years in the making like Jobless Reincarnation) and maybe deserve a few breaks like what A3!, Balance Unlimited, etc. did in genuinely wanting to improve animation quality, then this series would\'ve been rated the same as GOHS and BU by me.The sound and animation quality are rated as fair for it\'s neither bad nor memorable. It\'s just at an okay range though there\'s little to remember genuine serious scenes in my head.To me, this series has gone down in history as either the Best Worst Anime I\'ve ever seen (SBIG term) or the most infamous series that\'ll get GEEK TOYS being looked down and underestimated by many blind viewers if they were to have a new series to adapt someday. May their next series have consistent and meaningful and easy-to-follow storytelling and have luck of not to be chosen for another questionable series to adapt.The best self-made proverb to describe this series:""Too many ingredients spoil the broth."" - RK my verdict...You know the saying of ""Too many cooks spoil the broth.""? Don\'t get me wrong. I\'ve read good reviews and a professional reviewer at ANN whom I still wonder if he\'s immune to all kinds of frustrating plot holes & characters\' random behaviour without common sense.Heck! I\'m still shocked that this series has 100+ people worked on it, mainly the ones working key animators & background. I can assure you I appreciate these people\'s efforts for making an anime isn\'t easy & they get way less pay than the production committee. BUT! I can\'t un-see the many wrongs happening within the storytelling range.To those loving this series by rating it above 6, I can see your POV on why this series has made you buy the source material. Hence, let\'s be ""I love what I love and you love what you love and no hate get involve"". Ok! Now back to that said proverb...The manga series is surprisingly written by only one author. I\'ve ""sneaked in"" to see the early arcs right after watching an episode) while there\'s unfortunate stuff that really happened in the manga, mainly with main protagonist Licht forcing a girl\'s legs apart of main heroine Hina & groping on Soldier Girl Lynn, the anime adaptation is written by the same scriptwriter of Isuca & Rail Wars!, which are infamously have bad scriptwriting.But! I try to give this scriptwriter the benefit of doubt...Unfortunately, the anime becomes 100x more illogical, inconsistent & offensive to me. Actually, this series is still suffering from the Problematic Shounen Battle Tropes & the anime makes it 100x more problematic than in the manga. I believe the categorization below will help you read and understand clearly.CHARACTERSUnfortunately, everyone except Jail turn on a dime randomly for plot progression & suspence convenience. This is where I get disappointed for I was expecting coherent character development for every character. The dialogue and actions of some main characters contradict their emphasized goals that this kind of writing is lazy & offensive for these characters have the worst stereotyped DID/bipolar that\'s indirectly insulting towards real-life people having it. Lynn suffers from it, but she\'s a secondary character so I\'m not bothered about that with her. The primary ones I\'m bothered are Licht, Nana & Hina.Think about it.Nana & Licht are OVER 300+ YEARS OLD!; yet, they act like they didn\'t expect their enemies to come back at them in EP 8. So the first 7 episodes, why are they living peacefully or acting blissfully unaware of the ugly history?Also, EP 18 & 19 sees Licht going after the Alcian Army first then SSU.Proof with Nana saying in ep18:""After 300 years of regret, Licht\'s decision is to take on Alcia. To fight the entire army all by himself...""Again! Why does Nana looked so surprised he\'s going towards the SSU HQ? Those words of hers prove her nonsensical personality.I mean if she knew about that, why does she look so oblivious/dumb when Hina told her he\'s heading towards the army?! Nana looking surprised hearing Hina\'s words proved that she turns on a dime for cheap suspense or has amnesia or suffers from ""women/girls are always dumb"" problematic shounen trope... 😩It\'s like she and Licht were goofing off just for comedy & fanservice timing. Serious storytelling has been wasted by being replaced by those kind of ridiculous scenes. This is why I can\'t see any balance tonal shift in this series because the seriousness of SSU & Alcia\'s origins got overwhelmed by the incoherent and convoluted random comedic behaviours of the main characters.I mean, after watching EP 11, I wonder why they\'ve been keeping a very dangerous secret about the Demon Abyss (attack helicopter) & SSU from Jail & Hina & Lynn. I thought they trust them enough, but no! It\'s for building suspence & plot twist convenience happening in EP 9! That\'s not how you build suspence/plot twist value for this kind of method is offensively nonsensical regarding them having inconsistent personalities! 🤦I did turn my brain off when I notice the first few episodes are illogical in terms of characters turning on a dime randomly, but subconsciously, I feel like it\'s one of the most frustrating dialogue/screenwriting I\'ve ever seen.Oh! Hina becomes one of the worst written main heroines I\'ve ever seen in this medium because of the ""cursed turn on a dime"" concept, her only character development is becoming a sex maniac/obsessed baby-maker. Worst is that she hasn\'t state her age at all (not even in the manga too) and she forgets very scary events happened to her 1) punched & sexually assaulted by a corrupt Alcian soldier, 2) has a gun to her head TWICE, 3) forgets #1 that she forgot to hide Ballot in many cloths (ep21) all in the name of suspence & plot twist convenience...🙄I know she\'s cute and pure for the target demographic, but when she\'s like that, she\'s the most boring.

Anime ruim, desenho ruim, história ruim e apelativa com um doido que malha perna e fica pulando. Aquele filme do Justin Timberlake ""In Time"" já contou essa história anos atrás e não foi tão ruim assim. Não consegui assistir tudo pq tive que ir pro hospital fazer ressonância, mas mesmo que eu pudesse ter assistido o resto eu não desperdiçaria um tempo tão  precioso da minha vida, ao contrário disso, iria fazer qualquer coisa mais útil, tipo olha pro nada durante o...tempo restante. tempo restante.', ""Oh dear, what I have just watched...

BUT, in the very first 3 episodes there are characters that doesn't notices things that shine like the sun in the face, like really? dude, obviously there is a problem with some of those numbers, and you don't even blink an eye? This and VARIOUS...other problems with the unexplained attachment of Hina to Licht in a few moments of interaction, the way that Hina is so oblivious about everything in the world, even after have traveled like 44000 kms... How do you even put a freaking filler episode in the 3rd episode? (ok, they presented 2 characters, but dude, how unimpressive is their appearance for gods sake). In short: plot holes everywhere, things that are not easily explainable in the near or far future.Art: 6Battles got a passing mark as they are well animated and have nice choreography, well done there. Character design is in the meh side, the male MC is really wacky in shape and such, the female MC is cute, the cow character is ok. Nice drawings in general.Sound: 5The opening is meh, ending completely skip-able, sound effects are nice, but not impressive at all.Characters: 1Oh boi... these characters are generic AF. OP protagonist that is in the perv side like Meliodas or Roshi, with wacky design when perv and badass design in battle mode, did a nice thing in the second episode, but it sure is weird to show everyone that you are the guy that they are looking for so easily, but for some reason he didn't convinced me as a well written character. Don't get me started with Hina... she's just... how a kid can walk 30 kms a day with no paved ways hmmmmmmm... during all this time she was searching for something but she didn't knew the basics of how the world works... yeeeeeaaaaah suuuuuuure. The first enemy is just so baaaad (the fake white star), gods! I cringed every time he had screen time.Enjoyment: 1So, there is supposed to be ecchi (a lot of it), but all I saw was a guy violating girls as he pleased... no panty shots, no good angles, no female enjoying the ero moment... I don't like that dude. Just a guy touching girls for reasons, or for being rejected ... but still... WACKY AF.

However, the plot is always lacking and the power scaling is just terrible, one of the worst ones I saw. You're told that some numbers decide your power for it to be completely useless afterwards, and people pull powers out of thin air for the sake of plot or do completely unnecessary and uncharacterstical things (as you would be able to see in episode 22...in one of the villains...).

Characters do things that contradicts their established character. So let me rephrase, this anime is a dumpster fire after episode 12.

Plunderer goes a different direction.Good show hidden behind several episodes of ridiculous unnecessary fan service.Good world building, some unique ideas are explored. Perhaps they could have done more with the 24 episodes they had. Fantasy/ sci-fi with a good dose of drama.  The drama is stronger than the romance which they seem to fumble with a fair bit.Above average characters and depth.  Not brilliant but not bad.Interesting ethical dilemmas. Sometimes a bit forced.  I'm not sure if I gave it an 8 because it...was good or my expectations from the first 4 episodes was so low that the show surprised me.  The show was suprising in many places so if you are tired of predictable shows this is actualy a good choice. was good or my expectations from the first 4 episodes was so low that the show surprised me.

Fortunately for me, it fits all my taste. I mean, I love all sorts of animes, but sometimes I just wanna watch a badass wreck shit up with beautiful women slobbing over him.There are basically two MC\'s. The first is our hero Rihito or Licht. He\'s awesome. He\'s badass. Not just that, he\'s actually got layers to his character. The show does a good job bringing out those layers and you see his emotions and why he is the way he is. Also, he is NOT OP- well maybe he...is but he shows he can hurt and possibly die. Anyways, he rocks.The second MC is Hina. She\'s....the weakness in this anime, unfortunately. She doesn\'t add much to the story except she\'s cute and cries a lot. Seriously, they could replace her with any other girl character and it would be just fine. She is very dull. You don\'t know much about her, because she doesn\'t say anything worthwhile, or do anything worthwhile for that matter. She\'s  a knock-off brand of Elizabeth from Nantsu no Taizai.The supporting cast is pretty good.Iron Jail is kind of one dimensional, but eh- he does his thing. You get guys like him in every anime. Basically, he\'s the guy who ""may"" be on par with the hero, but is blinded by his own ideology.There\'s two side character that I forgot the name of. They\'re there for humor. If they didn\'t exist, the story wouldn\'t be any different.Then there\'s Nana. She\'s freaking AWESOME and the true beauty of the show. She\'s hot, sexy, dependable, and yeah- her power is OP but she doesn\'t even care to use it. My type of girl and the one the MC should be with. If you watch the show you\'ll no doubt agree.As for the antagonist- errrr don\'t really know who that is yet (and I\'m 20 episodes in). I mean, there are bad guys, but they\'re not bad, and we\'re not sure what anyone\'s plan is so like...yeah. Even the supposed big baddy name Shermann, is kind of a written weakly. When he\'s introduced, he seems like a great character, but they just don\'t give him enough screen time.OOOKK so for the story itself? It\'s a solid A in my book. It\'s different. It\'s fresh. It\'s mysterious enough. I like it, and honestly I don\'t know what will happen.I don\'t want to spoil any more other than that, so I recommend you give this anime a shot. I would say by episode 6 or 7 if you still don\'t like it then you can drop it. For me, a solid 8.5/10 over all. is but he shows he can hurt and possibly die. Anyways, he rocks.The second MC is Hina.

In addition, the Waste War that broke out in the past 300 years ago, wasn't really that clear, because aside from knowing that the war is fought between humans, killing each other for the primary purpose of eliminating useless people from the world to prevent overpopulation (due to the scarce resources earth have to feed humanity), yet it wasn't specified well who they...are really fighting, who is winning, and why are the major countries destroyed, like who destroyed them (is it humans or is it this Althing).However, the anime itself is pretty amusing. It may lack in the part of attracting audience in wanting to watch more, it also lacks in the part that provides those who watch a relaxation feeling at the end, but then overall its exciting, a little fan service, and also thrilling plot story. Especially at the end leaving an cliffhanging scene for the audience to expect a second season. The anime ended well, its not as if it ended in such a way that cause frustration or irritation.

Quickly, a vote was cast, this vote was that humans shall stop using the power of the nuclear weapons and it was so. However, as time passes by the earth's resources are becoming more and more scarce causing war to break out, which then they made another vote, it is a vote that set the time on when the true war will begin, this is called the Waste War, a war made to eliminate humanity to stop overpopulation, to kill the many and save the less.

But after watching through this anime, episode by episode I was honestly disappointed.Story: 9:10Truthfully, the story and plot is unique and very good, there is not much to say really about the story.Art: 3/10The art in the beginning of the anime was quite good, it was bright and vibrant and if I were to only of watched around 12 episodes of this, this rating would...beWAY higher, but after episode 12, the art quality kinda deteriorated to the point where it was absolute garbage, I\'ve never seen an anime with such inconsistent art quality in my life, the fight scenes later on in the anime had every corner cut in the art, each scene and cut had entirely different shades of colour from the one before and the LINE art was drawn awfully later on, I might seem quite negative about the art but I was completely shocked at the state the anime got itself in.Sound: 6/10The opening sounded quite nice although a bit cliche with the electric guitar and all trying to set the scene and make everything look epic, the ED was nice as well, not much else to say.Character: 5/10The characters were just downright mediocre, you had the very edgy looking overpowered cliche nicknamed ""The Legendary Ace of Flashing Strikes/Red Baron"" Pervert syndrome infected protagonist. And then you had the defenseless blue haired shy girl called Hina which after getting to know Licht magically turned into a kuudere and wanted to have his babies after one episode, like seriously? There\'s almost no possible circumstance or way that could happen in real life. You also had the busty large oppai tanned girl Nana which used to call Licht, ""Bro Bro"" And wanted to marry him when she was a child.Enjoyment: 7/10After all my negativity, I kind of actually enjoyed this series, not because of the Characters, art or anything like that, but I because it had quite funny comedy in my opinion, which is like a double edged sword for this series, it takes a serious good looking plot with plenty of potential to be something great and kinda splats a ton of comedy and jokes with poory designed characters and art in it hoping to get somewhere with the audience.Conclusion:The anime, for what it is, is fine, it was enjoyable enough for me to continue watching it, but I really wanted to enjoy other aspects of this anime other than the comedy. It took a unique storyline with great potential to become something amazing and just kinda splattered it with poor and cliche characters, garbage art, and miserable character development, and pretty much everything else with this anime.6/10 beWAY higher, but after episode 12, the art quality kinda deteriorated to the point where it was absolute garbage, I\'ve never seen an anime with such inconsistent art quality in my life, the fight scenes later on in the anime had every corner cut in the art, each scene and cut had entirely different shades of colour from the one before and the LINE art was drawn awfully later on, I might seem quite negative about the art but I was completely shocked at the state the anime got itself in.Sound: 6/10The opening sounded quite nice although a bit cliche with the electric guitar and all trying to set the scene and make everything look epic, the ED was nice as well, not much else to say.Character: 5/10The characters were just downright mediocre, you had the very edgy looking overpowered cliche nicknamed ""The Legendary Ace of Flashing Strikes/Red Baron"" Pervert syndrome infected protagonist.

Not to mention cliché, confusing, and boring for the most part. At the least, I'm not surprised the anime is rated near a 6-point, but sadly it's worse than that. And as usual, a portion of the Japanese Animation budget is preserved for unworthy shows such as Plunderer, a name which seemed an irony to the content shown on the screen. Enough intro, let's rate.---Story - 3/10 - I've seen and read much fantasy-based fiction, and this is one of the worst stories I have watched. Dunno of the...manga it's based on, but I don't have to read the comic itself to say the plot is third-rate all the way. From what I can derive, it's simply a big mess of pre-existing ideas, insincere emotions, and excessive fanservice to deceive viewers of an already bad anime.Fanservice is becoming a major problem with most of the bad anime productions taking in stories from the gutters which flimsy creativity has to provide. I'm not saying Japan produces no good anime these days, but the bad ones are getting easier to make with better-animation technology, making the overall situation worse. The anime is mostly intended for a male audience. But the fanservice in this show is simply disgusting.---Art - 5/10 - Colourful backgrounds and all that, but that's a method to be found in animes that try to deviate the viewers from its plot and characters, the latter which have nothing to show here. Nothing amazing to speak in aesthetics.Character designs are very generic - 'cool-looking' dudes and 'cute' girls with no originality. I wonder if the anime production, or in a part, the original illustrator himself put any effort or research into any originality. The writer must've watched/read a lot of bad manga/anime to arrive at such dullness. One does not always need 'cool-characters', let alone a whole cast of them, to make a story good. That just shows how shallow this whole production is.---Sound - 4/10 - Nothing new. Very generic once again. The usual Background Music was mundane and you'll see the semblance in similar anime.I'm furious at certain points when the music tries to draw in cheesy emotions in moments that are so predictable, a fellow with a decent mind would simply quit the show.---Character - 2/10 - Hands down, one of the worst cast of characters in the fantasy genre. The protagonist is a sleazy degenerate who shows himself as a cool, capable fellow, when the situation needs. It almost describes the bad bipolar stereotype seen in most of such quality anime.The initial shots of the first episode itself gave me the low hopes for this anime, and the same became lower during that school Arc after around Episode 10.The story is partially-based and driven by the theme of militarism, and Japan itself had its own share from the past. It simply shames the nation's past when the show elaborates the statement - 'Army that doesn't kill?' in those episodes, where bloodshed was shown without much restraint. I mean, Imperial Japan laid waste to most of East and South-east Asia during WW2. Even their present-day JSDF has prestige. All this anime had to show was a bunch of non-connectable characters, who believe militarism is fun. This shows how disconnected the story is to decent storytelling and the effort needed for it. The disillusion of the basic sense of realism is in its peak, and the only thing that keeps the last adhesive among the audience is the Fanservice, which is pointlessly cancerous and stupid.---Enjoyment - 3/10 - I won't say there were no instances of humour and fun, but all that is nullified by the cliché tropes, uninteresting and confusing plot, extreme use of fanservice, crummy and insincere emotional scenes, conceited/unoriginal character designs, high predictability, and in the end an overpowered/Deus ex Machina/pervert protagonist who was simply dull.Enough said.---Overall - 3/10 - This kind of show reduces the IQ of the decent audience, leading to degeneracy, with ideas of deceit and insincerity thrown over creativeness, bellowing a message of insult to the hopes of good content that's produced in Japan and the world. manga it's based on, but I don't have to read the comic itself to say the plot is third-rate all the way.

I don't know if that says more about this studio or others because other anime manages to look a lot more realistic and convincing with the same 2D constraints. Take any random anime from A-1 pictures, or Kyoto Animation and compare it to this and you'll see what I mean.Dialogue audio suffers from frequent clipping due to poor recording/ mastering (seriously they need to get better sound engineers). I mean it's very noticeable when it happens, and it happens practically every episode. Usually whenever a character yells.Characters in this are really generic all around; none of them are particularly interesting. The main protagonist is your standard over-powered fantasy character. Their character arcs are practically non-existent even if it seems like at certain points their gonna change, they never really do. You do get to learn about the characters and their backstories as it progresses, but not much happens beyond that. The fight scenes are also pretty predictable and average most of the time.Honestly, I can't recommend this anime knowing there are far greater ones out there that are much more worthy of your time.

My euphoria suddenly waned here and hoping the next episodes are better.Episodes 6 - The pacing and...plot got worse.  But the ending hints a milestone in the MC\'s backstory.  I\'m starting to feel bored at this point.Then episode 7 came and just killed off my enthusiasm.

It does have an intriguing enough premise to potentially warrant pushing through, though for me I could only bear it up to episode 10 before I realized the show had jumped the shark a few too many times for my liking.Each character is a cardboard character. The MC is the misunderstood good guy; the female lead is the unconditionally good-hearted and naive baka; the other female lead is an alternative version of the unconditionally good-hearted and naive baka; the guy named Jail is basically Javert but with typical mannerisms of anime characters who...wear glasses; and the other characters are basically just marginally more shallow than the main ones.

I thought to myself, ""This is a pretty unique and interesting premise. I\'m quite excited to see this!"" I even brushed off some of the absurd ecchi that almost gave me whiplash not even 5 minutes into the 1st episode. I don\'t mind ecchi and I figured that there might be at least some in this show. However, I should have turned this show off that very moment and I will explain to you why.So let\'s be...honest. The premise is very unique and interesting. The idea of a world where people\'s lives are dictated by the number of times they did something or something happening to them is enough to catch a lot of people\'s attention. However, unfortunately you will not see much focus on an actual story as you will see a self insert fantasy fulfillment tour. I don\'t care about self insert fantasy fulfillment, but when making sure that Licht\'s greatest desire of being lusted over by ""hot"" girls is finally satiated and making that the focus for like 3 OR 4 WHOLE EPISODES of a 24 EPISODE anime, I can\'t help but wonder if the story will be able to move in a reasonable direction. I\'m assuming based on about 85% of the reviews and the overall rating that the answer is no.It\'s like a horny 12 year old boy wrote the story for this anime. I mean, not much of anything of substance has even taken place (as far as I\'ve gone at least) except for some exposition in the beginning, but no, we need an episode dedicated to a cooking competition between 2 girls so they can compete for Licht\'s love. The story continues to take pit stop after pit stop to ensure that 1) the audience sees some fanservice and 2) Licht, despite his overtly depraved behaviour towards young women and he\'s otherwise dull character, is the man who steals the hearts of any woman he wants to. And what does any of that explain about the war, the number system, the ballot system, the Aces, or really any of the other elements that the story could be touching upon? Nothing. It would be one thing if this was just one episode, but unfortunately I don\'t have the luxury of giving you such reassurance.I have not and will not finish this show because I simply can\'t watch the first 7 episodes of an anime (or any show for that matter) that is, in essence, utter trash and continue like nothing happened.

Throughout all 24 episodes of this show, I could not get one thing off of my mind, and that is the absolutely uncanny resemblance this anime has to the ""Seven Deadly Sins (SDS),"" or ""Nanatsu no Taizai."" Girl who travelled a long distance tries to find a certain guy, finds him and he saves her, they travel to do some adventuring shit, blah blah whatever you read the synopsis.What makes this significantly worse than SDS? Well, everything, for starters, but mainly the absolutely cheesy characters and random plot points that...will never be brought up ever again. Average animation along with a forgettable soundtrack did not help it either.Characters:To start, let\'s talk about the characters. The MC, Licht is literally Meliodas\' clone. Unneeded perversion, happy-go-lucky even with a questionable background, and supposedly ""overpowered"" according to everyone in the anime. If you didn\'t like Meliodas, you won\'t like Licht either (and vice versa). Hina and Lyne were basically just Elizabeth and Diane, only there to suck up to Licht and give him good-night kisses, nothing else about them is noteworthy.You can compare Jail to Ban, the guy who wanted to beat the living daylight out of Licht at first but all of a sudden decided ""Oh yeah, we\'re friends now"" after giving each other a hard roundhouse kick. Jail was also just Kirito-in-hiding in Plunderer, considering how he completely defies the whole ""\'higher Count = stronger\' system"" they have in place, demonstrated when he beats up Sonohara (an ""Ace"", by the way) with 1 ""Count.""The romance was (for the most part) unnecessary as well, with each character having the hots for another and the viewers being constantly reminded of it for no reason at all. While I am a complete sucker for romance, the shitty dialogue that is used to convey these feelings will make you want to regret the concept of romance in media ever being brought up during a Greek Seminar 3 thousand years ago. Although, there are a few heartwarming scenes between Licht and Hina.Story:The story was quite interesting and the adventure concept was quite fascinating, coming from someone who somewhat enjoyed SDS. The whole ""Count"" system, Licht having a negative count, lower counts have to obey higher counts, the list goes on... Got all that noted down? Perfect, now be prepared to throw it all out the window after the first episode.This is not even a joke, Geek Toys literally decided that all of these plot points are absolutely useless and by the 24th episode, you won\'t even remember any of this. They\'re also defied dozens of times, using Jail and his Kirito god-mode that was mentioned above as an example.TLDR; If you liked or are a fan of Seven Deadly Sins/Nanastu no Taizai and want an anime just like it (quite literally a mirror  anime), don\'t be afraid to give Plunderer a shot.

Tottoko Hamtarou Movie 1: Ham-Ham Land Daibouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7329/Tottoko_Hamtarou_Movie_1__Ham-Ham_Land_Daibouken,"['Story: 6 (Decent)It was about them all going to this magical hamster world where there was a legend about a sunflower seed that could let you talk to humans that Hamtaro wanted so he could speak with Laura who forgot about him on her birthday.It was cute, most of the movie seemed like filler since the main plot wasn\'t as complex as it could have been, but it was fun filler.Art: 10 (I loved it!)It was cute, the characters had a lot of energy, emotions were clear, there was this one scene though where Hamtaro falls onto this trampoline. But he sorta just...teleported up and down for a second instead of actually bouncing!Though, that\'s clearly a nit pick.The settings, especially the magical land they travel to, are so atmospheric and almost a little creepy at times with as dark the colour scheme is. In a weird contrast for how happy all the hamster there are shown being. I liked it.The villain looked almost like a cat at first. I was wrong, but because of how dark the setting seemed to be I instantly assumed this whole world was just a trap to lure in hamsters for him to eat.I was thinking of Coraline I guess. I mean it makes sense. First Hamtaro is having trouble at home, then he\'s whisked away to a world built to make hamsters like him happy. Both worlds looked fun and happy with a sort of dark twist to their designs.I feel the comparison works.Sound: 8 (Very good)There was a lot of singing through out the movie. There was even a hamster idol group which I thought was hilarious.Welll, the songs weren\'t exactly play list worthy, but I still really liked them.Character: 4 (decent)I had a tough time figuring out what score. I think it\'s clear by now that I like the movie, but none of the characters really grew or changed.Hamtaro just sorta has a falling out with his human, Laura, he\'s mad at her, then the movie just sorta ends with him going back to normal.I doubt that counts as a spoiler. I mean, do you really expect a Hamtaro movie to not have a happy ending? Even if it does a good job faking you out you should still expect that happy ending to come anyways.As for the other characters, they were all there through out the movie but they sorta fade into the background.Actually, now that I think about it, they felt less like characters and more like a group of mindless robots following Hamtaro around. I think it was all that speaking in unison stuff they did. Hamtaro was the only one aside from the new characters that actually stood out.As for the new characters. I loved them. The Hamster ninjas were cute, the villain was pretty funny, then there was the girl, I can\'t recall her name, I skipped around the movie for a few seconds trying to find it but... I don\'t think she ever introduces herself.Odd... And the Hamtaro Wiki page for this movie didn\'t even have it. I might see it the next time I watch the movie.She\'s was probably the coolest character, I\'d say more but the things I really want to say feel like spoilers even if it isn\'t exactly plot related. Though look forward to the end of the movie. She\'s a candidate for most random line of dialogue ever. Like, what the heck? XDThe one thing I feel like I can say is, she\'s one of this worlds guardians and she sorta acts as the villains opposite. Look forward to seeing some pretty cool magic from her!୧☉□☉୨ I want to say it but I won\'t say it, because of spoilers, but she\'s to thank for best scene in the movie. Like holy crap. I bet the animators had a blast on this thing.Enjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)I get distracted easily. If an anime can\'t hold my interest I think to myself, ""I\'ll just pause it for a second and check something."" Or, ""Now I have a song stuck in my head, hold on, I gotta visit youtube for a second."" Or, ""Should I finish that quest in Skyrim? I\'ll watch the rest later.""Didn\'t happen one time during this movie. So it must have been pretty good, right?Would most certainly watch again.Overall: 9 (Great)That thing about the rest of the main cast turning into background robots kinda bugs me or it would have been ten here too. I mean this world was so creative and there was so much they packed into it, maybe they just didn\'t have the time to give everyone a chance in the spotlight.So.. I guess it\'s more of a nit pick if anything, especially considering how many characters there are.I hope this anime has an official subbed version.

Youkai Watch Movie 5: Forever Friends,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37969/Youkai_Watch_Movie_5__Forever_Friends,"['The main thought i had after watching Forever Friends was ""What was the point?"" Given it features a new protagonist (to the point of being a whole third of Yokai Watch 4), I was obviously wondering what different direction and tone LEVEL-5 would take to make it stand out from the goofy Keita era and the gritty Shadowside era. The answer: it\'s just more Shadowside. And if you\'re like me and hate all of the ""Enma stuff"" (which is all of the ""cool anime guy"" characters and swords and stuff) that\'s been defining the series for ages now, you\'re going to hate this.The movie...starts off promising. The plot works, the initial conflict is humble, and the three protagonists are all likable. However, it\'s shoved aside halfway through in favor of powerful men/spirit/demons fighting and getting more and more powerful just for the sake of spectacle. At least, when Shadowside did all of this, it was new and experimental. However, this movie is just more of the same (sometimes literally reused ideas) to the point where I wonder why it\'s separate from Shadowside. The focus being pushed away form Shin in the second half doesn\'t do it any favors for anyone hoping to learn more about the Yokai Watch 4 protagonist, either.I feel like the point of Yokai Watch is the many yokai that inspirit people with their quirky traits, but the series has since pushed them to the wayside for ideas that aren\'t nearly as unique. This movie is no exception, and your enjoyment of it will depend on how you feel about the Enma stuff. starts off promising.

The entire feel of everything is so bad except the voice-acting, I'm quite enjoying voices and some of the music here and there.Whereas the novel is a supernatural thriller with some shoujo ai, the anime feels like a slice-of-life comedy adventure romp.The long-distance shots of CGI are OK but it is far too low quality to be used for the supernatural entities, the scene loses all...credibility when they close up on poor CGI models. Movement in general, even in 2D shots, is quite janky. When things aren't moving the art is passable, but again doesn't capture the atmosphere portrayed by the novel at all - some things look completely different to what they're supposed to.It really is a shame how a fantastic series can get pushed into obscurity by garbage adaptations. credibility when they close up on poor CGI models.

For whatever reason, the anime adaptation of Urasekai Picnic is plagued with issues through and through. From the moment the first PV dropped I should have been alarmed, the audio mixing was completely messed up, and the animation quality was subpar at best. Still, I tried to convince myself that it's just a bad PV, surely the actual show would be at least decent right?I gotta start with the first thing that came to mind when I started watching the adaptation: Audio. The audio mixing...is awful. I think I get they want to do a creepy vibe, but even that doesn't work and most of the time the whole experience ends up being uncomfortable, like having loud sound effects drown out important dialogue or background noise overriding the whole scene. Music placement is also baffling at times, not that the score is any bad, but the placement truly leaves much to be desired with the BGM sometimes starting too early or too late, or ending too early or too late. The OP and ED are fine though. Maybe a bit too cheerful for my liking, but the days of having an actually scary OP for your horror anime has long past. (Even Higurashi has some generic pop OP now) The animation is subpar at best. The monsters are all janky, but not in a creepy sorta way, more in an ugly PS2-era CG kind of way.I honestly don't know what production troubles the studio was under (perhaps doing 4 different shows in the same season counted towards it), but some of the creative choices can't be blamed on a rigid production schedule alone. Very odd choices like rearranging chapters beyond their intended order, which results in many plot holes as well as strange lapses in character development and pacing, really make this such a mess. Especially since they've added a few anime original chapters to compensate (?) for the gaps in between. I don't know.If there's anything that's salvageable in this mess, it's the voice acting. Not because the performances are particularly groundbreaking or anything, it's a thoroughly average performance from your usual gamut of A-list seiyuu, but it's because you can now imagine in your head how the girls would sound like when reading the novel or manga.The reason I'm being generous with my score is because1. Kozakura is super cute2. The anime introduced me to the (far) superior novel and manga, of which I am currently enjoying.3. Watching this and Tatoeba Dungeon and contrasting the mains is hilarious.4. The end of episode skits where Toriko and Sorawo goof around in a bar is the sole good anime original thing.There. 4 points. Done and dusted.Thing is, in this relatively packed season, there is nothing Urasekai Picinic does that isn't already better accomplished by a different show. If I wanted horror-mystery, I have Gekidol. If I wanted yuri hijinks, I have World Witches. If I wanted something with weird monsters, I have that Yuuki Aoi Spider Anime. If I wanted comedy, I have Higurashi GOU.If I wanted a show that airs on Monday night made by Lidenfilms starring Kayano Ai and Hanamori Yumiri as the mains with the former playing a more confident foil to the latter's lack-of-self esteem character and both being in a romantic relationship...I have Tatoeba Dungeon.4/10 is awful.

Both in a good way and a bad way. There is so much the creator can do around with fantasies and can make it as ""crazy"" as possible.Urasekai Picnic is an anime about traveling to an alternate world called ""Otherside"" where they fight off weird creatures while searching for their friend. I watched this anime since it has the ""Shoujo Ai"" listed in its genres because I love Shoujo Ai and it is one of my favorite genres and I expected somewhat romance but I didn\'t get it, even though I felt it. The CGI used here is...somewhat decent, the studio made long-distance shots with the main characters in CGI for the first 6 episodes then stopped for 2 episodes and went at it again.One of the policies I like to follow while rating animes on this website is how much I enjoyed it and how much I enjoyed the plot. Some of the parts in this were scary. Even though there were monsters/ghost-like figures in the ""Otherworld"", it is almost weird that almost none of them completely creeped me out.One more thing I noticed is how the US Marines in the anime spoke english in a Japanese accent, it felt very weird to hear them say their mother tongue that way.The characters were really cute and interesting and they made the most out of working with each other. One of the things I would like to say is that the two main girls say that they\'re second years in college but they look like they are not even third year in high school which I found kind of weird.The OP gave me a vibe of Naruto for some reason and the ED is amazing, my favorite ending of Winter 2021. The song used in the ending, ""You and me"" was very touching and pretty nice to listen to after watching a cliffhanger episode.I\'ll summarize the main aspects of this in some sentences -Story (8/10) - Pretty good pacing and nice episode cliffhangers. I love how they make it super clear - what they are doing, where they are going, and what they will do. The decisions taken by the main characters in this are agreeable and lead forward to a better story.Art (7/10) - Pretty but I felt the long-distance CGI shots were a bit lazy but another CGI was pretty well made.Sound (9/10) - As I said, my favorite ending of the season; this anime has good OSTs and music. Also, the voice acting is on point and pretty good.Character (9/10) - Characters were very cute and super compatible and they supported each other the most.Enjoyment (9/10) - I enjoyed this anime a lot and it was pretty fun to watch every week on Monday, starting my new day. Most episodes were enjoyable and very nice.Overall rating - (8.4/10).P.S. - if you like fantasies with a cute relationship in them, watch this. somewhat decent, the studio made long-distance shots with the main characters in CGI for the first 6 episodes then stopped for 2 episodes and went at it again.One of the policies I like to follow while rating animes on this website is how much I enjoyed it and how much I enjoyed the plot.

I expected some action combined with sci-fi and of course a lot of Yuri. But I was completely wrong!The series focuses on Sorawo and Toriko, two young women who discover the “Otherside” of their own world. It is a dangerous world where many monsters from ghost stories come to life. There is always a secret door or item that leads to the other world. Sometimes it could be in an old...apartment or at other times the access can be made possible by pressing a certain combination in an elevator, even a special item like a hat could be a trigger.Both of our main characters have different reasons for entering the ""Otherside"". Toriko, a very beautiful girl with waist-length gold-colored hair, is looking for her missing friend Satsuki. Since Toriko was taught everything about survival as a little girl, she is very good at handling weapons as well. She protects Sorawo in every dangerous situation when the ghosts want to pounce on them again. They met by chance on the ""Otherside"", but quickly realized that they are a perfectly harmonious team and should therefore undertake the actions together. Sorawo, our shy university student, has always had problems dealing with other people. The only person whom she is comfortable with is when she\'s with Toriko. She really likes Toriko and wants to be on her on side at all costs. Their relationship is very important for Sorawo who has always been interested in ghost stories. With the curiosity in mind, she also wants to find more what the ""Otherside"" is all about. Besides their own interest in the ""Otherside"", both have their hearts in the right place and are ready to save other people who are stucked there. Due to their special ability (Sorawo can detect glitches, while Toriko\'s left hand allows her to directly ""touch"" the true forms of the “Otherside\'s” entities) they are the only ones who can save these people and are even ready to put their own lives at risk.In addition to our two main characters, there are two other friends of theirs who play an important role: Kozakura and Akari. Kozakura is a young researcher who is very interested in the ""Otherside"". She buys every interesting material that Sowaro and Toriko bring back for her as a “souvenir”. Before Satsuki disappeared, she and Kozakura used to do research together on the other world. But after a while Kozakura gave up because it was too much for her to handle. Therefore, she also wants to find out what happened to Satsuki. Akari, on the other hand, attends the same university as Sorawo. She is a lively, friendly and energetic personality who is also carefree and sophisticated, not worrying what others think about her. After being relentlessly attacked by ninja cats, she came to Sorawo for help. Later it was also found that Satsuki used to be her tutor.The art is very nicely designed, especially when it comes to the transition between the two different worlds. While on their ""real"" world the sun is shining and rather a light color appears, everything is very dark and gloomy on the ""Otherside"" in terms of color. The contrast is displayed very well. The ghosts are also portrayed in a high quality, their movement and the effects are clearly visible. But I would particularly like to emphasize the few Yuri moments between Sorawo and Toriko. Their special moments always stand out, be it through the light, the background or even the sound, their relationship is definitely something unique and wholesome.Urasekai Picnic\'s OP is very energetic and powerful. It is about one of the most important things in our life: friendship. CHiCO with HoneyWorks is a perfect combination, which is also very successful here. The ED ""You & Me"" is a bit calmer and more relaxed. Back from the dangerous journey from the ""Otherside"", you just want to end the day. This song is also about another very important topic in life: love and feelings.Despite the good OP and ED selection, it is again the small details that stand out here. In the scary scenes ghost noises can be heard in the background, in the decisive scenes the tension is built up by the sound or even the up and down of an elevator scene, the sounds are very suitable everywhere.As already mentioned at the beginning, I went into this anime full of enthusiasm because of the many Yuri scenes I had hoped for. I was disappointed from this side, but the story and plot grabbed me tight. Almost every episode is about a new encounter on the ""Otherside"". Unexpected things often happen there, but that\'s exactly what makes this anime so special. You never know what to expect on the other side of the world. Perhaps we also have glitches in our world that lead somewhere else…who knows? Our world is mysterious and so is Urasekai Picnic with all its open questions. As someone who has not read anything from the novels, it would be great getting a second season that could answer all these things. Then it wouldn\'t necessarily be about the Yuri moments, but what more exciting things we can expect on the ""Otherside""! apartment or at other times the access can be made possible by pressing a certain combination in an elevator, even a special item like a hat could be a trigger.Both of our main characters have different reasons for entering the ""Otherside"".

I don’t quite get this series. It’s basically combining urban legends and putting it into a title with characters to explore these said urban legends. Oh there’s also a side “B” story where a friend is missing but it doesn’t really talk about that.Story (3):It’s quite episodic. Every episode we get a different urban legend and our two MCs explore said legend. The formula is the same; somehow the MCs get themselves into these situations naturally and they try to find their way back to their own world.And that’s literally...it. The MCs go back, the legend is done. Now next episode move on to the next one. It’s eh.Art (6):It’s a typical, production type anime art we’ve seen for the past few years. It’s nothing new. It’s not astonishingly great or horrible. Just fine.Sound (7):The OST does fit with the situation/environment well though. I quite like the ED when the episode ends. OP is quite forgettable for me.Character (4):Characters are pretty weak in my opinion. We don’t get to see much backstory, I guess. The characters don’t really grow. It seems they treat each urban legend a bit like it’s business as usual; the MCs aren’t scared at all. Even though the directors tried to put in that the MCs are scared and stuff, it doesn’t feel that way. It feels that the characters will get over the challenge and return home safely. There’s no twist or anything.Enjoyment (7):Regardless, watching this every week was bearable. It keeps my attention span long enough and it’s interesting to see the characters explore. However, this anime is not something you can binge as you’ll probably lose interest pretty quickly. Unless you’re into this kind of genre, I don’t see how one can consume all of the episodes in one sitting.Overall (6):It’s fine. Big plus on sound, meh on basically everything else.I haven’t read the source material, but I have an inkling it’s better than what’s presented in the anime. it. The MCs go back, the legend is done.

Dealing with otherworldly stuff, or as they call em. Wiggle waggles. As we follow two girls that have come together through meeting each other within this strange world, for their own reasons, one of which wanting to find their missing friend. As for how it's done, and how I am enjoy it? Let me tell you.Story:The story follows two girls exploring a strange world, both having a reason for doing such of course, as their backgrounds tie into it, but it's the interest and variety of differences within each time that they go,...is what makes it spooky, and leaves the watcher curious, and wanting to see more, to see where else it goes, but also how these two characters, and anyone else that comes in, progresses, and how the story unfolds. Following a different kind of version week by week, all the while letting us getting used to the characters, getting used to how things work, and it's well done there.It's very enjoyable and curious. The creatures that come up within the show are certainly terrifying, and the world gives off a very strange and spooky vibe. It does it's job so far, to make it very tense, along with having the feel that the characters are very much in danger each time they go in. It's no walk in the park after all. It almost feels like the characters could be trapped in that world at any moment, with how terrifying it can make itself out to be.Characters:As for the story itself, as I said, it follows these two girls, each with a different backgrounds and personality, and reasons that they have to go to this otherworld, but it's thanks to this, and thanks to that, that a friendship, and possible further bond is formed. As both develop in their own way as the show progresses, from how they feel to one another, to bringing out more out of another. It's cute, but also can be very concerning, in terms of what happens that is. But that brings interest into what could possibly happen later in the show. But it's how they mesh well together that really help shows the characters the best. Sorao can come off as sometimes calm and composed, but other times, she can come off as concerned and very protective of those she is with, which this other world plays on a lot. While Toriko can come off as a small bit of an airhead, but also someone whom is focused on her goals and very spirited. Great chemistry between the two.Art and sound:I already touched on the art a little bit, along with the sound, as the anime does a real good job of making things look spooky and terrifying. It's done through how everything all sounds and looks. From being quiet, or low sounding during certain scenes, to looking like a mysterious and foggy place in general. They also seem to make outside of that world a bit dark too, as if it's treating this show with a serious tone, but it can be bright in areas, really good mesh of colours here.I'm certainly gonna keep watching Urasekai Picnic, and you should too! is what makes it spooky, and leaves the watcher curious, and wanting to see more, to see where else it goes, but also how these two characters, and anyone else that comes in, progresses, and how the story unfolds.

The show follows two girls who, for varying circumstances, visit the other side in search of something- for Toriko, her friend that had introduced her to the other side and for Sorao, what seems like social interactions. The other side doesn’t exactly follow the rules of the world we know, with creatures dubbed by the duo as wiggle waggles to be present who essentially make...you disappear from there. The wiggle-waggles take inspiration from what seems like ghost stories with those abilities being used from said lore's. Really and truly, this anime is focused around the interactions of the main two female leads as they explore and expand their knowledge of this weird world and its constituent rules. The chemistry between these two is quite electric at times with a decent level of intimacy being shown at times and both show that they care about the other party enough to want to travel with them into the other side consistently. They each understand the other quite well from what I could understand but not enough to make it seem like their reading each other’s minds and thus be too intrusive.  The art changes between the worlds, with more down to earth styles being realized on earth and more foggy and unclear styles being utilised on the other side. It's good enough to warrant a watch if you have the time, but it's not something as of yet that I'd give priority watching.More in-depth---Story - Quite normal all things considered, feels like a most mysterious version of pokemon with how the show is structered and the absurdity that happens each episode. The rules aren't exactly well explained so raises a lot of questions and at some times straight up doesnt make sense but if you disregard these the story is fine I guess FOR THE MOMENT. Pacing for the episode are improving as some questions are being answered but not enough in my opinion. Clearly some inspiration for this story is taken from Roadside Picnic which uncannily has a similar name.Art- Art is done quite nicely, and as mentioned above switching the art styles up to distinguish the worlds is much appreciated and is probably on par for animes released in the winter 2021 season. The wiggle-waggles are quite unsettling which is a great addittion however the CGI at times can be off putting but when used discreetly is quite nice.Characters- Main duo have good chemistry and feel like their actions make sense even if their characters haven't been fleshed out incredibly well as of yet. you disappear from there.

The wiggle-waggles are quite unsettling which is a great addittion however the CGI at times can be off putting but when used discreetly is quite nice.Characters- Main duo have good chemistry and feel like their actions make sense even if their characters haven't been fleshed out incredibly well as of yet."", 'First things first - this show\'s been mistagged. ""Mystery"" is something that is unknown but at least logical and can be eventually reasoned about and figured out. Instead of that, this show should be tagged ""dementia"" - not describing the character\'s mental health (tho sometimes I wonder), but instead the whole world\'s rules. There is no logic or reason, just random shit happening and no hope of ever making sense of it. Yet the characters continue to prance about, acting like they understand it and get through each situation with what they pretend to be a sensible decision while it\'s just one deus-ex-fantasia after another.That...really kills the thrill of the show for me. When you know there is no limit to what nonsense may happen next and no logic to how the characters are supposed to deal with it, it just becomes pointless to worry about anything or try to empathize, predict or even borderline care for them or the world anymore.The only reasons I keep watching is because I\'m already ""pot-committed"", I\'m a bit curious if it\'ll remain so nonsensical till the end, and there is not much else to do anyway. So I\'ll probably still finish the show. It\'s looking up to be the worst show I\'ve voluntarily finished so far. really kills the thrill of the show for me.

We got Urasekai Picnic, one of LIDENFILMS packed offerings for the Winter 2021 anime season. And compared to LasDan, this anime is more interesting to watch, albeit more risky and more confusing.It seems that LIDENFILMS is putting a respectable effort to make this kind of show work. The production quality is decent but not that great, and first we go to the visuals. The art is bleak and almost grounded with backgrounds depicting a ruined and uninhabitable ""Other World"". With the use of distortion and unorthodox visuals, it can already put the viewer...on edge and pique the said viewer to its story. Though one thing that I am not fond of is the use of CGI. This is mainly provided by the co-studio, Felix Film, who is credited alongside LIDENFILMS. The 3D models looks so bad and using them interchangeably throughout the show\'s 2D drawings doesn\'t help a viewer to fully immerse itself into the animeBut what I did like in the anime is its music, and it is a very commendable part of the anime. I don\'t praise the music much in anime, but in this title, it is very marvelous. The background music and sound mixing helps further present the setting of Urasekai in a surreal and unpleasant feeling. Once the music hits in a thrilling scene, it gives the viewer some real tension rather than just forgettable BGM. That\'s how good the music is in this anime. In the case of OP & ED, nothing really that remarkable though. They are just decent enough songs for the show.From what I saw in the first four episode, this has managed to barely encapsulate me in its world. It can just potentially degrade itself as a poorly-executed SoL adventure show. But I\'m not gonna cross out the possibility for this to become a mystery thriller show with some supernatural action to boot. I\'m hoping that LIDENFILMS and Felix Film will execute this. But from what I\'ve saw for the first 4 episodes, the show is not yet near at its true potential. Which is a shame because it has the interesting story and the capabilities to actually shine strong.

But wow, this is so good and so unexpectedly good at the same time, but so unexpectedly unique, while still keeping that yuri feel afterwards. But you have to ask yourself What is Urasekai Picnic? Why is it a 6.5 on MAL? Why have I rated it highly and much higher than other ratings on this site? I feel Urasekai Picnic is Wonder Egg but more...realistic with yuri and not as good art. If you asked me what would happen if a normal yuri couple of the shy girl and the beautiful/cute girl were suddenly thrown into an anime where they had the option to go into another world where they had to defeat unknown monsters and retrieve their friend? This! This is the closest thing you can find to that answer. It\'s the perfect thriller yuri, in my opinion (not that there are many out there).Story: 7So yall might grill me for this, but I feel the story is VERY unique, it\'s not an isekai but u don\'t exactly have monsters in your own world. The fact they can alternate within the worlds is also very unique. I wouldn\'t say it\'s the most well written, but it\'s certainly not bad enough to deserve a 6.5 on this site. Also, the story is not everything, there are other aspects that make this anime amazing. Some of the story that has been animated was a little rushed, not gonna lie, but thats the reason it\'s a 7. The Urasekai part of it is amazing, and the overall premise is very unique.Art: 8The HAND DRAWN art is AMAZING. The girls are amazingly drawn, the monsters which are drawn are amazing, the scenery is AMAZING. A lot is amazing, this art would be a MASTERPIECE, apart from the CGI. The CGI used is the only downfall of this anime. Even if the camera pan isn\'t far away, u can tell the bad CGI used. The monsters which used CGI are also not the best either. I would have given this a 9 but I have to be honest.Sound: 9One of the very best things about this anime is the sounds and the flipping OST. The soundtrack is AMAZING. This would be a 10/10, but tbh I don\'t give 10/10s to a lot of things. The soundtrack is literally one of the best I\'ve heard in anime, the amazing job it does at setting the ""thriller"" mood and the dramatic, scary mood is AMAZING. The OSTs make the scenes about 10x better because they generate so much emotion, it\'s amazing, simply put, the closest thing to a masterpiece you can get.Character: 8The characters, in my opinion, are VERY well written. People don\'t seem to think so because it\'s not the generic characters you would get. The characters may seem generic, where we have the shy one and the beautiful one, the norm in the yuri world. But what happens when you throw normal yuri girls into a world with unknown monsters and a world they choose to go into? That\'s an amazing though, and for that reason, I feel the characters are VERY well written. Not is it unique, but I feel the characters react realistically as if a yuri had some monsters in a different entrance. I feel like not enough props goes for the realism of this anime in general because its not the normal friend group/couple.Enjoyment: 9Oh my god, this is one of my most enjoyed weeklies this season, with the OST, the unknown monsters, the characters, everything is just so unique in that situation itself. It\'s so enjoyable, it\'s literally a guessing game as to what\'s gonna happen next. Not gonna lie, a lot of doesn\'t make sense, but neither do a lot of shounens. The enemy system isn\'t really explained or known, anything can happen in the Otherside, and that\'s what makes it so enjoyable, you can\'t even know what\'s gonna happen next. This anime is so refreshing with a season of an isekai, a shounen, and AOT (not that any are bad, just this is refreshing). Whenever the dramatic OST hits, the monster comes in, it gives off this unique dramatic feel you can\'t get in any other anime because of the mix of yuri. How\'s it gonna pan? What\'s there? What will the yuri couple do? What\'s going on? With the OST hits, its AMAZING. On top of that, the yuri couple is just cute as hell, and they deserve the world when they\'re together, I love it, even it is more of a thrillerOverall: 8/10I can\'t understand the hate at all, people ask for unique anime, and when they get them, they don\'t like it? I don\'t want to hate on people\'s takes, but this is one I just can\'t understand, I love it and it has to be one of the most enjoyable anime this season. Was it expectations? Did people expect a realistic thriller with no yuri? I don\'t know man, but I have the same brain watching this as watching a shounen for example, just enjoy it, it\'s a hella ride, and if you like yuri, you\'ll love this. realistic with yuri and not as good art.

All due to a ""ghost story of a week"" format. The other world is used only as an excuse for the heroes to be spirited away into a setup of one another...ghost story or an urban legend. Because the show is a patchwork of the different urban legends, there is not even an attempt to make the other world somehow connected or whole. The research of the world becomes a joke, any attempt to use it becomes a joke because the characters have lost any resemblance of a life and life goals to use the world for.The show starts with interesting characters with complex backgrounds. Sorawo is a broke student and an avid urban explorer. Toriko is from Canada an military family with some military training, deep previous connection with the new world, knowing scientists who research it. And Toriko was close to a girl who she has lost in the other world and tries to find.All of this goes up in smoke in the later episodes. None of the background is used later in the show. Most shocking, Toriko forgets about her love, who is probably dying in the other world, and goes drinking, playing on the beach and having fun. Both of the characters have no life outside of the other world, no life goals, they are making no life decisions.Basically they become a placeholders for a character in a random ghost story. Like ""one day two girls were drinking at the bar but when they have exited the bar they have realized they are in some strange place"". This is it. Both main characters are reduced to ""two girls"", a protagonist whose life is totally irrelevant after she/he got into a life-changing situation. While this is a point in the urban legends, exactly no matter who you were, it all doesn\'t matter when you encounter the unknown, in this show the characters are supposed to shuttle between the other world and the real life. Which they have none.The fact that ""two girls"" are the same girls from one disconnected urban legend to another comes across more like a laziness of the authors who do not want to create a new character for the new urban legend.The show starts with the hint of an intriguing sprouting romance and a potential love triangle.All this goes up in smoke. The characters have no life and making no life choices. All their choices are tactical. The third girl is dropped and forgotten like an old toy. Where is no character development there is no love story progress. And there is no love story whatsoever. You see no chemistry, no revelations, no growing connection. They go eat and drink together but this is it. You do not see why Sorawo likes Toriko, you do not see vice-versa. All yuri is: Sorawo occasionally sees Toriko half-naked and blushes. Or she has been driking too much and in the morning she is like ""we woke up in the same bed and Toriko is naked but I\'m fully dressed with jacket and stuff. Did something good happen?""The story.The story is a patchwork of the random urban legends with a weak attempt to connect them through the heroes. The attempts to connect, or rather attempts to extract the heroes from one another urban legend of the week are forced and defy any logic.Like, to leave the place where nobody leaves according to the urban legend, Sorawo ""uses her eye"" and tells Toriko to ""use her hand"". And whoops, one girl reaches to the passing ghost train and jerks herself and her friend on board. End of the episode. Next episode they are already in the other ghost story.Overall - 3.

However, the longer the show goes on, the more it starts to leave all the setup and buildup it introduces back where it first popped up.Especially the second half felt just completely dragged out and it seemed like it was constantly dancing around the things it set up - Satsuki mostly. With the buildup the show has around her, you would expect her to pop up at the end as some kind of challenge to the way Toriko and Sorao have been going about...the Otherwold, or some connection to Sorao because of the comments Akari makes about her kinda looking like Satsuki, but nope - the only glimpse we see of her is by an apparition in the Otherworld that isn't even her. That's it.Pacing is a complete mess, artstyle is kinda bland but not bad. Sound was good and did its job in creating very eerie atmospheres. Voice acting felt kinda 'off' sometimes and don't even get me STARTED on the Engrish with the American soldiers.Overall, if you like creepy and unsettling shows this one is great, but don't expect a satisfying or logical ending, because you won't get it. the Otherwold, or some connection to Sorao because of the comments Akari makes about her kinda looking like Satsuki, but nope - the only glimpse we see of her is by an apparition in the Otherworld that isn't even her.

It blends Sci-Fi, mystery and Shoujo Ai romance in a way that I’ve never seen before. Unfortunately, the show on its own merits felt like a teaser for something greater.Ura Sekai was enjoyable throughout, but it was obvious that like most LN adaptations, the purpose of this anime was to get you to buy the books. Over the course of the one cour series many storylines are set up and never fully explored. The show has a rather unique storytelling method where it’s both monster of the week, as well...as an overarching narrative. Unfortunately, I think the monster of the week elements of the show take up a few too many episodes that could have been dedicated to tying up loose plot ends. In fairness, this is probably just the way the books are written, therefore the studio can’t do much about that.I did really enjoy the two main characters’ chemistry and their personalities are different enough to make them unique, while similar enough to make a cohesive team. The series is listed as Yuri romance, but we were really only teased in the anime. I’ll have to check out the LN to see how they ultimately develop.The anime also does a great job of creating a mysterious and tense atmosphere throughout. Several episodes, particularly towards the end genuinely made me uncomfortable with the eerie OSTs and direction. Hats off to the studio for pulling that off. The art and animation are really good in the series as well. There’s not a ton of fights in this show, but when they happen they’re well done. My only gripe is the CGI, which may look fine to others, but for me I always find jarring.Overall, Ura Sekai picnic is definitely one of the two most unique shows this season. The other being Wonder Egg. I really think it’s worth a watch and at the minimum will introduce you to an interesting setting and concepts.

How do you even visualize something that is described as so otherworldly that it makes a person mad just by looking at it, but somehow they succeeded better than anyone could have expected.The otherworld...itself seems to be a success as well as it oozes the vibe of unique difference to the normal world.The other thing that is exceptional are the characters, sure some might say they are stereotypical, but I think they are unique enough and have great synergy and if you like Yuri you might even give bonus points (it never gets explicit though).The problems start with the structure and flow of the story itself.It is incredible hard to understand the actions the characters take. This might be part of an issue due to it being an adaptation, but that can't be all, the flow is just plain weird.(Very mild spoilers)For example the girls go out drinking after coming back from a trip from the other world and suddenly end up in the other world while on their way home.The stay is dangerous and they barely make it back, just to go back to drinking to celebrate that they made it back alive, just to get transported to the other side again, this time in a more peaceful place, where they continue to drink until the dangers catch up with them again.That whole sequence doesn't make sense, sure the girls grow more confident in their abilities to survive in the other world, but that whole sequence is more a showing of zero learning and near suicidal behaviour. A normal reaction would probably be to find out how they end up on the other side after the first incident and make sure that it can't happen again on accident and celebrate that instead of just repeating that incident and even continue drinking while on the other side.There are multiple instances of inconsistencies like this and it kind of takes you out of the experience. It doesn't make the rest of the show bad, but it puts a damper on things.In general, I would say the show is an amazing watch and give it an 8/10, but if the inconsistencies and logical holes irk you the show might as well be a 3/10. If you really like psychological horror, the subtle horror in this show is one of the best and way more horrifying than some show that pride themselves on their shock value. itself seems to be a success as well as it oozes the vibe of unique difference to the normal world.The other thing that is exceptional are the characters, sure some might say they are stereotypical, but I think they are unique enough and have great synergy and if you like Yuri you might even give bonus points (it never gets explicit though).The problems start with the structure and flow of the story itself.It is incredible hard to understand the actions the characters take.

The story is very persistent and doesn't tend to go off track for more than 1 episode. I love the story and the way there relationship slowly and realistically develops from a simple friend, to a romantic love. The art style is very similar to most recent Animes, being very sleek, modern, and simple. The world design on the other hand is very detailed and eye catching. There is a  mild amount of CGI in the show, and I think they use it in the perfect moment...and the perfect way! The personalities of both the main characters are very different, yet they are very charming most of the time and I love both of them! Though, one complaint I do have about Toriko is she can be self-centered at times, and she doesn't really pay attention to how Sorawo feels. But, even though I say that, there are some points where she is nice to Sorawo and I love her for that, even though her being rude can be a little annoying.  Overall, at the time of writing this, I enjoy Urasekai Picnic a lot and can't wait to see where the story goes! :)*Review update!*The show has finished, and I will say I am very satisfied with the ending. I loved the fact that it kind of kept the story open ended, just incase they made a second season, yet they still made it to where if there isn't a second season, it's kind of completed. I kind of expected a love confession, but I'm not complaining, they ending was still pretty good.

Overall, it was a really enjoyable anime, and I'm happy they gave us a pretty good ending!"", ""This Yuri slow burn is gonna be so good and I can't wait to see it animated.I think episode 6 was the best so far. I'm really loving the music in the background and the phone call scene. I like how the show's monsters are all based on actual stories, copypastas, urban  legends and everything else. Each one can be searched online too, I really like that aspect of the series.I completely understand why manga and LN readers are let down, as an LN and manga reader myself I understand far too well, but I realized they adapted the anime more into like...a lighter adventure sol sorta show. I guess they wanted to adapted something a bit different maybe they thought it would appeal to a bigger audience.I do wish they would've followed the raw material exactly because thes could've been one of the best shows since the story is absolute genius, and the horror is so graphic in the raw material. There's a ton of dialogue they left out like how Sorao describes each legend/myth and a lot of scenes they cut out from the original work.The Light Novel and the manga show a LOT more horror, and uncensored scenes, as well as lots of internal dialogue and I want to say these parts are what make it a masterpiece.Honestly I give those both easily a 9.5/10. The pacing for the raw material is thousand times better as well and you become immersed just reading it. The way they drew the monsters in the manga is so creepy and good that I have to take a minute to actually process what I'm seeing since there's so much detail.If you're interested in this show then I HIGHLY recommend the manga and the light novel as well! a lighter adventure sol sorta show.

Honestly, I went into this anime because I thought it would be something light and a little trashy. It is not what I expected, and not for the typical reasons.This show is not a deconstruction. This show is not over the top. This show is nothing special in any way, and it makes sure you know that... Rather, it is the stark normal of its setting that leads into the uncanny. This entire show is uncanny in all of the worst ways.An atmosphere of perpetual existential dread lingers in every episode, choosing to indulge in...the sophisticated aspects of horror. Jump scares and gore are extremely rare and understated, the absence of them making the whole thing all the more terrifying.The story is simple in premise, but deceivingly so. There is a mystery surrounding the world, where every question leads to an answer that leads to more questions. Questions that are never answered, and probably will never be.I really appreciate the understated nature of the action scenes. Normally writers are driven to break past the limits of what is possible, but this story chooses to do the opposite and make those limits painfully present...This show is easily a 10/10.As for how this show was crafted, I can say that there are a couple minor issues. Episode 6 in particular is one of the most technically challenging episodes to animate and pace.The main characters are a pair of know-nothing girls that make bad choices sometimes. That really isn't a problem, but sometimes it leads to a strange unfolding of situations because they make an unusually dumb choice. I think this is because the someone could not resist the temptation of showing something cool happen, and needed to force a sudden plot change. It might have been the studio, though. There were some changes between the anime, the manga, and probably the novel also.Sometimes plot-essential objects appear out of nowhere without explanation, and do not match technically with the rest of the scene. These are continuity issues. I counted 3 instances, and they all happened in episode 6. I think this was because that episode is one of the most difficult to make and they had to cut corners on scenes and outsource a little too much to keep in budget.The sounds occasionally fall to the generic and break the harsh realism of some scenes to remind me that I am indeed watching an ANIME specifically.The anime is still a 10/10 in my book. They might want to look at remastering some scenes if they put it on bluray. Would be glorious. Episode 6, for all its flaws, is my second favorite episode. the sophisticated aspects of horror.

I just saw a hot blonde chick holding a Makarov. And that was just enough for me to take a peek at what this was all about. I was expecting your average junk food Isekai copy-and-paste story but boy was I wrong. I understand that there...were many plot holes in the first episode but I don't really mind it at all because I think the story will naturally place the puzzle pieces together and solve the unknowns as the story and character progresses together.I think this is gonna be somewhat of a mystery, Adventure, and a little bit of horror mixed with dementia type anime. I absolutely do not crave for dementia genre anime but I don't hate or avoid it by any means.Now, for the animation and audio, I thought it was a solid 8/10 with the audio winning over the animation for the most part. The animation isn't mediocre but not amazing either, sorta average. The unfitting CGI doesn't bother me that much. But the audio and music on the other hand, I thought it was pretty good. the sound effects of the monsters and the OST in the background of different scenes were eerie and mind twisting.

So with that, I do hope we get more with future seasons but if not, dang that would be sad not knowing. We get a idea of what\'s on the otherside but it feels like we\'re just scratching the surface.I will say one of the weakest point to this anime that I was disappointed in was the horror element or the suspense. Since most of the issue were resolved rather quickly and often with the...same concept. I\'m not saying it\'s terrible, just wasn\'t what I was expecting.One of the main reason I even watched this show that did not disappoint at all was the animation and voice acting. I knew going in I loved both the voice actors so off course I was gonna love their voice. The visual was beautiful and never disappointed me throughout at all. The characters were unique, even with the side characters too. Off course we can complain about the bad broken English from the soldier lol... yes yes...It does have a pretty good element of suspense in a few of it\'s episode but for the most part it lacks it more then anything else. A few episode really captures how great this show could\'ve been but it\'s not a terrible show regardless. I think it\'s worth a watch if you have nothing else to watch and though it has the ""Shoujo Ai"" tag there\'s nothing really there beside just a crush. So don\'t worry, it\'s not really ""yuri.""Overall, it was a pretty fun watch with a unique idea that I believe future installment can make it better, but for now, as it is, it\'s not good nor is it bad.

If you\'re expecting something suspenseful or some sort of crazy element to it, I won\'t... if you just want fun with some good suspense once in a while, it\'s worth watching then.

The problem is the pacing of the show, it's really fast so fast at the point of the anime feeling sort of rushed well if you have read the novels or manga u know what I mean by this. But if you are including world building in the story I will say then it gets a bit better because the world building is pretty decent...in this show, the world of the otherside and all the creatures inhabiting it are presented to us and continue to further develop as the story progresses.Art: 7Now for the visual aspect of the show its really good. The visuals of the otherside are just really good and the character design is not all that bad but the problem is the cgi, now I admit cgi can be really good if done right but the use of cgi in otherside picnic can be bad to say the least. Now I do understand why they used cgi but still it kinda ruins the immersion.Sound: 7The op,ed and osts of Otherside picnic are decent to say the least. The ed and some osts slap but the others are kinda meh.Characters: 5Here we come to the second thing that made me write this review in the first place the characters. The characters of Sorao and Toriko feel like sentient cardboard cut outs meaning they are not fully a cardboard cut out but not fully developed too. Now I understand you can make the argument of me complaining about the characters when it's only episode 4 but the people who have read the source material know how much character development, how much dialogue has been cut out for the anime version.Enjoyment: 5As a manga reader I feel very disappointed watching the anime, first episode was fine but as the episode went by I noticed more and more things feeling missing and the bad pacing just damages this show so much I wished to see this show become something good but it's still episode 4 and I will keep hoping that one day the anime will become good.Overall: 5 in this show, the world of the otherside and all the creatures inhabiting it are presented to us and continue to further develop as the story progresses.Art: 7Now for the visual aspect of the show its really good.

With Attack on Titan swallowing all the venom coming from the anime fanbase, sequels of well loved shows have been abundant. Isekai came to announce us that it\'s not dead and slap us in the face for believing it did, and of course that is not to forget Jujutsu Kaisen who keeps earning praise after praise from people everywhere on the Internet.And yet... something is missing. Something that is meant to fill both my eyes and my heart. Something soft and sweet, yet something that isn\'t cotton candy. Damn right, where\'s the cute anime...that isn\'t made to make me think, but to make me feel? Where\'s the beach episode? The onsen episode? The summer camp? The winter festival? Where\'s the moe anime to make me feel like trash? I know Yuru Camp season 2 is a thing, but I haven\'t watched the first season yet.Well fear no more, because this anime does a good enough job to serve as the token moe trash. But before I bring my point home, let me first warn you.DO NOT watch this anime for the plot! If the rating is anything to go by, far too many people have attempted to watch Urasekai Picnic expecting a horror anime that will keep them on edge, or about the exploration of a new world filled with danger and thrill. But there is NONE of that. The story is nothing that good, in fact, the story is the broken leg of the anime, forcing it to walk on crutches throughout all its episodes.In fact, taking the plot for what it is is the surefire way to not enjoy the anime for what it offers. Instead, the plot should be appreciated as those events that pace slice of life anime, similar to the election of the class representative, the cooking episode or the date. That\'s right, running away from creepypasta creatures is as good as cooking with your friends, or at least in this anime.And you\'ve made it this far thinking, ""Mr.Stuff, you still gave this anime a 7/10, what are you, a MAL user?""Remember the walking on crutches metaphor? Well if I had to define the crutches, it would be the cast, an all girls cast dare I say, this anime may have fooled some of the users of this website, but I\'m above that, I can see the true nature of Urasekai Picnic, its nature as a moe anime, and as many other moe anime, the waifus range from good to best girls.Of course, the setting of the anime means that the dere factor has to be toned down quite a bit, which is quite refreshing in a sense as the characters feel a bit more mature. And in terms of character design and voice acting, Urasekai Picnic doesn\'t have anything to feel ashamed about, even when compared to the kings of the moe genre. As for the soundtrack, the find that it also feels too ashamed to be all fun and bubbles may be a hindrance for you to feel truly in a moe anime but it doesn\'t really matter when the anime gives itself away so easily.What would be Urasekai Picnic in a single sentence? An anime that is too tsundere to reveal it\'s actually moe slice of life but still does a very good job at it. And if you think the beach episode wasn\'t the highlight of this anime, then you\'re lying to yourself, probably one of the best beach episodes in recent anime. that isn\'t made to make me think, but to make me feel?

Not because I hate it or anything, but I just never really found it interesting. But I was bored one day and had nothing to watch, so I decided to try checking this out. It turned out to be better than I expected, though I do feel more could have been done with this. The story centers on two girls—Sorawo and Toriko—who meet in the mysterious realm they refer to as the Otherside. It's a vast and dangerous realm that hardly anyone knows about, filled with all manner of...horrors straight out of ghost stories. In order to get more information on this strange world, Sorawo and Toriko travel back and forth to it from the real world, though one incident alters their bodies in ways that actually manage to be somewhat helpful in both investigating the Otherside and dealing with the monsters and ghouls that inhabit it.As far as animation goes, Otherside Picnic isn't really winning any awards. I mean, the animation itself is fine, and the character designs, while very simplified from the illustrations from both the light novel and the manga, do their job. Liden Films as a studio isn't always capable of doing justice to the things they adapt into animation. They've gotten better as they've gone on, especially compared to the disaster that was Goodbye My Dear Cramer, and they're set to adapt an anime of the first Atelier Ryza game coming up, and their work here is pretty good for what it is. That being said, the CGI is REALLY hit-or-miss. Seriously, the CGI monsters don't look like they blend well with the show. They're so clunky they look like they came right out of a bad PS3 game. Also, whose bright idea was it to make the far-off shots of Toriko and Sorawo CGI models? Because those were just flat-out bad. They move really awkwardly and clumsily, like disjointed Barbie dolls, and it's really noticeable when you're watching the show on a big TV. Why couldn't they just animate their far off models in 2D? And no, this isn't just a product of the broadcast version, they're in the home media release, too! Why?!I don't have as much to say about the music, as a lot of it is pretty heavy synth that's meant to sound eerie and horror-like. The soundtrack, again like the animation, does its job, but isn't really anything memorable. I did really enjoy the song that played at the end of episode 12, though. For the characters, again I'm kind of mixed. I do like Sorawo and Toriko as a pair, and their chemistry really blossoms as the series goes on and we learn more and more about them as people. They pretty much carry the show, and while they're not exactly three-dimensional, I did find them interesting enough to care about. I did find Kozakura to be a bit too whiny for my liking, and I feel like more could have been done with Akari and Natsumi. That being said, I found out the anime only adapted the very first light novel and nothing else, which explains why Akari and Natsumi don't do much beyond their introduction.As for the anime's attempts at horror, I do appreciate that Otherside Picnic doesn't try to rely so much on jump scares or gratuitous violence for the sake of it. A lot of it is atmosphere or character-driven, something I'm definitely a big fan of. Plus, rather than the typical monsters like zombies or ghosts, Otherside Picnic takes inspiration from Japanese urband legends and creepypasta stories, using them as the scaffolding for its story and lore. I've never even heard of stuff like Lady Hasshaku or the Kunekune until I looked them up on the series' TVTropes page. Believe me, I want to like this show more than I do, but a lot of its problems do come down to the fact that it's an adaptation of one light novel in a whole series of them. As a result of this decision, its build-up never goes anywhere and the characters don't evolve too much throughout its run. It's likely we'll ever get a second season of this, and that sucks because I do want to see more of Sorawo and Toriko. Then again, there's always the light novels and the manga. I know the anime itself is meant to be a commercial for the light novels, which is fine, but I'd gladly watch more of it.Overall, Otherside Picnic is a fairly low-key, intriguing horror anime that's bogged down by the fact that it's a commercial for the light novels, and its narrative doesn't get resolved.

In fact, the overall score on this site is ridiculous for this series has managed to promote its source material even if some of the blind viewers see some stuff between an episode's ending and another episode's beginning being skimmed through.Of course one should expect anime adaptations of a 10+ episode season are a summary of the first few volumes of the novel. Nevertheless, in my eyes, nothing's amiss. All the important details about the mysterious...creatures of the Otherside are conveyed properly.

Sure the CGI may look jarring at some point, but the way it looks and designed, that manages to convince you that this is how a horror series is portrayed.Did I forgot to mention that I'm glad to watch female leads being themselves and not be written mostly as sexual objectification if the scriptwriter(s) have no clue how to write connections between each episode? Thank goodness the female leads are distinctive and have an intriguing dynamic relationship with each other. There's a beach episode that's written in a unique style where unorthodox bonding time is being used.

Before we start, let me tell you a couple of things: 1) I like the shoujo ai genre. I think anime with said genre has more romance than 'normal' romance anime out there, and usually sweeter, too. 2) I haven't read the source material, be it the light novel or the manga, so this review is based on my opinion solely from watching the anime, therefore I won't be commenting on things that aren't accurate to the source material. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get into it....TL;DR: Even if you don't enjoy shoujo ai, this anime is still very enjoyable for its thrilling moments.*MINOR SPOILER AT THE STORY PART*Story - 7The story is about two girls, Nishina Toriko (Toriko for short) who encountered another girl named Kamikoshi Sorao (Sorao for short) in the otherworld/otherside; a place (world) of bizarre creatures. The story itself doens't really explain what the creatures are in the otherside, other than what Sorao explains herself. Basically the otherside is a place full of urband legends, be it ghosts, mononoke, or other bizarre beings (which are very creepy by the way). At the start of the series, it is mentioned in order to get to the otherside you would have to ride an elevator, press a series of floor buttons, and there you go! You made it! In order to go home, however, Sorao must search for the 'exit doors' which are random and scattered. Now, everything I've said up until now is all Sorao's explanation on what the hell is going on, and if you don't want to get lost on what's happening, then you'd better pay attention. Because Sorao is the only explanation you'll get from.It is revealed that the reason Toriko goes to the otherside is to look for a certain someone whom she lost there (and also to take things to sell). However, this plot is soon abandoned and will not be mentioned for quite some time, and turns the story to just about monster hunting. Seriously, they're not even shown profiting anything after the first episode.  Each episode (mostly) features a different monster so you don't have to worry about waiting for the resolve to come. Here's how an episode usually goes: Toriko asks Sorao to come with her to the otherside, Sorao agrees, they go there, meet an urban legend creature, kill or run away from it, Sorao explains what that creature is, and they successfully escape. That's the kind of anime this is. That being said, the story is not at all boring. Each episode is very thrilling and the things they encounter are always scary enough to make you think you don't want to meet them. Which brings me to my next point: the art.Art - 10The art for each character is beautiful. Toriko looks very pretty and Sorao is the polar opposite of her. Sorao looks bland when standing next to Toriko, but that's what makes it good. You can clearly tell that Sorao is not a very interesting person or the kind who goes to parties or has many friends just from the way she dresses. On the other hand, Toriko has silky hair, dresses modestly and  has a fun personality. Just one look and you'll know she is that kind of character. The supporting characters are also well designed. Kozakura wears sloppy, white t-shirt, messy hair, and speaks kind of rudely. Akari wears short pants and has short hair; indicating she's a sporty person. Not only the main and supporting characters, but the creatures are also very well designed. Some look simple enough but you can feel the terror through that simplicity, and some have big heads (literally). Of course they nailed the background as well. You can clearly tell that it's different from the 'real' world. All in all, I'd say a 10 is a solid score for the art.Although the drawing is good, I can't give the animation the same praise. They use a lot of cgi models. And when I say a lot, I mean A LOT. They use cgi for the monsters for most of the time, but there are times when Toriko or Sorao, or even both of them are cgi models. This usually happens when there's a lot going on in the scene (like 100 monsters chasing them), so I can slide this off. When the cgi models appear on screen however, the camera angle is far from the characters, so they won't be a bother to anyone watching. The cgi models don't bother me, so it's still a solid 10!Sound - 6While I did say the art is splendid, I can't really say the same for the sound. The voice actresses are doing a very amazing job voicing their characters. What I have a problem with is the sound effects. I'm not sure they don't have many things to work with or what, but the effects sound really mediocre. I'm not going to say it's trash, though. The quality is not that bad, it's just very mediocre. Nothing I can say other than that.Character - 7Did I mention this is a shoujo ai anime? I did, didn't I? If you're hoping for some 'action' scenes from this show, then forget it. You won't get anything even close to that. The furthest they would go is hugging and Sorao getting embarrassed from it while Toriko being oblivious to it. That's as much as you'll get. Now, talking about the actual characters, I would say they're very normal. Nobody is quirky in the show. They do have some traits which makes them kind of different, but they're not unique in anyway. Not that it's a bad thing. As the matter of fact, I actually like the fact that they are 'normal'. All of them love to help each other's back, genuine good girls. That's a plus from me. If you're curious about how the character development is in this series, I'd say there's almost none. They're basically the same people they were in episode 1. Then again, it's not bad.Enjoyment -  10With all of its flaws I can still say this with a high degree of certainty that I enjoyed this show very much. I'm always at the edge of my seat waiting for the next episode to come out, and when it did come out, I'm at the edge of my seat because of how intense it is. I never get bored watching every episode each week just because of how good the thrill is. This anime is 23 minutes long and damn it sure doesn't feel like it. Each episode ends so fast, which makes me crave for more, which makes me sit at the edge of my seat for the next one. IIf you want to know how much I'm enjoying this anime, let me tell you this: I never yawned while watching it even once. That's just how good this is.Overall - 8Urasekai picnic is a solid anime which I very enjoy watching every week and I hope more people would watch it.In conclusion. If you like shoujo ai and expects a lot of 'action' scenes, then this is not for you. However, if you do enjoy a light sci-fi (you know, the kind that doesn't hurt your brain) with a bit of comedy here and there but is still thrilling to watch, I'm sure you're going to love this. All in all, I hope more people are willing to check this anime out because I really think it's very good. Thanks for reading this review.The question is, is Urasekai Picnic worth watching?

Some spoilers below so be warned.This was definitely the weakest anime I watched during the winter season, and the weakest Yuri I\'ve seen by far. I\'m not really quite sure what the overarching storyline was of Otherside Picnic. It felt a bit like a different mission to the Otherside every week, and some episodes felt like they didn\'t even connect to a larger plot (ninja cats? really?) The CGI bits were atrocious, as well as the English-speaking soldiers. So...story-wise, not that great. If the leads weren\'t pining over each other, I would not have given this anime a watch. I was never that entranced by the story, and I never really had any idea this entire anime where the story was even going, except maybe trying to find Satsuki (which  never even happened).But you know what? As bad as this anime was, the feelings developing between Sorawo and Toriko were real, and those 30 seconds of gay we got each week were worth it in my book. I don\'t commend this to be the best Yuri of all time (Bloom Into You takes that title), but it was a refreshing setting for a Yuri since most are slice-of-life. Don\'t expect any huge development between the two leads, but it\'s obvious by the end how much they\'ve fallen for each other. I really enjoyed the last bit of this final episode as they both examined their feelings toward each other. That being said, I have no intentions of ever really rewatching Otherside Picnic, and I certainly will never prefer to it to Yuri like ""Bloom Into You,"" ""Adachi and Shimamura,"" or ""Kase-san and the Morning Glories.""I don\'t expect this anime to get a season 2 (nor do I think it should after this atrocity), but I may check out the light novels to quench my gay thirst, so marketing-wise, I guess Otherside Picnic works? That or I\'m just desperate for the few bits of sapphic content out there.Overall, Otherside Picnic is not going to be the best Yuri you\'ve ever seen, especially with such a weak story, but if you want to sit through 12 episodes for a little gay fanservice, then go on ahead. You\'re not going to get a whole lot of development, but you\'ll get little sprinkles of lesbianism, and for some (like me) that\'s enough. story-wise, not that great.

Aside from shifting around a couple chapters with some necessary plot modifications, the anime was a close adaptation of the first two volumes of the light novels.

On one hand, I enjoyed a lot of what it had to offer, but on the other hand, it was dragged down by a few (pretty important) pretty mediocre aspects. To be honest, I didn't have super high expectations, but I was a bit disappointed. This anime stood out to me because it seemed pretty unique. The Sci-Fi Mystery tags intrigued me, and since I haven't seem very much Shoujo Ai, I thought it would be good to watch some more.Story:The story involves a bunch of different short arcs following a similar pattern: The two main characters...encounter something strange, which either happens in the Otherside or prompts them to enter the Otherside, they encounter some sort of creature, they use the same tactics to get rid of it, and find their way back home. While the formula tends to be the same, there is enough variation between them that it doesn't get too repetitive, and the arc with the soldiers is especially unique.However, there were a few inconsistencies that threw me off, such as a certain object that had disappeared/been destroyed in a previous episode somehow existing again. This ended up happening because the anime switched the order of some arcs in the manga, and I'm not really sure why they made this decision.Art:The art itself was pretty mediocre, nothing really special. There was some CGI involved, which isn't a huge deal when used on vehicles or other inanimate objects. However, especially in the beginning, CGI was used for the main characters during long shots, which looked really off. Some monsters were also done in some pretty bad CGI.Sound:The soundtrack itself was pretty interesting - I really enjoyed listening to it. It helped build up suspense and excitement quite well, contributing to the atmosphere in the Otherside. The OP and ED were both quite good. However, there were some mixing issues that I noticed throughout the anime, which isn't terrible but was definitely noticeable.Characters:I didn't love the characters, but they weren't bad either. Sorawo and Toriko didn't go through too much development, and they didn't feel completely real (especially since they often seemed not be scared about things they definitely should have been scared about). On the other hand, Kozakura did get scared of things, and reacted the way a normal person would.

While the formula tends to be the same, there is enough variation between them that it doesn't get too repetitive, and the arc with the soldiers is especially unique.However, there were a few inconsistencies that threw me off, such as a certain object that had disappeared/been destroyed in a previous episode somehow existing again. This ended up happening because the anime switched the order of some arcs in the manga, and I'm not really sure why they made this decision.Art:The art itself was pretty mediocre, nothing really special. There was some CGI involved, which isn't a huge deal when used on vehicles or other inanimate objects. However, especially in the beginning, CGI was used for the main characters during long shots, which looked really off. Some monsters were also done in some pretty bad CGI.Sound:The soundtrack itself was pretty interesting - I really enjoyed listening to it. It helped build up suspense and excitement quite well, contributing to the atmosphere in the Otherside. The OP and ED were both quite good. However, there were some mixing issues that I noticed throughout the anime, which isn't terrible but was definitely noticeable.Characters:I didn't love the characters, but they weren't bad either. Sorawo and Toriko didn't go through too much development, and they didn't feel completely real (especially since they often seemed not be scared about things they definitely should have been scared about). On the other hand, Kozakura did get scared of things, and reacted the way a normal person would.

This anime does ""cute girls in scary place"" and they make no questions about their troubles and how much they escalate. They don\'t questions how scary things keep happening to them when trying not to adventure. They just happen, and they have drinks at the end.Adding onto it\'s mediocrity, it also displays the recent batch of ""Engrish"" that may make it live long enough for memes-sake.The first two episodes showed promise with the premise of friendship and mystery with plenty of thrills. This is quickly deflated by the characters and repetitive sound cues. The story shows no impact on...their troubles encountering problems from the Otherside that are described in ways to be haunting. But it all falls flat over and over again. Character development is tossed aside for randomness that is quickly shrugged off each time.There is no mystery or intrigue save for how anyone would think this story even works as an ad vehicle for the light novel series. This series is a slice of life ""thriller"" that lives on it\'s potential and dies by it\'s blandness. their troubles encountering problems from the Otherside that are described in ways to be haunting.

Instead, its fear of committing to what could have made it great left us with lukewarm drinks and lackluster sandwiches.Let\'s start with the anime\'s strongest point: the characters.  Sorao and Toriko both feel pretty fresh, neither so hyperbolic nor so bland that you can\'t imagine meeting them in real life.  The start of their relationship feels a little improbable, though at least that problem is addressed in retrospect.  By the end of their...relationship, they really do make a great pair (both as friends and romantically.)  Yet, despite the good start and decent relationship progression, the characters lack sufficient individual progression for the anime to be realistic.  To be fair, it would all be fine in most genre, but the Lovecraftian/urban horror here demands more character work than the average anime, which leaves the anime feeling more flat that expected in this realm.On to the horror aspect.  First, the monsters were for the most part very well designed and felt both new and decently thought out.  In the moment, they generally generated appropriate tension (though the sound detracted from this more than added.)  The problem lies in the lack of consequences.  Horror that is always escaped or overcome in the nick of time ceases to hold the power to horrify.  Lovecraftian horror without the slow degradation of sanity also misses the mark.  Urasekai Picnic\'s monsters stayed safely behind the screen, giving you a PB&J in lieu of Philly cheesesteak.The slice of life aspect was similarly lacking.  Including slice of life with horror is in my opinion a brilliant move, since the slow warping of the fabric of everyday life makes the horror hit home with devastating effect.  Yet here the slice of life was all pretty bland, which may have been fine if that were used as impetus to drive the heroes toward the Otherside, but that didn\'t seem to be the case.  In the end, adding lukewarm milk to the lukewarm coffee still fails to make a better drink.Finally, all these problems could have been ameliorated by a solid story, but the episodic nature of the show shot that potential in the foot.  Further, the few times that episodes end up connected, the links that should have left us eager for more were tenuous at best.  The world building also had its share of holes that left some of the stories weaker than they should have been (in particular, the glitches were poorly thought out.)In the end, Urasekai Picnic is another case of good and great ideas that were poorly handled.  The process of putting the ingredients together is what makes or breaks the final dish, and here the final product fell far short of the quality of ingredients. relationship, they really do make a great pair (both as friends and romantically.)

It takes hints from Tarkovski\'s Stalker, applies those to a metaphorical canvas where a secluded high-school girl ""is taken to a magical worlds"", but rather than presenting tropes, it surprises with every choice.The anime offers a wildly inspired and...creative work, with a very unique soundscape, great (slowish) pacing and thought-provoking themes.People who didn\'t like stuff like Flower of Evil or Evangelion will prolly hate this. But once they read into more fiction, film and great cultural works, they\'d come to appreciate its originality and thoughtful nature, no doubt.Also similar to: Kokoro Connect, Death Parade, Shinsekai Yori, Japan Sinks. creative work, with a very unique soundscape, great (slowish) pacing and thought-provoking themes.People who didn\'t like stuff like Flower of Evil or Evangelion will prolly hate this.

Other than it, it has great voice acting, a killer soundtrack, and the characters are just lovable (especially Kozakura!)Though, I have read the novels, and a few episodes are out of order, but I'm willing to forgive that because there was 2 new episodes from the author themselves which were amazing.

an interesting premise, Japanese folklore related to urban legends and horror legends is great and quite different from most other cultures, so much so that we see it being used in several different ways in works of all kinds, so it would not be a bad idea to create a work focused only on that, but the anime explores very poorly its base structure.Sorao is a lonely girl who doesn\'t have much to lose in the world so isolates herself in this place that the characters call ""another world"", but at random she ends up meeting the person...who would be his partner from then on, Toriko, a girl a little more experienced in that world who exploits him to find a lost friend.From the moment Sorao forces himself to follow Toriko around the world the anime gives indications that those conflicts with monsters only have 3 objectives, create interesting suspense and action scenes, develop Sorao\'s personality for her to mature and a turn in her life through the relationship with Toriko and solve the mystery of the missing girl.But none of the three premises are successfully fulfilled, the anime fails to create empathy for the main character since most of the time exchanges interesting dialogues with jokes or interruptions for something that happened in the background, the most we know of it are monologues that she does about her person, but we have almost no moments of personal improvement of the character.The action scenes are mediocre and mostly anti-climatic, and the main mystery is most often interrupted by an isolated mission that takes the characters nowhere.In the end what held me in the anime was its world, which by the way seems to be very rich and full of complex rules to survive in it, but in very few episodes these same rules end up being deconstructed by the whims of the script and conveniences, if the anime were only paranormal research as its basic premise I would not bother since its closed missions are at least interesting that give a reasonable level of entertainment , but become a problem in the middle of twelve episodes since, upon arriving at the end of the anime it seems that we have just begun the journey and nothing relevant has been done so

outras culturas, tanto que vemos ele sendo usado de diversas maneiras diferentes em obras de todos os tipos, então não seria má ideia criar uma obra focada apenas nisso, porém o anime explora muito mal sua estrutura base.Sorao é uma garota solitária que não tem muito a perder no mundo então se isola nesse lugar que os personagens chamam de “outro mundo”, porém ao acaso ela acaba encontrando a pessoa que seria sua parceira daí em diante, Toriko, uma garota um pouco mais experiente naquele mundo que o explora para encontrar uma amiga perdida.A partir do momento que Sorao se força a seguir Toriko pelo mundo o anime dá indícios de que aqueles conflitos com monstros só tem 3 objetivos, criar cenas de suspense e ação interessantes, desenvolver a personalidade de Sorao para que ela amadureça e de uma volta em sua vida através do relacionamento com Toriko e resolver o mistério da garota desaparecida.Porém nenhuma das três premissas são cumpridas com êxito, o anime falha em criar empatia pela personagem principal já que na maioria das vezes troca diálogos interessantes com piadinhas ou interrupções por algo que aconteceu de fundo, o máximo que sabemos dela são monólogos que ela mesma faz sobre sua pessoa, mas quase não temos momentos de melhora pessoal da personagem.As cenas de ação são medíocres e na maioria das vezes anti climáticas, e o mistério principal na maioria das vezes é interrompido por uma missão isolada que não leva os personagens a lugar algum.No fim o que me prendeu no anime foi o seu mundo, que por sinal parece ser bem rico e cheio de regras complexas para sobreviver nele, porém em pouquíssimos episódios essas mesmas regras acabam sendo desconstruídas por caprichos do roteiro e conveniências, se o anime fosse apenas investigação

Well sign me up Debra. Except then I was thoroughly disappointed. On paper this sounds like it could've been one of the coolest shows ever. It literally has everything a guy could want in an anime. Then you watch the actual anime and things fall apart. What could have been with this anime turned into a comedic slice of life about two women with sexual tension between them. Yes they do fight these monsters from urban legends, and by fight I mean...Sorawo just stares at the monster while Toriko takes an ungodly amount of time to aim at it.This show is like a minefield of moments that should have been awesome, and they managed to avoid setting off every bomb.

You may recall Liden from Arslan Senki and that dumb anime about cockroaches from Mars. It's based off of an ongoing series of novels by Miyazawa Iori. Let's open shoujo ai month with a look at Urasekai Picnic.Story:We open with Sorawo, a young University student, thinking about death while a monstrous creature looms nearby. She's rescued by another young woman named Toriko. Turns out, Sorawo stumbled upon a strange place referred to simply as Urasekai. Toriko is there in search of her former mentor Satsuki. Toriko convinces Sorawo to explore the Urasekai with...her. The pair encounter all manner of strange creatures and circumstances while deepening their bond.The worst I can say for the series is that it gets a bit cheesy at moments where the girls are expressing their deep affections for one another. It doesn't go into purple prose territory, but it definitely veers near the border of it. There are also a few moments where something significant happens and they don't really address the repercussions fully. Like when they see a man die and don't really talk about it afterwards.With that said, this series is highly compelling. The adventures into the Urasekai are presented in a largely episodic way and they're very interesting with lots of different scenarios and some brilliant world building as Sorawo & Toriko endeavour to solve the mysteries of the Urasekai and find Satsuki. The romantic elements are absolutely adorable as well in spite of the slightly cheesy moments. The series manages to hit a good balance where the slightly serious moments work but it can also be more light-hearted and offer a sense of fun. I do also appreciate the fact that they replace the usual preview segment with a more comedic segment with the girls just having cutesy, funny bits that tie into the episode you just watched. The anime also does end at a pretty good point. Which is always good when you're looking at an anime that only covers part of the story.Characters:There are a few things I really appreciate about the characters in this. The first is that they aren't all connected through going to the same university or being childhood friends or some such David Copperfield coincidence. Instead they find their way to the Urasekai through varying means, as do the other humans they encounter within. They also have varied motivations for engaging with the Urasekai and they're just a very endearing group. Even the side characters who show up for one or two episodes manage to have some complexity.The main cast also have some interesting dynamics. Both those that are clearly being established as romantic and those that aren't.Art:The artwork is actually pretty spectacular. The monster designs are very interesting and otherworldly. Some of them are based around putting a twist on traditional monsters while others are very unique and bizarre. I also really like the character design. I think the alterations Sorawo and Toriko get from exposure to Urasekai creatures gives them some interesting physical traits and I do appreciate the way the anime actually handles that. The animation is smooth and the backgrounds are strong.Sound:The acting in this is really good. Hanamori Yumiri, Kayano Ai, Hidaka Rina, Tomita Miyu and the rest of the main cast all do really well. The one issue I can bring up is that the American soldiers they encounter speak a lot of dialogue with very stilted, awkward English. While I do fully understand that these are Japanese actors trying to speak a language that they aren't necessarily strong with, it does feel a little bizarre to hear these characters who are supposed to be native English speakers slur their words like they aren't quite sure what they're saying or how to say it. Watanabe Takeshi's soundtrack is very well composed.Ho-yay:There's a lot. Sorawo and Toriko are portrayed as developing feelings for one another. Two of the more important side characters, Akari and Natsumi, definitely have feelings for each other that go beyond friendship. It's also implied that their researcher companion, Kozakura, had a thing for Satsuki before she disappeared. So, none of these girls are straight.Areas of Improvement:1. They could go just a little less cheesy with some of those romantic moments. Hearing Natsumi and Akari say each others' names longingly is all well and good but when they do it back and forth for a hot minute it's a little excessive.2. The series probably could have gotten some actual Native English speakers who understand Japanese to act as the American soldiers and had it come across a bit better. Or, alternatively, just had them speak Japanese.3. The series could have addressed the events they witness a little more.Final Thoughts:Urasekai Picnic is pretty fantastic, actually. While it wasn't a resounding masterpiece, the complaints I do have with it are relatively minor and it definitely delivers in entertainment, endearing characters, a compelling narrative and a strong world. It's like a cross between Mushishi and one of those slice of life series about lesbians. Which is pretty much exactly the kind of anime I really go for. I do hope it gets a second series because I want to see how the narrative resolves and more of that cutesy les-yay. I'm giving it a 9/10. her.

It's also implied that their researcher companion, Kozakura, had a thing for Satsuki before she disappeared. So, none of these girls are straight.Areas of Improvement:1. They could go just a little less cheesy with some of those romantic moments. Hearing Natsumi and Akari say each others' names longingly is all well and good but when they do it back and forth for a hot minute it's a little excessive.2. The series probably could have gotten some actual Native English speakers who understand Japanese to act as the American soldiers and had it come across a bit better. Or, alternatively, just had them speak Japanese.3. The series could have addressed the events they witness a little more.Final Thoughts:Urasekai Picnic is pretty fantastic, actually. While it wasn't a resounding masterpiece, the complaints I do have with it are relatively minor and it definitely delivers in entertainment, endearing characters, a compelling narrative and a strong world. It's like a cross between Mushishi and one of those slice of life series about lesbians. Which is pretty much exactly the kind of anime I really go for. I do hope it gets a second series because I want to see how the narrative resolves and more of that cutesy les-yay. I'm giving it a 9/10."", ""For me it was one of best anime's of this season. I love it.I start choosing my anime's watching the trailers of different types and every time I do that, I still make my final decision after the first episode.For me the word mystery includes ghosts, abnormal worlds, whatever unknown things. Good mystery is hard to find like any other good anime. I must say that this season has been great one and it seems that the next one will be too.I hope that this show will get a sequel.All the different monsters that the main characters meet have some kind of their own...set of rules and Sorawo knows how to deal with them, because she have read enough stories about urban legends.This is my very first review, so I know that I am kind of bad, but from now on I try to get better at it. set of rules and Sorawo knows how to deal with them, because she have read enough stories about urban legends.This is my very first review, so I know that I am kind of bad, but from now on I try to get better at it."", ""Okay, I had high hopes for this anime. The trailers and clips I saw looked cool, and the synopsis sounded interesting. Sci-fi shoujo-ai?? Hell yeah! However, even with just the first episode, I was disappointed. The only reason why I keep watching the show is for the story. The art style is mediocre at best, and they constantly use unnecessary CGI for even simple scenes (like them walking or when the camera pans). The characters are plain and kinda forgettable. The voice acting is okay I guess? Just kinda meh. The sound design is almost nonexistent, and when there is music, it feels kinda out...of place. I just watched the 6th episode and my god, it stands as a prime example of all the negatives of the show. Lazy animation and CGI, ENGRISH LIKE HELL, awkward pauses, weird dialogue.The story had so much potential, which is why I'm leaving it at a 5.

You have two girls with romantic chemistry going to visit the Otherside, where Urban Legends reside. The sad part is that most of what's there just doesn't work that well.In particular, the rules of the world are poorly explained and the characters just kind of fumble forward through problems without ever even understanding what they are doing (and we are left in the dark to an even greater degree than they are).Despite the central conceit of the show being monsters from urban legends, the show seems to give remarkably no cares about presenting them in an intimidating...or interesting fashion. Moreover, since the structure so far seems to be a monster of the week type of deal, we also don't really get any time to learn about them.Hell, each episode can hardly be said to have a plot. This in and of itself isn't a bad thing. Other shows have been able to rely on strong world-building and interesting characters to propel their show forward. Girl's Last Tour did this rather successfully.But Uraseki Picnic only has one of these components: a dynamic duo who are interesting to watch. One is smart(er) but shy and adorable, while the other is more outgoing and ditzy while being more traditionally attractive. Over these first 4 episodes, they slowly tease out what their dynamic is like and you start to see them open up to one another in interesting ways.Part of me wants to watch more just for this reason. There has been real character development over the course of four episodes and there is a nice chemistry. But when the story is so barebones (episode 4 is mostly a retread of episode 2 and yet together they don't feel like an entire episode) and the action so dreadful, it's hard to say that you should stick around and watch the 70% of the show that's bad just to see the 30% of the show that's good.All in all, the only real way to recommend the show is if you are hooked on the two main girls.

For me, this is a pretty strong series.Many reviewers have picked out faults that I really can't argue with: there are times when the audio mixing lets it down, the animation is decent but unspectacular and the story about two girls who can cross into a supernatural world does relax into a monster-of-the-week pattern that would benefit from a little more time spent in the real world in order to draw a brighter contrast with the strangeness of the 'other side'.With all that said, the show has strengths which make it very enjoyable....The world-building is mostly excellent and the show creates an attractive and cohesive reality.There is always a trick to bringing the natural and the supernatural together in a way that doesn't stretch the audience's belief too far and this show manages that well with gates between the two worlds that spring up in places where people's connection to reality is weak. The supernatural powers that the main characters develop are subtle and well-integrated. I was impressed with the way the show deployed these elements to navigate the world and empower the girls without making them so overpowered that the tension was completely lost.The characters are actually pretty good. Some of the unresolved tension around their 'friendship' and what they really mean to each other is a bit repetitive but they do a good job of walking us through the strange world of the 'other side' and their growth and adaptation throughout the series is quite believable and well done.This show is better than people have given it credit for, at least for people who haven't read the source material. It's easy to look at the story across 12 episodes and ask 'what's actually happened?' but at the beginning two bereft and lonely girls were wandering lost in a supernatural land of horror; at the end they were cheerfully mounting a rescue operation for a troop of helpless American soldiers who were stranded in that same land of nightmares.

In theory, I\'m interested in a show about two girls who kick ass and fall in love. But this just isn\'t my cup of tea at all.The episodes are very slow and not too much happens before the monsters show up. They don\'t even bother to use the extra time to flesh out their romance, instead going for a ""they grow closer after surviving dangerous things together"" approach. Which would require the things they survive together to be particularly thrilling....Instead, it\'s usually an explanation of some facet of the Otherside that I honestly couldn\'t care much about. Maybe the glitches were a set-up for something else later on, but if not, they\'re just a huge waste of animation time that clearly made more sense as a paragraph or two in a novel.I will say that the plot twist of the second episode had promise as an action climax and a relationship moment.

But it IS definitely an UTTER TRAINWRECK. So, first off, let\'s start with the name - ""otherside picnic"". For those of you who don\'t know, \'roadside picnic\' is the Russian fictional novel that the video game, mods and book series ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R"" is loosely based on, and i\'m entirely sure that\'s what the anime and manga\'s name ties to without even researching. So yeah, the show (and the manga) definitely feels like a love letter to both stalker and \'roadside picnic\' in a lot of ways (teleports, gravitational...and other semi or really dangerous anomalies, weird creatures and incomprehensible beings).What is DIFFERENT? Well, as \'other side\' would hint, it takes place on the other side, as in, unlike stalker or roadside, its not some closed off area on earth, but some kind of dimension/limbo/spirit realm, and as such, unlike the game and novel, the anime has a lot of said spirits, and is overall seems to be more based on the supernatural and spirit-y stuff rather than being more scince-fiction and physical anomaly based like in the game and novel. How is the manga structured? Tiny arcs, with our two protagonists traveling to the \'otherside\' to either complete an objective, or encounter something from there, or ending up there unintentionally.Its a good setting, and a good premise, a decent, if somewhat weak formula too, because it gets resolved too fast and doesn\'t leave much room for tension. The manga isn\'t TOO good, but is entertaining enough, i\'d probably give it somewhere around a 7.7. So why does the anime barely get a 6? Well, simply put, i think the staff and/or the director didn\'t give a flying F when adapting it. Let\'s start with the fact some stuff is omitted. No big deal, happens often, right? Well, i don\'t know, i didn\'t fully read the manga, but considering the short arcs, it might be a pretty bad thing since important things can get lost.But next comes the real bad parts - first, the complete DESTRUCTION of any suspense, dread and horror. Not that the manga had TOO much of it, but they at least didn\'t try brush and laugh off every scary event with silly comedic girly expressions, allowing for a grimmer and more eerie atmosphere, which would best fit a series trying to be similar to stalker/roadside picnic (and it does, it even somewhat succeeds in the manga and the starting of the anime). Next - FULLY changing events and switching around arc chronology without making any edit.Again, i didn\'t really read the manga much, just the points which made no sense, but i\'ll bring up the ones i did stumble on from either reading some and/or the comments outraged at what the anime did and the inconsistency it caused. First of all is the American soldiers. In the manga, the two girls went on a mission to SAVE them. DELIBERATELY. Armed and ready, knowing their goal. They knew where to look. In the anime, they just randomly fall into the otherside and come across them by chance. In the manga, they\'re met with some suspicion, but are welcomed, and soon rescue everyone. In the anime, the girls are met with EXTREME suspicion, despite being unarmed (unlike the manga), they suddenly pull a semi auto sniper from nowhere, somehow trigger some of the soldier\'s suspicion, and then flee (they DO return to save them much later, but in the END of the show instead, they go about it rather differently than in the manga, and because so much time passed since they first encountered them, they made up a \'time progression difference\' thingy because otherwise the soldiers would just starve and/or die off before they made it back), first from them, onto a moving ghost train, then end up half the country across in the real world.Completely different, the new scenario makes way less sense too. It triggers the next episode being even worse, because it isn\'t like in the manga, and to go there, they skipped a few arcs ahead. So, her semi auto sniper is gone, and they\'re half way across the country. What do they do? Beach, of course. On their way there on a taxi, they end up on the otherside again. They STILL wanna swim. They change, swim, have a few beers... Yes, in a HOSTILE, otherworldly environments that killed many and is supposedly extremely dangerous, they went to swim. Furthermore, then they decide to go for target practice, WASTING most of their bullets (again, on the dangerous \'otherside\')... Target practice and bullets..?That\'s right, because they SKIPPED ahead, and didn\'t bother with logic, consistency and chronology, the girls now both got a shiny pair of Makarovs (and i say shiny because they seemed to be so heavily upgraded, they have WAY more bullets in them than any real world counterparts, seemingly capable of well over 20 shots without reload... but its probably just the directors not giving a fuck again), an AK, and some other assault rifle... With a scope. The weapons they got from the Americans in the manga btw, the Americans they ran away from without picking up anything in the anime, yet now now STILL have.So yeah, i wouldn\'t really recommend it to anyone, despite it managing to sometimes (mostly in the start) deliver on that (stalker fan) beloved eerie, slightly horror filled atmosphere of empty, or apparently empty worlds full of unseen danger... 6/10, barely. and other semi or really dangerous anomalies, weird creatures and incomprehensible beings).What is DIFFERENT?

I watched it for the yuri and it's definitely yuri but don't expect anything conclusive, it's in the category of 1-season LN adaptations that can't really go anywhere with the plot or characters. I would basically describe it as being like Jeff VanderMeer's Annihilation trilogy but with drunk college student anime girls instead of scientists.As for the quality of the show...it's uneven to say the least. It feels extremely low budget. There's a lot of CGI here: most of the distance shots are fairly ugly CGI, and many of the monsters...are fairly pathetic CGI. With the exception of a handful of strangely well-animated fight scenes, most of the animation is pretty weak, although the characters do stay on-model consistently.The characters also tend to act in extremely stupid ways to keep the plot moving (why do you guys keep going to the Otherside with minimal preparation?!) Sorawo's powers are confusing, and many of the monsters are hard to understand without reading the LN.That being said, Sorawo and Toriko are cute and likable, and their relationship is adorable. I guess you could say it's almost like a college SOL mixed with mild urban fantasy horror. If you like SCP-style urban legend fantasy stuff, it's in that vein, and it has some good overtures to the deeper thematic horror of that genre, it just doesn't really have the time to develop any of it. There are some fairly disturbing scenes, nice creepy moments, and decent suspense, but nothing that'll keep you up at night–the LN is more successful at having genuinely scary content.I don't know...I just found it difficult to be mad at or dislike this show even though it probably underdelivers on its premise. There's something about the constant tonal whiplash, uneven quality, bizarre plots, the protagonists' insanely cavalier attitude towards the Otherside, and Sorawo pouting that make it a pleasantly bemusing experience. I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like the beach episode, I'll put it that way. If you're desperate for yuri, like creepypasta stuff, and are willing to watch something that isn't really that good, this might be the show for you!

Adachi to Shimamura was a pretty alright anime, but I was hoping this one would be better since it has that fantasy element to it.Boy... I'll just give you bullet points:1) Mediocre soundtrack2) Animation was definitely rushed and the CGI is...INCREDIBLY obvious3) Each episode's plot is extremely rushed (they like to shove in as many chapters as possible for some reason; probably because the anime isn't getting a million episodes)4) No character development or exploration at all.

The two are at odds with their situation as aggressive supernatural entities approach them - Sorawo finds out Toriko is in the other side so she can find her mentor Uruma Satsuki and she spends time helping her out and drowning out her ordinary life's worries. Despite the calming environment in the other side, it is actually home to many supernatural phenomenon seen in...traditional Japanese folklore, the duo experience what the other side has to offer and meet some interesting people. Will they be able to reach their goals?Story & Character: 4/10Urasekai Picnic is an interesting take on yuri, CGDCT, isekai, mystery. The worldbuilding is really expansive and has a lot of promising uncovering of details per episode. However, I think it gets overshadowed by the inconsistencies or just plain cliché horror-genre character decisions scattered throughout the entire series. The story follows 2 female characters and a few side characters who venture in and out of the mysterious otherworld sometimes involuntarily. I think the idea is nice but it just gets inconsistent when that logic bends so the characters can see the portals and avoid them miraculously. Also there are a few character decisions that really relate to the usual uncooperative horror main character especially seen in episode 6: Toriko and Sorawo are told not to use their phones but they us it anyway, leading to the otherworld denizens finding their camp location and ambushing it; Toriko and Sorawo are then told to stay put and not to leave the tent but they leave 3 seconds later. Also earlier in this episode, the two verbally announce they don't have a weapon but after the first 2 predicaments mentioned ^ Toriko somehow assembles an M14 EBR straight from her backpack even though she says she didn't have a gun on her. Some of that really dwelled on my conscience throughout the series which ruined the creative illusion.Art & Sound: 7/10 & 6/10The art is really good in comparison to some much popular series (Fruit of Evolution) and has some nicely 2D character animations especially scene when the stationed US solders are involved. Of course the main girls have high quality as well. The colors were dark when needed and happy most of the time which held a noticeable visual contrast.I didn't really notice music apart from suspense used in the show. The voice acting was above average, consumable but not groundbreaking.Overall & Enjoyment: 4/10I wished this series could have worked more on the consistencies and event layout; Most of the time I had to play catch up so I could understand the connection between each episodic event. Apart from that it had nice art and average isekai execution. traditional Japanese folklore, the duo experience what the other side has to offer and meet some interesting people. Will they be able to reach their goals?Story & Character: 4/10Urasekai Picnic is an interesting take on yuri, CGDCT, isekai, mystery. The worldbuilding is really expansive and has a lot of promising uncovering of details per episode. However, I think it gets overshadowed by the inconsistencies or just plain cliché horror-genre character decisions scattered throughout the entire series. The story follows 2 female characters and a few side characters who venture in and out of the mysterious otherworld sometimes involuntarily. I think the idea is nice but it just gets inconsistent when that logic bends so the characters can see the portals and avoid them miraculously. Also there are a few character decisions that really relate to the usual uncooperative horror main character especially seen in episode 6: Toriko and Sorawo are told not to use their phones but they us it anyway, leading to the otherworld denizens finding their camp location and ambushing it; Toriko and Sorawo are then told to stay put and not to leave the tent but they leave 3 seconds later. Also earlier in this episode, the two verbally announce they don't have a weapon but after the first 2 predicaments mentioned ^ Toriko somehow assembles an M14 EBR straight from her backpack even though she says she didn't have a gun on her. Some of that really dwelled on my conscience throughout the series which ruined the creative illusion.Art & Sound: 7/10 & 6/10The art is really good in comparison to some much popular series (Fruit of Evolution) and has some nicely 2D character animations especially scene when the stationed US solders are involved. Of course the main girls have high quality as well. The colors were dark when needed and happy most of the time which held a noticeable visual contrast.I didn't really notice music apart from suspense used in the show. The voice acting was above average, consumable but not groundbreaking.Overall & Enjoyment: 4/10I wished this series could have worked more on the consistencies and event layout; Most of the time I had to play catch up so I could understand the connection between each episodic event. Apart from that it had nice art and average isekai execution."", ""I have to write this review with the Mixed Feelings recommendation for one main reason, the Girls Love tag is absolute lies. Is one of the MC girls harboring a crush for the other MC Girl? For sure, and maybe that'll be enough for some of you, but when I read GIRLS Love that reads as a promise of romance, not just one sided subtext (MAL even defines the tag as such). I hate that mislabeling here on MAL and it's 90% of the shows labeled GL....label them subtext like they should be ffs.As for the other things about the show: It's actually fine to...good. The story is cool, nothing completely original, but it still holds it's own. It promises horror, but never gets beyond mildly disconcerting (could scare the heck out of some folks made of less stern stuff if I'm being honest). The sound is ok, I see others complaining but I didn't notice anything too off. The art though, that's where this show shines. It's a treat for the eyes in most parts with the character designs, critter designs, and the landscaping all done beautifully.All in all, I was severely let down by the GL tag it has and would've scored higher with me had I not been deceived. good.

However, I expected way more yuri. It was cute I wonder if the light novels make them out to be cuter, I saw a review saying that if you like the characters its better to skip the anime and go straight to the novel there’s so much more depth and the vibes aren't as comedy as the anime. But I don't plan on reading it.The story starts with Toriko finding Sorawo and saving her from loneliness. I relate a lot to Sorawo in the beginning, but her actions are super simpy towards Toriko and we aren't...rewarded with enough yuri scenes to accept this.Its a dystopian genre story where in their normal world you can find gates that takes you to a peaceful but dangerous another world or maybe dimension that they call the otherside. Every episode or almost is about these two characters running into trouble in the other world because of monsters, etc. I quite liked the adventures and the concept but it after finishing these 12 episodes its just not enough to give u a sense of what's happening and why this story is happening. The ambiance of the anime doesn't sit right with me, it's too lighthearted and comical about death.Overall it was enjoyable and I am going to watch season 2. rewarded with enough yuri scenes to accept this.Its a dystopian genre story where in their normal world you can find gates that takes you to a peaceful but dangerous another world or maybe dimension that they call the otherside.

The world design, at first glance, was actually quite cool. I kind of liked the post-apocalyptic elements of the Otherside. The soundtracks that played when they were in the Otherside also pretty much sold how eerie and intense the exploration is gonna be like....but that's not what happened.What we got were mostly boring fights that I'm pretty sure 99% of them involves running away. The most effective way of fighting ofc. And when it DOESN'T involve running away, it usually ends very...quickly and easily. That's just not a good fight writing.The yuri relationship pretty much didn't go anywhere by the end of it all. Sorao's character is pretty half-assed, and CAN I JUST SAY THIS? I really don't like the continuity problems related to Sorao's contact lenses. Like, sometimes she puts them on, sometimes she doesn't. And somehow, none of the people around her noticed this stuffs. Like, if Liden Films ain't gonna care about these sorts of detail, how am I gonna feel immersed in the story being told?Toriko also just straight up dismissed Satsuki at the end, the main reason behind her eagerness to explore the Otherside. I know that it was said at the end that t's been three months ever since they both started doing stuffs together, but by the way this anime is made by Liden Films, it really only felt like a couple weeks.Also, you know how I said at the start that I thought the world design was quite cool? Welp, the world design turned out to be a pile of mess. We weren't told clearly, if at all, about the origins of the Otherside. Like, the explanation just flew by. Cuz, all of them, we switched from a post-apocalyptic world into.... a cat world? And then, some occult fights happened IN THE REAL WORLD and NOT THE OTHERSIDE? Like it's as if the studio didn't wanna fully explore the world itself, even though they have the materials given.If I wanna end this review with a silver lining, I'll just say the OP theme of this anime FUCKING BOPS! Easily a contender for OP of the season. It gave me excitement everytime I start continuing watching, and the lyrics also pretty much told a story in itself.The FIVE in my review score also pretty much represents the final FIVE minutes of this anime, cause it is quite wholesome and very beautiful.

The one specific thing I\'ll say now is that there are some static shots of things like our characters among people standing in the city where the complete lack of motion in the people standing around just doesn\'t look right at all. There\'s one other visual thing I want to mention but I\'ll bring it up later.The OP and ED are both fun songs, though only the OP is actually memorable to me. The sound design within the show is pretty standard suspenseful horror fare for the most part,...but it\'s competently executed for what it is. The main audio-related complaint I would give is about the marines in the episodes where they show up. These guys are supposed to be native English speakers and they have a whole bunch of English lines. Only one or two of them have a large number of Japanese lines. So the VAs could\'ve been better at English than this. The fact that they\'re clearly not is a particularly rough hit to the overall production value of their scenes from a native English speaker\'s viewpoint.The supporting cast is pretty flimsy, but Toriko and Sorawo are reasonably well developed, in personality if not backstory. Their ""opposites attract"" kind of chemistry is pretty intense without leaning too hard into blatant trope indulgence. (Disclaimer: I am completely unfamiliar with yuri, and have little familiarity with romance anime as well, so I don\'t have much of a frame of reference here.) That connection is backed up by a lot of trust in high-stakes situations, which gets justified by their successes in those situations. Those successes usually feel earned even if they do sometimes feel a bit conveniently timed and located.Now for the main meat of the review, which is pretty much all negatives about the story.The story is quite shaky throughout, though some of that can be forgiven on the grounds that it\'s centered around something that is meant to be mysterious. Still, I see some pretty serious problems already.First, they don\'t really do a very good job of explaining why Toriko and Sorawo keep going to the ""Otherside"" voluntarily at all. I understand that ultimately they\'re going to, it\'s literally what the show is about; even a single episode with no supernatural stuff would probably be panned as filler. But still, it needs more expansion than it got.Toriko is just trying to find Satsuki, but we still have no clear picture of why Satsuki is important to her. Sorawo, after the first time, seems to just want to hang out with Toriko, but can\'t seem to persuade her to stay in the normal world. Sorawo also doesn\'t seem to have anything else important to her going on in her own life (she\'s a university student but they don\'t even mention what year or what she\'s studying). That feels quite contrived. There also seems to be a dynamic where they want to use selling stuff they found in the Otherside to fund a hedonistic lifestyle together, which...definitely creates an undertone that the show is allegorically promoting drug abuse in a way that I\'m sure they didn\'t intend.Anyway, perhaps they are just going for a simple star-crossed lovers kind of motive for Sorawo to go to the Otherside. In this case there is still a problem: because Toriko\'s precise situation isn\'t clear, it\'s not apparent why Sorawo thinks Toriko is even available as a love interest. What if Satsuki is alive just fine and Toriko just wants to be with her and friendzone Sorawo? Obviously for trope reasons that\'s not gonna happen, but the show hasn\'t sold me on that within its own world, even after a whole season.VAGUE SPOILER: on the upside, they end up making several involuntary trips, which helps a little, but not a lot.Second, the Lovecraftian-ness of the concept is hurting the show from both sides. On the one hand, it is too Lovecraftian, in the sense that the Otherside never really makes sense and you just have to roll with each scene there as its own thing. Just about the only rules presented so far are the excuses for the use of the two leads\' superpowers. Relatedly, the fact that only they appear to have such powers seems remarkably contrived, given how little trouble was required for them to obtain their powers.On the other hand, it\'s not Lovecraftian enough, because it doesn\'t really seem the slightest bit maddening from our perspective. There are weird-looking, aggressive creatures, but it almost never feels like it\'s impossible that they could exist. The most powerful creatures seem to be able to strongly manipulate perception by using the victim\'s feelings. There are invisible (to most people but not Sorawo) ""glitches"" littered all over the place that basically act like landmines (although references seem to be made to glitches that do other stuff, this is never really fleshed out). Also, Sorawo gets so competent at spotting and avoiding glitches that they only really feature prominently in one or two episodes. That\'s pretty much it, other than all the stuff about how you get there. And the two leads don\'t really seem to be going insane from all their time spent there, either.There was only one scene, the scene in which the two leads get their powers, where we get a clear glimpse into the capacity that the Otherside has to make visitors go insane...but from our perspective it was pretty much just depicted as Sorawo babbling incoherently. Maybe what she said will make more sense later, but I doubt it.Third, the structure of something like half the episodes is ""there\'s an urban legend that Sorawo knows off the top of her head, it is literally true because of some contact with the Otherside, they encounter the monster from the legend, they kill the monster, nothing else changes"". There\'s a way to make that format fun, but it is not the way that this show is initially set up. As a result these episodes, which seem to clash with the overall format of the show and also don\'t really progress any larger plot, feel more like filler than anything else.Finally, this season has no ending. They wrap up an arc, the leads do a thing that helps them be more prepared for subsequent Otherside visits, and the leads have an extremely indirect heart-to-heart chat. That\'s it. The only real sources of a sequel hook are the leads\' romance and the pending mystery about Satsuki\'s status. It\'s also not even really clear that there\'s romantic interest, even though for genre reasons there clearly is.I read the four volumes of the LN currently available in English. I will confine my commentary to the first two, since most of the anime is restricted to their content.Simply put, most of the problems above are either created or exacerbated by the anime. In particular, the first volume, corresponding to episodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, largely avoids the issue of too many voluntary trips to the Otherside, the issue of why Sorawo is interested in going there at all, and the weird ""too Lovecraftian but not Lovecraftian enough"" vibe. The characterization is also done better, in part because the LN is written from Sorawo\'s perspective. So Toriko is still pretty flat, but you feel like you want to get to know her better because of your connection to Sorawo, while Sorawo herself is developed quite well. That said the first volume of the LN doesn\'t really have an ending, either, so there is that.That gets even worse with the second volume. The second half of the anime is trying way too hard to make the episodes start and end ""cleanly"", along with shoehorning in more time with the supporting character Akari than we really needed. In the process, they end up delaying the resolution of the plot line set up in episodes 5 and 6 for no good reason except to put a climax near the end of the season. And then they have no time at the end to get to the bulk of ""File 8"" (the last quarter of the second volume), which is where the story actually opens up. It\'s like they don\'t want to make a sequel anime even if someone would pay for it! but it\'s competently executed for what it is.

For one, I feel that the Otherside is not fully realized. They do provide exposition of what the Otherside is, but the way that the anime presents in, we are already launched skin deep into the story without fully explaining how these characters discovered the Otherside, nor how the dimension works as there are many ways that someone could accidentally wind up in the Otherside.While the Otherside is a very interesting concept, it felt more like a backdrop to establish the setting of the series. Because of this, there isn\'t much investment that...one can take in the story due to it barely scratching below the surface of the inner mechanisms of the world.Animation. It is serviceable, that I can guarantee, and some shots of the Otherside do look adequate. When it comes to representing the monsters, however, a lot of the action/intense scenes are blatantly CGI-animated that it takes you out of the scene if you think too much about it.

Sorawo and Toriko are the lead characters and they do have great chemistry with each other I won\'t deny that. Sorawo is someone who starts off introverted and would rather be by her lonesome. This does make her hard to like at first because she really isn\'t much of a ""hero"" at the beginning. She was someone who could come across as cowardly and would have to be pushed by Toriko to save people.

The rich atmosphere and meticulous design that Manglobe brought to Ergo Proxy and Witch Hunter Robin would have been a perfect match for Otherside Picnic, but sadly that studio doesn\'t exist any more.While I haven\'t read the source material, the Otherside Picnic anime feels like a competent adaptation. The problem is that some stories demand something other than off-the-peg anime aesthetics. I\'m aware that the novels and manga used the same character designs, but they just don\'t fit the story. The animators do manage to pull...off some eerie moments in places, but for the most part the bright colours, poorly judged use of stiff CG for mundane scenes, and overall look of the series fall short of what the story needs. It\'s the same feeling I got watching the competent but safely attractive Boogiepop & Others after experiencing the unsettling brutality of Boogiepop Phantom.It\'s a shame because Otherside Picnic is that rarest of beasts: an old-school, horror-tinged isekai that puts some actual effort into its world-building and gives us an otherworld that feels truly alien and threatening. In an anime landscape drenched in the worst kind of self-referential, generic RPG power-fantasy isekai, this series should have flattened the competition, but its merely competent adaptation undermines it.None of this is to say it\'s a bad series; far from it. There are some solid episodes here. It\'s just that adaptations of a lot of manga and light novels can get away with a ""good enough"" approach to the art and direction, and this isn\'t one of them. off some eerie moments in places, but for the most part the bright colours, poorly judged use of stiff CG for mundane scenes, and overall look of the series fall short of what the story needs.

Otherside Picnic... should not have been the one to try.Story: Our story in Otherside Picnic starts out with us seeing Sorawo in the middle of nowhere when another character, Toriko, finds her.  They escape seemingly dangerous situations and return home with some supernatural items over the course of the first few episodes that they want to sell off for cash.  Soon after, we learn that Sorawo stumbled upon this place by chance where as Toriko is looking for a friend of hers, Satsuki....This is essentially the basis of the story and isn\'t the worst setup in the world.This place that the girls were in is then dubbed ""Otherside"" and it seems to be a world entirely separate from the real world - think Digital World from Digimon.  In fact, the girls seem to be able to access the Otherside at will, simply by finding a gate location..  Over the course of the series, they go back and forth between worlds with some minor conversations in between.  One curious decision is the use of guns: Why do the guns scare these seemingly dangerous supernatural beings as much as they do?  They\'re literally using pistols, for the most part.  A large bulk of these beings are spiritual and apparently, the firearms do away with them.  Why?  What\'s the point of your monster designs at that point?  It goes off way too easily.The story is incredibly shallow. Everything I have described is basically how deep it gets with the odd curveball thrown in there.  The whole series seemed to set you up as to say ""Yes, we\'re going back to this world to find Satsuki"", but that doesn\'t explain a) How they\'ll find her, b) How they know she\'s there and c) Why Sorawo is there through all this.  That last point kind of gets touched upon at the end but there really isn\'t anything answered and the base of the story is left completely unsolved by the time the ending rolls around.Everything in between left much to be desired as well.  There was very little in the way of meaningful conversations and we weren\'t really given an idea of how these girls get a hold of their seemingly infinite supply of guns.  They\'re clearly not meant to have them in Japan... so where?  How do they know the meaning of the Otherside?  How do they how to access it?  I simply don\'t understand where this series was going because it didn\'t have a real goal and the characters never really solve anything.  (2/10)Characters: The characters don\'t fare much better.  Sorawo has some okay qualities in that she goes through with what she wants to do, but then gets cold feet when it\'s time to act.  But she really doesn\'t do enough that kept my attention.  Toriko is a little more exuberant and I find it pretty funny that she knows how to wield a gun when her background is of Canadian roots (where guns aren\'t allowed to the general public...).  They just form a really strange main cast.  Oddly enough, this is also labeled Shoujo-Ai, when there\'s very little chemistry or romance as well.  It plays out almost as if two friends are trying to do something.The side characters don\'t fair better in that no one really lasts longer than a couple episodes.  Kozakura spends all day complaining to whatever the girls come to her with and apart from being an okay hand-to-hand fighter, Akari isn\'t really interesting either.  The characters top to bottom just don\'t interest me at all and I\'m sure the story isn\'t helping their case.  (2/10)Art: The supernatural designs were okay, but aside that, the art direction was decently consistent.  Some of the Otherside being\'s were shockingly static though and it looks really poor.  The transitions from the real world to the Otherside were passable, but again, didn\'t do much to the story.  Early on, Sorawo gains the ability to see ""glitches"", which basically just unmask supernatural beings and the vision they gave during these sequences were also okay.  It looks fine in general, but nothing really wowed me.  (6/10)Sound: The OST choice is... interesting.  It was looking to be really spooky and play out like a supernatural show, but the art certainly didn\'t inspire any amount of fear, despite what our characters see.  There wasn\'t anything terribly threatening and these inconsistencies can\'t be overlooked.  The Japanese VAs were fine for what they were, as were the OP and EDs. (6/10)Overall Enjoyment: I really don\'t get what they were trying to accomplish here.  The story is full of holes, the cast were boring and the art and sound were simply passable.  I got halfway through, didn\'t enjoy it, and figured I\'d finish it for the sake of finishing it.  No, it wasn\'t worth it.

Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/886/Amaenaide_yo_Katsu,"[""I’ve decided that instead of writing two reviews for both series I am going to talk about both in this review, with the most focus on the Katsu!! sequel, as it is the better of the two, though only marginally.  Now before you fanboys out there who loved this show get all worked up I have a couple comments to make before I get to the meat of my opinions.  This show is pretty much pure echii, and I don’t mind echii, that’s not the reason this show is getting low marks.  If the only thing you want is to see cute...girls in various states of undress then this is probably your show but I think if you really looked at yourself honestly you too would admit this show is very ordinary and below average.The story is pretty simple and uncomplicated.  Spirits appear which forces a girl to take her clothes off or either have them taken off for her or ripped off... rinse... repeat next episode with a different girl.  It’s still pretty funny in a lot of places and I did laugh a bit, but it gets boring after a while.  The first season sets up a lot of things that happen in the 2nd series.  And the plot does get more detailed and interesting however it fails to live up to what you expected in the end.  I don’t want to give away and details on it but let’s just say it feels like it’s going to be this big ending and it turns out to be kind of a dud. Of course for me the big peeve is the relationship between Ikkou and Chitose.  It’s pretty much implied that they like each other, more on Chitose's side as she pines for him and gets jealous almost the entire series but as usual in these kind of series we are left without any resolution in the end and things are pretty much exactly the same as they were in the beginning.The characters are simplistic and boring.  They follow the standard stereotypes and pretty much add nothing of interest to distinguish them from any other series out there.  Your pretty much assured to find a girl in the group you like whether its moe, tsunderes, lolis, or manly types.  Ikkou is your standard wussy useless male nosebleeder.  The cast is fairly small which is one thing the show has working for it; it allows you plenty of screen time with the important characters.  The development is small for all of them, all the girls have episodes involving them and explaining their special power and mastering their power however the ending arc doesn’t really make much use of this.  Ikkou gets a little better at not being such a pervert and not awakening every time he sees a boob but again like the girls and their powers this doesn’t seem like it makes much difference in the end either.Animation and music wise this series is pretty strong.  I love the character designs, the girls are all very adorable and well drawn and... healthy looking.  Ikkou despite being a wimp at least looks like a man.  The acting is good and the girls all have voices that match their personalities.  All the music is great and it’s very catchy. girls in various states of undress then this is probably your show but I think if you really looked at yourself honestly you too would admit this show is very ordinary and below average.The story is pretty simple and uncomplicated.

As stated from my previous review on the prequel, having knowledge about Buddhism will be of great help in understanding the story. The anime clarifies many issues that surfaced in Amaenaide yo! (ie. who were those suspicious looking monks, why does Ikkou have such tremendous power, and who was the monk eating ice cream with Jotoku baa etc.). Of course it is absolutely recommended to finish Amaenaide yo! before watching the sequel!Similar to the first season, Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! is also very episodic. Thus one...can literally jump around watching the episodes in different orders and still won\'t be confused with the overall storyline (not recommended though). However, unlike the random day-to-day events from the first season, this time the show focus on how the girls harness and master their powers while at the same time aid Ikkou to better understand his unique talent. The overall story gets a bit more complicated than the first season as to be expect due to uncovering the mysteries from before, but it still remains easy to comprehend nonetheless.The animation quality is similar to the previous season. For those who are familiar with the producer, Studio DEEN (products include:Fate/stay night, Rurouni Kenshin,Vampire Knight, and the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni series) has a pretty good reputation for its high level animation quality.Many types of ecchi scenes made their way to the screen in this sequel (there\'s even one involving DOGS o.0). Most of these scenes does not really contribute much to the story, but as weird as it may sound, some of these ecchi scenes does help act as stepping stones for the character developments.Beside a slightly better OP and ED, everything else is pretty much a recycle of the previous season (ie. not bad). There were no changes to the voice actors role as well so everything should be pretty standard for those who have already seen the first season (which everyone should do before watching Katsu!!)The addition of the uber ""kawaii"" Kazuki Kazusano to Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! really made this sequel much more interesting to watch as a whole. Voiced by Asami Sanada, Kazuki, the antagonist of the show, really brought the ecchiness to a whole new level (not quite the level of Kanokon, but quite close).Additionally, the original casts also have further character developments (which was extremely lacking in the previous season). Many of their secret pasts have been revealed along with their reasons to becoming a nun/monk. While there are still plenty of room for improvement in this department, overall I feel the production crew have done a much better job for this season.Seeing how the manga is still publishing, there is quite a high chance that someday we will be hearing more from this series. For a one season anime (two if you count Amaenaide yo!), the show is entertaining enough to make you ""marathon"" the anime in one go. If you like ecchi anime then you would not want to miss this!

Mata joudo!', ""After watching both seasons, I am still baffled by the fact that the main protagonist put up with the girls, who are unreasonable, violent and extremely selfish. But then again, who cares, it's a harem anime, and most of the harem protagonists are dumb. Let's move on.The work is average in the sense that it fulfills the criteria of being a harem anime, although their jokes are not funny and the character development-wait a minute, there wasn't character development. If you are looking for an interesting series with sense and storyline, this is not where you should be looking. "", 'This review will encompass both seasons of Amaenaide yo.The first season was verging on a waste of my time. I had just gotten off of watching Clannad After Story and wanted an anime that didn\'t require much thought or an anime that dished out deep emotional drama. I came to rest on Amaenaide yo. Pleasing to my eye with its ecchi, harem, and romance aspect, but also appealing was the fact that it had a second season. With most animes that I watch, ones with sequels (I\'m referring to the first season now) tend to score higher because I know the show isn\'t ""complete""...yet and things that are left unresolved tend to be resolved within the second. This is where the deficiencies in, not only season one, but season two start to become all too apparent. I\'ll get to that a little later. However the first season of Amaenaide yo gets a ""4"" from me for these reasons:Cons:- No character development- No plot development- Episodic storyline- Annoying/uninteresting characters- Reused/unfunny jokesPros:- The ""ecchi"" was nicely integrated- I was at first iffy on the animation style, but I ended up loving itOn to the second season: Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!!This one is so much better than the first. Adding a backstory to every relevant character (not Chitose or Ikkou, though...?) was a nice touch to the anime; the story also got better and deeper; Ikkou\'s powers were transformed from a solely perverted side, to an actual plot revolving around his powers that was relevant to the storyline; the introduction of Kazuki as a person who not only served as ""competition"" for Chitose, but, one could tell, had malicious intent with regards to Ikkou added another layer of interest to the anime.That being said, I watched this story, like all others that I watch, for the romantic aspect. And this season did a much better job playing to that front than the first. The jealousy etched on Chitose\'s face was funny and satisfying whenever Kazuki made a move for Ikkou, more romantic moments, etc. I use the word satisfying because it expels all doubt about her liking or not liking Ikkou. And, being an anime-watcher that likes resolutions to romantic animes, I thought the show was headed in the right direction... right up until the very last episode.The anime was looking so promising, then it inexplicably reverted back to season one\'s ways - like nothing they had previously gone through had happened. They ended the season with season one-like antics that I\'m sure this anime had long since waved goodbye to. Unfortunately, this left a bitter taste in my mouth (as well as other things). However, do not throw this anime away, into the garbage pile all because you saw the first season. If you\'re a person that enjoys ecchi, some romance, a harem aspect (only in the second season!), some good storytelling elements thrown in, and someone that doesn\'t mind an ending that isn\'t terribly satisfying, I would definitely recommend you watch this anime.Overall: 6 yet and things that are left unresolved tend to be resolved within the second.

The same characters show up in this series, and of course just like in the first season, Ikkou is being constantly told not to rely on his strange power and is still being scolded by all the main character girls including Chitose. The main antagonist in this installment is a first year student named Kazuki, and yes...she's beutiful. In my opinion Kazuki is the best female character, she's very cute, and likes to show off her hot bod. Unlike the rest of the female characters, Kazuki is in love with Ikkou. Kazuki tries her best to impress Ikkou and make Chitose leave Ikkou alone. Kazuki also want to help guide Ikkous powers in the right direction and she believes that his powers are good and that it's okay for him to awaken. She gradually relizes that Ikkou still likes Chitose even though he denies it throughout the series. Chitose actually without saying she loves Ikkou shows her love to him. So now Ikkou has both Chitose and Kazuki who love him to death but Kazuki leaves ends up leaving and goes off to train but vows when she comes back Ikkou would be hers.This is a very good anime please enjoy it if you watch. If you like this review please email me and tell me so and i will write some more K.ANIME ROCKS OUT LOUD. she's beutiful.

Every episode felt like a filler having no connection with one another.No story at all and some fan service but not even that one was great.Hinata was my favourite and i was completly sure they will mock her and so they did.I have to say i was a little surprised by the upgrade the 2nd season was.In short words first season felt like a bunch of specials that weren't interesting the the least yet 2nd season felt normal just like the anime should've been from the beggining ""]"
Aiura,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17082/Aiura,"[""With the episodes only 3 minutes each, THIGHura wastes no time delivering what it does best, delicious thighs and fresh voice acting.It's an adaption of a 4 koma slice of life, so don't expect much plot or progression. This show has great animation to make up for this though, and coupled with its bright colour palette and characters, it'll easily make your day a little more cheerful.Watch if for the:- ドンマイ- Thighs- Voice acting earsex "", ""I fell in love with Kanaka Amaya!! i really like this anime because they're so funny especially Kanaka who makes me really llove this anime.. every episode was very nice that it makes you beg for more because of it short time,,, it also makes you rewatch it again and again.. the only thing that i don't like in aiura is the time..seriously, only 4 minutes and 12 episodes? with epic characters?! no way!but still i rate it 10/10 "", 'Anime shorts are quickly becoming a new trend in the industry, and while quite a few people see them as nothing more than annoyances and most times space consuming drivel, it really isn’t the case, as they more than in one way help to promote the industry. They can be viewed as akin to indie developers, there are a lot of animation studios in japan but not all of them have the manpower or prowess to continuously dish out 24 minute episodes for 12 weeks. Shorts give a chance for the smaller studios to make a name for themselves using very limited resources, and just...as ‘The Walking Dead’, an indie game, won the 2012 VGA, some smaller companies are capable of producing something special.One of the rules of writing is never to use a single word several times in your work in relation to its length, so I hope you’ll forgive me as I’m going to use the word ‘adorable’ several times in this review.This 4-Koma adaptation follows the lives of 3 high school girls; Saki, Kanaka and Ayuko. At first glance Aiura doesn’t seem to have much going for it, the 3 lead girls are indeed adorable in both design and personality but it looks like something that can get old pretty quickly, delve a little bit more into this show and you’ll find that…..it’s actually more than enough.‘Slice of life’ from the name itself we know entails something inspired from everyday life but most of these shows use a ‘dream approach’, inserting characters in situations where very few normal folks actually get to experience, but Aiura is surprisingly something that is seriously rooted in real life, the sheer relatable scenarios and interactions between characters give it an extremely natural, casual and life like feel that makes it a times seem like a reality show shot with hidden cameras. The jokes and antics are also extremely adorable and heart-warming but unfortunately I can’t claim if it’s something that will be up everybody’s alley, luckily enough the length of the show ensures that 2 episodes (~6 minutes w/o OP/ED) is more than enough for you to decide if it’s something you want to continue.As far as production values go, the show performed well above average than most of its other anime short counterparts, a lot of resources were put into character designs resulting in an art style that more close to adorable than moe. Animation was also surprisingly something that wasn’t cut back on, characters are always in motion but the over budgeting of some scenes may result in characters performing rather over extravagant movements. As a lot of effort was put into the design of characters and animations, it’s no surprise that everything else was sub-par; in particular the design of the environments and landscape was unfortunately quirky and poor.A HELL of a lot of praise has to be given to the seiyuus, they really bought the girls alive despite all three making their debuts in this show, they are really prospective star seiyuus that we will hope to hear more from in the future, I will be lying if I said I didn’t have a nosebleed a couple of times, in short, the seiyuus were adorable. The animation and series of montages shown from the OP is something extremely unique and memorable as it features several alluring designs of doting crabs and Steve Jobs striking several gestures and poses of world domination, not to mention the several adorable chibi designs of the girls.Despite the very natural feel of the show and main characters, the supporting characters kind of brought the show down a bit, most of them had quite farfetched personalities, from a teacher that dresses as a student to one that gives very a little damn about what she says and how she acts around her students, it all adds up to the shows biggest backdrop, it hardly has any serious moments. This may sound like a strange thing coming from a comedy show but the show is over excessive in its use of gags and jokes and rarely ever shifts to a serious tone for even a second.The interaction between the girls is prime example of the phrase ‘fun to watch’; when all three are on screen the show truly sparkles, a lot of kudos has to be given to the writers for coming up with a script that flows so seamlessly and natural from line to line. Kanaka’s gags and pranks are a joy, with Saki and Ayuko’s response even more of a heart warmer. However it’s not always perfect in tinsel town; Kanaka’s baka personality isn’t always solemn as always intended, Saki’s cold attitude seems a bit antagonistic a times and Ayuko seems from time to time a bit out of place in the group, making up for a cast of slightly weak characters.However,In my opinion, the characters are purposely flawed, another impressive note the writers have managed to introduce is how one character is able more times than often, to balance or cover for another’s weakness, usually in one person’s response to another’s show of weakness. The result of this is an almost complete concealment of an individual character’s flaw and a further improvement to characterization than if the character already started out without any flaws at all.The first sentence of the ED reads: “They were pointless conversations, but they were fun the nonetheless”, this more than explains the whole ethic of the show, a directionless tale of everyday life driven by a very interesting cast of characters, slice of life has never been so Adorable. as ‘The Walking Dead’, an indie game, won the 2012 VGA, some smaller companies are capable of producing something special.One of the rules of writing is never to use a single word several times in your work in relation to its length, so I hope you’ll forgive me as I’m going to use the word ‘adorable’ several times in this review.This 4-Koma adaptation follows the lives of 3 high school girls; Saki, Kanaka and Ayuko. At first glance Aiura doesn’t seem to have much going for it, the 3 lead girls are indeed adorable in both design and personality but it looks like something that can get old pretty quickly, delve a little bit more into this show and you’ll find that…..it’s actually more than enough.‘Slice of life’ from the name itself we know entails something inspired from everyday life but most of these shows use a ‘dream approach’, inserting characters in situations where very few normal folks actually get to experience, but Aiura is surprisingly something that is seriously rooted in real life, the sheer relatable scenarios and interactions between characters give it an extremely natural, casual and life like feel that makes it a times seem like a reality show shot with hidden cameras. The jokes and antics are also extremely adorable and heart-warming but unfortunately I can’t claim if it’s something that will be up everybody’s alley, luckily enough the length of the show ensures that 2 episodes (~6 minutes w/o OP/ED) is more than enough for you to decide if it’s something you want to continue.As far as production values go, the show performed well above average than most of its other anime short counterparts, a lot of resources were put into character designs resulting in an art style that more close to adorable than moe. Animation was also surprisingly something that wasn’t cut back on, characters are always in motion but the over budgeting of some scenes may result in characters performing rather over extravagant movements. As a lot of effort was put into the design of characters and animations, it’s no surprise that everything else was sub-par; in particular the design of the environments and landscape was unfortunately quirky and poor.A HELL of a lot of praise has to be given to the seiyuus, they really bought the girls alive despite all three making their debuts in this show, they are really prospective star seiyuus that we will hope to hear more from in the future, I will be lying if I said I didn’t have a nosebleed a couple of times, in short, the seiyuus were adorable. The animation and series of montages shown from the OP is something extremely unique and memorable as it features several alluring designs of doting crabs and Steve Jobs striking several gestures and poses of world domination, not to mention the several adorable chibi designs of the girls.Despite the very natural feel of the show and main characters, the supporting characters kind of brought the show down a bit, most of them had quite farfetched personalities, from a teacher that dresses as a student to one that gives very a little damn about what she says and how she acts around her students, it all adds up to the shows biggest backdrop, it hardly has any serious moments. This may sound like a strange thing coming from a comedy show but the show is over excessive in its use of gags and jokes and rarely ever shifts to a serious tone for even a second.The interaction between the girls is prime example of the phrase ‘fun to watch’; when all three are on screen the show truly sparkles, a lot of kudos has to be given to the writers for coming up with a script that flows so seamlessly and natural from line to line. Kanaka’s gags and pranks are a joy, with Saki and Ayuko’s response even more of a heart warmer. However it’s not always perfect in tinsel town; Kanaka’s baka personality isn’t always solemn as always intended, Saki’s cold attitude seems a bit antagonistic a times and Ayuko seems from time to time a bit out of place in the group, making up for a cast of slightly weak characters.However,In my opinion, the characters are purposely flawed, another impressive note the writers have managed to introduce is how one character is able more times than often, to balance or cover for another’s weakness, usually in one person’s response to another’s show of weakness.

Sure it's only 4 minutes and you can finish it in less than an hour, but I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't be a very fun hour. Aiura will just keep you in a good mood, and for that alone I recommend it. Each episode has a different story from the rest, but each one is pretty funny, and none of them are bad. The characters are all very funny, all 3 of them (plus the teacher, who is like the second best teacher ever). I'm sure you'll like all three girls....The animation is very nice, and I like the character designs. The best part of this show though, is its opening. This is one of my favorite openings, simply for the fact that it combines crabs and Steve Jobs. The randomness! The best part is that that Jobs died of cancer, which the crab is the zodiac of. Yeah, a little messed up if that was their goal, but every time I see the opening I just burst out into laughter because I always see something different each time. Watch this show if only for the opening. The animation is very nice, and I like the character designs. The best part of this show though, is its opening.

Watch this show if only for the opening."", ""Story: This anime is very short because it's twelve four-minute episodes, so it doesn't have much story to it. I like story as much as the next person, but because this is about the lives of three best friends in high school, I really don't mind it at all. Though there are moments that I ask myself why a certain scene exists, I just don't focus on it as much. With that said, I rate this portion a 9/10.Art: Unless the stuff I usually watch, this anime is very cutesy in art. The style is much simpler than the styles used in anime such as...Black Bullet, Ouran, and all that stuff. Still, I love it all the same because I don't see anything that's annoying. It also gives my eyes a break from not seeing so many things in one place, you know. 10/10Sound: The beginning theme, I just skip over because it takes up most of the anime time, and it's not that enjoyable to listen to, but I know why it's there. The beginning of the anime is where all of the energy is, and the end is usually much calmer, which leads to the very cute ending theme. I can just listen to the ending all day without getting bored of it. I'd also give this a 9/10.Character: Most people could say that characters in an anime like this make it super annoying. I don't find that to be the case. The three main girls, Saki, Kanaka, and Ayuko are very enjoyable. You have your energetic type, the serious one, and the girl who just sits back and lets things happen. Some of the background characters are enjoyable, too, even though they aren't in the episode that much. The homeroom teacher is so chill that I don't mad at her for doing nothing as much. 10/10Enjoyment: This is all really cute and relaxing. This is not like some other shorts that tries to be funny by putting over exaggerated moments in them. This anime is really calm, and we need stuff like this. Just a slice of life that's really about life. If you're a person who wants to see actiony or very funny things, this anime may not be for you, but for relaxing purposes, give this a watch. 10/10Overall: I don't have really much to put in this section because I pretty much explained it all above. The conclusion score is a rounded up 10/10. Black Bullet, Ouran, and all that stuff. Still, I love it all the same because I don't see anything that's annoying.

I was wrong.While the show runs for 12 episodes and has a total running time of 66 minutes, the actual show itself, barring the repeated use of OPs and EDs boils down to only 32 minutes of ACTUAL content.And while the art and voice direction is very polished, the whole thing is soiled by a disappointing display of mediocre slice of life that surprises no one. There\'s absolutely nothing new here if you\'re...even remotely familiar with the genre. Many have been quick to defend this show on account of the girls\' beautifully rotoscoped interactions with their legwear, but even that doesn\'t do enough to distract from the disappointing mediocrity that is Aiura.This show leaves no lasting impressions except for a sense of innate aggravation that you may or may not experience after sitting through 3 minutes of absolutely nothing and then skipping through 2 EDs and an OP only to experience 3 more minutes of nothing. The story goes nowhere, and some might even wonder why some characters were even introduced at all, because you just want to see more of them and they never appear again. A real squandering of story-telling potential, if you may. That alone hurts more deeply than having sat through this show.As a final note, the final 3 minute ""episode"" isn\'t even a real episode.Rather, it is merely a retracing of the first episode, only with the girls wearing different outfits.No closure, no real ending.

However, Aiura does a good job of having nothing happen in a comfortable, realistic manner. Nothing all that extraordinary happens, nothing feels out of place, and everything seems seemingly plausible. It never tries hard to get a punch line across. Rather, it tells sorts of jokes you and your friends might experience. Laid back, relaxing, chuckle-worthy humor that becomes an inside joke for the next few years. It's all quite enjoyable, and it never feels stilted or rehearsed. Everything is fluid and organic in this work.Art:Beautiful backdrops, smooth animation, Aiura looks fantastic. I'm talking excellent. The only issue...I had was one frame seemed unfinished, and there were a few reused shots, albeit recolored characters.Sound:Fitting soundtrack with good intro and outro songs. Not only that, the VA work is impressive. It's as natural as VA work can get. There wasn't anything over the top for the characters to call upon top-tier VA work, and there was a song that was used a lot throughout the short runtime, so I can't go 10/10 on this score, but it's still very, very good stuff.Character:Each of the 3 mains are unique. Not only that, while they are influenced by some tropes, they are, in themselves, separate from your stereotypical triune cast. They're witty, friendly, and a lot of fun. Not only that, everyone has great character design and exemplifies different characteristics that are all realistic and fun. Granted, one teacher is in the show for barely 2 episodes, and her only purpose is to be 'cute,' so that was unnecessary. Either way, it doesn't boggle much down in the finished product.Enjoyment:I'm always wary with SoL productions, especially 3-minute ones. However, this one was astonishing. It was a ton of fun to watch, and I'm very disappointed that this show wasn't a 22-minute per episode production. Granted, many of my praises may have been stretched thin in that run-time, so I'm quite content with the current product, but I'm definitely hooked on the franchise and will check out the 4-koma along with keeping an eye out for a S2.((If you liked this review, check out my other reviews by going to my profile and clicking the 'reviews' tab.

I mean, i understands the amount of repetitive work, difficulty of synchronizing sounds with animations or mouth movement, and keeping their art qualities. But 2 min of an actual fucking content? Aiura could\'ve been made into a fun to watch slice of life anime if it wasn\'t for that 2 min of an actual content. Although, Iwasawa Saki thighs (other as well, but hers was the best... xd) definitely compensates for...the lack of content, and opportunity for different form of story development, or a character development in general just to make the story, a good story to watch at the very least. Type in, ""Aiura thighs"" in google images man. Or just watch the anime. THIGHS ARE FUCKING EVERYWHERE! But i like that idea tho. Most anime tend to focus their camera work on boobies, or a person\'s entire face. Thighs is new for me. I guess that works too.Btw, the OP is 1 min long.

I definitely think this show panders to some demographic I'm not a part of, because it's overly sweet. Nevertheless, I like it for being cute. I'd like it more if it weren't ONLY cute.

The show itself is only like 3 minutes since it had an opening and ending song. There is not plot what so every in this anime. Everything seemed really random and funny at the same time. It had its moments and downsides. If you plan to watch this don't expect much from it unless you are killing time. "", ""Alrighty, so here we have another short duration anime. They're actually pretty good and there ins't much to fault on this one. Apart from the fact that you're sat there begging for something totally cool to happen or just something to spice up the show a little bit. But to be fair, since its only 3 minutes long you can't really expect muchHere we have a simple slice of life about 3 girls who are preparing to start high school. Nothing much was happening in this show apart from the 3 girls developing their friendship and managing their experience in high school. There are different...yet very simple scenarios such as chit chats in the classroom, visiting each others houses, studying...that's pretty much it.The two things i really liked about this show was the character design, art style and also the voice acting. Especially the voice acting of the main character Kanaka Amaya. Her voice just seemed very unique and lovely compared to most of the other show I've seen. Just by listening to her voice you can discover right away that she's an energetic character. Most of the time, i would consider these type of characters to be rather annoying, however this character didn't come across as that. But maybe that could just be because of the short duration in the episodes. I'm sure she would get more annoying if they were 24 minutes eachThe next main character is Saki Iwasasa. She has been friends with Kanaka through her other school years and is the tallest in her group of three friends. She's pretty mature and has a passion for sports and games. Since she has always been friends with Kanaka, she is usually seen getting teased by her which i guess kind of keeps the show going. I wouldn't call her a very fun type of character but she's a pretty nice one.Last of all we have Ayuko Uehara. We see her right in the very first episode who seems pretty motivate about started high school. She is also teased by Kanaka which is mainly because of her height as she's the shortest. She's a very friendly character who's cute and pretty mature. At first she doesn't have any friends until she meets Saki and Kanaka. And that's pretty much the whole story.In my opinion, if you like the watch cute girls with there daily high school life and don't mind short anime, then this just might be the one for you.Sorry if this review is a bit waffley, i'm not very good at writing them heh. To be honest i don't think there should be this much writing since the anime is so short. yet very simple scenarios such as chit chats in the classroom, visiting each others houses, studying...that's pretty much it.The two things i really liked about this show was the character design, art style and also the voice acting. Especially the voice acting of the main character Kanaka Amaya. Her voice just seemed very unique and lovely compared to most of the other show I've seen. Just by listening to her voice you can discover right away that she's an energetic character. Most of the time, i would consider these type of characters to be rather annoying, however this character didn't come across as that. But maybe that could just be because of the short duration in the episodes. I'm sure she would get more annoying if they were 24 minutes eachThe next main character is Saki Iwasasa. She has been friends with Kanaka through her other school years and is the tallest in her group of three friends. She's pretty mature and has a passion for sports and games.

That's what I like most about this series, the main three girls interactions all felt natural and had some funny moments that were performed very well by their voice actors. The major draw for a slice of life anime, for me personally, is if I can like the main characters and I do,...they were cute, sometimes acted funny but felt like a group of friends just joking around and hanging out with each other.The animation was another surprised to how well done it was for something only a few minutes long, with the characters design being well done and the animation of how they move being so detailed and smooth was something unexpected for an anime this short. I especially liked how the backgrounds seem to be like colored vibrant painting.Well now for the stuff I didn't enjoy, I was not a fan of the music overall, yes the opening and ending songs are decent for show of this genre, as was the background music, it just wasn't something I much cared for. As well some of the side characters just weren't that interesting when they appeared in the episodes, I feel that if a second season ever happened it would give them more time to develop but the only episodes we have with them just wasn't enough.This is a simple, fun, cute show that has no conflict or story in the entire series. If you enjoy simple slice of life shows or you just need a quick anime to relax too, the Aiura is good anime for you, go ahead and give it watch. they were cute, sometimes acted funny but felt like a group of friends just joking around and hanging out with each other.The animation was another surprised to how well done it was for something only a few minutes long, with the characters design being well done and the animation of how they move being so detailed and smooth was something unexpected for an anime this short.

But hey, that’s not exactly a bad thing. In this case, I believe Aiura is one of those shows that someone love, but others not so much. I fall into the later, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t enjoy some of the aspects of it. After all, this show only has four minutes in it. There’s an intro, and and outro song… so that doesn’t exactly leave a lot of time for show content. But hey, it’s a comedy sketch. What do you expect?...Let’s get one thing settled. I definitely see the potential in the show, and I can understand why people gave this show a higher rating than I did. It just wasn’t my cup of tea.

It must be that it’s really hard to get a laugh out of me. However, I wouldn’t say this was a “laugh-so-hard-you-fall-out-of-your-chair” kind of anime, instead more of one that will make you smile to yourself. It’s quick, and it’s a good middle anime you can watch in between two dark, lengthy, and deep anime. It’s a lifter-upper alright.On to characters! The show focuses on three different girls - Saki, Ayuko, and Kanaka and a series of twelve shorts that broadcast their life right before school, during school, and right after school. Don’t expect some deep character development, or some kind of complex backstory from this anime. It’s just a comedy and a short, not meant for over analyzation.  Kind of ironic for me to say that considering I’m working on an analytical review for the show right now.Next- let’s hop aboard the sound train. There’s really not much to say about this. I wasn’t overly impressed by either the beginning or ending song, however don’t let my lack of musical knowledge curve your opinions on the music. I personally found it rather mundane, but hey, that’s just my look on it. . . Doesn’t mean you can’t rock out to the songs…The animation wasn’t anything special, but I did like it.

Thanks for reading in advance.There\'s not a lot to say about short anime, it\'s obvious why, and so, I have no real opening with Aiura. But it made me think a little about how good school comedy can be, especially something like this of short length.Aiura\'s narrative is fairly simple, if the KV didn\'t give it away, then I will tell you now that Aiura is based on a trio of high school girls just cruising through life in a relaxed and funny way. Everything comes under enjoyment, what I will say with the story however is that Aiura does seem to pay...attention to its surroundings, understanding that people grow and stuff, so they need to prepare for times like that, which you will see here, it is done, like everything else is here, relaxed and fun. Nothing really bad, and too much seriousness would kill the vibe anyway, so I think this has a good story. Same with characters, being aware of who they are and sticking true to themselves, whilst they are walking generic cliches, sure, I can say that for a short anime like this, they are still people I found to have some decent bit of interest in.Audiovisuals are good. The visuals here are well made for its time, probably because the budget didn\'t need to be spread out so much, but it was still well made for an anime like this. It is common designs just imposed with visibly good animation and what have you, even the backgrounds are good. Would give 7.5 but MAL moment. Let\'s just say 8 for that. Audio is fine too, pretty box standard, nothing to comment home to with that. I will say that OP is very good and catchy, and the ED is pretty chill and calm. BD ED is pretty good too if you ever get a chance for that. OP/ED alone carries this section.I enjoyed this a lot, I probably laughed way more than I should and if I am honest, the length doesn\'t cut it. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it, I laughed when I should have, and it was generally nice to pass time in a fun fashion. I would imagine most would like it, maybe not as much as I did, but this was pretty damn good for a short anime.TLDR: Good short comedy anime, that has a little more life in it. Looks good and sounds catchy, and is very enjoyable.Would recommend this for sure, hell, as of this review\'s upload, I have already watched this a year ago before, and read the manga (which I would also recommend). It isn\'t *that good*, but this was fun for real, like honestly probably one of the most entertaining short anime I have seen.

Beginning with the story, there really isn't one. It's a very mundane slice of life plot, and at 3 minutes there's even less substance than usual. Typically that's not a problem, but I would still like a little more to happen here. Regardless, it is pretty funny and manages to make pretty good use of the 3 minutes it has each episode. The humor is very much aimed towards a Japanese audience, and some things may be lost on your average western...audience. This is especially true for the bizarre crab-themed intro. So, apparently Aiura means crab, and sounds like 'i-ura', which sounds like an apple product, hence why Steve Jobs is so heavily present in the intro. Moving on to the real star of the show, the art. Aiura is downright gorgeous, and there really isn't any part of it that's lacking. Literally everything is beautiful, from the watercolor backgrounds to the distinctive character designs to vibrant color palette and even the CG. I never say this about CG in anime, but it is really at its absolute best here, and really just speaks to its absolute quality. I even went back and rewatched some scenes simply for their jaw-dropping beauty. Maybe it has something to do with how short this show is that they could afford to go all-out on the art, but man, this is a real home run, and I cannot state that enough. The sound was also good, with detailed sounds of life and music which brought a warmth and levity to every scene. The characters are your typical CGDCT fare, but still fun to watch and a good fit for each other.

The complete lack of a plot or narrative other than ""girls are friends"" doesn\'t become a problem because of the short runtime (all 12 episodes in total are about as long as 2 regular episodes of TV anime), and the show is funny and densely packed with jokes since it doesn\'t have a moment to spare. It even makes the punchlines land better in some cases (""brevity is the soul of wit"", and all that).The show is also gorgeous. Without the intense schedule demands of a full series, director Ryosuke Nakamura (Grimgar) directs and storyboards the entire series himself,...which lends an added cohesiveness to the visuals from episode to episode. There\'s nothing flashy to animate in this series, so it doesn\'t always jump out at you, but the character animation is consistently excellent. Small moments like someone putting on their shoes are animated with a film-like attention to detail. Legendary art director Hidetoshi Kaneko (Trigun, Hajime no Ippo, Texhnolyze) also puts in strong work here. If the watercolor-like background art evokes Studio Ghibli for you, it\'s in large part because Kaneko got his start painting backgrounds on My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki\'s Delivery Service. It\'s not an exaggeration to say the artwork is on par with those classics.The main 3 characters in the series are lovable and their personalities mesh well together. Unfortunately, in such a short series, there are basically no side characters of note, with the exception of the teacher (it\'s nearly a guarantee that she will be your favorite).The one significant complaint I have with the series is that the OP is annoying as hell, and that\'s a bigger issue than it sounds like when it takes up a full 1/4th of each episode\'s runtime. I recommend skipping it, but don\'t skip the ED since there is always a post-credits scene.

Overall, this series is easy to recommend as a short burst of fun that you can watch start to finish in under an hour.', ""Aiura is show that embodies the idea of a warm cup of tea on a sunny day, it feels good and warm in your chest and although there isn't a lot going on its just enough to keep you entertained and happy, its simple, toasty and something I can see myself recommending new and old anime fans alike.There are jokes, there are cute moments between characters, there’s an absurd amount of charm but it hits you right where it matters and before you know you’ll be finished the series and dearly missing it, I just wish there were more episodes, and I'm sure you...guys will too. guys will too."", 'A short, fun slice of life anime but without any real emotional depth and lacking a clear sense of purpose.The character’s and their interactions are very relatable and fun to watch, like when they play jenga when they’re bored, or make up nicknames.The animation for the characters are pretty good and detailed, although some of the backgrounds just look like basic sketches without much detail.There’s no clear plot. There are no overarching themes that links the episodes together, each episode (about 4 minutes) all consist of the girls doing a different activity. This also results in a plotless film with no real challenge during...the series. And the characters never actual discuss anything serious or personal, which results in an emotionally lacking story.Although most of the jokes are quite funny and the humour is spot on, from when they make fun of the teachers, or talking about their dreams and etc… The series is very upbeat, which makes this a lot of fun to watch even if there’s no real depth to it.Constructive feedback is appreciated :) the series.

I find it very interesting to see the kind of stories that can be told in such a brief period of time. Shorts require a lot of planning, so as to communicate as much to the audience with as little as possible. In a word, they have to have clear and deliberate direction, something that Aiura noticeably lacks.Aiura introduces itself with its OP, a 1...minute song and dance that by its length takes up a full fourth of the episode runtime (the ED is 30 seconds, which leaves a scant 2 minutes and 30 seconds for the main attraction). The OP is catchy but rife with shrill and fast-singing seiyuu, which quickly becomes annoying after the second episode. It\'s also about... crabs? And Steve Jobs? And Steve Jobs with crabs? I must admit that its absurdity got a good chuckle out of me the first time around.This humor of randomness is plainly absent from the content of episodes. The OP would suggest that Aiura intends to be a comedically nonsensical anime, but the jokes are always of the ""air out the nose"" variety: one-off quips that aren\'t enough to carry the show. Sometimes the comedic timing is completely off, punchlines coming in before the setup is even clear, or the ED music fading in well before a joke is made. Other times, Aiura thinks itself to be a lot funnier than it actually is. One episode is little more than one of the main characters declaring her intention to be captain of a school club, as her friends call attention to the fact that she has no interests. Another episode spends an uncomfortable amount of time with a boyfriend admonishing his totally-not-lolicon girlfriend for dressing up like a school girl.Stories come in many forms, and I do actually believe most slice of life animes possess stories even if their detractors claim they are ""about nothing."" Aiura is not one of them. It has plot, certainly—the events of episodes are somewhat causally related—but Aiura cares little for the ""why?"" and ""how?"" explanations that make up a story. Characters serve only as vehicles for the lackluster jokes scattered throughout the show. In spite of there being only three central characters, none of them receive any development other than basic personality traits in the first episode, and I struggle to even recall what their names were. Beyond compromising any attempt at telling a story, this also has an effect on the humor when its complexity is limited to wordplay and awkward situations. I\'m sympathetic to finding beauty or amusement in ordinary life, but Aiura expects its audience to care about such things as the inside jokes of the main characters when their personalities are as sophisticated as cardboard.On one positive note, the art of Aiura can be special: beautiful watercolor backdrops populate many of the scenes in the anime. Character design also complements the background art very well. The animation itself is also generally smooth and in some instances gives the impression of careful rotoscoping.

Most anime companies see it as an excuse to market moe girls who act younger and dumber than regular high schoolers do. While anime has always been a tool used for advertising at some point, there are just as many anime that prove you don\'t have to be soulless in doing so. Unfortunately, Aiura is one of the worst CGDCT anime I\'ve ever seen. It\'s literally about three girls—Ayuko, Kanaka, and Saki—who just go to school, hang out,...have pointless, cringey conversations that devolve into weird nonsense, and make Kanaka into the butt of their jokes. That\'s it. There is literally nothing to this anime at all.None of the characters are memorable or likeable in any way whatsoever. They\'re all a bunch of one-note stereotypes who are as bland as wheat toast. Ayuko is the short girl who gets mistaken for a grade schooler, Kanaka is the peppy cheerful dumbass who\'s always the butt monkey, Saki is the straight man, and...oh lord, that one teacher Wakatsuki...don\'t even get me started on her. Her whole purpose is to be a cutesy moe shortstack who has a higher pitched voice than her students and mistake the (very reasonable and mature!) male teacher for being a pervert based on an absolutely baseless assumption. God, I wanted to smack Wakatsuki so hard in the face. Worst character in the entire show. Seriously, I can name several other CGDCT anime that have much more effort put into their characters than Aiura does.Honestly, the show\'s only real saving graces are the lusciously detailed and fluid animation and the fact that every episode is two minutes long. I mean, the background art is colorful and bright, very easy on the eyes, and the actual motion is as smooth as butter...with the occasional obvious CGI, of course. It\'s kind of weird learning that Aiura was animated by LIDENFILMS, as their most recent project is the admittedly very ugly-looking Farewell My Dear Cramer. I mean, the difference in animation styles and the care put into them (or in Cramer\'s case, lack of care) is unbelievable. Plus, I\'m glad every episode is only two minutes long, save for the opening and endings, which are both only 1 minute long. If this show had episodes that were half an hour long, it would have worn out its welcome long ago, though considering the show is pretty bad already, that\'s not saying much.The soundtrack is...fine, for the most part. The background music and the ending theme are nice, but dear lord, that opening is so bad! Not only is it badly sung, it\'s basically a rip-off of a crap ton of other anime openings that are similar! Also, the actresses singing it are clearly straining when they try to sing really fast and high pitched, and the end result makes it sound like tin foil in a root canal. I mean, you have to TRY to be that bad. It actually hurts to listen to! Basically, Aiura is a bland, lazy, terrible slice-of-life moe girl anime that\'s best left forgotten.

Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28391/Ao_no_Kanata_no_Four_Rhythm,"['For centuries, it has been man\'s dream to fly.  Because of the Wright Brothers, we finally have the technology to do so, and as such, have been able to soar into the skies, give or take the method.  But we have never truly been able to fly by ourselves.  But here, we have Aokana, an anime about flying, and the sport that goes along with it known as Flying Circus.Story:  In the world of Aokana, the world has developed special footwear called Grav-shoes, a kind of footwear that allows for the user to utilize anti-graviton particles in order to essentially defy...gravity and fly.  In order to make the idea of Grav-shoes more fun, a new sport known as Flying Circus was developed, creating a brand new activity that one could do with their new shoes.  It is here where we meet Kurashina Asuka, a bright and optimistic girl who dreams of soaring in the skies.At its core, Aokana is centered around Asuka and her journey through the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short.  The show is centered around her and her group of friends in the FC club at her high school, participating in competitions and aiming to become top FC players.  So more or less, this is your standard tournament/sports anime that focuses around beating stronger opponents and progressively getting better and better as time goes on, right?  Well...no, actually.Contrary to what the show looks like from the outside, Aokana has a surprisingly deep set of values that it showcases.  It really hammers in what it takes to be good at a sport, and the satisfaction of winning when facing someone tough.  In fact, the characters are shown to more or less only be fighting the same opponents, completely disregarding a \'stronger challenger approaches\' style of story.  The anime shows us the true feeling of losing and how heartbreaking it can be, as well as the beauty and satisfaction of winning, all things that you wouldn\'t see in your generic tournament anime where the protagonist just barrels his/her way through each match without trying and winning every time because he/she is that good.  There\'s genuine feeling when it comes to seeing the growth of these characters and it really made me like this show and want to continue watching.  The progression is far better than what I had expected it to be, and I was happy to receive such a surprise.On the downside though, the show has some issues with some of its presentation.  Some aspects of the show feel cliched and everything is tied up with a nice ribbon bow, so the plot is predictable in that regard.  Additionally, the show does have quite a lot of moe-affiliated moments where the show does tell you once again ""Hey, we\'re a show with a bunch of cute girls doing some cute stuff"", which it is.  It takes away from the serious atmosphere a little bit, but for me, it really wasn\'t really a problem.Overall, while there were problems and issues with its presentation, Aokana had a message that was far deeper than I thought it would ever have given what it looked like on the outside.  The show had good progression and a good mix of good to bad moments that helped improve character growth and, despite its appearance of one guy surrounded by several girls, IS NOT A HAREM!  (I know, shocking right?  We can have an anime with that kind of character setup WITHOUT having romance!  Gasp!)Overview:+  Interesting story concept  (The sport is simple, but surprisingly complex.)+  Great message and themes throughout+  Not a harem despite what we get for a cast-   Has cliched and/or predictable moments that do take some credibility of the show awayCharacters:  The cast of Aokana isn\'t particularly big.  As mentioned before, the show more or less focuses on a relatively small group of characters where they all fight amongst each other in the sport.  There\'re no ""Challenger-kuns"" anywhere once the rivals have been established, and the show takes its time to develop its cast.First, we have our spunky and optimistic main protagonist, Kurashina Asuka.  Asuka is the very definition of optimism.  Her dream is to soar high in the sky, and most of her lines involve things being ""amazing"" and being ""spectacular"" to the point that it\'s actually somewhat annoying.  A somehow gifted natural at FC, Asuka is sort of that \'prodigy\' kind of character who gets stuff or is able to do complicated stuff relatively easy in the series, even to the extent that even towards the end, she is able to handle more difficult maneuvers or strategies that would ordinarily taken someone else weeks or even months to accomplish.  As a character, she is more of a catalyst for things, as she evokes feelings and aids in the character development for others, without really changing much herself.  She does have bouts of sadness and some time dedicated to her recovery after a loss, but she\'s the type to get back up on her feet quickly, so there\'s really no worry there.The people that are interesting are both Mashiro and Misaki, the two other members of the FC club that Asuka belong to.  As a senpai loving kouhai and a nyanko respectively, Mashiro and Misaki are more of the characters that project and showcase the quality of what it is to have ups and downs in a sport, as each of them have dedicated time to their characters.  These areas of the anime are sections where I think both the message and the anime really shine, because they\'re both very realistic examples of what it means to participate and try to get really into a sport since both of their mini character arcs are dedicated to resolving their own insecurities and strengthening the qualities that they possess and turning it into in the series\' words, ""Their own FC"", aka, their own style of playing.If I was to make a complaint, it would have to be geared towards Masaya Hinata, our male character guy.  Masaya is a character who really...doesn\'t have all that much importance in this series.  As Aokana was originally a VN before getting adapted, Masaya is the player character and is dictated by the actions of the player.  In the anime, Masaya more or less plays a supporting role to the series, which is fine since I\'m all for a series with 1 guy and a bunch of girls that isn\'t a harem series, but they try to give an explanation and time to his backstory and why he decided \'never to fly again\' which just ends up being incomplete and very lackluster.  It is by far the weakest aspect of the characters by far, which is surprising since the side characters not only get more screentime, but more development than our so-called male protagonist here.The side characters are definitely a side cast that has more worth to this series than most anime I\'ve seen.  Other FC players like Shindou, Inui, and Rika get little moments dedicated to them to add onto the message that the show coaxes in, and Madoka, who is more or less the comedic straight man to everyone (poor Madoka).  Point being, there are members of this side cast that deserve mention, and only add to this show since a good number of them actually develop along with the series, if only for a little bit of character development.Overview:+ Great character development+ Good focus on main females and their development+ Side cast members also get development-  Asuka is a bit too perfect sometimes and gets a bit annoying-  Masaya, the supposed main character, is basically nonexistent to this seriesArt:  Produced by Gonzo, Aokana boasts a very high quality and whimsical looking style for Aokana.  All of the colors have this shimmering bright sheen to them that reflects the sunny and bright feeling that the show evokes, creating this wonderfully colorful show that looks very pleasing to look at.  The characters also look very nice in conjunction with the background and move very fluidly in terms of the normal animation fluidity.  The artstyle is heavily moe-centered, as the characters, girls in particularly, are drawn in a very cutesy style coupled with some cutely exaggerated moments at a shot at comedy and cute pictures.  I say this because there are people that REALLY hate moe, so I just wanted to mention it here.Another thing that the show has is effects, and lots of them.  The grav-shoes create contrails when the fly, and the effects of those are just really stunning to look at.  One thing that does bug me about the anime is the fact that they utilize 3-D CGI very often when they\'re trying to make a flying scene.  Using CGI for stuff like this is understandable, since the characters are moving very fast, and the amount of frame per second in order to create something like that would be time consuming to say the least, but the CGI is done in a way that really looks obvious, especially due to the fact that the fluidity of that particular scene looks stranger than it normally is.  (Also, there really isn\'t much fanservice to be had.  We get like...1 bath scene or so, and that\'s about it in the way of fanservice.)Overview:+  Really nice artwork+  Great effects-   CGI wasn\'t meshed well and stood out easilySound: The OST for Aokana is very fitting for the series.  The entire OST is more or less performed with airy instruments like the flute, in order to keep up with the theme of flying up and whatnot.  The OP ""Contrails"" is a very vibrant and uplifting piece that fits with the positive, soaring feeling that the characters have when they sprout their wings and lift off.  It\'s a very happy song that while doesn\'t have a staggeringly large amount of memorable factor to it, it\'s still a good song.The ED on the other hand is a more toned down song that has a similar soaring feeling to it.  But instead of soaring high, the song more or less drifts around and glides.  It\'s not particularly a song that I feel lacks in comparison to its OP.  It\'s not a bad song, but its calm and generic sound really doesn\'t really do the song any favors for being particularly memorable.Overview:+  Good, fitting music-   Not really a memorable OSTPersonal Enjoyment:  Aokana was that one show this season that out of every show in my watching list I thought would turn out to be a surprisingly good show, a dark horse that was good, but no one would watch.  And now, after finishing it, turns out, I was right.  It has its flaws and its problems, but honestly?  I really think that this was a good show; an unexpectedly good show.Did I like this anime?To be honest, I really did.  I liked it far more than I thought I would.  It\'s unassumingly cute exterior hides a really deep and meaningful set of themes that was not only well tackled, but really played into why I think that this anime deserves far more attention than it gets.  Hell, the OP has the phrase ""True Battle comes After Losing"", and that could not be more true to what happens in this show, and in real life.  Also, flying shoes.  Science, get on it.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Ok, I\'ll be honest, Asuka is a bit irritating.  Her constant optimism is a feature of the anime that really doesn\'t fall, which really isn\'t a good thing.  She sees the bright side of practically everything and doesn\'t falter which in a sense, clashes with what this show was trying to convey.  In addition, Masaya was just NOT used.  He had so much potential, and could\'ve really added a lot to the series, but in the end, he was more or less shoved to the side and wasn\'t really as important as he could\'ve or should\'ve been.  (And yes, I know that Asuka IS the main character here.  Doesn\'t mean we couldn\'t have devoted more focus to Masaya.)Would I recommend this anime?Personally, I think that this anime is definitely worth a watch.  While it looks all cutesy and moe on the outside (which...it honestly does do a lot, quite a bit actually...), what the show tries to tell us with its themes gives the show far more worth than your seasonal generic moe show.  It tells us that enjoying the things we like doing is more important than winning or losing, and that work has to be put into something in order to get better, and it conveys these messages so well!  IMO, Aokana is an underrated show from Winter 2016, and despite its flaws, is still worth a watch. gravity and fly.  In order to make the idea of Grav-shoes more fun, a new sport known as Flying Circus was developed, creating a brand new activity that one could do with their new shoes.  It is here where we meet Kurashina Asuka, a bright and optimistic girl who dreams of soaring in the skies.At its core, Aokana is centered around Asuka and her journey through the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short.  The show is centered around her and her group of friends in the FC club at her high school, participating in competitions and aiming to become top FC players.  So more or less, this is your standard tournament/sports anime that focuses around beating stronger opponents and progressively getting better and better as time goes on, right?  Well...no, actually.Contrary to what the show looks like from the outside, Aokana has a surprisingly deep set of values that it showcases.  It really hammers in what it takes to be good at a sport, and the satisfaction of winning when facing someone tough.  In fact, the characters are shown to more or less only be fighting the same opponents, completely disregarding a \'stronger challenger approaches\' style of story.  The anime shows us the true feeling of losing and how heartbreaking it can be, as well as the beauty and satisfaction of winning, all things that you wouldn\'t see in your generic tournament anime where the protagonist just barrels his/her way through each match without trying and winning every time because he/she is that good.  There\'s genuine feeling when it comes to seeing the growth of these characters and it really made me like this show and want to continue watching.  The progression is far better than what I had expected it to be, and I was happy to receive such a surprise.On the downside though, the show has some issues with some of its presentation.  Some aspects of the show feel cliched and everything is tied up with a nice ribbon bow, so the plot is predictable in that regard.  Additionally, the show does have quite a lot of moe-affiliated moments where the show does tell you once again ""Hey, we\'re a show with a bunch of cute girls doing some cute stuff"", which it is.  It takes away from the serious atmosphere a little bit, but for me, it really wasn\'t really a problem.Overall, while there were problems and issues with its presentation, Aokana had a message that was far deeper than I thought it would ever have given what it looked like on the outside.  The show had good progression and a good mix of good to bad moments that helped improve character growth and, despite its appearance of one guy surrounded by several girls, IS NOT A HAREM!  (I know, shocking right?  We can have an anime with that kind of character setup WITHOUT having romance!  Gasp!)Overview:+  Interesting story concept  (The sport is simple, but surprisingly complex.)+  Great message and themes throughout+  Not a harem despite what we get for a cast-   Has cliched and/or predictable moments that do take some credibility of the show awayCharacters:  The cast of Aokana isn\'t particularly big.  As mentioned before, the show more or less focuses on a relatively small group of characters where they all fight amongst each other in the sport.  There\'re no ""Challenger-kuns"" anywhere once the rivals have been established, and the show takes its time to develop its cast.First, we have our spunky and optimistic main protagonist, Kurashina Asuka.  Asuka is the very definition of optimism.  Her dream is to soar high in the sky, and most of her lines involve things being ""amazing"" and being ""spectacular"" to the point that it\'s actually somewhat annoying.  A somehow gifted natural at FC, Asuka is sort of that \'prodigy\' kind of character who gets stuff or is able to do complicated stuff relatively easy in the series, even to the extent that even towards the end, she is able to handle more difficult maneuvers or strategies that would ordinarily taken someone else weeks or even months to accomplish.  As a character, she is more of a catalyst for things, as she evokes feelings and aids in the character development for others, without really changing much herself.

(EDIT - Not anymore, thanks XEELTom for giving me the heads up! :) )Quick summary - in a world where people have flying shoes there exists a sport that's called Flying Circus. Basically you touch four poles as fast as you can or you whack the opponent's back or well, you prevent the opponent from doing so. Not really much of a premise there LOL.This was pretty much a sleeper hit, it was a really outstanding show from start to end considering it was based off a VN. Instead, they dropped the romance and made...it all about the sport and the girls, which was a very good approach.

The anime, which has a great main concept/story line, but tries to strive for a little bit too much.|Objective Review||Story/Plot|The anime starts out well, sets up the scene well for the characters and the sci-fi sport called ""Flying Circus"". The story progresses at a good pace, making it easy to keep up, yet keeping it interesting enough. However, as the series go on, the anime tries to reach too high. As a result, there will be a lot of plot lines that are not properly developed or finished. For example, the anime sets up...Hinata as one of the main characters with his trauma, but instead pushes him into the background into a supporting role. The supposedly romance story line is also left there hanging. There are a couple of signs of it, but it just never really happens or even starts to develop. Overall, it just seems like the main sports/tournament story line is very well put together, meanwhile all the other ones were ignored and unfinished in the end.Plot Score - 6|Sports|As this anime is focused all around Flying Circus, it\'s quite important to see what the anime can bring to the sports lovers. The fantasy sports at it\'s core is fairly simple, but it still has plenty of depth. There are a fair amount of moves/tricks you can utilize, though it would have been nice to see more. As for strategies goes, it\'s a little bit lacking. It mostly just deciding whether to race or battle. In the end Inui does show some actual strategy, but it still feels a bit lacking. The rules also have some holes, like why not just skip to the third buoy instead of stopping to intercept. But all in all, the sports is fairly easy to pick up, not to mention it\'s a very flashy sports meaning it\'s good to watch. It just lacks a little bit of depth.Sports Score - 7|Sci-fi|Even though in the beginning we don\'t know too much about the Grav-Shoes, in the latter part of the series we learn a lot more about them. It really gives more options for the anime to expand the sports. One of the reasons why the sports aspect of the anime doesn\'t become too boring at the end.|Characters|The characters are mostly cute and nice, but nothing particularly outstanding. The drama part of the anime is nothing too serious, it\'s just mostly rivalry which is used nicely to develop the characters and their relationships. It\'s a nice touch that they use multiple forms of rivalries for different couples, there are couples where it\'s just a friendly/mutual connection where others might be more tense. However, the way they set up Hinata and Kagami, it only seemed right to see them a little bit more (especially Hinata with his trauma). This, unfortunately, is almost completely forgotten and it\'s almost like the creators totally forgot about their existence.Character Score - 8(for the MCs) - 4(for the rest) - 5 overall|Art|The art is just spectacular. The drawing is clear and the shading is very fine and soft. The overall style also complements the anime with it\'s bright happy ambiance. The animation throughout the series is pretty consistent and the effects smooth in with the rest of the animation greatly.Art Score - 9|Sound|The sounds are also quite outstanding. While the voice acting and music is fairly good, it\'s the sound effects that really made this anime/sport enjoyable to watch. They are clear, crisp and really do give off a feeling of speed.Sound Score - 8|The whole package|As a whole, the Flying Circus is a very easy to watch sport with spectacular audio-visual experience. The sport mechanics itself are nothing too special, but they do the job. If you want to just relax and watch some fantasy sports, then this is for you. Just make sure you don\'t expect nothing else other than a good tournament ""documentary"". If you expect to see good comedy, romance, support characters, drama then you will probably get disappointed.All in all, if i had to put it into words, the anime has a great core, but the shell surrounding it is very fragile and has holes in it. For what it\'s supposed to be, it does the job very well, but it strives for more and then just flops.Overall Score - 6.5(if you look at what it\'s supposed to be then 7.5)|Subjective review| (SPOILER alert)My relationship with this anime was like a love&hate relationship. While i enjoyed the tournament, i wanted to see Hinata and Kagami fly and compete so bad. And when they teased it at the end of episode 10 i was so hyped. And then they just skipped it... We only saw both of them fly for like 10 seconds in the whole series. I felt for Misaki (couldn\'t care less for Asuka)and was kinda disappointed by how they finished her story line.

So, she took up the so called sport and the plot pretty much revolves around how she got through all adversities to be an amazing FC player. Extra factors like having a coach who used to be one of the best players but quit due to personal reasons, becoming friends with the Best player of FC and more just adds up the entertaining factor to this anime.This anime gives a very upbeat...vibe, vibrant colours and great sound.To put it simply, it has a simple plot but the visuals and sound make up for the most of it, which makes it pretty much a decent anime for 2016.Extras: There's no romance at all for this anime.

It completely ruins the story beats that the vn has, makes the fight scenes look ridiculous through CGI (apart from the last one thankfully) and ruins the art-style of the vn.For the first point, the story beats being ruined:The show takes story beats from different routes but really fails to mesh them together well, even introducing some that weren't there and literally contradict the ones present in the visual novel. Furthermore the ones that are there that still make...sense are often so quickly disregarded and pushed aside its aggravating. The pacing too, is insane, the show needed another 12 episodes to fit the current content into a much better pace (I understand adapting a 30 hour vn route into anime can be difficult but still).For the second point, the fight scenes:The fight scenes or rather FC scenes most of the time look ridiculous due to the CGI being incredibly apparent and most of the time coming off as stiff and looking inhuman. When in contrast to the visual novel, these FC scenes sure are composed of stills but you can really feel the motion and force behind the movement of each the characters, how an animated piece of media conveys movement worse than a vn is beyond me.For the last point of the art:The visual novel has one of the most gorgeous art-styles I can think of, and what does the anime get? At best shoddily traced CGs from the vn and at worst some awful proportions on characters, awkward looking faces where character's eyes are too far apart and even unnecessary reusing of frames (due to what I can only guess was budget).To see my favourite visual novel being handled like this is sad to say the least. But at least I can go out of my way here to say, don't watch this, read the visual novel instead. It is available on Nekonyan's website and Steam (where it often goes on sale) for PC and also on Nintendo Switch (and PS4 but a censored version). sense are often so quickly disregarded and pushed aside its aggravating.

Also, due to this, there are many lowly rated reviews for this anime. However, I\'ll be delivering my take on this anime.Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm - The REAL Proper ReviewAo no Kanata no Four Rhythm is an anime that could have had the potential to be a really great anime but was plagued by its origin. ""Eroge"" & ""Visual Novel"" Lets take a deeper look why it meets its demise when compared other animes of the season.Most anime are adapted &...serialized from its manga counterpart. Manga are usually known & recognized for its deep plot/content. Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm on the other hand is adapted from its visual novel known for its eroge. Most visual novels serving its ""eroge"" purposes have little to no real plot by default. Furthermore, its ""sports"" focus further reduce its chances for any deep plot to come by.However with Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm, I think they have done pretty well despite being a ""sports"" anime. It\'s actually deeper than it seems and gets better at later episodes.Story - 6/10Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm revolves around a sports called ""Flying Circus"" The goal of the sports, by flying through the use of Grav shoes, is to score points by touching its buoys in sequence ""1,2,3,4"" or scoring a hit on the opponent\'s back. Or so it seems... This is when the real plot begins to surface.Do not JUDGE its plot before Episode 7, because that\'s where it really showed how deep it really is.When you love & know something so well, for example in a game, (In this case, FC) then all of a sudden, someone new just came & destroyed your concept of that. You become afraid, because the very thing you are so familiar & close to, becomes something you no longer understand.That\'s what Misaki felt. FC became something ""dark"".All these while, FC to her, was about touching buoy or hitting each other\'s back. A simple and fun sport. But Inui broke that concept. Instead of playing the game, she intensely pressures the opponent by restricting & denying whatever her opponent tries to do. It becomes a mental sports and makes you feel inferior & powerless. That\'s the ""beauty"" Inui and Saki sought. However, Asuka, being that carefree girl, may not fully understand the ""dark"" Misaki began to see. To Asuka, it is an exciting new territory of the game. But Misaki became afraid of FC, became afraid of Asuka. She could not accept how Asuka could think that way.Art - 6/10Brilliant & Radiant. This anime is just beautiful to look at.Sound - 8/10One of the best anime\'s OST I\'ve heard in a while. If you actually listen closely, you will notice. One example I can give is in Episode 6.Listen closely to the OST:05:04 to 06:02.16:22 to 17:47.17:47 to 19:45.Character - 6/10I love the contrast between Asuka and Misaki\'s mindset. As I\'ve explained earlier.Masaya Hinata is your secretive hidden ace badass. He is shown to be rather highly intelligent.Asuka Kurashina is your slightly clueless clumsy cute female MC with innate potential in FC that she doesn\'t really know about.Misaki Tobisawai is strong female character that is also smart. Realizing the ""dark"" in FC.Mashiro Arisaka is your kawaii little loli with cute obsession with Misaki.Aoi Kagami is your ultimate hidden ace triumph card that you hope she would just come out and whoop everyone\'s ass.Enjoyment - 6/10I really like all the characters. There\'s a good variety in personalities and good comedy. I like seeing Asuka\'s sillyness, Mashiro\'s cute obsession with Misaki. Hinata & Kagami being the hidden badass retired aces.Overall - 6/10Honestly, I really enjoyed this anime despite being poorly received by the community. A good mix of comedy, action with its beautiful art, amazing OSTs. Would definitely recommend to give this series a try and watch till the very end. serialized from its manga counterpart.

It was very fast paced and many plotholes or even many important part, that would have make the story more exciting weren\'t animated. You dont get the feeling of something interesting and watch it merely because you somehow enjoy it how awesome it looks how they...fly and how the principle of ""their"" flying is.The music was fine, nothing special or from heaven door, but atleast you can say that this was enough to make it an enjoyable anime.You have too many characters to develop, yet only 12 episodes to animate. It\'s sad, since it could have been one of the top 150 contenders with a rating with 8~, but the budget was not enough. One the fatal weakpoints from becoming an actual good anime, since it lacks real development plus the  very fast pacing.In the End, it is an enjoyable anime and you can watch it with a smile in your face. But dont expect too much from it and do not try to find logical aspects in it. It already stops with ""people flying and having a competition in it"".7/10 fly and how the principle of ""their"" flying is.The music was fine, nothing special or from heaven door, but atleast you can say that this was enough to make it an enjoyable anime.You have too many characters to develop, yet only 12 episodes to animate.

Only the people who actually played this godly game can understand this frustration.The Story is about Asuka, a girl who moved to Kunashima due to her father\'s transfer and later comes across a sports called ""Flying Circus"" which uses GraShuu (A type of shoes which uses anti-graviton particle to make you fly) and then joins the ""Kunahama FC Club"" together with a classmate and a kouhai.Story 6/10. The Story presented...in the anime is completely different from how it really is. Getting from beginning, It was just Masaya alone who finds Asuka searching for her house keys. Also, it was him alone who uses the co-op system of the shoes to help Asuka get to the school on time. The terminal which is shown outside the school, is actually inside the building. (So if someone uses the Grashuu then he/she doesn\'t have to go all the way to cross the main gate). Misaki actually meets Asuka for the first time in the classroom. Masaya never knew that Mashiro family runs the Udon Shop untill Mashiro injures herself during the practice. It was Masaya alone Aoi-sensei asks to be the instructor for her flying lessons. Also It was just Masaya and Asuka who finds Satouin-san and Shion-senpai having an argument over the ""in"" letter plus Masaya actually doesn\'t see Asuka do the ""Air Kick Turn"" for the first time, as he closes his eyes not able to see her figure falling into the sea after the fail attempt to target Satouin -san\'s back, also it was Satoiun-san herself who explain about FC to Asuka. After the match Buchou bugs Masaya for like a week or so to join the club, and in the end, getting asked by sensei and convinced by asuka he finally decides to join the club. Also it was not Madoka but Masaya who takes the three of them to the Shirase-san\'s FC Shop. Though the story of the ""Anime Adaptation"" deserves 2, I gave it 6 just because it takes few points, just a few points from the original series.Art 6/10 - As expected of the art of these days anime\'s. It\'s well made. I have nothing to say about that.Sound 7/10 - As the ""anime adaptation"" mixed few BGM from the VN, it\'s quite good to the ears. Plus the OP/ED are made quite well as well (Not as good as the VN\'s though)Character 6/10 - Aside Masaya, how they portrayed the characters in the anime are pretty much how they\'re like in the VN.Enjoyment 2/10 - Just after watching the first two episodes of the anime, I raised the white flag, as I didn\'t wanted the headache I got from those two episodes to effect the surroundings.Overall 4/10 - I do know that the visual novel and light novels adaptations are pretty much like that and I don\'t wanna see the rest of the 10 episodes to prove that.A piece of advice, if you know how to read Japanese then please play the game, I ensure you that it\'s 500 times better than the anime, but if you don\'t know how to read, then just wait for the English Translation to finish and then try it. in the anime is completely different from how it really is.

Watch the anime to find out what happens next in Asuka\'s journey !', ""I'm sorry, but this is a horrible anime and an even worse adaptation. In terms of the adaptation, everything has been changed and it's extremely rushed to the point that battles only show 1-2 points scored and then just cut to the end with the final score... Not only that but they changed the main character. Yup, the main character of the visual novel and his background story that drives the game is practically non-existent in the anime. At first, it seems like they decided to make Asuka the main character, but then they just bounce around and don't seem to focus on anyone at...all while making Masaya (the original protagonist of the VN's) just a very small background character. Asuka seems like a reasonable choice for the protagonist since she's the rising star of the sport, but instead they dont focus much on her either. Rushing through the story and not focusing on a character makes everyone bland and boring. None of the characters are developed enough through the anime and there are major contrasts in their character between the VN and the anime.On terms of it being an anime, it still sucks. It is so rushed, especially the battle scenes, awesome VN fights only last like 30 seconds and are quite underwhelming. For example, Asuka pulls off an awesome move, but instead of using flashy art and intense music to show just how significant it is, they just focus on different characters saying wow. That brings on another point, the battle music is also way too calm and doesn't create any kind of tension. Speaking of tension, since the show is so rushed, there is zero build up to their opponents which leads to the battle itself having no real impact, meaning or gratification when the good guys do something great.The story is non-existent... seriously it feels like there is none which is pretty incredible because the VN has so many different story options they could have gone with. Overall, it's a bit boring. The lack of story direction and rush through the VN content just makes it very confusing because it cuts out most of the major interactions between characters and the things that promote their growth.I can't recommend this anime. Even if you haven't played the VN, you will be disappointed because it's just a bad anime in general. Do yourself a favor and just play the game. It's easily 100x better than this letdown. all while making Masaya (the original protagonist of the VN's) just a very small background character.

The progression of the protagonists was always interesting to see and there were definitely some surprises for me while I watched the anime. You can definitely tell it's a sport anime while watching but it sometimes just lacks the seriousness that's usually expected. Whilst not the best art style I've ever seen, it looked quite nice...and I enjoyed watching how the FC matches went.Nice anime overall. and I enjoyed watching how the FC matches went.Nice anime overall."", '(NOTICE 1°: Recommend to watch the anime first before reading this review)(NOTICE 2°: This review is in English and Spanish)--REVIEW IN ENGLISH--‘’Look at the sky, don\'t avert your eyes, the answer lies there’’That\'s what the visual novel taught me.(NOTICE: Visual Novel Reader / Player)Yes, as it says above, this review is focused from the point of view of adaptation of a visual novel, so it will have two parts, how good anime is and the other side of the coin, how well adapted to anime is it, both points individually, so here we go....(NOTICE: Sorry if my English is bad)1. REVIEW OF THE ANIMEHistory 7/10The story is good and simple (A sports club, how much fun it is to fly and the freedom it brings, friendships, winning or losing, although what really matters is having fun, etc.) throughout the episodes it shows an entertaining story and the last episode complements the: ""What really matters is having fun.""Still, it\'s not spared from script holes or things characters say and then contradict themself, but we\'ll talk about that in the character section.Art 5/10Well...the backgrounds look good, the character design is good but the good animation is not constant if not non-existent and in certain parts the characters look amorphous, yes, the CG in the encounters makes them much more enjoyable in sight.Sound 8/10The soundtrack is very good especially since the composition is made by Elements Garden, the same ones who composed the original BGM of the visual novel.Character 5/101. Asuka Kurashina: a good character, being the fun and positive of the group. Her development is good since she starts out well, but she ends up falling and then in the final episode she shows that she is the root of: ‘’What really matters is having fun’’.2. Misaki Tobisawa: a character with low energy but when he dedicates himself to something he gives everything of himself, being the first to go through the conflict of: ""If I don\'t have fun why do I keep flying?"" so then she stops flying, although she then takes it back, to give everything of herself but this time having fun.Asuka and Misaki are the main protagonists of this story.3. Masaya Hinata: character who contributes almost nothing to the story until the last episodes.4. Mashiro Arisaka: good character, with good development, but little screen time ...... Misaki-senpaaai!!!!!!!5. Rika Ichinose: character with potential, but disappears after the fourth episode.6. Madoka Aoyagi: ...Comic Relief.7. Shion Aoyagi: a man who loves speed.8. Reiko Satou: ...is Satou-in by the way, writer.9. Shindou Kazunari: the best Skywalker in Japan.10. Saki Inui and Irina Avalon: the antagonists of the story, although Irina is the most obsessed with her perfect FC, and then ends up redeeming herself. Acceptable antagonists for a sports anime.11. Aoi Kagami: Masaya Hinata\'s mentor, only contributes to the plot at the end of the anime.Enjoyment 6/10An anime to pass the time, although you have to wait for it to get interesting.Overall 7/10An entertaining anime, funny characters, fascinating encounters, very good soundtrack, \'\' good \'\' animation, script holes, acceptable character development and a good message: \'\' What really matters is having fun \'\' (yes, I know, I have already repeated this three times) and how amazing it is to give everything you have.If you have time and want to have a good time, watch this anime, yes, do not expect an incredible story or memorable characters, it is worth it because it is entertaining especially because of the encounters and the message it gives: ‘’What really matters is having fun’’...fourth and last time I say it.If you read this, I appreciate that you took the time to read my review of this anime, see you later or below if you read the part of the visual novel, sayonara.The anime review ends here, if you wonder why I wrote so little about the characters I suggest you keep scrolling down to read the lost potential of this anime adaptation in the review from the visual novel point of view, if you wish.(NOTICE: Review taking into account the visual novel, read this if you have played the game or if you simply want to know more)2. ADAPTATION TO ANIME OF THE VISUAL NOVELWell now I will talk about how good adaptation it is, I will be taking into account the points of the anime part to compare it with the visual novel and see if it has coherence.In order not to make this longer, I will be comparing only the story and the characters, without spoilers of course.-Story-The story in the visual novel reaches the summer tournament from here you are presented with the decisions to enter any of the 4 heroine routes that the game has, so having clarified this, let\'s continue.Since the anime begins, we are already shown that it will not follow any of the existing routes since our protagonist in the game, Masaya Hinata, here has no love interaction with any of the heroines and is put in the secondary role. As we advance in the episodes, we are also shown how the routes of the heroines are mixed, which makes the character development totally original and inconsistent with that of the visual novel, although it has events that happen in the game, in the anime no longer they have coherence or they are left without any feeling for not following the original script from the beginning.In the anime we are shown that Asuka and Misaki will be in charge of being the protagonists since Mashiro and Rika (the other heroines in the game) are also put in the secondary role, with Mashiro being the one who is always behind Misaki, and Rika set aside, but we\'ll talk about this in the next section, characters.-Characters-I do not want to spoil anything about the history and development of the characters so I will not go into details I will only say how the anime differ from the visual novel.-Protagonist and Heroines-1. Masaya Hinata (Protagonist): well, they just put him aside in the anime, but in the visual novel his development on each heroine route makes him one of the most realistic protagonists I have ever seen.2. Asuka Kurashina (Heroine): her development is completely opposite to that of the game since she is the simplest heroine but the one that brings the most changes with her as at the end of her route, he brings a revolution to the world of FC and is the root from: ""What really matters is having fun.""3. Misaki Tobisawa (Heroine): the heroine with the conflict of: \'\'If I don\'t have fun, why do I keep flying?\'\' since, believing to have \'\' talent \'\', but not being able to improve, she collapses, stopping practicing FC to be able to find the value of her effort, thus achieving it at the end of her journey where his frustration turns into fun.4. Mashiro Arisaka (Heroine): the frustration and the desire to be better make her one of the heroines who strives the most to improve without having even a \'\' talent \'\' to lean on, reaching from 0 to 100 giving everything of herself.5. Rika Ichinose (Heroine): the honor student, having a serious personality and not being able to show her true self, is one of the heroines who remains stagnant and cannot improve until she gets to know Masaya in order to show how far she can go being herself.-Support characters-1. Aoi Kagami: a role model for Masaya and his mentor, the connection they have shown how important they are to each other.2. Madoka Aoyagi: manager of the group and a character who always cares about her friends.3. Shion Aoyagi: a man with a great spirit, if it weren\'t for him the FC club wouldn\'t exist.4. Reiko Satou: despite being an ojou-sama, she is a character who cares about her companions and friends, thus being a source of resolution for Masaya and the Heroines.5. Shindou Kazunari: a character who shows great passion for what he practices, thus being another source of support for Masaya and the Heroines.-Antagonists-1.

Irina Avalon: the mastermind behind the \'\'Bird Cage\'\', in the anime she redeems herself, but in the game, she simply accepts the fact of having enjoyed the show and then says that one day she will show them her real FC.Both Saki and Irina are well built antagonists with just the same motivations and desires as everyone else.-Conclusion-The adaptation is not bad, but it does not manage to convey the same feeling as the visual novel, the heroines who are the source of everything in the game, in the anime they are not developed correctly and the protagonist who is the connection between the different routes, is non-existent in the adaptation.In my opinion, having an original script, the message they want to convey throughout the anime, especially in the final episode, is only the 20% of what the visual novel actually transmits to you.If you want to see how beautiful this story is and the message it wants to convey, I recommend you give the visual novel a try, you will not regret it, I gave it a chance and I can say from the bottom of my heart that it was beautiful to have done it...Well, this writing ends here, if you got this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart, I hope I have helped you with my opinion and have opened an opportunity for you to play the visual novel.Now I say goodbye, I thank you for having read me and have a good day, I hope to meet again, matta ne...‘’A story of girls flying through the sky and experiencing love’’AOKANA, 2016...--RESEÑA EN ESPAÑOL--(AVISO: Recomendable ver el anime antes de leer esta reseña)‘’Mira al cielo, no apartes la mirada, la respuesta yace ahí’’Eso es lo que me enseño la novela visual.(AVISO: Lector/Jugador de la novela visual)Si, como dice arriba, esta reseña está enfocada desde el punto de vista de adaptación de novela visual, así que tendrá dos partes, que tan buen anime es y el otro lado de la moneda, que tan bien adaptada a anime esta, ambos puntos individualmente, así que aquí vamos.1.

ADAPTACION A ANIME DE LA NOVELA VISUALBueno ahora hablare de que tan buena adaptación es, estaré tomando en cuenta los puntos de la parte de anime para compararlo con la novela visual y ver si tiene coherencia.Para no hacer esto más largo estaré comparando solo la historia y los personajes, sin spoilers claro.-Historia-La historia en la novela visual llega hasta el torneo de verano a partir de aquí se te presentan las decisiones para entrar en cualquiera de las 4 rutas de heroínas que tiene el juego así que habiendo aclarado esto prosigamos.Desde que empieza el anime ya se nos muestra que no seguirá ninguna de las rutas existentes ya que nuestro protagonista en el juego, Masaya Hinata, aquí no tiene interacción amorosa con ninguna de las heroínas y es relevado a personaje secundario por no decir eliminado. Al avanzar en los episodios también se nos muestra como las rutas de las heroínas están mezcladas lo que hace que el desarrollo de personajes sea totalmente original e iconsistente al de la novela visual, aunque tiene sucesos que pasan en el juego, en el anime ya no tienen coherencia o se quedan sin sentimiento alguno por no seguir el guión original desde el principio.En el anime se nos muestra que Asuka y Misaki serán las encargadas de llevar el protagonismo ya que Mashiro y Rika (las otras heroínas en el juego) son también puestas en el papel secundario, siendo Mashiro la que está siempre detrás de Misaki, y Rika dejada de lado, pero bueno hablaremos de esto en la sección que sigue, personajes.-Personajes-No quiero spoilear nada acerca de la historia y desarrollo de los personajes así que no entrare en detalles solo diré como se diferencian los del anime con los de la novela visual.-Protagonista y Heroínas-1. Masaya Hinata (Protagonista): bueno, simplemente lo dejaron de lado en el anime, pero en la novela visual su desarrollo en cada ruta de heroína lo hacen uno de los protagonistas más realistas que he visto.2. Asuka Kurashina (Heroína): el desarrollo que tiene es completamente opuesto al del juego ya que es la heroína mas simple pero la que trae más cambios consigo como al final de su ruta que trae una revolución al mundo del FC y es la raíz de: ‘’Lo que importa en verdad es divertirse’’.3. Misaki Tobisawa (Heroína): la heroína con el conflicto de: ‘’Si no me divierto por qué sigo volando?’’ ya que, al creer tener ‘’talento’’, pero no poder mejorar se desmorona, dejando de practicar FC para poder encontrar el valor de su esfuerzo, lográndolo así al final de su ruta donde su frustración se convierte en diversión.4. Mashiro Arisaka (Heroína): la frustración y el deseo de ser mejor la convierten en una de las heroínas que más se esfuerza por mejorar sin tener ni un ‘’talento’’ en el que apoyarse, llegando de 0 a 100 dando todo de sí misma.5. Rika Ichinose (Heroína): la estudiante sobresaliente, al tener una personalidad seria y no poder mostrar su verdadero ser, es una de las heroínas que se queda estancada y no puede mejorar hasta que llega a conocer a Masaya para así demostrar cuán lejos puede llegar al ser ella misma.-Personajes de apoyo-1.  Aoi Kagami: una figura a seguir para Masaya y mentora del mismo, la conexión que tienen demuestra que tan importante es el uno para el otro.2. Madoka Aoyagi: manager del grupo y un personaje que siempre esta pendiente de sus amigos.3. Shion Aoyagi: un hombre con un gran espíritu, de no ser por el no existiría el club de FC.4. Reiko Satou: a pesar de una ojou-sama es un personaje que se preocupa por sus compañeros y amigos, siendo así una fuente de resolución para Masaya y las Heroínas.5. Shindou Kazunari: un personaje que demuestra una gran pasión por lo que practica, siendo así otra fuente de apoyo para Masaya y las Heroínas.-Antagonistas-1. Saki Inui: una persona de pocas palabras que solo quería encontrar a alguien que se divierta volando con ella.2. Irina Avalon: la mente maestra detrás de la ‘’Bird Cage’’, en el anime se redime, pero en el juego simplemente acepta el hecho de haber disfrutado el espectáculo para luego decir que algún día les mostrara su verdadero FC.Ambas, Saki e Irina son antagonistas bien construidas con motivaciones y deseos igual que los demás.-Conclusión-La adaptación no es mala, pero no logra transmitir el mismo sentimiento que la novela visual, las heroínas que son la fuente de todo en el juego, en el anime no son desarrolladas correctamente y el protagonista que es la conexión entre las diferentes rutas, es inexistente en la adaptación.En mi opinión al ser un guión original el mensaje que quiere transmitir a lo largo del anime especialmente en el episodio final es solo el 20% de lo que te llega a transmitir en verdad la novela visual.Si quieres ver lo hermosa que es esta historia y el mensaje que quiere transmitir, te recomiendo le des una oportunidad a la novela visual, no te arrepentirás, yo le di una oportunidad y puedo decir desde el fondo de mi corazón que fue hermoso haberlo hecho…Bueno, aquí termina este escrito, si llegaste hasta aquí te lo agradezco de corazón, espero haberte ayudado con mi opinión y haber abierto una oportunidad para que juegues la novela visual.Ahora sí me despido, te agradezco por haberme leído y que tengas buen día, espero poder encontrarnos nuevamente, matta ne…\'\'Una historia de chicas surcando el cielo y experimentando el amor\'\'AOKANA, 2016… (NOTICE: Sorry if my English is bad)1. REVIEW OF THE ANIMEHistory 7/10The story is good and simple (A sports club, how much fun it is to fly and the freedom it brings, friendships, winning or losing, although what really matters is having fun, etc.) throughout the episodes it shows an entertaining story and the last episode complements the: ""What really matters is having fun.""Still, it\'s not spared from script holes or things characters say and then contradict themself, but we\'ll talk about that in the character section.Art 5/10Well...the backgrounds look good, the character design is good but the good animation is not constant if not non-existent and in certain parts the characters look amorphous, yes, the CG in the encounters makes them much more enjoyable in sight.Sound 8/10The soundtrack is very good especially since the composition is made by Elements Garden, the same ones who composed the original BGM of the visual novel.Character 5/101. Asuka Kurashina: a good character, being the fun and positive of the group. Her development is good since she starts out well, but she ends up falling and then in the final episode she shows that she is the root of: ‘’What really matters is having fun’’.2. Misaki Tobisawa: a character with low energy but when he dedicates himself to something he gives everything of himself, being the first to go through the conflict of: ""If I don\'t have fun why do I keep flying?"" so then she stops flying, although she then takes it back, to give everything of herself but this time having fun.Asuka and Misaki are the main protagonists of this story.3. Masaya Hinata: character who contributes almost nothing to the story until the last episodes.4. Mashiro Arisaka: good character, with good development, but little screen time ...... Misaki-senpaaai!!!!!!!5. Rika Ichinose: character with potential, but disappears after the fourth episode.6. Madoka Aoyagi: ...Comic Relief.7. Shion Aoyagi: a man who loves speed.8. Reiko Satou: ...is Satou-in by the way, writer.9. Shindou Kazunari: the best Skywalker in Japan.10. Saki Inui and Irina Avalon: the antagonists of the story, although Irina is the most obsessed with her perfect FC, and then ends up redeeming herself. Acceptable antagonists for a sports anime.11. Aoi Kagami: Masaya Hinata\'s mentor, only contributes to the plot at the end of the anime.Enjoyment 6/10An anime to pass the time, although you have to wait for it to get interesting.Overall 7/10An entertaining anime, funny characters, fascinating encounters, very good soundtrack, \'\' good \'\' animation, script holes, acceptable character development and a good message: \'\' What really matters is having fun \'\' (yes, I know, I have already repeated this three times) and how amazing it is to give everything you have.If you have time and want to have a good time, watch this anime, yes, do not expect an incredible story or memorable characters, it is worth it because it is entertaining especially because of the encounters and the message it gives: ‘’What really matters is having fun’’...fourth and last time I say it.If you read this, I appreciate that you took the time to read my review of this anime, see you later or below if you read the part of the visual novel, sayonara.The anime review ends here, if you wonder why I wrote so little about the characters I suggest you keep scrolling down to read the lost potential of this anime adaptation in the review from the visual novel point of view, if you wish.(NOTICE: Review taking into account the visual novel, read this if you have played the game or if you simply want to know more)2. ADAPTATION TO ANIME OF THE VISUAL NOVELWell now I will talk about how good adaptation it is, I will be taking into account the points of the anime part to compare it with the visual novel and see if it has coherence.In order not to make this longer, I will be comparing only the story and the characters, without spoilers of course.-Story-The story in the visual novel reaches the summer tournament from here you are presented with the decisions to enter any of the 4 heroine routes that the game has, so having clarified this, let\'s continue.Since the anime begins, we are already shown that it will not follow any of the existing routes since our protagonist in the game, Masaya Hinata, here has no love interaction with any of the heroines and is put in the secondary role. As we advance in the episodes, we are also shown how the routes of the heroines are mixed, which makes the character development totally original and inconsistent with that of the visual novel, although it has events that happen in the game, in the anime no longer they have coherence or they are left without any feeling for not following the original script from the beginning.In the anime we are shown that Asuka and Misaki will be in charge of being the protagonists since Mashiro and Rika (the other heroines in the game) are also put in the secondary role, with Mashiro being the one who is always behind Misaki, and Rika set aside, but we\'ll talk about this in the next section, characters.-Characters-I do not want to spoil anything about the history and development of the characters so I will not go into details I will only say how the anime differ from the visual novel.-Protagonist and Heroines-1. Masaya Hinata (Protagonist): well, they just put him aside in the anime, but in the visual novel his development on each heroine route makes him one of the most realistic protagonists I have ever seen.2. Asuka Kurashina (Heroine): her development is completely opposite to that of the game since she is the simplest heroine but the one that brings the most changes with her as at the end of her route, he brings a revolution to the world of FC and is the root from: ""What really matters is having fun.""3. Misaki Tobisawa (Heroine): the heroine with the conflict of: \'\'If I don\'t have fun, why do I keep flying?\'\' since, believing to have \'\' talent \'\', but not being able to improve, she collapses, stopping practicing FC to be able to find the value of her effort, thus achieving it at the end of her journey where his frustration turns into fun.4. Mashiro Arisaka (Heroine): the frustration and the desire to be better make her one of the heroines who strives the most to improve without having even a \'\' talent \'\' to lean on, reaching from 0 to 100 giving everything of herself.5. Rika Ichinose (Heroine): the honor student, having a serious personality and not being able to show her true self, is one of the heroines who remains stagnant and cannot improve until she gets to know Masaya in order to show how far she can go being herself.-Support characters-1. Aoi Kagami: a role model for Masaya and his mentor, the connection they have shown how important they are to each other.2. Madoka Aoyagi: manager of the group and a character who always cares about her friends.3. Shion Aoyagi: a man with a great spirit, if it weren\'t for him the FC club wouldn\'t exist.4. Reiko Satou: despite being an ojou-sama, she is a character who cares about her companions and friends, thus being a source of resolution for Masaya and the Heroines.5. Shindou Kazunari: a character who shows great passion for what he practices, thus being another source of support for Masaya and the Heroines.-Antagonists-1. Saki Inui: A person of few words who just wanted to find someone to have fun flying with her.2. Irina Avalon: the mastermind behind the \'\'Bird Cage\'\', in the anime she redeems herself, but in the game, she simply accepts the fact of having enjoyed the show and then says that one day she will show them her real FC.Both Saki and Irina are well built antagonists with just the same motivations and desires as everyone else.-Conclusion-The adaptation is not bad, but it does not manage to convey the same feeling as the visual novel, the heroines who are the source of everything in the game, in the anime they are not developed correctly and the protagonist who is the connection between the different routes, is non-existent in the adaptation.In my opinion, having an original script, the message they want to convey throughout the anime, especially in the final episode, is only the 20% of what the visual novel actually transmits to you.If you want to see how beautiful this story is and the message it wants to convey, I recommend you give the visual novel a try, you will not regret it, I gave it a chance and I can say from the bottom of my heart that it was beautiful to have done it...Well, this writing ends here, if you got this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart, I hope I have helped you with my opinion and have opened an opportunity for you to play the visual novel.Now I say goodbye, I thank you for having read me and have a good day, I hope to meet again, matta ne...‘’A story of girls flying through the sky and experiencing love’’AOKANA, 2016...--RESEÑA EN ESPAÑOL--(AVISO: Recomendable ver el anime antes de leer esta reseña)‘’Mira al cielo, no apartes la mirada, la respuesta yace ahí’’Eso es lo que me enseño la novela visual.(AVISO: Lector/Jugador de la novela visual)Si, como dice arriba, esta reseña está enfocada desde el punto de vista de adaptación de novela visual, así que tendrá dos partes, que tan buen anime es y el otro lado de la moneda, que tan bien adaptada a anime esta, ambos puntos individualmente, así que aquí vamos.1.

Personally, this is not like any other sport animes you would typically see. The anime has a great animation and sound. I really enjoy watching the opening; it gives an insight to what the viewers can expect.Overall 8.5/10: This anime is one of my favourites. It is definitely the one you should watch. Seeing the characters taking on the sport inspires and motivates you to try it as well. It can also motivate the viewers (especially the ones involved in sports) to never give up and to keep on trying. You can relate to the characters for the hardships they have endured and the lessons they have learned in the anime. I hope there is a season 2 in the future. Madoka is the manager of the team.

Aside from simple transportation, people also use these shoes in a competition called FC (Flying Circus). To score points, they either touch buoys floating above the ocean, or their opponent\'s backs.I was really hyped for this series when I first heard about it back in October of last year. I was like ""Flying Circus?, Drama and Romance?! Hell yeah, I\'m watching this series"". It was my most anticipated series of Winter 2016. Fast forward to January when the show started airing, my hype slowly died down after the 3rd or so episode. What slowly killed the hype for me? Lack of romance. If I wasn\'t expecting Romance in the beginning then I would have probably enjoyed this show a lot more I did right now.There wasn\'t really anything interesting that occurred in the first half in terms of story. It\'s basically just an introduction to the characters, how the Flying Circus works which is surprisingly more complex than I thought it would be and a few Flying Circus matches which is so fun to watch because there was barely any still shots and it\'s all smooth and consistent. I want to talk more about the FC\'s rules. At first, I thought it would just be a simple race or touching the opponent\'s back to score a point but turns out there\'s more rules embedded in FC. It actually wasn\'t until the 2nd half where I completely understood how FC works. You know, just like Basketball. Simple yet somewhat complex if you\'re a beginner.Now, the 2nd half, where the actual story begins. I wouldn\'t say the 2nd half is where the show redeemed itself but I can say that it\'s better than the first half. Basically, the 2nd half focuses on a certain someone introducing a new play style to FC which is honestly a dick move except it\'s a smart strategy Remember when Basketball didn\'t have those 24 second shot clock? That\'s how I\'ll explain the new play style. Since this is a non-spoiler review, I won\'t explain it in detail. Even with the new ""innovative"" play style introduced, it shows us how Asuka will never give up on FC and how she\'s still going to have fun playing FCLast thing that I want to talk about is the comedy. The way they handled the show\'s comedy is horrible. Four Rhythm\'s comedy is a hit or miss and for the most part, it\'s a miss. There are a few hits though but like I said, the miss outweighs the amount of hits. For example, whenever Asuka show\'s her ditzy/clumsy side; instead of me laughing, I was annoyed. By the way, this is coming from a guy who has a thing for ditzy female characters. I think they\'re funny but there was something about Asuka\'s ditziness that didn\'t translate into ""hahaha"" but rather, into ""agh, her annoying side"".If the show is going to have a second season then it\'s immediately going into my watch list because the final episode is the best episode that I have ever seen in Four Rhythm. Thought, it\'s a shame because it wasn\'t enough to save this series. The dogfight scene was just so amazing and Asuka\'s determination is one of the best that I\'ve seen from her. Asuka was so close to being my favourite character in the series but that spot goes to someone else.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (10/10)The Animation is simply beautiful. It completely fits with wherever the show is set and it looks so relaxing. It looks like they live in an island to me. The character designs are also amazing and if you look at the cover, you\'ll see Asuka\'s side boob. Yea..you\'ll see more of them side boobs in the 2nd half of the series. I already said this above and I\'ll say it again. The Dogfighting scenes are great..They\'re just so engaging and once a match ends, you\'ll want to watch more Flying Circus matches. There\'s also barely any still shots which makes the matches more exciting to watch.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9/10)When I first heard the soundtrack that was playing in the PV, I knew that the show\'s soundtrack will be great and I guess I was right. The Dogfighting battle themes is where the soundtrack excels and every time I hear it, it gives me goosebumps and it makes the matches more exciting to watch. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""Contrail ~Kiseki~"" by Mami Kawada and the ED theme songs are ""a-gain"" by Ray  and ""Kimi Toita Sora"" by Ray. I love Mami Kawada but I feel like this is, by far, her weakest song. It\'s not a bad song or anything and I didn\'t hate it but compared to her other songs, this is her weakest song. Four Rhythm\'s (VN version) OP ""Wings of Courage"", which was also sung by Mami Kawada, is 10 times better. Though, I\'m glad they played ""Wings of Courage"" in the final episode during the final FC match. For the ED, Ray delivers again with her beautiful singing voice. If you\'ve heard her previous songs then the ED theme song should sound similar to Nagi no Asuka\'s OP and Ano Natsu De Matteru OVA\'s OP.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (7.5/10)Take a look at the character\'s list and guess who the main character of the series is. If you think it\'s Masaya Hinata then you\'re dead wrong because he\'s basically a non-existent main character. He didn\'t have any serious role in the series other than training Asuka how to fly. Hell, he ""didn\'t"" even fly nor did he participate in any of the FC matches. He feels more like a side character to me. Though, they did explain in the show why Masaya doesn\'t participate in the FC anymore but it still bothered me that he\'s the supposed main character but all he was doing is coaching Asuka. If the series were to get a second season and Masaya flies again because Asuka inspired him to play in FC again then I will forgive Masaya\'s non-existent MC role here.The character that felt like an actual Main Character is Asuka Kurashina. Not only does she get more character development than Masaya but she also gets more screentime than Masaya. Honestly, I love Asuka\'s character because of her passion in FC and her determination to never give up. Due to her determination, she manages to do (and master) a special move that is supposedly hard to do. At the first half, she\'s a ditzy, clumsy character who barely knows how to fly but in the second half, she\'s more of a strong female character who chased her passion and never gave up on FC even though she was horrible at flying. In the second half, she manages not only to fly but also master the special move.The 2nd character that also felt like an actual MC than Masaya is Misaki Tobisawa. At first, I honestly did not like her because of her cliched personality. She loves to sleep and eat and the fact that she puts a ""nya"" at the end of her sentences is the sole reason why I didn\'t like her in the first half. However, in the 2nd half, I began to like her character and she became my most favourite character in the series. It\'s mostly because of her character development in the 2nd half.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)Even though the show suffers from lack of romance and there\'s minimal drama in the series, I still enjoyed the series because of the FC matches and Asuka and Misaki\'s character in the 2nd half which was a lot better when they were first introduced.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]""Ao No Kanata No Four Rhythm"" or ""Four Rhythm Across the Blue"" in English could have been something great if they stuck with the VN and made this series a 2 cour but instead what we got is an average/decent slice-of-life show about Flying Circus. If you\'re looking for a relaxing slice-of-life show that focuses on a fictional sport then this is for you. If you\'re looking for romance however, then I don\'t recommend this anime. You\'re better off playing the Visual Novel.[OVERALL]: (7.5/10)Pros:+Relaxing Slice of Life show that\'s about a fictional sport+FC matches are exciting to watch+Outstanding Animation+Great Soundtrack, most of it are battle themes that plays during FC+Asuka\'s determination and passion in FC is what makes her a likable character+Great and Exciting EndingCons:-Gonzo deciding not to adapt the romance element from the source material.-Comedy is mostly a miss-Asuka\'s personality was annoying for the first 3-4 episodes a technology called ""Grav-shoes"" which allows the wearer to fly to the skies.

(Spoilers)When I first watched the first episode I thought ''Wow, that was interesting and pretty bad at the same time. But just try not to drop it.'' I'm glad I didn't. This anime covered its bad parts and has become a lot better since the first episode. But still it has issues. They added drama and character developments in it but still with romance, better art and exciting music it could even deserve 9 out of 10.Story: 7.5/10The story is about a girl who always wanted to fly, luckily there is a invention that makes people fly : Flying...Shoes. That girl moves to an island(?) and starts using that shoes. But she can't fly well so her new friends start teaching her how to fly. Her dreams came true! What a happy story... Anyway, the main plot is about an interesting sport called Flying Circus (FC) and she starts being into it (long story... Watch the first episode and you'll understand). Then she and her friends start doing FC, the male character becomes their coach/director and they want to go to tournaments. Yeah story is going like that. Actually what matters about the story is matches. Who is going to win and what kind of cool moves and strategies is s/he going to use?I don't like the characters that so OP and wins every match from ep 1 to final, so this anime is not like that. In the first episode main character couldn't even fly stable. My only hope from the story was that (characters improve their skills) and it happened. And I liked the final. And they expressed their main idea well in the final. ''True battle comes after losing.'' (Well, a lot of losing) and you should have fun while you are trying to win.The plot is classic sport or slice of life plot and it's interesting enough to continue so 7/10 is a fair score.Art: 7/10I generally didn't like the character designs but the match scenes and flying effects are really cool.Sound: 7/10I don't like the OP or ED so much but OSTs are actually good and relaxing.Characters: 7/10These kind of animes characters and enjoyment is much more important than story. ''But the characters are the worst part of this anime. They should've made the characters interesting. Even better art (character designs) would make them more interesting.'' I said when I first wrote this review. I still think it is one of the worst parts of this anime but when I kept watching I found the characters really interesting. They tried all characters to develop (which I liked) but it could be a lot better. Few episodes, the main focus was on the characters but not matches. We saw Misaki's real feels about the FC, Asuka and the ''FC King''. And Asuka was one of the most developed characters I've seen. The episode when she fell into the sea and she lost and she cried. Maybe the only time this anime used drama but it was good. The main problem is the male character. He is just directing the girls. 2 or 3 minutes we saw him flying but it surely wasn't enough.Enjoyment: 7/10At first it's really boring but I started to enjoy it after mid-season. Generally the match scenes are really enjoyable. You usually know who's gonna win but the tricks are really cool. But the main problem about the enjoyment is lack of comedy and especially romance.Overall: 7/10So here is my opinions about this series. Could be a lot better? Hell, yes. Is it bad? Hell, no :) Shoes. That girl moves to an island(?) and starts using that shoes. But she can't fly well so her new friends start teaching her how to fly. Her dreams came true! What a happy story...

Hell, no :)"", 'So, Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is about a sport called FC- Flying Circus is where 2 players, 1 vs 1 fight in the air at high speed, and gain points by touching buoys that are scattered in the air or by touching the enemy\'s back.Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is a special anime, I have yet to see a speical like this.The sports focus also gives the satisfaction as it was Action, even though it doesn\'t have action is it.Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm doesn\'t have any nudity, Ecchi or sexual moments, also called ""Fanservice""- None.It focuses on the FC itself,...and less on the side, which is great, and can make the plot go on smoothly and well.The story didn\'t have much of complication, it was basically their training, development, matches and tournaments, which were exciting matches, colorful and bright.I don\'t remember the sound being something special, the Opening song was pretty catchy and fun to hear, but nothing else.Characters develpoed there well, they had the times which they were at their best, and a bit when they weren\'t, but most of the anime was in a good spirit.Also, the characters were really funny, and got well together (Some anime has the inside fights in a group, this anime doesn\'t really have that, besides a small time when they envyed each other).The ""bad"" charaters weren\'t ""evil"" or so, they were pretty fine, and understandble, and people can also like them.This anime is absolutely underrated, and I enjoyed watching that very much, It\'s light, and goes with a free spirit (No depressing or ""feelings"" scenes)*In addition, no romance*I rated everything 8/10- Story, Art, Sound, Character and Enjoyment.In short, special anime, that you don\'t see around every day, and is recommended. Fits to everybody. :) and less on the side, which is great, and can make the plot go on smoothly and well.The story didn\'t have much of complication, it was basically their training, development, matches and tournaments, which were exciting matches, colorful and bright.I don\'t remember the sound being something special, the Opening song was pretty catchy and fun to hear, but nothing else.Characters develpoed there well, they had the times which they were at their best, and a bit when they weren\'t, but most of the anime was in a good spirit.Also, the characters were really funny, and got well together (Some anime has the inside fights in a group, this anime doesn\'t really have that, besides a small time when they envyed each other).The ""bad"" charaters weren\'t ""evil"" or so, they were pretty fine, and understandble, and people can also like them.This anime is absolutely underrated, and I enjoyed watching that very much, It\'s light, and goes with a free spirit (No depressing or ""feelings"" scenes)*In addition, no romance*I rated everything 8/10- Story, Art, Sound, Character and Enjoyment.In short, special anime, that you don\'t see around every day, and is recommended. Fits to everybody. :)', 'In an alternate world anti-gravity shoes are commonplace worldwide that allows the user to fly around in the sky practically. Thus came the creation of a game called ‘Flying Circus’ Asuka Kurashina is a transfer student who has no idea about anti-gravity shoes. After being introduced to the anti-gravity shoes and the sport ‘Flying Circus’ by Hinata Masaya and Misaki Tobisawa, Asuka then decides to join the ‘Flying Circus’ club bringing about its revival.Now I’ll be the first to admit it, I didn’t think this anime was going to go anywhere and the subject of flying was going to be a small plot point...whilst the series focusses on the romance aspects and such. Boy… was I wrong.Story:The story focusses on our main heroine Asuka Kurashina and her progression in the Flying circus team and we have the inclusion of other characters from Kunahama academy and their progression within the sport.Initially the show starts off in what I perceived to be a stereotypical romance/harem anime. Asuka meets Hinata on the beach and helps her out. The anime however decides not to take the romantic route and focusses entirely on the sports aspect of the anime.Story progression was steady throughout the show and I only feel that the rushed ending was the let-down for me. However what surprised me was that the show made me feel that some romantic elements were going to be included, but shifted focus away from what was in the visual novel, which in my opinion was a fantastic call.Romance elements can distract the story of an anime unless that is the central theme. However being a sports anime the focus was entirely on the development of their skills and the determination of the characters to fight for the sport that they love.Characters:Asuka Kurashina is a ditsy and adorable girl who had aspirations of soaring through the skies as a child. When introduced to grav-shoes, Asuka initially struggles to use them and with the assistance of Hinata and Misaki, Asuka learns how to fly properly and after being persuaded to join the flying circus club Asuka’s skills in flying and as an all-rounder player excel greatly. Asuka’s relationships with other members in the group is solid and especially with Misaki which I will delve into.Misaki Tobisawa is a stern and energetic girl who is personally my favourite character in the show. It was after introducing Asuka to flying circus that Misaki would try competing in the sport again. I felt Misaki’s development as a character was really tested after being beaten Kazunari Shindō. I really loved how the show goes about portraying the change in desire after losing to someone else and witnessing someone else better than you.The last mentionable character is Hinata Masaya who is the coach of the flying circus team. Hinata acts as a mentor for Asuka and the others to help improve their game. Masaya is a lesser character in the anime in comparison to being the main protagonist of the visual novel.Art:Studio Gonzo does yet again a great job of animating this series, the use of 3D was apparent in some episodes, but I didn’t find it particularly distracting. Colours were vibrant, but character designs were nothing special if I’m honest.Sound:The sound was very good for the series. I haven’t listened to the OST yet, but particularly during the flying circus matches It was heavy with excitement and anticipation. The sound tracks did a good job to get me invested in the intense sports battles. ""A-gain"" by Ray was an excellent ending song for the anime and accompanied by the visuals of Asuka and Misaki highlighting the two’s close friendship and rivalry made it very enjoyable.Final Verdict:I was quite sure this anime would end up being another stereotypical adaptation of a romance visual novel and I was honestly quite surprised with the final product. Let’s get this straight Aokana is a sports anime, something I didn’t realize since old reliable Wikipedia branded It as a romance. When stripped away of its romantic elements you do have yourself an enjoyable show to watch. That doesn’t however mean it’s a justifiable show to recommend.The anime started off quite slow actually. I also felt that there are a lot of other sports anime out there that could do equally as much justice as Aokana did, but just a difference in sports. I can see how the appeal of flying through the skies can make can the show an attractive proposition and to integrate a sport into this was a very good idea, to which I give the Reiko Yoshida applause.The silly moments provided comedic relief weren’t anything too amusing and at times Misaki’s use of cat speech like ‘Nya’ can be annoying, though I\'m just nit-picking the little things.Overall I found this Aokana to be a very nice show about competitive flying sports. I recommend this to fans of sports anime looking for alternative sports to basketball or tennis.  Those looking for romance elements won’t find any here, so scoot along.I give Aokana a 7 out of 10 and a recommendation of trying the first four episodes. If you don’t like it then move on to something else after that.Alternative recommendations for this are Ro-Kyu-Bu! A basketball anime with cutesy girls who aim to become better basketball players… Yeah... Sorry guys I don’t watch a lot of sports anime can’t find much else to compare this to if im honest.Lastly I suggest trying a visual novel called. ‘If my heart had wings’ vastly different in terms of story as a group of highschoolers set out building a glider to soar through the open skies. It came to mind when i watched Aokana. If you like visual novels check it out.Thanks for reading guys. Have a nice day! whilst the series focusses on the romance aspects and such. Boy… was I wrong.Story:The story focusses on our main heroine Asuka Kurashina and her progression in the Flying circus team and we have the inclusion of other characters from Kunahama academy and their progression within the sport.Initially the show starts off in what I perceived to be a stereotypical romance/harem anime.

Colours were vibrant, but character designs were nothing special if I’m honest.Sound:The sound was very good for the series. I haven’t listened to the OST yet, but particularly during the flying circus matches It was heavy with excitement and anticipation. The sound tracks did a good job to get me invested in the intense sports battles. ""A-gain"" by Ray was an excellent ending song for the anime and accompanied by the visuals of Asuka and Misaki highlighting the two’s close friendship and rivalry made it very enjoyable.Final Verdict:I was quite sure this anime would end up being another stereotypical adaptation of a romance visual novel and I was honestly quite surprised with the final product. Let’s get this straight Aokana is a sports anime, something I didn’t realize since old reliable Wikipedia branded It as a romance. When stripped away of its romantic elements you do have yourself an enjoyable show to watch. That doesn’t however mean it’s a justifiable show to recommend.The anime started off quite slow actually. I also felt that there are a lot of other sports anime out there that could do equally as much justice as Aokana did, but just a difference in sports. I can see how the appeal of flying through the skies can make can the show an attractive proposition and to integrate a sport into this was a very good idea, to which I give the Reiko Yoshida applause.The silly moments provided comedic relief weren’t anything too amusing and at times Misaki’s use of cat speech like ‘Nya’ can be annoying, though I\'m just nit-picking the little things.Overall I found this Aokana to be a very nice show about competitive flying sports. I recommend this to fans of sports anime looking for alternative sports to basketball or tennis.  Those looking for romance elements won’t find any here, so scoot along.I give Aokana a 7 out of 10 and a recommendation of trying the first four episodes. If you don’t like it then move on to something else after that.Alternative recommendations for this are Ro-Kyu-Bu! A basketball anime with cutesy girls who aim to become better basketball players… Yeah... Sorry guys I don’t watch a lot of sports anime can’t find much else to compare this to if im honest.Lastly I suggest trying a visual novel called. ‘If my heart had wings’ vastly different in terms of story as a group of highschoolers set out building a glider to soar through the open skies. It came to mind when i watched Aokana. If you like visual novels check it out.Thanks for reading guys. Have a nice day!', ""I'd first like to mention that this is my first review. Now, about Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm.The anime is quite interesting and unique in its own way, though the plot is predictable at times. The girl Asuka Kurashina is a clumsy and cute character, one that wishes she could fly. That dream comes true, for she can use the Grav-Shoes and participate in a competition called FC (Flying Circus) with the help of those shoes. With the appropriate help and training, she and her team are taking part in it.It turns into a sports anime, where they compete for the first place. They...get to compete with amazing other characters, every one having their own playing style and brand new moves. It doesn't introduce us all the characters properly one by one, but on the other hand it really emphasizes on the battles, which in my opinion are really a thing. get to compete with amazing other characters, every one having their own playing style and brand new moves. It doesn't introduce us all the characters properly one by one, but on the other hand it really emphasizes on the battles, which in my opinion are really a thing."", 'So I really liked this anime, it was very entertaining and the characters were really fun. I could really enjoy these epic battles, and the last episode made me really emotional, it is truly a great anime. One thing that bothers me a bit... is the lack of a bit more slice of life scenes and a bit more character development, I think it was just a bit rushed, not really much, but they could have done much more and it would have been a 10, I would fucking love this anime and it would be my favorite. But yeah overall an 8. ', 'For those of you that are expecting romance in this anime, don\'t expect any. There is ZERO romance in the anime. Don\'t get your hopes up if the romance aspect is all you care about. You have been warned.Now, Ao no Kanata is adapted from a visual novel. And I am a big fan of visual novels. This will means several things.1: The adaptation will almost guaranteed to be unfaithful to the original source.2: A 12 episode adaptation will NOT cover all the story lines and routes.3: My expectations will be kept low.That\'s just how 99% of most visual novel adaptations go, so I wasn\'t...surprised when the anime changed the main character from Hinata Masaya to Kurashina Asuka. Right from episode 1 they were already taking a different approach to the original source content, from a romance filled story to a slice of life version.I can see where they were planning on going with this. Cut out all the romance in the anime, keep the anime PG-13 (visual novel is an eroge, after all), and leave the romance for those who want more after the anime to play the visual novel. The anime is ultimately an advertisement for you to go play the game. Smart idea, but if you\'re going to do that, TAKE THE STUPID ROMANCE TAG OUT OF THE ANIME, MYANIMELIST PEOPLE. If there was no romance tag in the first place, there would be a lot less salty people running around the forums right now.But enough about romance. What about the anime in general?Pros:-Great soundtrack (some of it was completely taken from the visual novel ost). The opening is probably one of my favorites this season. Shame that Mami Kawada retired. You will be missed.-Great background artwork (water and skies were nicely done)-Core of the story was very straightforward and easy to follow-Great moe moments (the part I liked most about the anime)-Slice of Life elements were done extremely well (as expected of director of Non non Biyori)Cons:-It is clear some of the characters got shafted from this adaptation. Rika, for example, is listed as a main character, yet she barely had any screen time. Same goes for Masaya, who was completely pushed off to the side as a supporting character (even though he was THE main character in the visual novel). Even some of the side characters could not hold their positions as side characters and just simply vanished from the face of the earth as the anime went on.-The Flying Circus battles have CGI elements in them. While at times they do look very nice (last episode was a great example of good CGI), most of the times the animations look very stiff and artificial, making some of the action scenes somewhat lackluster and uninspired.-They did a poor job explaining some of the rules and tactics for the Flying Circus sport. Sometimes some things would happen in the anime and you would scratch your head and wonder ""Was that move even legal?"" or ""Wait? You can do that?""-The lack of romance was really disappointing. They missed a lot of great heart wrenching moments from the visual novel that could have added an extra layer of depth into the anime.If I were to rate this based on adaptation, I would give it a 6. This anime is an inferior version of the visual novel in every possible aspect. However, my enjoyment for this anime is a 7. They kept the core of the story from the visual novel and kept it fresh with comedy and wonderful slice of life elements. It was passable as a standalone, I suppose.Would I recommend this to anyone? If you desire romance, STAY AWAY FROM THIS anime. If you like moe, sports, slice of life and drama, this may be worth checking out. It\'s a very chill anime that does not really break any new grounds. There is a sequel visual novel confirmed, so there may also be a sequel anime as well.I encourage anyone who finished the Ao no Kanata anime to play the visual novel. The anime only covers roughly ONE FOURTH of the visual novel. There is a LOT more story to tell. Also, you will get your fix of romance once you play the game :)The concept of wanting to fly has always been a dream in many of our hearts, and this anime explores what it would be like if a flying sport existed. For that, I am thankful to Studio Sprite and Gonzo for bringing our childhood dreams some hope.For other recommendations related to Ao no Kanata, I have heard many people compare Ao no Kanata to Air Gear. For my own recommendation, I would recommend Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate. KoiChoco and AoKana are made by the same visual novel studio (Studio Sprite), and they have the same joke character running around both series. surprised when the anime changed the main character from Hinata Masaya to Kurashina Asuka.

But other than the misleading genre titles, I personally found it quite enjoyable.Note that this show was based on a VN (Visual Novel) by Sprite.  So there will be some VN cliches.Story.  For many who takes anime seriously and always seeks a plot, then you will be disappointed.  Mainly, it was non-existent.  I guess the best way to put it was similar to Fee!. Not much plot, just characters doing sports.  Also, it's a sport that doesn't exist in real life.  So no one can remotely relate to it....And I feel it could have done much better if they developed the story more.  But, it's probably one of those VN animes for advertising.Art. Brilliant.  Not gonna say much but it does its job very well.Sound.  I'm a fan of anime osts (Original Soundtracks) in general.  And let me tell you, I've been trying to find this anime's ost since like episode 7.  I just love the cheery-ness and the light-heartedness of these osts.   And again I've a feeling the ost were from the actual VN itself.  And generally, VN have great osts.Characters.  Despite its relatively poor plot, the characters were quite memorable.  The bubbly one, the sleepy-cat one, the obsessive one, and the quiet one.  They're all there and it kinda deviates from your usual characters because they fulfil their role very well.

Suspension of disbelief, it's a Sci-fi anime about a non-existing sport.  (And you WILL be very confused most of the time, but I think it will be worth it).  Accept the show as it is.  Remember that it's only 12 episodes, about a non-existing sport.  So it will be IMPOSSIBLE to fill everyone's image of this show, and perfect it.  Even Angel Beats, deemed as Angel Feels, couldn't develop all its characters in 12 episodes (excluding the extra episodes).  So don't expect that will happen in this anime.Overall, as much as i would like to give it more than 7, it doesn't deserve more than 8.  Max, 7.9 .  Pacing and plot were the main downfalls of this. But I kinda expected it after the first episode.  BUT, please, if you have dropped this show, I do encourage you to finish it off.

Now I understand: this anime isn\'t about the breathcatching plot or the awesom characters, it\'s just about the atmosphere and surroundings. When I watched it for the first time, it was just an average anime to me, but it left kind of subconscious imprint on my...soul. I realised it for the first time, as these green rainy urbanized islands appeared in my dreams. As I woke up, I just understood, that there\'s something special about this atmosphere and this landscape. Since that, I\'m just in love with that atmosphere.

But then the actual matches weren\'t exciting either. One or the other side would do a move complete with ridiculous name and hand-waving physics explanation, and then win. Considering...how little I was able to care about the results of the games, maybe they would have been better off going with a romance slant (based originally on a love sim game).The art was fine, nothing special.

That\'s said I can rated it based on my own personal bias opinions.Before I actually begin, I should probably address the elephant in the room. Aokana is a great show, great in the way that the overall theme didn\'t require romance. Let\'s take a look at the opening scene. The few slides after the beat drops, we see a few words ""The True Battle Comes After Losing."" I don\'t see how in any way,...where having this pop up in the opening could ever lead to any romance. The show has never been about romance, if you so duly desire some romance download tinder or play the visual novel. If you can\'t understand how this adaptation is ruined with romance, you haven\'t seen enough anime.Now that we\'ve address that, the first thing I\'d like to review is the animations. However bare in mind I typically enjoy mecha animations so I cannot say too much about this section. That said compared to the game CG (which I\'ve not played yet) they were pretty accurate with some of the effects toned down. But much like most anime, there are scenes where people are drawn correctly, but as long as it isn\'t on the quality level of Rail Wars, then it gets a passing.Characters. Where do I begin? While each of the heroines are developed, most are lacking. Notably the Main Character from the visual novel. But once again THIS IS NOT A ROMANCE ANIME. Thus his role as a supporting character is a good choice and is fine to underdeveloped. In my personal opinion the true main characters were Misaki and Asuka. We see both of their emotions and struggles with the sport. And how the few words in the opening actually reflect this. However it falls short because of some characters. Their presence is so small that the anime could have been the same without that character or that scene in general (there are few trust me, you can\'t miss them). The characters as a whole are likable in the cast, but some characters could have had more of an impact, like Rika and Mashiro. But overall the cast is enjoyable.Now I would go into the sounds, but unfortunately, I\'m not particular good at describing it beyond saying each soundtrack and that insert, all flowed well with the show.Now onto the plot. There\'s a reason why I called this show ""beginner\'s luck the animation."" This is one issue where sport shows fail at, and it\'s usually why I don\'t watch many, but it always shows the character having some natural talent in the sport that they had no knowledge of. This is taken up to 11 when Asuka decides to have a match with another student on the day she just learnt to fly. Now you may be asking, isn\'t the theme of this show ""the true battle comes after losing?"" And I\'d answer yes little one. So it\'s no spoiler that some main character will lose the will to continue playing the sport. This is when it gets good, you see tensions rise between friends and teammates while that character tries to understand why she wants to fly (please it\'s not a spoiler when there\'s only 2 guys who actually do sport), what compels her. And it\'s these parts that make the show good.And sadly we must come back to the elephant. Throughout the series there are hints at why Masaya doesn\'t play the sport anymore. The main character of the show also has flashbacks about a certain boy she met in the past, yet she brushes it off and decide not to put 2 and 2 together. I believe this is what most people got angry at. However if we look at it from another perspective, these flashbacks allowed the characters reaffirm what\'s important to them and how to achieve their goal.Now let me address the romance for all the haters. How would the writers incorporate it? According to some places I\'ve read this is Asuka\'s route. Now if Masaya and Asuka were to develop some romance how will Masaya as a coach be any importance to any of the other girls. But if you reply, Misaki has Shindou, I\'d reply but they needed to make room for Masaya\'s development along with him and Asuka, where would Shindou be if they story had focused on Masaya and Asuka. That would leave Misaki unable to develop her own way of playing the sport. Anyways, Masaya doesn\'t play much of a role, but he\'s still there. Also we only know a few things about him but not so much besides the fact that he\'s quit the sport when he was a star as a child. What would the writers cut out so they could develop his character? Understandably the show points at this from time to time with the new neighbor and the windows incident, but that\'s just poor writing, as that scene wasn\'t useful to the story as a whole. If this was a two cour show and lacking in romance, then yes I can see an issue. But for this short one cour show, it does fine without it.Sadly that\'s all the praise I can give it. The plot isn\'t all great. While the main characters find their reason to fight, so does Masaya. Which is totally irrelevant, along with the Sensei. A bit of an explicit spoiler here, but near the finale, the Sensei and Masaya decide to actually start trying. Thus they trained with all the athletes. And at the end, the Sensei says ""I\'ll tell you this super secret move"" and at the end of the series they didn\'t even show it, granted we don\'t what it is, but I assume it wasn\'t shown. And the shows ending brings me to another point. The main antagonist uses a technique on Asuka (please, as much as I wanted Misaki to win we all knew that it would be Asuka who wins and that is not spoiler unless you\'re new to anime) to which causes the match to go into overtime. The overtime allows for a short break to which Asuka decides to use the same technique on the antagonist, much to everyone\'s surprise, because the technique should require a lot of practice. It\'s because of this that I found it bad that the story ended like this, especially how Asuka got the final point.All in all, the show is great for all the tension it provides, however it falls short with the cliche ending. While I really enjoyed it, for other reasons I won\'t say, I can see why people were disappoint with it. It\'s like getting a game that\'s only half complete, oh wait... where having this pop up in the opening could ever lead to any romance. The show has never been about romance, if you so duly desire some romance download tinder or play the visual novel. If you can\'t understand how this adaptation is ruined with romance, you haven\'t seen enough anime.Now that we\'ve address that, the first thing I\'d like to review is the animations. However bare in mind I typically enjoy mecha animations so I cannot say too much about this section. That said compared to the game CG (which I\'ve not played yet) they were pretty accurate with some of the effects toned down. But much like most anime, there are scenes where people are drawn correctly, but as long as it isn\'t on the quality level of Rail Wars, then it gets a passing.Characters. Where do I begin? While each of the heroines are developed, most are lacking. Notably the Main Character from the visual novel. But once again THIS IS NOT A ROMANCE ANIME.

It\'s like getting a game that\'s only half complete, oh wait...', 'I was able to finish this series just recently and it left me an interest to write a review for it. While I was able to play its visual novel (the first visual novel that I was able to finish), I’d like to give my cents worth.Aokana is a unique sci-fi, sports anime which revolves around the value of camaraderie, which the anime adaptation gives emphasis. What makes it unique is the concept of the sport involved which is the “Flying Circus” (FC). Just imagine a dogfight between 2 fighter jets but instead of the jets, humans themselves are involved with the help of gravshoes...for them to fly. Basically, it’s a human dogfight with addition of racing in the sky, that’s how FC works. It was introduced here that humans are capable of flying almost freely with the help of gravshoes.I was surprised that the anime adaptation went on a different side compared to the visual novel. Though the only difference of the two is the thought of the story, the anime adaptation didn’t fail to retain most parts of the visual novel. What surprised me is how the story flowed on the anime. In the VN, the main protagonist is Masaya and the story revolved on himself and his relationship with the 4 heroines (Asuka, Mashiro, Rika, and Misaki). What we had here in anime is Asuka as the main protagonist and the story revolved on the friendship built in their club and with their rivals. In addition, in the VN, Masaya’s the one who reached a hand to Asuka in her first flight while in the anime, Misaki’s the one who introduced Asuka in flying. After their defeat in the FC Summer Tournament, the anime followed Asuka’s route in the VN in conclusion to the series.Story:While the main key of the VN is the romance (aside from the sports), the anime didn’t disappoint despite removing the romance part. The story became interesting and enjoying about the development of the 4 main girls together with their friends/rivals. The love for the sport, passion to grow, fear of losing, regrets and trauma of the past, envy and anxiety for those better than them, which are some of the keypoints tackled that were able to execute in the anime.  They were able to deliver the story of the VN straightforwardly without sacrificing important details.Art:The art and character designs are not as beautiful as from the VN but it’s still commendable as they were able to replicate the designs from the VN and weren’t massacred. Aokana is very colorful in the VN considering that contrails are everywhere in the sport and Studio Gonzo was able to do a great job in making it possible in the anime.Sound:The choice of OP and ED theme fits the series but not as good as from the VN. The insert song “Wings of Courage” from the final match between Asuka and Saki is a banger and really sets the mood for that specific scene. I was surprised that they prepared a different ED (Kimi to Ito Sora) for the final ep. If you love Ray and Mami Kawada like me, you’ll surely enjoy the songs of this anime.Verdict:Obviously, I really enjoyed this anime. I only have a little personal disappointment since I came from the VN first but still, this one’s a good watch. This anime will have you the thought of fun in flying and being one with the sky.There might be some parts which seems to bore you especially in the beginning but they were necessary to build up the excitement and tension in the mid and later part of the anime. I’d say that I could recommend this to those who likes light series with competition that doesn’t have any romance element. It’s a pretty flexible anime worthy of any type of viewer. I could guarantee that it won’t disappoint you. for them to fly. Basically, it’s a human dogfight with addition of racing in the sky, that’s how FC works.

They have all what was mentioned before, but the opposite gender....And being a fan of those two recent sports animes, I had a good time watching this one.Some may call out our MC is quite the dumb klutz, but she is about as clueless to the sport as she was. In short, she learns about the sport as much as we do from watching.The sport is pretty neat, its a 1 versus 1 aerial battle for point control. One player tries to get from one area to another, while the other tries to stop them.It\'s not such an intense watch as the more well known sports animes, but it certainly isn\'t what the tags say it is. Check it out for a more lighter and chill sport anime.

The slice of life at best gives some ""ok-running gag"" comedy to some character development sections for the character in question and the developments to most of the characters are handled ""ok"", though some are rushed as they only get one episode to their name then tag along with the competition as spectators. The FC sport as simple as it is, it is rather interesting to watch and gives some form...of adrenaline to it, be it because of the simplistic nature or how animated it is, FC is the main reason LA watched the series all the way through. Because it\'s also a pseudo-sports anime it also falls under many of the typical sports cliches, but for what this anime does...as cliched as it is, it\'s still fun nonetheless as it\'s does help with the characters development.With the characters they are typical visual novel stereotypes with their own quirks just with the added sports added to it. One of the club members Misaki Tobisawa voiced by \'\'Azumi Asakura\'\' have a cat accent every time she talks and she gets huge amount of development outside from being the cat sleeper character, Mashiro Arisaka voiced by \'\'Nozomi Yamamoto\'\' is the yuri girl in love with Misaki and later her development focuses on her inferiority complex towards the better FC\'er, Asuka Kurashina voiced by \'\'Misato Fukuen\'\' is probably the only character in the anime to not change her behaviour, instead her stride to grow as a FC\'er becomes a pedestal to the rest of the characters. Finally the only male Masaya Hinata voiced by \'\'Ryota Osaka\'\' about his reluctance to join the club in the first place though he knows the sport a lot. The characters get developed in the episodic arc sense along with growing the club simultaneously and that works in this anime\'s favour.In terms of animation, well hello Gonzo, your not slacking this time. Yes, the animation throughout is decent enough and although CGI is used during the high-speed moments of the FC, it\'s not distracting in the sense as the FC battle is animated well overall to be ignored, not to mention the contrails and the overall FC battles are the best parts of the series. Overall Gonzo once again steps it up with the animation even when they use CGI!In terms of voice acting, LA would have to say that there are some squeakers, that being \'\'Nozomi Yamamoto\'\' and \'\'Misato Fukuen\'\' however LA can once again ignore that as LA\'s favorite character would go to Asuka Kurashina (her genkiness is rather infectious with Misato\'s vocals).The ending did make the build up and the ""final battle"" itself along with the intensity of the battle and the overall theme in which this anime was trying to portray (even though it\'s slightly cliched) to ""just have fun"" instead of worrying about winning all the more prevalent...huh that statement LA said at the start of review kinda went full circle now.Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm may not be a hidden gem or a prominently ""great"" anime of Winter 2016, it definitely has a certain charm to it from it\'s quirky characters to it\'s love and enthusiasm of FC and flying through it\'s characters and thus LA will say that it\'s not a hidden gem or the ""best"" anime of Winter 2016...it\'s average-above average at best. of adrenaline to it, be it because of the simplistic nature or how animated it is, FC is the main reason LA watched the series all the way through.

Although I feel like I could have fit it in, the new ideas and concepts make up for it.The story follows a group of high school students that participate in FC, or Flying Circus. The players, using anti-gravity boots, race each other to these buoys or try to tag the other players back. Pretty simple, but also pretty creative.Now,...the characters were very lackluster.

Surprisingly, this show isn\'t really like that at all, it\'s more about the fruition of a girl\'s lifelong dream to be able to fly and compete with the other best flyers in the area. Though the show showed promise early on with some good development, the circus\'s act breaks up late in the show, falling victim to forced, unnatural antagonists. If you\'re looking for a harem, this definitely is not one. If you\'re looking for a competitive, tournament-based show...that bastardizes moves from air combat, then feel free to dig in.Animation:The show is well drawn overall with a rather bright mood and lots of serene, blue skies and oceans. Backgrounds in general are mixed as occasionally you get really detailed drawings (mostly clouds) and other times you get generic, blurred scenery. There is definitely a lot of CGI in this show, some of which is pretty distracting. The show has some nice, colorful UI displays during tournaments and some other gadgetry that looks like it\'s lifted right out of a game. The character styling is average overall; you won\'t get characters confused with each other but there isn\'t anything particularly special about them either. Asuka\'s drawing style feels a bit odd as her eyes seem to give off an air of confidence and sharpness that honestly is missing most of the time. I also don\'t get the uniforms worn during matches, not really sure why yukata-like sleeves are helpful in a speed contest.Expect a fair, though dispersed, amount of action, centered around the two main tournaments in the show. I was indeed surprised that they made it through two tournaments considering how most shows of late fail to conclude even a single one per season. The action consists of two contestants flying and attempting to accomplish goals, either hitting pylons or hitting the other contestant\'s back, which apparently causes a giant magic-sign-like symbol to appear. Given that most of the action is really just following colorful contrails in the sky, this isn\'t going to be satisfying for those needing real, gritty action. The same can be said in the ecchi department. Though there are completely unnecessary scenes, such as our protagonist seeing his neighbor pretty much naked multiple times, it isn\'t nearly as over the top as some of the other ecchi heavy hitters. That said, there is plenty of bouncy and bodysuits in the show if that\'s your fancy.Sound:The show opens with a very light rock OP that reminds me a bit of the voicing in Mami Kawada\'s work in Shakugan no Shana, the melody here isn\'t nearly as strong though. The ED is likewise very light (almost like they purposely filtered out all the base); I like the instrumentation and atmospheric pads, but the melody just isn\'t convincing. The same could be said about the BGM, it has some good fundamentals and some nice string tracks but ultimately lacks any memorable melodies; the stringed instruments make for a fairly relaxed mood overall.The show has a decent number of veterans but the actual casting feels odd. Misato Fukuen (Yami from ToLoveRu) is an interesting choice for a clumsy, light-hearted heroine and Azumi Asakura (Asia from DxD and Kumin from Chuunibyou) is an odd choice for an own-pace tsundere. Really, my choice for strongest performance goes to Risa Taneda, who voices a strong supporting character.Story:The show follows yet another high school club, this time the Flying Circus club where you train to fly in circles in what is essentially something like a baseball diamond. Our protagonist, Hinata, is coerced into joining the dying Kurahama club along with the heroines of the show. What follows is a lot of preparation and, surprisingly, multiple tournaments. It\'s all told in a rather simple, contiguous storyline with just a few teasing flashbacks.Though I appreciated the effort in drawing out this unlikely setting and liked the intensity during the tournaments, the rest of the show felt rather lackluster. Though episodes flow well together, many of them focus on a specific heroine and their personal struggle; often the protagonist isn\'t even part of the resolution. As alluded to before, the show builds to two main peaks in the form of the tournaments. Each is resolved to a fair degree (the latter in the final end credits) though I still don\'t get the point of the whole show. There were a lot of what seem to be foreshadows that don\'t amount to anything; either Gonzo planned a sequel or are using them to satisfy those who consumed the original source material- in either case these events are just wasted screen time for the rest of us for now.Character:There are a fair number of characters in this show, including about half of dozen rather important females. The character interactions were pretty good overall, but one wonders why they even put the protagonist here. It becomes obviously pretty early in the show that he\'s no ordinary Joe, but he really never gets much of a chance to shine nor does he really try for the majority of the show. Other than seeing his neighbor undress a few times, there\'s nothing guyish about our lead.The heroines fare better than our protagonist but likewise aren\'t particularly memorable. There\'s just too many of them and none of them really ever develops any real bonds with the protagonist, the strongest bond is arguably between two of the girls. Reiko Satouin gets my vote for most interesting character, which says a lot considering that she\'s not even a main character. As for the lead heroine, Asuka, there\'s just something about her that\'s off. Sometimes she\'s goofy and sometimes she\'s Kira Yamato; it just boggles me how a single person can be such a klutz and yet such a genius.Unfortunately, a character-centric slice of life is pretty meaningless without strong characters, and that\'s exactly what we have here.Value:This show is about a useless bystander of a male lead who barks orders at various girls flying in circles who eventually develop some feelings for the guy barking orders at them but nothing ever develops- there is no romance. In addition, there\'s some amusing tournaments where it apparently makes sense that the best way to intercept a flying object is to stand still- there is no logic.So there you have it, a VN-converted show with no romance and illogical battles. If you\'re looking for a show with good character development or intense action, steer clear. This is really only a filler show to pick up when you\'ve really run out of things to pick up. That said, it isn\'t the worst of fillers that I\'ve seen. Are you ready to run in circles figuring out what this show is really about? that bastardizes moves from air combat, then feel free to dig in.Animation:The show is well drawn overall with a rather bright mood and lots of serene, blue skies and oceans. Backgrounds in general are mixed as occasionally you get really detailed drawings (mostly clouds) and other times you get generic, blurred scenery. There is definitely a lot of CGI in this show, some of which is pretty distracting. The show has some nice, colorful UI displays during tournaments and some other gadgetry that looks like it\'s lifted right out of a game. The character styling is average overall; you won\'t get characters confused with each other but there isn\'t anything particularly special about them either. Asuka\'s drawing style feels a bit odd as her eyes seem to give off an air of confidence and sharpness that honestly is missing most of the time. I also don\'t get the uniforms worn during matches, not really sure why yukata-like sleeves are helpful in a speed contest.Expect a fair, though dispersed, amount of action, centered around the two main tournaments in the show. I was indeed surprised that they made it through two tournaments considering how most shows of late fail to conclude even a single one per season. The action consists of two contestants flying and attempting to accomplish goals, either hitting pylons or hitting the other contestant\'s back, which apparently causes a giant magic-sign-like symbol to appear. Given that most of the action is really just following colorful contrails in the sky, this isn\'t going to be satisfying for those needing real, gritty action. The same can be said in the ecchi department. Though there are completely unnecessary scenes, such as our protagonist seeing his neighbor pretty much naked multiple times, it isn\'t nearly as over the top as some of the other ecchi heavy hitters. That said, there is plenty of bouncy and bodysuits in the show if that\'s your fancy.Sound:The show opens with a very light rock OP that reminds me a bit of the voicing in Mami Kawada\'s work in Shakugan no Shana, the melody here isn\'t nearly as strong though. The ED is likewise very light (almost like they purposely filtered out all the base); I like the instrumentation and atmospheric pads, but the melody just isn\'t convincing. The same could be said about the BGM, it has some good fundamentals and some nice string tracks but ultimately lacks any memorable melodies; the stringed instruments make for a fairly relaxed mood overall.The show has a decent number of veterans but the actual casting feels odd. Misato Fukuen (Yami from ToLoveRu) is an interesting choice for a clumsy, light-hearted heroine and Azumi Asakura (Asia from DxD and Kumin from Chuunibyou) is an odd choice for an own-pace tsundere. Really, my choice for strongest performance goes to Risa Taneda, who voices a strong supporting character.Story:The show follows yet another high school club, this time the Flying Circus club where you train to fly in circles in what is essentially something like a baseball diamond. Our protagonist, Hinata, is coerced into joining the dying Kurahama club along with the heroines of the show. What follows is a lot of preparation and, surprisingly, multiple tournaments. It\'s all told in a rather simple, contiguous storyline with just a few teasing flashbacks.Though I appreciated the effort in drawing out this unlikely setting and liked the intensity during the tournaments, the rest of the show felt rather lackluster. Though episodes flow well together, many of them focus on a specific heroine and their personal struggle; often the protagonist isn\'t even part of the resolution. As alluded to before, the show builds to two main peaks in the form of the tournaments. Each is resolved to a fair degree (the latter in the final end credits) though I still don\'t get the point of the whole show. There were a lot of what seem to be foreshadows that don\'t amount to anything; either Gonzo planned a sequel or are using them to satisfy those who consumed the original source material- in either case these events are just wasted screen time for the rest of us for now.Character:There are a fair number of characters in this show, including about half of dozen rather important females. The character interactions were pretty good overall, but one wonders why they even put the protagonist here. It becomes obviously pretty early in the show that he\'s no ordinary Joe, but he really never gets much of a chance to shine nor does he really try for the majority of the show. Other than seeing his neighbor undress a few times, there\'s nothing guyish about our lead.The heroines fare better than our protagonist but likewise aren\'t particularly memorable. There\'s just too many of them and none of them really ever develops any real bonds with the protagonist, the strongest bond is arguably between two of the girls. Reiko Satouin gets my vote for most interesting character, which says a lot considering that she\'s not even a main character.

Are you ready to run in circles figuring out what this show is really about?', 'Have you ever wanted to be able to fly, not by planes, but by a certain kind of shoes? With those kind of conditions, have you ever wondered what it would be like if there was a sport that you only play in the sky? I\'m sure a sport like that would be quite enjoyable, especially in this anime. The only reason for me watching it is the artwork, which I thought was very beautiful, but honestly, I didn\'t expect too much. Needless to say, the moment I planned to include Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm, or Aokana for short, among the anime I...watched for the winter 2016 season, I had gotten myself in for a pleasant surprise.Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm introduces to us the sport of Flying Circus, or FC for short. Grav-Shoes, which are used to fly for transportation, are also used in this sport. Touch either your opponent\'s back or one of the four buoys that float above the ocean, and you score a point. This anime focuses on Asuka Kurashina, a girl who is completely new to flying but quickly falls in love with FC. She, along with Misaki Tobisawa and Mashiro Arisaka, joins her school\'s FC Club and, coached by Masaya Hinata, competes in various FC matches.The story of Ao no Kanata was quite an interesting one, and I was fully invested in the FC matches that took place within this anime. There are also a decent number of interesting characters that got a decent amount of development throughout the story, like Asuka and Misaki; those two are my favorite characters, to be honest. There is a problem I have involving the characters, though; there are a number of them I personally thought didn\'t appear as often as they could of. For example, Masaya was the protagonist of the visual novel, but in the anime, he doesn\'t appear so much; even when he does, he doesn\'t have much significance. Instead, the protagonist torch seems to have been passed on to Asuka, and as much as I love Asuka, I would have loved to see more of Masaya.The opening and ending themes, ""Contrail ~Kiseki~"" by Mami Kawada and ""a-gain"" by Ray, were actually pretty good songs, and I\'m surprised by how much they fit the anime. The voice acting was pretty good, too; Misato Fukuen as Asuka was just so freaking adorable! However, we can\'t forget about the best part about this anime, which is, hands down, the animation. The animation is colorful and bright, and it\'s cool this way. The animation especially stands out in the FC matches; it had a great use of 3D animation during those matches.Overall, Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm was a good anime. I\'d recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great sports anime for a sport that isn\'t even real. Who knows, though? Maybe several years for now, we may have the technology to make Grav-Shoes into real shoes and Flying Circus into a real sport!

If you dislike an anime that basically tricks you with the summary and leaves you with an unfilling bad feeling after having watched it dont watch this.So if i found this anime that bad why did i watch it fully because of the consept to be honest and that the music fitted with it also because something that the anime summary tricks you into believing in never happens which i wont say since it would be the ultimate spoiler to the anime.What i didnt like...was the boring development between characters with a feeling like nothing will happen there eventhough you hope that something will happen. This anime has the feeling of some other anime there they just rush through the entire show saying this is that person and here you go not much more. As i have stated many times already i feel like this anime was made to leave you hanging on all threads if the reason for this anime to be this plain and uninspiring was because it originally had a good story in the manga or novel then its ok but if this is basically because someone found this story good i cant see it.Overall the consept is the  only thing that did it for me and some music other than that there is really nothing speciall about this anime and your better watching a harem anime like infinite Stratos there something happens in a more good pace eventhough i know even that has some rushed pointers in it.  Dont watch this if you have another anime on hold i advice you to watch that and pray you never have to feel the same dissapointment and unfulfilling thoughts that i had.

Rarely do i say it but i wish i had dropped this', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)When I was a kid, say five years old or so, I liked picking dandelions.Specifically, I picked them whenever I played soccer on my uncles’ team. They were kind enough to help guide us youngsters to victory – at least, those who had such goals. For I, playing goalie and having zero interest in what was happening around me, happily took to weeding the ground. The ball rolled and the players ran, but I concerned myself only with the dirt and the dandelions before me.I was bored; I wasn’t having fun. That element is key...to any sport, any activity: fun. Because if you are not having fun, then what is the point?Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm answers this question, with goals on the ground and dreams in the sky, as a surprising yet slightly subpar anime.STORYFour Rhythm stars Asuka, a girl who has recently moved to the Four Islands Archipelago where people use a new piece of technology: Grav-Shoes. Granting flight, these shoes spawned Flying Circus, a competitive sport that tests one’s endurance, speed, and abilities. After meeting Masaya “Coach” Hinata, Misaki Tobisawa, and Mashiro Arisaka, Asuka enters this new and exciting world that has always been right above her.Flying Circus, or “FC” for short (and from here-on-out), is the cornerstone of the anime. The show takes its time in explaining the various rules: how points are scored, what fighting entails, and so on. It details the different styles, like being a fighter or an all-rounder. It introduces a myriad of moves. Sonic Boost, Pentagram Force, Air-Kick Turn…As such, the anime does a reasonable job of creating, from the ground up (if wordplay is permitted), a brand new, never-before-seen sport.Unfortunately, FC is prone to the biggest problem that the anime has: lack of interest. The cast fly around and create intricate patterns and bring the battle to each other. But most of the time, the drama the sport tries to generate does not stick. One major reason is misplaced satisfaction. Just touching a buoy or swatting at an opponent does not have that feeling of accomplishment because it seems too easy most of the time. Another reason is the lack of urgency. Many times, the duelists ignore certain routes, slowing down the action in an otherwise fast-paced game. And the stakes at hand are just not high enough. Four Rhythm does not give a lot of context in terms of potential accomplishments, tournaments, and end goals. I.e., their efforts do not amount to much. Not that everything feels pointless, but it certainly comes off as not as important as the anime tries to make FC out to be.Altogether, it makes the drama and the sport much less interesting. An unfortunate outcome.Only with FC itself, however. For the narrative holds some power in terms of its themes. More specifically, the show explores a concept that most sports players encounter: fun versus fear.Many people start off playing a particular sport because it is simply fun. Kicking a ball, diving for a catch, or flying in the air with Grav-Shoes unlock a sense of wonder from the get-go.Eventually, some want to take their game, per se, to the next level. They want to compete against other skilled players. But what they find is that some people are far beyond their own capabilities. Try as they may, their skills never match up to that person who is just slightly better. In other words, they cannot win any more.This description starts to get at Four Rhythm’s stance on this theme. Asuka plays FC to have fun and nothing more. Coach and Misaki have fun, believing that they were better than their true skill set. Mashiro derives fun not so much from the game but from hanging out with the group.For these and many of the characters, though, fear takes over. Fear of the unknown direction the game was going. Fear of the opponent they were facing. And fear of themselves, their own thoughts.As the anime depicts, it’s hard to face fear since it takes on these different forms. People sometimes cannot accept change. It’s even harder to admit that there are other people out there that can be stronger. To put it differently, fear makes them think that “losing” becomes the only option.And so fear takes over. Asuka becomes afraid of herself. Misaki fears Asuka. And Mashiro fears being left behind. Fear turns the sport not into a likable experience but rather into a dramatic incident.Yet fear and fun go hand-in-hand. Shindou puts it best: “Because the fear of losing something shows that you enjoy it.” Fear can remove fun, but it can also lead to fun, too. Asuka remembers why she flew to begin with. Misaki realizes that there is more to life than comparing herself to others. And Mashiro strengthens her person. Indeed, Saki’s entire character – how she uses fear to dominate others in FC – highlights what fear and fun can do to others and for one’s self.Taken together, Four Rhythm creates its take-away message: Winning and losing are not the be-all, end-all goals; having fun takes the crown.Looking at the rest of the anime, it has other highs and lows. The comedy, while not extreme, fits in comfortably among the drama. But the tale itself ends rather abruptly.Regardless, what matters most to the anime is FC and its theme on fear versus fun. The execution on both fronts varies, but the whole narrative is still a passable one.ANIMATIONFour Rhythm’s biggest issues lay in its art and animation.First, some positives. The CG work – usually used for small sequences during the battles – does not distract the eye. Also, the later light-shows that the competitors essentially put on are shiny. The anime’s constant use of silly reaction faces also not only improves the comedy but also helps to curtail some of the errors seen in the art itself.Because there are quite a few. Some characters are drawn with incorrect eyes – wrong pupil colors or placed on their faces off-kilter. Specific scenes are reused constantly, like a shot of the announcer or a duelist coming in from the right side of the screen in preparation to cutoff his or her opponent.And while the anime can have beautiful shots of the landscape, it more often than not has the view filled to the brim with blue water and cloudy skies. Granted, it has to be this way since FC takes place over the ocean, but it still does not lead to much detail or creativity.Animation also suffers. Characters can sometimes move around with stiffness, and, worse, missing frames make their actions appear choppy. To be fair once again, the anime reduces the animation to give much of it to the FC battles themselves. But the actual animation nevertheless remains relatively low since, even during battles, the quality can dip from time to time.Even the character designs are not all that impressive, but they are at least stronger than the rest of the art. Asuka’s flowing pink hair with special hairclip and Misaki’s bows are the most notable aspects. And while their regular school outfits are bland, their FC attire at least add color and variety. More importantly, they bring about symbolism. Shindou’s purple symbolizes his respectful nature, Saki’s lime green symbolizes her revitalizing path, and so on.CHARACTERSThe cast of Four Rhythm are an interesting bunch.From the start, it appears as though the anime will follow the harem route. After all, multiple girls with different personalities and types surround Coach, the single male protagonist.But that doesn’t happen.Instead, the anime focuses on everyone but him. For a long while, Asuka, Misaki, and Mashiro (as well as many more) earn the majority of the attention. So much so, in fact, that he ends up being not a prominent protagonist but merely a simple side character.But more on Coach later. The true star is Asuka. As the new person in town, she is quite unfamiliar with Grav-Shoes. Her flying evidence enough. She can barely keep herself aloft let alone fly in a straight line.Yet she does not let this obstacle bring her (figuratively and literally) down. Indeed, her extremely positive nature is almost uncanny. She loves to make light of the situation. She is overly cordial even during duels. She smiles when she makes a mistake. She exudes positivity to the point that others cannot help but feel happiness themselves.Her stumbling flights last until she performs an Air-Kick Turn, an impossible move for a beginner and especially Asuka. It highlights her inherent strength at the sport, and what strength she shows. Over the course of the season, she moves from the worst of them all to the best in ages – a defined and satisfying arc.Despite her personality, though, it is not all rainbows. As she continually improves and continually finds FC so amazing, she encounters Saki. A fearsome opponent taking the sport by storm with her commanding and intimidating playstyle, she defeats Asuka in resounding fashion. To the point that Asuka questions whether or not she really haschanged from the weak girl that she had always viewed herself as being.Misaki experienced a similar conflict. Definitely not an early bird and a consumer of udon, Misaki is in a normal position at the start of the season. Besides these traits, she is known for her “zip-zap” (as she coins it) FC playstyle and for her doting kouhai Mashiro. She joins the team early on, and, for a time, she is the best.Perhaps obviously, Misaki’s top status does not remain for long. At the first major tournament, she witnesses a lot. Much to her disbelief, she sees Shindou going all-out against Asuka when he did not do the same for her during their match. But when she hears Asuka actually liking the dirty match between Shindou and Saki during the finals, something breaks within her.In essence, Misaki becomes envious of Asuka’s skill, of her happiness. She retreats into herself, avoiding her friends and even FC. Later conversations with Shindou and Coach let her realize her trouble, one that goes along with one of the anime’s main messages: She is afraid.Asuka and Misaki find themselves simultaneously dealing with personal issues, so it is only fitting that they get out of their respective slumps by supporting (and dueling) one another. Both find courage for themselves through each other, leading them down their own paths.That’s another of Four Rhythm’s main messages: following one’s own path. Asuka channels Zephyrion, believing in the power of optimism and fun. Her playstyle reflects her mindset. Misaki tackles her fears much like her zip-zapping tackles her opponents.The same can be seen in nearly every character. Mashiro – technically a side character – gets an entire episode all to herself about feeling left behind around Asuka and Mashiro. Hence, she relentlessly trains, learning more about herself than she ever realized. She adopts a speeder-fighter combo playstyle to fit not only her smaller frame but also to symbolize her adaptable nature.Shindou is usually a calm, respectful leader. But on the FC battlefield, his true self – unsheathed anger – surfaces during particularly difficult bouts. His contrasting characterization accentuates his care and passion to the game.Saki, the ruthless speed-demon, explores the theme the best, however. Because she doesn’t follow her own path. Instead, she obediently follows the commands of Irina, her Second. Saki and Irina tried to replicate Aoi’s (the teacher that advises them) own playstyle to achieve a “perfect” way of competing. But, thanks to the combined efforts of Asuka, Misaki, and everyone else, Saki manages to break away from her self-made birdcage (to use their own ultimate move against them).On top of the characters’ individual growth and thematic presence, the anime layers many parallels between the characters. Asuka and Misaki’s have already been discussed, but there are many more. Misaki admires Shindou for his strength. Rika was Mashiro’s trainer, leading to a close friendship between the two. Aoi happened to be Coach’s coach.The most interesting is that of Asuka and Coach as well as Misaki and Coach. Both remember a “female version of Coach” that they played with and against. In other words, Coach was the first person to give the two girls their wings. Surprisingly, Misaki makes a remark about “who cares” in an almost fourth-wall jab about how Four Rhythm will not be exploring Coach’s character to any degree. Cheeky yet accepted, hearkening back to him never being the focal point to begin with.Nevertheless, Coach is one of the anime’s only missteps with its cast. The show makes a big deal out of his refusal to play FC. As though the major reveal and his (inevitable) resurgence will be groundbreaking (or maybe, given the context, sky-breaking). But his backstory is hastily shown and his not-too-impactful return lacks proper build-up due that aforementioned side-character status he earned from the start.Saki is one of the other missteps. While she does change as a person and does help to explore one of the anime’s themes, her original character has a weak foundation. This weakness is due in part to how late into the season she is introduced. But mostly it’s due to yet more hastily strewn together backstory. In other words, her connection to Irina and the struggles she has been through feel hollow when compared to everyone else.Altogether, while some snags are had, the cast of Four Rhythm are a strong bunch that prove said strength – be it at home or in flight.SOUNDThe opening track for Four Rhythm focuses on a free-spirited feeling to match the free-flying spirits within. The vocal work is okay, but the gentleness of the piece does not help the loftier segments. At the minimum, the initial slow-into-fast singing makes the piece somewhat more fun to listen to, though not by much.The ending track is a definite step up. Various pacing to the lyrics. Up-and-down instrumental work. Multiple singers in harmony. The ED, while not all that memorable, comes together as a mostly happy yet strangely cathartic piece that fits Four Rhythm well.As for the rest of the soundtrack, it tends to lag behind the ED along with the OP. Some acoustic guitar riffs here, a lighthearted clapping tune there. Standard fare. At the minimum, the different sound-effects for FC carry some weight. When the characters shoot past or attempt a tricky maneuver, the anime makes sure to use some cool sounds to give the sport more oomph.Voice acting is clearly better than the OP, ED, and OST. Misato Fukuen as Asuka gives the girl a sweet and happy voice that could brighten anyone’s day. Azumi Asakura as Misaki blends catlike inflections into her words quite smoothly. And Nozomi Yamamoto as Mashiro adds extra energy into the mix with her different upbeat, angry, and overzealous ways of speaking.ENJOYMENTBack when I first started this one – now about eight months later – I called it an “underdog” in the sense that it had untapped potential. I was somewhat correct.I was pleasantly surprised at how layered the cast members were. The show put a lot of effort into making many different connections between the entire cast, connections that I was not aware were going to be made. It was cool to see it slowly grow not exactly into a complex network but no doubt into a thorough one.I also found myself laughing at bits of the comedy. Asuka’s positive nature, Mashiro’s yuri feelings towards Misaki, and even Aoyagi, Madoka’s brother, had me smiling as he advocated spirit in all parts of life (especially FC).But there were still quite a few people that I did not much care for. Irina, Coach, and Aoi (as well as Shindou and many others) definitely had more to their characters, but I was not too much of a fan of their personalities.Worse still, I found the vast majority of the FC matches boring. The only one that actually caught my interest was the final one between Asuka and Saki. Many different (and new) moves were used, the battle meant a lot to both sides, and the final light spectacle was pretty pretty. While the others before had minute moments of intrigue, they were largely forgettable. And given that FC was such a major part of the anime, the total amount of entertainment I got out of this one never really took off.Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is all over the place when it comes to execution. On the one hand, the music and especially the art have troubles. On the other hand, the story’s thematic focus and the parallels between the characters make each strong in their own right. Overall, the anime flies higher than a dandelion in the dirt, but that is not really saying all that much.SUMMARYStory: Fine, Flying Circus has trouble staying interesting, but a theme on fun versus fear permeates the anime nonethelessAnimation: Bad, lame and error-prone artistic direction, below average actual animation, okay character designsCharacters: Good, individual growth for Asuka and Misaki, a nice theme on finding one’s own path, and many parallels between the cast members, brought down only by a mishandling of Coach’s and Saki’s charactersSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, bad OST, nice sound-effects, above-average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, pleasantly surprising and some funny bits, but boring characters and matches bring down the experienceFinal Score: 4/10 to any sport, any activity: fun.

Mashiro derives fun not so much from the game but from hanging out with the group.For these and many of the characters, though, fear takes over. Fear of the unknown direction the game was going. Fear of the opponent they were facing. And fear of themselves, their own thoughts.As the anime depicts, it’s hard to face fear since it takes on these different forms. People sometimes cannot accept change. It’s even harder to admit that there are other people out there that can be stronger. To put it differently, fear makes them think that “losing” becomes the only option.And so fear takes over. Asuka becomes afraid of herself. Misaki fears Asuka. And Mashiro fears being left behind. Fear turns the sport not into a likable experience but rather into a dramatic incident.Yet fear and fun go hand-in-hand. Shindou puts it best: “Because the fear of losing something shows that you enjoy it.” Fear can remove fun, but it can also lead to fun, too. Asuka remembers why she flew to begin with. Misaki realizes that there is more to life than comparing herself to others. And Mashiro strengthens her person. Indeed, Saki’s entire character – how she uses fear to dominate others in FC – highlights what fear and fun can do to others and for one’s self.Taken together, Four Rhythm creates its take-away message: Winning and losing are not the be-all, end-all goals; having fun takes the crown.Looking at the rest of the anime, it has other highs and lows. The comedy, while not extreme, fits in comfortably among the drama. But the tale itself ends rather abruptly.Regardless, what matters most to the anime is FC and its theme on fear versus fun. The execution on both fronts varies, but the whole narrative is still a passable one.ANIMATIONFour Rhythm’s biggest issues lay in its art and animation.First, some positives. The CG work – usually used for small sequences during the battles – does not distract the eye. Also, the later light-shows that the competitors essentially put on are shiny. The anime’s constant use of silly reaction faces also not only improves the comedy but also helps to curtail some of the errors seen in the art itself.Because there are quite a few. Some characters are drawn with incorrect eyes – wrong pupil colors or placed on their faces off-kilter. Specific scenes are reused constantly, like a shot of the announcer or a duelist coming in from the right side of the screen in preparation to cutoff his or her opponent.And while the anime can have beautiful shots of the landscape, it more often than not has the view filled to the brim with blue water and cloudy skies. Granted, it has to be this way since FC takes place over the ocean, but it still does not lead to much detail or creativity.Animation also suffers. Characters can sometimes move around with stiffness, and, worse, missing frames make their actions appear choppy. To be fair once again, the anime reduces the animation to give much of it to the FC battles themselves. But the actual animation nevertheless remains relatively low since, even during battles, the quality can dip from time to time.Even the character designs are not all that impressive, but they are at least stronger than the rest of the art. Asuka’s flowing pink hair with special hairclip and Misaki’s bows are the most notable aspects. And while their regular school outfits are bland, their FC attire at least add color and variety. More importantly, they bring about symbolism. Shindou’s purple symbolizes his respectful nature, Saki’s lime green symbolizes her revitalizing path, and so on.CHARACTERSThe cast of Four Rhythm are an interesting bunch.From the start, it appears as though the anime will follow the harem route. After all, multiple girls with different personalities and types surround Coach, the single male protagonist.But that doesn’t happen.Instead, the anime focuses on everyone but him. For a long while, Asuka, Misaki, and Mashiro (as well as many more) earn the majority of the attention. So much so, in fact, that he ends up being not a prominent protagonist but merely a simple side character.But more on Coach later. The true star is Asuka. As the new person in town, she is quite unfamiliar with Grav-Shoes. Her flying evidence enough. She can barely keep herself aloft let alone fly in a straight line.Yet she does not let this obstacle bring her (figuratively and literally) down. Indeed, her extremely positive nature is almost uncanny. She loves to make light of the situation. She is overly cordial even during duels. She smiles when she makes a mistake. She exudes positivity to the point that others cannot help but feel happiness themselves.Her stumbling flights last until she performs an Air-Kick Turn, an impossible move for a beginner and especially Asuka. It highlights her inherent strength at the sport, and what strength she shows. Over the course of the season, she moves from the worst of them all to the best in ages – a defined and satisfying arc.Despite her personality, though, it is not all rainbows. As she continually improves and continually finds FC so amazing, she encounters Saki. A fearsome opponent taking the sport by storm with her commanding and intimidating playstyle, she defeats Asuka in resounding fashion. To the point that Asuka questions whether or not she really haschanged from the weak girl that she had always viewed herself as being.Misaki experienced a similar conflict. Definitely not an early bird and a consumer of udon, Misaki is in a normal position at the start of the season. Besides these traits, she is known for her “zip-zap” (as she coins it) FC playstyle and for her doting kouhai Mashiro. She joins the team early on, and, for a time, she is the best.Perhaps obviously, Misaki’s top status does not remain for long. At the first major tournament, she witnesses a lot. Much to her disbelief, she sees Shindou going all-out against Asuka when he did not do the same for her during their match. But when she hears Asuka actually liking the dirty match between Shindou and Saki during the finals, something breaks within her.In essence, Misaki becomes envious of Asuka’s skill, of her happiness. She retreats into herself, avoiding her friends and even FC. Later conversations with Shindou and Coach let her realize her trouble, one that goes along with one of the anime’s main messages: She is afraid.Asuka and Misaki find themselves simultaneously dealing with personal issues, so it is only fitting that they get out of their respective slumps by supporting (and dueling) one another. Both find courage for themselves through each other, leading them down their own paths.That’s another of Four Rhythm’s main messages: following one’s own path. Asuka channels Zephyrion, believing in the power of optimism and fun. Her playstyle reflects her mindset. Misaki tackles her fears much like her zip-zapping tackles her opponents.The same can be seen in nearly every character. Mashiro – technically a side character – gets an entire episode all to herself about feeling left behind around Asuka and Mashiro. Hence, she relentlessly trains, learning more about herself than she ever realized. She adopts a speeder-fighter combo playstyle to fit not only her smaller frame but also to symbolize her adaptable nature.Shindou is usually a calm, respectful leader. But on the FC battlefield, his true self – unsheathed anger – surfaces during particularly difficult bouts. His contrasting characterization accentuates his care and passion to the game.Saki, the ruthless speed-demon, explores the theme the best, however. Because she doesn’t follow her own path. Instead, she obediently follows the commands of Irina, her Second. Saki and Irina tried to replicate Aoi’s (the teacher that advises them) own playstyle to achieve a “perfect” way of competing. But, thanks to the combined efforts of Asuka, Misaki, and everyone else, Saki manages to break away from her self-made birdcage (to use their own ultimate move against them).On top of the characters’ individual growth and thematic presence, the anime layers many parallels between the characters. Asuka and Misaki’s have already been discussed, but there are many more. Misaki admires Shindou for his strength. Rika was Mashiro’s trainer, leading to a close friendship between the two. Aoi happened to be Coach’s coach.The most interesting is that of Asuka and Coach as well as Misaki and Coach. Both remember a “female version of Coach” that they played with and against. In other words, Coach was the first person to give the two girls their wings. Surprisingly, Misaki makes a remark about “who cares” in an almost fourth-wall jab about how Four Rhythm will not be exploring Coach’s character to any degree. Cheeky yet accepted, hearkening back to him never being the focal point to begin with.Nevertheless, Coach is one of the anime’s only missteps with its cast. The show makes a big deal out of his refusal to play FC. As though the major reveal and his (inevitable) resurgence will be groundbreaking (or maybe, given the context, sky-breaking). But his backstory is hastily shown and his not-too-impactful return lacks proper build-up due that aforementioned side-character status he earned from the start.Saki is one of the other missteps. While she does change as a person and does help to explore one of the anime’s themes, her original character has a weak foundation. This weakness is due in part to how late into the season she is introduced. But mostly it’s due to yet more hastily strewn together backstory. In other words, her connection to Irina and the struggles she has been through feel hollow when compared to everyone else.Altogether, while some snags are had, the cast of Four Rhythm are a strong bunch that prove said strength – be it at home or in flight.SOUNDThe opening track for Four Rhythm focuses on a free-spirited feeling to match the free-flying spirits within. The vocal work is okay, but the gentleness of the piece does not help the loftier segments. At the minimum, the initial slow-into-fast singing makes the piece somewhat more fun to listen to, though not by much.The ending track is a definite step up. Various pacing to the lyrics. Up-and-down instrumental work. Multiple singers in harmony. The ED, while not all that memorable, comes together as a mostly happy yet strangely cathartic piece that fits Four Rhythm well.As for the rest of the soundtrack, it tends to lag behind the ED along with the OP. Some acoustic guitar riffs here, a lighthearted clapping tune there. Standard fare. At the minimum, the different sound-effects for FC carry some weight. When the characters shoot past or attempt a tricky maneuver, the anime makes sure to use some cool sounds to give the sport more oomph.Voice acting is clearly better than the OP, ED, and OST. Misato Fukuen as Asuka gives the girl a sweet and happy voice that could brighten anyone’s day. Azumi Asakura as Misaki blends catlike inflections into her words quite smoothly. And Nozomi Yamamoto as Mashiro adds extra energy into the mix with her different upbeat, angry, and overzealous ways of speaking.ENJOYMENTBack when I first started this one – now about eight months later – I called it an “underdog” in the sense that it had untapped potential. I was somewhat correct.I was pleasantly surprised at how layered the cast members were. The show put a lot of effort into making many different connections between the entire cast, connections that I was not aware were going to be made. It was cool to see it slowly grow not exactly into a complex network but no doubt into a thorough one.I also found myself laughing at bits of the comedy. Asuka’s positive nature, Mashiro’s yuri feelings towards Misaki, and even Aoyagi, Madoka’s brother, had me smiling as he advocated spirit in all parts of life (especially FC).But there were still quite a few people that I did not much care for. Irina, Coach, and Aoi (as well as Shindou and many others) definitely had more to their characters, but I was not too much of a fan of their personalities.Worse still, I found the vast majority of the FC matches boring. The only one that actually caught my interest was the final one between Asuka and Saki. Many different (and new) moves were used, the battle meant a lot to both sides, and the final light spectacle was pretty pretty. While the others before had minute moments of intrigue, they were largely forgettable. And given that FC was such a major part of the anime, the total amount of entertainment I got out of this one never really took off.Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is all over the place when it comes to execution. On the one hand, the music and especially the art have troubles. On the other hand, the story’s thematic focus and the parallels between the characters make each strong in their own right. Overall, the anime flies higher than a dandelion in the dirt, but that is not really saying all that much.SUMMARYStory: Fine, Flying Circus has trouble staying interesting, but a theme on fun versus fear permeates the anime nonethelessAnimation: Bad, lame and error-prone artistic direction, below average actual animation, okay character designsCharacters: Good, individual growth for Asuka and Misaki, a nice theme on finding one’s own path, and many parallels between the cast members, brought down only by a mishandling of Coach’s and Saki’s charactersSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, bad OST, nice sound-effects, above-average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, pleasantly surprising and some funny bits, but boring characters and matches bring down the experienceFinal Score: 4/10', 'I find it very, very interesting that most reviews for this anime fall between the ratings of 8 and 10.

The music in this anime is really bland. It doesn\'t excite me, even though this is a sports anime. It feels like it\'s just there so you don\'t simply listen to people talk. Props for having decent sfx though.Character - 1Kurashina Asuka: A kuudere. If you don\'t know what that means, it means airhead. Well yeah she does think about flying most of the time. Anyways, she learns how to fly! WOW. SO AMAZING. An airhead as a protagonist probably wasn\'t that much of a great idea.Hinata Masaya: Okay, here\'s like 40% of the reason why I *hate* this anime. Masaya was a professional player. He had a pretty interesting background that could actually bring about character development. Instead, the creators decide to dump all of this in the trashcan. What a great side character,I mean protagonist that doesn\'t do **** during the entire 12 episodes right?Other ""main"" characters: wat. i tot they wer syde karakters too.Enjoyment - 1ugh... waste of timeOverall - 2Art doesn\'t contribute to how good an anime is imo. If it\'s not killing my eyes, then it\'s fine. That being said, I should be rating this anime a 1 and not a 2, but then again the girls are hella cute and they mesmerized me. Gotta give this anime a 2 for le girls :<[ This last section is pretty long. Read it if you want to know why I despise this anime. ]Where should I start? I guess I\'ll start by looking through the tagged genres for this anime. Can someone explain to me where the drama is. I mean, if you\'re talking about melodrama then yeah... There is no drama in this anime. All there is is a bunch of kids making a huge deal out of nothing. Take Misaki for example. Asuka suddenly becomes good at flying, and Misaki starts to feel inferior. Instead of trying to get better, she cries like a little kid and quits the club. bruh....A sports anime where the sport probably took 14 seconds to come up with... There was so much potential in anti-gravity boots, and what we get is a sport where people fly to corners of a square and d-dd--do-dog fighting. I\'m gonna file a lawsuit for animal abuse. Realistically, the faster person will always win. It doesn\'t matter if the other player takes a shortcut. You can just fly right past them. If they chase, it\'s not that hard to turn your body around to protect your back given how easy it was for the characters to do ""something kick turns"". Dog fights will never happen.I want to talk about the characters a bit more. Some may argue that there was character development because a few characters become a bit more mature. Some may say that because there is, ever so slightly, character development, the characters are not one-dimensional and boring. I disagree. For one, the characters never really changed that much to make any impact on how they are as people. Their sole existence is to be with Asuka while she learns how to fly. The only character with the potential to be interesting is Masaya, but again he was discarded like garbage.

So much for a main character....', 'I have not played the visual novel on which this is based, so that will be a complete non factor for this review. This is solely about the anime.Overall, Aokana is mediocre. It definitely has flaws and it doesn\'t excel at anything, but there are some things to enjoy here too. Far and away the strongest aspect of the show is its invention of and significant focus on an entirely new sport, flying circus, which looks like it would be a blast to play and is fairly creative and well thought out as a whole. They spend a ton of time on it and they...go over tactics and strategies and they do a good job keeping the viewer in the loop as to why things are occurring. The rules, for the most part, are clear, but there are definitely a few aspects of flying circus that require a viewer to suspend their disbelief. They never went down this road because it\'s simply not that kind of anime, but in a real life setting flying circus would be incredibly dangerous and would have a lot of potential for serious injury, and that\'s to say nothing of the many ways to skirt some of the less than defined rules and limitations or to outright cheat.As an example, since the game is more or less a mid air, high speed game of tag with shoes that essentially function as a jet pack, there is a physical component to it. You have to tag the other person\'s back in order to score a point, and you\'re doing so at very, very high speeds. What is there to prevent a player from (accidentally or intentionally) ""tagging"" another player in the face as opposed to the back? What happens if your jet-pack shoes fail, fall off or your opponent knocks them off? What happens if you\'re moving so quickly and you crash into your opponent or one of the mid-air buoys featured in the game that you break your hand or wrist? What if you full on crash head first into one of the buoys going 100 miles per hour? Other than vaguely mentioning that the shoes have some built in safety measures, the anime simply isn\'t willing to go down this rabbit hole and the game is represented as extremely safe and recreational, which feels less than realistic.While the main character is intended to be free-spirited, very positive and a total ""glass half full"" kind of person, English language voice actress Jill Harris goes way too far with this and more often than not sounds not only fake but simply extremely hyper. Also one of my biggest personal pet peeves- having a person use a fake accent to play a character from a country or region they\'re clearly not from- is featured in this anime with Alexis Tipton, who is from Texas, attempting to sell us that she\'s from the UK. Anyone over the age of 12 or just anyone who has ever actually been to the UK should be able to tell you immediately that she\'s not. Is it out of budget to hire an actual British person for this role or must Funimation continue to give every single role to the five men and five women they hire for anything and everything?Other tropes are ultra present as well, such as the female friend who wants to be more than friends with her also female best friend, the teacher/mentor character who happens to have been one of the best in the world at the game/sport you\'re interested in and of course the ultra convenient amnesia/we used to know each other as children but we both forgot!Being a 2016 anime the visuals are what you\'d expect- smooth, clean, colorful. Everything visually is up to present day standards and the colored streaks the flying circus players leave in the sky in their wake are pretty.The story as a whole is rather light and bare-bones, but it\'s certainly an easy, inoffensive watch even if sometimes it maybe isn\'t the most exciting thing in the world. More or less the whole anime is about a new girl getting into flying circus, making friends with her teammates and improving at the game. There\'s nothing heavy or dark here and the anime shoves it down your throat at the end that you should not take games, or life, too seriously and you should just have fun. I don\'t know that I entirely agree with that message, but I can at least appreciate it. The ending as a whole feels rather rushed and several key matches in the final flying circus tournament are obnoxiously played off screen, but at this point, beyond playing out the tournament, the plot doesn\'t really have anywhere else to go.At the end of the day, if you\'re in the mood for a light sports anime Aokana, with its very quick 12 episode run time and overall inoffensive nature, should suffice. Beyond that there\'s nothing overly memorable here and this is certainly not among the top anime of its release year, nevermind the decade or anything crazy like that. Give it a watch if you\'re specifically craving its niche or pass on it if you\'re not. It\'s not good enough to force yourself to watch it if you\'re not specifically in the mood for it.OBJECTIVE RATING- 6-6.75PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6.25-6.5 go over tactics and strategies and they do a good job keeping the viewer in the loop as to why things are occurring.

It follows the main protagonist as she discovers how amazing and fun the sport, Flying Circus, was. Flying Circus is a sport about flying fast and hitting the back of the enemy to point. Its very intriguing and definitely interesting. The sport itself attracted me, that’s why I got into this series. The story follows like any other typical slice-of-life sports anime. Still, it was enjoyable. I do admit, there were some pacing issues on some episodes in the middle part of the series. There were some episodes...that I felt were unnecessary or were too slow. The rest then were okay.Other than the sport, the characters also made me like the series. All of the characters were really likeable. I didn’t find anyone annoying, though I’m a bit hassled by the male lead. Other than that, I like them all. The main protagonist, Asuka, looks and act like any other ‘baka’ protagonist, but damn she is so badass during the games. I really like her determination to win and also her love for the sport. I also like Misaki for being an awesome player and a really good friend to Asuka.I really like the character designs, specifically the uniform of the characters when they play Flying Circus. As you can see in the cover photo, they look like birds and the shoes looks so cool. It makes me want to own one. With the animation, well, there is 3D. Yeah, I admit, some scenes were were not really good, especially during the fights, but they were bearable compared to the new Berserk. So its not that bad.Overall, this anime is quite lighthearted and fun to watch. This anime might not be the best underrated anime out there, its still enjoyable to watch. I recommend you guys to binge-watch this one. I think one of the reasons people overlooked this one was because its kinda forgettable, especially when she went against Assassination Classroom S2, Akagami Shirayukihime S2, and the famous Erased in the Winter season. Binge it, its worth it bruh.Anyway, thats it for now.Thanks for reading and I hope you check out this gem!! that I felt were unnecessary or were too slow.

Binge it, its worth it bruh.Anyway, thats it for now.Thanks for reading and I hope you check out this gem!!', '(Mostly a negative critique, quick summary at the bottom)Anti-gravity boots are at the center point theme, using special flying boots to get to school, Asuka our clumsy MC sees them for the first time (not really, as you find out she knew about them when she was little....) and wants to learn how to use them, later on she and her group of friends sees a girl at the beach challenging someone to a Flying Circus dual, learning about what the sport is, wants to challenge her, this leads to her scoring a point and sparking an interest for the sport.Considering I watched this anime...dubbed, ""That match was so exciting I almost peed my pants"" sums up the dialog of this show, the characters were basic factory made to be liked, same copy-cat backstory for you to gain sympathy to every single side character, the main girl was basically the only one you should focus on, the rest of them are just a feeling of ""wow they all knew each other as children and can\'t remember now, that\'s neat"". These characters face a ""harsh"" backstory with the sport that left them unmotivated and having to leave it at an early age despite every single one having incredible talent for it.... oh how tragic.Every match starts off with them going for the ""floating buoys"" and just ends up being a 1 on 1 battle of them tagging each other on the back, dodging and using special moves until one gains enough points to win, started off well having more strategy being put into everything, but ended up just being a brawl or ""dogfight"" between players the entire match, for me it just lost that ""sport"" aspect of it the longer the show went on.The story message comes down to creating your own way of playing the sport and making it fun, that competition isn\'t everything and finishes strong with a cheesy heartwarming ending that ""yeah, we are all just having fun at the end lol"".""Insert title here"" was cute, can\'t stop myself from admitting that I actually enjoyed them duelling each other, overall it\'s 3 genres thrown into a bowl, barfing sugar into the mix and just stirring, about 15% Slice of life, 25% Sport and 60% Sci-Fi schoolgirl, the sport aspect is at the backend, where cute UwU magical girl sits front and center, it\'s nothing special, cool shoes, but rather watch something else.If you enjoy magical girls, this is a lighthearted Sci-Fi that should come off as fun and enjoyable, if not, then it\'s not worth watching. dubbed, ""That match was so exciting I almost peed my pants"" sums up the dialog of this show, the characters were basic factory made to be liked, same copy-cat backstory for you to gain sympathy to every single side character, the main girl was basically the only one you should focus on, the rest of them are just a feeling of ""wow they all knew each other as children and can\'t remember now, that\'s neat"".

It\'s your typical ""a group of kids join a once defunct sports club that gets resurgence thanks to these new members"". I do find the sport (as well as the wear used for it) to be a bit fascinating, though the lackluster story can still make it look dull. Plus, these are never explained enough (like how did they come to be, what was the purpose, etc.) At times, I wondered if...there was an actual story, or even if there was one (that was surprisingly absent) that was never used. Upon further research, the visual novel, which the anime was based on, was more of a dating sim (any signs of romantic elements were taken out).The characters are just was dull as the story. They\'re your cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional with nothing interesting about them. One of the characters had traits that did not match at all; while acting like the more adult character, occasionally she has this cat speech (ending sentences with ""Nya"" and whatnot). In the visual novel, you play as the one who (sort of) becomes the main male lead in the anime, and choose which os the girls to have a romantic relationship with. He showed no significance in this anime, and doesn\'t even have any type of romance, which could\'ve given the show some spice. There\'s implication that he has a past, but that\'s not even brushed on (just mentioned). The only thing I can say I liked was the voice of the main female lead (just the voice, nothing else) as I found to be quite cute.Just like with everything else with the show, there\'s not much to say about the animation. For the most part, it\'s average with occasional inconsistencies in detail.As I continued watching, it came to a point where I wasn\'t looking forward to next week. There really was nothing to this that completely captured my attention. I understand why the story from the original source was changed for the anime format, but even a bit of romance can give it at least something, especially for character development.

I am so disappointed to the show\'s story. Apparently, the protagonist is supposed to be a guy named Masaya, but instead of revolving the story around him and again instead of showing how he showed his romantic interest in any of the girls he\'s been with, the story...revolved around a girl named Asuka, which is totally messed up because the main-main character is supposed to be Masaya.Disappointing as it may be, the anime\'s art quality is perfect, scene execution is nice and character\'s personality is good. The story is just really a big disappointment for me, not just because it had no romance in it but it had a ""mainstream"" kind of feel. It was too simple and didn\'t have something I\'d call great. Again, greatly disappointed with the ""No Romance"" part.I hope they create a sequel, movie, or an ova to this anime and hope it contains what it\'s supposed to have because the potential of the anime\'s plot is actually pretty good but it\'s not being used to its fullest. Not just talking about its romance potential but also to its potential to be an overall, great anime. This might also be the best one if plot was utilized properly. revolved around a girl named Asuka, which is totally messed up because the main-main character is supposed to be Masaya.Disappointing as it may be, the anime\'s art quality is perfect, scene execution is nice and character\'s personality is good.

Well:This anime has good visuals, good sound, and the Flying Circus it's kind of interesting. The most interesting element for me was the shoes, I really would like to have a pair of those shoes, You no?.But out of that, this anime has nothing to offer:There's no story.The characters are generic and flat.And absolutely nothing happens.If you are looking for entertaiment,...then it can interest you.If you are looking for quality, it's definitely not for you. then it can interest you.If you are looking for quality, it's definitely not for you."", 'I have added this anime to my ""to-watch"" list a while ago, just never got to it because of time constraints and a long list of ""to-watch"" stuff lol...Anywho, this is a GREAT anime. I am not really into the sports genre, but I picked this up because I really liked the art style of it. It looks amazing! Other popular titles pale in comparison to this. The op of the series is really beautiful as well, song brings a tear to my eye almost every time I listen to it. The op really makes you connect w/ the characters.The story isn\'t know knows what....There\'s a point about half-way where I really thought it was gonna go downhill, but they resolved it pretty well. My only complaint is that the should have really made it a 13 episode (or at least bring out an OVA) sort of like how Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko ended, where after the big event, they had an OVA to settle things w/ all the characters. I really wish they did this for Aokana, because the ending episode is just too abrupt imo. Definitely recommend though.

I\'m actually a fan of Air Gear so the concept ""flying"" really got me hooked into this anime and I got loads of free time so I\'m like why not and decided to try it.:Story: 6An anime which...had friendships/sports and a little spice of drama and poof Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is created. Basically its about a girl named Asuka Kurashima who came back to the island where she went before as a child and somehow is a prodigy in this ""Flying Circus"" thing. There\'s also the ""kouhai"" character which is played by Arisaka Mashiro. Tobisawa Misaki played the senpai role between this two, shes a gluttonous girl who have fragile emotions and basically had many emotional breakdowns through out the serie. And there\'s the main ""guy"" character named Hinata Masaya who is actually a prodigy and also a japan candidate back then but hes a p*ssy so he ran away from everything and because he got caught up in the moment he became a ""second"" to all the players in the FC Club.It had it cliche moments aswell like the main character being prodigy and good at sport even though she tried it just recently, and many more. The ending was also predictable at many ways the cliche lines of the antagonists such as ""why does she look like shes having fun"" and so forth brought predictable ending to the serie.:Art:  8Its the modern generation and I must say that the art of this anime is top notch and its one of the reasons why I didnt drop this anime, I\'ve been wanting to drop it so much after so many disappointments here and there such as lack of explaination and sh*t pacing that was brought throughout the serie.:Sound: 7The osts were alright but it could be better, something like that was given off as I keep hearing the osts from openings and endings as I am the type of person to not skip the opening, as there are some people who actually skip openings from time to time. I as a fan of music myself refrains from skipping as I actually enjoy listening to op/ed\'s.:Character/Character Development: 5Characters were mostly all basic looking you have the normal girls with normal sized tits, theres that flat chested, loli, kouhai girl, the hot looking teacher, proud type girls with boobs ( Satouin) and the main char guy who I really is so dissappointed in is plain looking and nothing out of the normal presented except his exceptional skills in FC which took him 10 f*ckin episodes to release to them that he had those techniques. He\'s like ""o sh*t they need new moves and crap alright imma show off my techniques"" and the teacher aswell LMFAO she couldve helped by showing her techniques even at the first half of the serie but nah which is really a disappointment.I was really disappointed in the character development through out this serie as there are many flaws that couldve been fixed easily things such as it took 10 episodes for ""Hinata Masaya"" for him to stop being a p*ssy and actually teach FC manually LOL:Enjoyment: 5I hardly enjoyed watching this to be honest because I keep waiting for the part where the main guy will take control of the situation and actually have some balls and be proud of his exceptional skills and take pride in it but nah he chose to be a p*ssy until ep 10 which is really a disappointment.:Overall: 6Well it was out of the usual animes and it truly is a unique one even though I\'ve had many disappointments throughout this serie it was fairly good and if youre looking for a pure sports anime with a bunch of emotional breakdowns this is for you. had friendships/sports and a little spice of drama and poof Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is created.

Why? the main reason why i think this adaptation is bad is, Hinata Masaya was a supporting character instead of being the Main Character because they changed some part of the story like on the first few minutes of episode 1,instead...of Masaya helping Asuka go to school, they added Misaki, Misaki and Asuka was supposed to first meet after Aoi sensei asked Masaya to teach Asuka how to use a grav-shoe (the shoes used to fly) but no, Asuka met Misaki in the FIRST MINUTES OF EPISODE 1... And they also changed a lot of minor details like Madoka bringing the fc club to shirase-san's store, HINATA WAS THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THE FC CLUB TO SHIRASE SANS SHOP.. and also Madoka and Shion first met at the beach, while in the anime they already knew each other.. And there was a filler at episode 4 where Mashiro asked Rika to teach her how to maintain a great form but i liked that part cuz it gave more screentime for Rika, BUT what i hated after that episode is they made Masaya an idiot... Masaya knew right from the start that Mashiro should be a speeder rather than a Fighter, then he asked Mashiro to change her playstyle and Mashiro agreed, but in the Anime they made Masaya was surprised that Mashiro was a better speeder than a fighter which made him look like an idiot... WHY DID THEY REMAKE HINATA AS AN IDIOT?!?!?!?! MASAYA WAS A CHAMPION IN A NATIONAL TOURNAMENT AND HE WAS GOOD AT ANALYZING THINGS... AAAAAAAA this was a huge dissapointment.... of Masaya helping Asuka go to school, they added Misaki, Misaki and Asuka was supposed to first meet after Aoi sensei asked Masaya to teach Asuka how to use a grav-shoe (the shoes used to fly) but no, Asuka met Misaki in the FIRST MINUTES OF EPISODE 1...

Character development is fine, although I must say towards the end of the series, the ending is quite naive. In my opinion, I think the series could have improved more of the character developments of the side characters, as I think everything just isolates around a few characters. I love the music and environment of this anime, especially the themes of flying. I also love how it portrays to the audience of the character's sentiments towards their craft and passion which anyone can relate with in their own lives, and...I find the Flying Circus to be very inspirational.

And since it centers around the competition of the sports, I would expect the graphic to be at least intriguing to watch and yes, I could say it did-flow is more relaxingBecause the story is not too serious and tense, we wouldn't need to be too focused on the story since it flows quite relaxing, hence making it more enjoyable so plus point to this-funWell, okay I could say that aokana focuses more on fun, so... yeah-characters are clearThe character development is acceptable, it doesn't have too many characters that would make us really confused and it focuses more on the main characters, but it does lack a bit of the characters backstory.And the cons-the competitions are a bit boringDespite from being something fresh, the competition doesn't really have much variation, thus making it a bit boring for me. Of course this is to be expected as it not a common sport, but I thought it could have a bit more variationThe most intriguing one I found is only at episode 12 and yeah, the last episode-Story developmentaokana is weak at the phase of the story. Every phase of sports is crucial, by this I mean that from the introduction of the sports, the practice, the competition, until the win or loss, everything.The introduction of the sports didn't have any problems. What I felt missing is from the practice until the result of the competition. It didn't pack a punch-an imbalanced characterThis imo is one of the most weakest point in aokana and the biggest factor to why I rate lowAs everybody knows, Asuka is the character that has the most spotlight, in fact, aokana prioritize her too much. And to add it, Asuka is too OP, it felt like the most important thing is talent, not hardwork. She could easily do anything, I mean anything any other people could do.This kind of talent itself is not that bad of a plot, but for it to be over exploited leaves a bad outcome.To conclude, aokana does have many flaws, but is still enjoyable to watchIt is more of a leisure anime than a serious one and is better to watch if you are just intrigued and isn't really expecting muchI really wished it to give more spotlight to Masaya though, and in a certain episode (no spoilers intended) did gave my hopes up, but....Well, nope pros first-it is a brand new sportWhat piqued my interest is this, since we always wanted something to be fresh and not mainstream, and aokana is one of them-decent raphicsThe graphic in this one is still acceptable, it isn't one of those that really has a bad or weird grapnics.

The anime removing romance has me feel less both towards characters and sports which you\'d think would be improved cause it\'s given extra focus.I finished playing both Aokana and EXTRA1 & 2 recently and they\'re all perfect imo, I\'ve seen some people say the romance was a bit out of place at some points in the VN but this adaptation proves to me that ""A story about girls flying through the sky and falling in love"" (or something like that was shown at the Grand end credits) is a necessary part of...this story. Should also mention some people believe the romance is what makes some of the heroines (Mashiro and Misaki specifically become such amazing characters by the end of their routes and EXTRA\'s thanks to their relationship with Masaya). The adaptation mostly focuses on Asuka\'s route and the romance in that was much more minimal compared to others but even so the reason they are able to go against Inui (not spoiling who wins) is the trust they build as coach and player which the romance also serves to highlight and that goes for the other routes as well this isn\'t even my main issue with the removal of romance - it\'s how they make Masaya\'s relationships with the girls feel less important (once again weakening the coach and player trust), in the VN he\'s the one who fly\'s with Asuka without Misaki and that becomes a key part of her trust towards him, He changes Mashiro\'s grav shoes to speeder not Rika cause he\'s the coach and is making decisions for his players which allows Mashiro to put trust in him (this one specifically annoys me cause Rika\'s reduced to a side character which is accurate to this route but still why the side character in the anime). There\'s also the loss of all other heroines asking about what if they had been the one to put in effort which isn\'t just some harem thing it\'s them genuinely wanting to be good at FC and shows their growth in both trusting the coach and love for FC. There\'s also Masaya\'s trauma which even if both Misaki and Mashiro handle it best in the VN Asuka still does a believable enough job of getting rid of it only thanks to romance making it feel believable.FC is presented much better in the VN as well and somehow feels more dynamic than this animation, plus artsyle is really good in the VN and CGs (especially EXTRA CGs) look amazing.The music still being Elements Garden and Ray\'s ED let the music be a saving grace but even then it\'s mostly the same as the VN and Crossing Way, Wings of Courage, One Small Step and one of a kind are all better OPs (anime still has a good op just not great) with Millions of You and Happy Tomorrow (Both Mashiro EDs) being close to a-gain.So my point is play the VN, Asuka\'s route is like a shounen, Rika\'s is the worst one but is still good and provides some introspection on Masaya, Mashiro\'s is just adorable romance and even more so is her EXTRA (enough that I replayed her route within a week of first finishing it), Misaki\'s is just pure sports drama mostly in EXTRA2 but still some in main game. Every single character in AOKANA gets their chance to shine as well just not in the anime.AOKANA, EXTRA1 and EXTRA2 are all 10/10 maybe even more so for EXTRA1 due to Mashiro bias but this... this story.

There\'s also the loss of all other heroines asking about what if they had been the one to put in effort which isn\'t just some harem thing it\'s them genuinely wanting to be good at FC and shows their growth in both trusting the coach and love for FC. There\'s also Masaya\'s trauma which even if both Misaki and Mashiro handle it best in the VN Asuka still does a believable enough job of getting rid of it only thanks to romance making it feel believable.FC is presented much better in the VN as well and somehow feels more dynamic than this animation, plus artsyle is really good in the VN and CGs (especially EXTRA CGs) look amazing.The music still being Elements Garden and Ray\'s ED let the music be a saving grace but even then it\'s mostly the same as the VN and Crossing Way, Wings of Courage, One Small Step and one of a kind are all better OPs (anime still has a good op just not great) with Millions of You and Happy Tomorrow (Both Mashiro EDs) being close to a-gain.So my point is play the VN, Asuka\'s route is like a shounen, Rika\'s is the worst one but is still good and provides some introspection on Masaya, Mashiro\'s is just adorable romance and even more so is her EXTRA (enough that I replayed her route within a week of first finishing it), Misaki\'s is just pure sports drama mostly in EXTRA2 but still some in main game. Every single character in AOKANA gets their chance to shine as well just not in the anime.AOKANA, EXTRA1 and EXTRA2 are all 10/10 maybe even more so for EXTRA1 due to Mashiro bias but this...']"
Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2131/Bokusatsu_Tenshi_Dokuro-chan_2,"[""What can I say, a bit more of same-old Dokuro chan, although the second season manages to be even less politically correct than the first one (tons and tons of ecchi) .No story to speak of, no character developpement, but if that's what you were looking for in this anime you have issues:)Apart from that, an episode of this series never fails to deliver when you need 10 minutes of stupid/cruel/ecchi humor.Call me twisted, but I still chuckle every time Sakura kun gets clubbed to death:) "", ""Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2 can basically be described as this: Over the top comedy and violence, complimented with pointless story and echhi-ness on the side.It picks up where the first season left off, (well with the cast appearance anyway) and gives you even more of what the first had to offer.Story: 4/10Honestly if this anime series could talk, it would say: &quot;Story? What is this story of which you speak of?&quot; Because quite frankly there is none whatsoever, if you have ever seen season one then you may be surprised that everything the actual storyline (if you can even call it that) had built...up to that point, seems to have gone right out the window. In fact it kind of confused me when I started this second season. The way the first half ended left many things up in the air, and instead of continuing it from where it left off, it simply just decided to put all characters together as one big happy family, whether or not they actually were so in the first half. Anyway, there is no plot at all to speak of, basically we see Sakura (main male lead) get into all sorts of over the top situations with Dokuro-chan and her friends. Whether it be simply taking a bath together, (in their swimsuits no less) or getting trapped inside some magical box. It does differ from one another so you don't feel you are re-watching recycled content scenes from the first part. They also boosted the over all &quot;echhi-ness&quot; factor and over the top &quot;violence.&quot; So whether you either loved or hated Dokuro-chan's content before, it will mostly increase two full this time around! So if you are new to the series, just be aware that it contains more extreme themes regarding these. Oh and they also added about two new characters, nice for its 2 episode length. Though I personally would have liked for it to continue further than that. There is no character development whatsoever.......nor an actual ending to this either, as you could basically switch the first and last episodes with each other and it wouldn't make much difference. And the way they threw the story out, this series could honestly keep going on for an eternity, all the while making you laugh the entire way. Honestly I just found this title drop dead hilarious at times, as many on the comedy scenes are pretty darn clever......dirty and bloody as they may be.Artwork: 8/10Bright colorful, sharp and lovable, and definitely on par from what you would expect of the series. (though they seem to have given the overall characters a bit more of a mature-er look to them) The character design is not fully different from what you may be accustomed to wanting, but the design and artwork truly have a distinctiveness to them. I especially like how they cut and copy actual animal faces, (or even real life historical characters on occasion) and stuck them on selected characters; Whom of which have been cursed by Dokuro-chan herself! So yeah it varies on the artwork, most of the time you'll see the standard colorful fair, and others you'll see real life western style paintings and character art playing a role in the wackiness. Backgrounds were good and detailed for the most part, but never really come off as anything great or unique, and look pretty standard overall.Soundtrack: 6/10They actually re-made the opening theme from the first part, its okay and all but just isn't quite as carefree and happy as the first. The ending song was pretty beat-ish, basically it has all the characters in yukata's (summer kimonos) dancing to this happy kind of drum beat, all the while singing along, which may tempt you to sway along with it. The background music is pretty forgettable though, nothing really stands out as most are just generic sounding pop beats. I honestly didn't even notice the BG most of the time.Characters: 7/10Great as usual, all the characters retain their varied personalities from the first half. From Dokuro-chans innocent yet murderous intent, to Shizuki's (supporting role) tender caring attitude. Which is quite nice considering nothing in this title is taken seriously, and I am glad that the company went out and actually gave each character a good variety of persona's! Though I think most viewers out there will either love or hate a guy named Zansu, as he can be an extreme in the personality department. Not the most memorable cast out there, but great for this style of anime. Though I feel I should stress it once again, zero character development.Bottom Line: 8/10&quot;Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2&quot; ups everything in content from the first season, chances are you will either love it or hate it more depending on your taste. It remains a solid watch for what it brings to the table. If you like echhi-ness complimented with over the top comical violence, then you will absolutely love this series, if not then you will loath it all the more and find it overall pointless. Good solid watch for fans and viewers who can appreciate its approach in comedy content. up to that point, seems to have gone right out the window.

Obviously, that had to change at some point. Which is why we find ourselves looking at the follow up to Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan, a terrible anime from Hal film maker about an angel who beats her love interest to death, brings him back to life and that's basically the big joke that we kept getting. I'm not looking forward to this one, but let's move in and see how many more gruesome domestic abuse scenes they can cram in and treat as humorous.Story:We pick up where the...last series left off. Sakura is living with the angel sisters, Dokuro and Zakuro.  He's trying to live a normal life and get the attention of the girl he likes at his school but that's consistently ruined by Dokuro torturing and murdering him, but it's okay because she brings him back to life afterwards and that makes it funny because... people dying horribly and gruesomely is hilarious according to this series.The humour is much the same kind of thing that the first series offered. We have gross out humour with the over the top gore effects and perverted humour that's really used more as an excuse to show Dokuro and Zakuro in skimpy outfits than it is for actual comedic attempts. This is one of those series that seems to be based firmly on the idea that sex and violence sell and you don't need any charm or clever witticisms. After all, even semi-clever jokes would have interfered with this OVA's mission to route your blood flow away from the brain. The humour is also quite repetitive with Dokuro getting angry and mutilating or murdering Sakura with little or no provocation. It really shouldn't be possible for a joke to get stale with less than an hour of content, but they manage. So, does this one have any legitimately funny moments at all? Personally, I thought that Corpse Party did the over the top violent humour much better and it wasn't trying to be funny.Characters:This cast of characters is pretty horrendous. I'll give comedic series some leeway when it comes to character complexity since they really only need to play off of each other well for comedic purposes, but this cast doesn't even have that much going for them. We get the same few unfunny pay-off reactions repeated.Art:The artwork is pretty lazy with fountains of blood gore effects, really basic character designs and minimal backgrounds. The most effort they put in is for the tacky fan-service scenes. Which shouldn't be surprising after the first series.Sound:Like the first series, the theme tune is easily the best aspect of Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2. However, it is weakened a bit by being a pretty lazy remix of the first series' theme tune. Rather like Toei did with Futari Wa Precure: Max Heart. The acting is either obnoxiously exaggerated or emotionless and dull, depending on which character is speaking. Which is a pity since there are some really good actresses here. Chiba Saeko, to give an example, voiced Nina in Code Geass, Azmaria in Chrno Ctrusade & Natsuki in Mai-Hime/Otome. She can give such strong performances. It just doesn't happen here because there's nothing to work with.Ho-yay:There are some “jokes” that imply that Zansu is romantically interested in Sakura. Aside from that, there's really not any.Final Thoughts:This series is not good, at all. It's crude, tacky and generally tasteless with the same basic jokes the first OVA had. So, if you're a fan of the gross out/ fan-servicey humour, you might get a kick out of it otherwise, I would stay far away. For myself, I was not amused. I was quickly annoyed by the series and tired of its nonsense. I give Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan 2 a 2/10.  Next week we'll move away from sequels and talk about Charlotte. last series left off.

It still stands strong in the violence department and the storyline is still pretty shallow. The characters are quite lively and still as funny as ever. The place where Dokuro-chan stores her phone is revealed even more clearly in this season &gt;_&lt; ', ""Before I begin, please take note that this is a spoiler-free review. In most cases, this means that I think the show is worthwhile enough to spare you the misfortune of reading any spoilers before enjoying the show for yourself. However, I regret to inform you that this is not the case with Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan 2. So, why then am I not providing spoilers? Quite simply, it is because there is nothing to spoil about this show. Over its incredibly short 2-episode run, BADC2 manages to not only completely abandon all of the elements that made Season 1 funny, but it also removes any...semblance of a plot. So, this leads to the next question: What was added to this show for its second season to make up for a lack of plot or humor? It is simple, really.Nothing.Anyone reading this review is probably wondering whether or not I am exaggerating. After all, ranking a show 1 star out of 10 seems rather harsh. However, rest assured that the rating IS justified. For context, BADC Season 1 is a guilty pleasure of mine. The humor was done well, it had a silly plot, and in spite of its ridiculous nature, everything made sense. In Season 2, the comedy takes a massive step back in favor of ecchi, there is no real plot, and NOTHING makes sense. In fact, some plot points from Season 1 that led to certain characters being around in Season 2 are completely ignored, leaving the viewer wondering what the point of the setup at the end of the last season was for to begin with. Even without a plot though, if the comedy showcased here was at least on-par with Season 1, I could have rated this season 4 or 5 stars. So, let me explain my case in that regard as well.First, it is necessary to understand that comedy is entirely subjective. What one person finds funny may not necessarily be what I find funny, and that is great. It shows that we are all different and can appreciate different things. However, when the point of your show is to be a comedy, and 90% of the show's comedic elements are replaced by scenes of uncomfortable sexual situations (some of which are with a 9-year-old), there is just no excuse. I normally don't mind ecchi, but it is so awkward, brainless, and lazy here that its presence detracts significantly from the quality of what little comedy remains in the show. Watching BADC2 is like going to your favorite comedy club, and instead of a comedian going up and performing his/her tried-and-true routine, two random people just step up onstage and start grinding on each other. Sure, there will be some people in the crowd who get a kick out of it (and maybe even find it funny), but as a comedy routine, it fails completely. There were admittedly two scenes in the first episode that made me actually crack a smile (one of which was essentially a re-used gag from Season 1), but that ultimately can't save this season from being a complete disaster in almost every way imaginable.I could go on and on with this review, but I am finding it more and more difficult to accurately describe why these two episodes fail so completely without providing actual clips and comparing them with Season 1 more specifically. As for my final recommendation, if you enjoyed BADC1, you are doing yourself a favor if you ignore Season 2. However, given the fact that it is only two episodes long, you may find some satisfaction in viewing this trainwreck for yourself over the course of 40 minutes, especially if you wanted a case study on how to ruin a show. semblance of a plot.

made the second season a bit more tolerable to watch.Story (3/10)The story continues with Sakura and Dokuro doing random stuff however the second season only has 2 episodes whereas the first had 4 which to me was an improvement since it meant not having to watch it as long and another slight improvement was the antics that the duo got up to which actually didn't involve much of the school or their schoolmates instead it focused...on a more select group of characters which felt a bit more decent to watch.Once again though the story goes nowhere yet even more this time since there wasn't really a story to begin with in the first place although I did like the moment where the characters got trapped in a prison made to contain angels which did add a bit of suspense because we didn't know how they were going to get out of there.Characters (3/10)Now the characters are a little better not because of Sakura or Dokuro because they are still the same, but because of some characters in season 1 getting some more screentime like Zakuro and Zansu who felt like the only decent characters of the show and I really liked how they used these characters more especially Zakuro who seemed like a waste of a good character in season 1, luckily they decided to make her a main character this season which made the show a little more tolerable to watch.Art (8/10)Once again the art is pretty much the only good thing about the show and the show does improve the character design's this season although I don't know why they turned Dokuro's hair from a light purple and into a turquoise blue which didn't make any sense however I did like some of the locations especially the angel prison which may have looked bland it actually held it's fair share of traps which was pretty interesting.Sound (2/10)The op this time isn't as bad as season 1's op, but that isn't really saying much to be honest it's still ear bleedingly hurtful to listen to.Extras:The comedy was a little better since it didn't fully focus on Sakura getting smashed into bits so many times by Dokuro instead it puts the characters into bad situations and tries to make their actions funny which was an improvement.The Ecchi side was a little heavier too even having a bath scene with Sakura, Dokuro and Zakuro which was a little steamy, but nothing I haven't seen before.Enjoyment (3/10)Overall this was a small improvement over the first season and it sucks you'd have to watch the first season to get here then again it's not really worth you're time as the improvements this season still weren't

I thought it was more of a 'less talk, more fighting' or more like 'kill, then ask', which is my kind of amusement. It is thoroughly consistent and enjoyable for...a twisted, perverted mind like mine XD a twisted, perverted mind like mine XD""]"
Build Divide: Code White,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48777/Build_Divide__Code_White,"[""I will stress that you need to watch the first series in order to get this series. As it continues on from the previous one, and you'll have a better understanding of it overall. But for now, let's get back into the review!Story and characters: 8Without giving so much away, I actually really do love it's story and context within. The way it handles the on going situation from the previous season, it adds to the tension, and nerves throughout. While before, it was cute, but it had a clear objective. Here, there is a lot more seriousness to it. There is a lot more...edge to it. But it's all because of how they handled the characters in Hiyori, and Kikka. Of how those two ahve grown, and developed after the events of the first series. They're the life blood of the show, and it really shows.Sure, there isn't much to the other characters, as they fill the void of what this world is. But in terms of the main cast that you really want and need to pay attention to, it's told super well, and really is believable. It honestly will smack you in the feels. Really nice work all round, and I cannot wait to see where the story progresses next.Art and sound: 7This is where it also really showcases how good the show is. With the tone, and pacing, it makes for an entertaining watch. They really did an amazing job with atmosphere, and general tone of the music, that mesh well together, along with the characters animations and reactions. It all blends well together, to make a well organized product, that comes off well for what it presents. Both departments can bed credited well for it.Code white is honestly worth the watch. It really does well with it's story progression, and really makes you feel for the characters. Watch the first series first, and come back to enjoy this deep depressive second series! edge to it.

This season took a rather ""serious"" approach to the tone, with a lot more stakes at hand and more truths to be revealed about Neo Kyoto.Our main character this time around is Hiyori. From the loveable and dorky apprentice in Code Black to a dignified and strong leader in Code White. I very much enjoy this change, and it makes sense considering the events from last season. She, along with Kikka, fights foes and breaks through obstacles to figure out the absolute truth behind their city....With the ultimate goal being to get their friend/master Teruto back.Code White definitely explores some of our side characters more and explains their motives for their actions, which was something Code Black was lacking. While it isn\'t the greatest, it gets enough done to make each character ""believable"" in a sense.The animation quality is just about the same as Code Black\'s to no one\'s surprise. Nothing terrible, but also nothing great.Egoist comes back for another banger, befitting of the current state of our characters as well as Neo Kyoto itself.Who-Ya Extended gives us a really catchy ED, also befitting the tone of the series.All in all, there isn\'t too much to say about the series. It has its moments and was entertaining enough for me to finish. I don\'t regret watching this, but I personally wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone who wants a casual watch. I enjoyed how the main characters contrasted from last season, as well as the battles that were shown.It was fun, but nothing special.

It\'s not a masterpiece, but they made a structured and coherent product out of nowhere. Of course, you have to see the first season, because this project is meant to be overall 24 episodes.For the content department: I greatly appreciate (maybe too much but that\'s how I am) the change in pace, retaining the solid frame of the story. Two other protagonists for 10 episodes who can bring their potential to the stars and have an outstanding chemistry; the villain wasn\'t boring or overpredictable, he wasn\'t even a good person whose toy they stole as a child; they brought back every single character...who had still something to tell, giving them a little screentime to underline they were secondary character.In a few words, I love how they balanced everything and how we can see the commitment to reasoning in all the choices of the plot. The story wasn\'t left off the leash, condemning us to belly choices only generated in order to move deeply the viewer or to exalt him exaggeratedly, and nowadays it\'s rare.There\'s always the card game and its rules, its ""twists"" in the draws and effects happening when needed, and I tell you: it\'s ok. I\'m not making a fuss because the heroine never loses, there\'s a whole different context from the first season and here losing may bring death. Instead, love the way they introduced new cards and mechanics to the game without giving them the all the spotlights and without making this product pure advertising. This story maintained integrity and identity, again a rare case today.For the technical department: little improvement for the drawings, always a good level of photography and directing, but the best is made with the sound. I am honestly touched by the soundtrack and the opening by Egoist is a dream come true. I even enjoyed the endings, which are my favorite type of music, but it\'s in that moment when I realize they thought well even the ED, that you know they put effort to this project and not only towards the user and his/her much coveted fanservice.Two downgrades: the recap episode (q.q) and the furious pace in episodes 6-7-8, it can be too much even if I appreciate the philosophy of not wasting time.Finally, I\'m very joyous that Build Divide knew an end, instead of giving us the torture of other five seasons with maybe a mediocre cast and plot. I will remember this anime as the best of the first half of 2022, I\'m very grateful that I had the chance to know these amazing characters and this simple but well-written world.P.S Honestly, the vote would be 8,5, but hey, here I want to reward the effort of this production. who had still something to tell, giving them a little screentime to underline they were secondary character.In a few words, I love how they balanced everything and how we can see the commitment to reasoning in all the choices of the plot.

The randomness matches all the other great comedy anime like Hinamatsuri and Saiki K. Of course, it's not wholesome like Gintama but it's still hands down one of the most enjoyable anime this season.Fukuyama Jun is of course at his best voicing the protagonist here. I cannot believe...the same guy voiced Koro-sensei and Lelouch Vi Britannia.The Hanadori and Tsukimiya combination is also so absurdly funny. Furthermore, the show keeps on adding more and more interesting/ridiculously funny characters. I recommend people who are out there giving it such a low rating to rewatch and re-evaluate their scores.

At times it may seem overused but I never felt the need to close the episode or drop the anime while watching. On the contrary, I found myself laughing multiple times during certain episode and that...was like a proof to me that I should finish it and I\'m glad I did.As this is a Comedy-focused anime, It doesn\'t really have a story so it has to depend on the characters to carry it. The characters are great I have to say, we have the MC who wants the peaceful life, the mind-reading sadist who enjoys tourmenting him and the chuunibyous that are the rest of the main characters. What I enjoyed about this cliche cast was that they weren\'t just chuunibyous, unlike lots of other anime characters with the same troops, these are much closer to reality. They feel embarrassed when they do dumb shit and people call them out for it, even Miguel has his cute childish and the ""too embarrassed to talk to females"" characterstics that made him stand out than the normal chuunibyou you see in other anime. To sum it up, the characters are unique. They don\'t feel repetitive despite presenting the same ideas done before in many different anime.The fact this anime has very low focus on romance was nice. Lots of comedy anime get ruined when romance is involved and many use the romance as the source of the comedy and tho that idea isn\'t bad in itself, the execution of them leads mainly to either the ""tsundere hitting the MC"" type of humor and the ""we feel on each other by accident"" type so the fact the anime actually presents what little romance it has in a good way was nice to see.The sound, voice actors, art and overall animation were great as well as the op.Overall I would give the anime an 8/10. I hope to see more of it and to see more great comedy anime in general.Would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a relaxing comedy anime. was like a proof to me that I should finish it and I\'m glad I did.As this is a Comedy-focused anime, It doesn\'t really have a story so it has to depend on the characters to carry it.

And by upgrade I mean even more delusional, not better. He is in love with the supposed main character for some reason. The Main character is a masochist that likes to blame everyone for his shortcomings when he is the one to blame for having the temperament of a bob-omb. He almost literally explodes in fits of rage at the chuunibyou character. His indecisiveness makes him the most unlikable character in the show. Lastly there is the God of the show. He can hypnotize people with his eyes and read the...MC\'s mind. He always uses this to pick on the MC. I was gunna say the MC probably enjoys it, but after thinking carefully he has anger issues and the people picking on him are an intelligent being who knows his everything and a clown who wishes he were Rika but needs to be in a hospital.That being said watching this is kinda like watching NTR. You wanna feel bad for the victim (the one who is being stolen) but you know at the end of the story they actually enjoy whats happening then you wonder why you felt bad and end up hating them instead. Its like ""enjoy it or shut the fuck up and stop complaining"". Its just annoying. Hope this review sheds some light on why this anime is currently 6.75 and not the 8 some people seem to think this garbage deserves.Like everything it has its moments but overall what a shit show.

Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy did it to me last season, and this show is largely more of the same.The extents of Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy and this show play down the same game: a non-existent plot about the MC wanting to get some quietness out of life, and in comes the eccentric ""otherworldly"" boys playing around in their own...world and messing the world\'s balance around with their antics, and finally the MC ropes in together with these boys in an unshakable bond of friendship.Again, the characters are what makes shows like this so endearing, apart from all the ridiculous antics and comedy:Koyuki Seri, nicknamed Gestober, the main attraction of the group, a plain-looking boy wanting to have some calmness in school, and always gets arrowed for insane reason he always ""dies"" in spirit at the end. Plus, his desire to have classmate Kotoko Sumiso notice his crush for her are always thwarted by (mostly) Hanadori. ""RIP Koyuki"" has been the recurring gag that never fails to make me laugh that hard. Props to VA Jun Fukuyama for doing such a wonderful job.Kabuto Hanadori, the over-excessive chuunibyou, nicknamed Miguel, the dark God of Destruction. He\'s always performing alter-ego acts of chuuni so much that it irks Koyuki, but in truthness, wants to be Koyuki\'s friend and cares deeply for him...that is, unless he\'s asked to do in consideration.Utsugi Tsukimiya the teaser and joker of both Koyuki and Hanadori. Always never-ceasing in spreading his ""knowledge"" to both of them and the constant low-ley teasing that ends both in hilarious states, he\'s the straight man to their inherent relationship.As for Hibiki and Mogami, they\'re just as chuuni in their own ways, the former being a shy one and the latter trying his best to be noticeable at best and helping Koyuki out.The best has got to be the bond between Tsukimiya, Hanadori and Koyuki and their endless antics that drive the comedy and the bond between Hanadori and Koyuki so well, and Tsukimiya being the ""threat"" to them both.With great character comes great animation...in the comedic sense whilst keeping it low budget, and any studio would\'ve been fine in this treatment. What\'s enough is more than enough, and with all those cartoony, slice-of-life caricatures, the enjoyment shines through. In the sound aspect, it\'s decent at best. The OP is as average as wack, but I love its bop and hoppity feel, say whatever you want but this is my hidden gem of a great song. AOP\'s ED...well, just sounds the typical idol group kind.This show (like Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy) are shows that you can enjoy regardless of the score/rating, and if you need a time to flex your laughing stock and funny bones, it\'s worth the watch (plus a re-watch too). world and messing the world\'s balance around with their antics, and finally the MC ropes in together with these boys in an unshakable bond of friendship.Again, the characters are what makes shows like this so endearing, apart from all the ridiculous antics and comedy:Koyuki Seri, nicknamed Gestober, the main attraction of the group, a plain-looking boy wanting to have some calmness in school, and always gets arrowed for insane reason he always ""dies"" in spirit at the end.

I actually almost missed this show because it had so little popularity within the currently airing anime.Boku no Tonari ni Ankoku Hakaishin ga Imasu is a great comedy show. The plot of the anime is nothing special: MC gets dragged along with a chuunibyou friend. This type of show has been done a bunch of times. But, why is it that something like Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai or Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy average or even below average, and this show, very good in my eyes?Well, I\'d say that there are a lot of elements that make this show as good...as it is, but let\'s first talk about one of the most important things about a comedy show: the characters. The main character is not your white bread japanese MC with their only personality trait being ""kind."" He definitely has a depth of personality that you wouldn\'t normally see in a comedy anime. He\'s childish, dumb, selfish, easily tricked, and maybe doesn\'t appreciate his friends enough. All of this shows through in his monologue. There\'s definitely a lot of shows with monologuing like Bakemonogatari or Suzimiyah Haruhi. And definitely a few comedies that do the same, like Saiki K. However, Seri\'s monologue showcases his personality very well, and creates a great comedic effect off of it. His reactions and comments truly makes this show a lot more fun and interesting, and the show isn\'t shy to showcase it a lot. Seri\'s monologue is one of the defining factors of this show, and also one of the funniest. However, lets move onto the other main character: Hanadori. It\'s true that he starts off by being one of the most overused chuunibyou archetypes of all time but after he starts to interact with Seri and Tsukimiya, that archetype becomes secondary to his personality, and this is true with all of the characters in this show. While a lot of them seem to be very boring and only have a quirk/gimmick to them, they usually get explored a lot more than just that. This is something Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai or Chuubyou Gekihatsu Boy fail to do. They just muddle about with their given quirks in uninteresting slice of life scenarios with predictable dialogue and reactions, thus making them extremely boring. Boku no Tonari has great characters, comedy, and a unique MC. Hanadori is shown to be extremely affectionate towards Seri, and you get to see him grow as a person, or at least, see him become something more than just ""a guy with chuunibyou."" Tsukuyima is actually one of the most unique characters right off the bat, and a necessary character for the story. He\'s shown to actually have mysterious powers of that like a God, and harasses Seri for no other reason than for his amusement. While he doesn\'t really progress as a character, you never find him boring. As for the side characters, I\'ll go over them real quick. Just like Hanadori, archetypal characters are generally given enough love to evolve beyond their single trait that they were given when introduced. However, I will admit. Some characters really are just what they look to be  when they were introduced. It was probably the 12 episode time frame that this show was given that this had to be the case. I find that especially Mogami really got no screen time or dialogue beyond his typical lines that he always goes for. However, there is no real annoying characters, and Helius, Sumiso, etc, are all pretty good. They\'re also not overused that much, so the jokes about them don\'t get oversaturated. The author tries to keep things fresh.Anyways, lets move on to the story. Some comedies sometimes shift their focus to more serious character development arcs, such as ""why am I even hanging out with these guys,"" etc etc. Boku no Tonari is no different, but it\'s executed well. A lot of comedies fail to pass this hurdle. Boku no Tonari maintains a serious tone when needed, but also knows that it shouldn\'t be a show that should be taken that seriously. In the end you have well balanced character arcs where you get to know the character much more in a genuine fashion than a typical comedy show could offer without it being forced. The only other thing I wanted to comment about the story is that it focuses on comedy for the most part, while some shows love to focus heavily on the ""slice of life"" part for some reason. It\'s not even good when they do that. Boku no Tonari focuses on the comedy aspect, and thus, is not a half baked product that tries to execute both a slice of life and comedy.Art...honestly, looking at the art objectively, it\'s very average, or even below average. That is, if you don\'t include the comedic aspects of it. What I mean are the facial expression of characters during scenes. As a comedy, having your animation blend in is very important, and Boku no Tonari gets a 10/10 on that aspect. Simple, yet effective and cute chibi figures, everything about the cat aesthetic that Seri has, and the other facial expressions and reactions are very reminiscent of a 4-koma comedy (which it obviously adapted off of),  is amazing. While it may be something that you may brush off, the art and animation of these scenes definitely multiply the execution of dialogue and scenes.All in all, It\'s a very good series with little to critique. I was honestly very surprised that it was at the bottom of the barrel of new airing shows, since it\'s probably going to be one of my favorites of the year. I hope this review makes you think about giving it a try. as it is, but let\'s first talk about one of the most important things about a comedy show: the characters.

The only other thing I wanted to comment about the story is that it focuses on comedy for the most part, while some shows love to focus heavily on the ""slice of life"" part for some reason. It\'s not even good when they do that. Boku no Tonari focuses on the comedy aspect, and thus, is not a half baked product that tries to execute both a slice of life and comedy.Art...honestly, looking at the art objectively, it\'s very average, or even below average. That is, if you don\'t include the comedic aspects of it. What I mean are the facial expression of characters during scenes. As a comedy, having your animation blend in is very important, and Boku no Tonari gets a 10/10 on that aspect. Simple, yet effective and cute chibi figures, everything about the cat aesthetic that Seri has, and the other facial expressions and reactions are very reminiscent of a 4-koma comedy (which it obviously adapted off of),  is amazing. While it may be something that you may brush off, the art and animation of these scenes definitely multiply the execution of dialogue and scenes.All in all, It\'s a very good series with little to critique. I was honestly very surprised that it was at the bottom of the barrel of new airing shows, since it\'s probably going to be one of my favorites of the year. I hope this review makes you think about giving it a try.', ""Pretty cute anime with good comedy.StoryThere isn't really an overarching story, more like mini-stories per episode, like most comedies. Despite this, the story that there is, is cute and unique, turning everyday activities into something ridiculous. It is pretty memorable for the absurdity of it.

Music is also great, along with the voice actors who have done an excellent job.CharacterDesign of the characters is really unique, each character looks great and none of them are boring as they all have amazing personalities.

By virtue of not being a cruel comedy when it easily could have been, I figured I could add it to the pathetic single piece of paper that comprises my Anime Comedy Good Book.12 episodes later, I’m not so confident. While the series does hand Seri the L in every situation, I find that by relentlessly doing so it actually loses the touch of kindness a...series like this could benefit from. Seri’s assumptions, even the wholesome ones – like his worries about Hanadori’s wellbeing, social or otherwise – are uno-reversed the same way his negative assumptions are. You could argue his self-sacrificing assumptions are driven by a sense of self-importance he shouldn’t have and him getting unwittingly checked by Hanadori or Tsukimiya is satisfying, but after the first time it just started to feel a little malicious. Even if Hanadori never means to insult Seri by rejecting his rare offerings of kindness or concern, it left me waiting for a pay off when he would accept and there would be some normal bonding moment uninterrupted by cynical comedy, but that moment never came.I get that it’s funny that the times when Seri gives in and tries to be nice to his wildly annoying friends who are obsessed with him, that it backfires because haha, he thinks they’re obsessed with him! Except, they actually are...?And so the usual episode format goes one of two ways:1. Seri gets wrecked by his annoying friends who can’t leave him alone and he eventually snaps and yells at them for embarrassing him.2. Seri gets wrecked by his annoying friends but something happens that makes him feel guilty about how he reacts, or causes him to worry about their well-being, and when he expresses these things it is revealed that he shouldn’t have, and he snaps and yells at them again for embarrassing him.It does get tiresome to see the same formula again and again and again, and by the end of it, I was there in despair with Seri and wondering if he would ever escape his friends' tormenting. When Seri becomes more soft, it just backfires on him and the universe proves that he should stay cynical. When Hanadori reveals any other aspect of his character other than just being a chuuni, it’s backpedalled into him just being a chuuni actually. When Tsukimiya actually says something with an ounce of truth to it, he then twists it to be another part of his game of 4D chess he’s playing to make Seri suffer. And so it turns out there are consequences to making literally every scene a joke: nothing happens and no one changes.It made for a rather insincere final impression, even if Hanadori and Seri are endearing… their endearing traits go nowhere because it wouldn’t be funny if they did. But it would be better.Oh, and the side characters are either useless (Hibiki) or annoying (Tsukimiya and Mogami). Hibiki’s entire thing was just being unlucky and getting ignored by Hanadori and I found him easy to ignore as well. He really has no presence whatsoever after his introductory episode. I don’t care about Tsukimiya and him “being a God “ with literally supernatural abilities like being able to read Seri’s mind and always knowing where he is -- it just felt like Godmodding. I don’t get what’s “cool” about the kid that ruins a D&D session by rambling about how unexpectedly invincible his character is against the boss that should wreck him. And Mogami is just… a masochistic teen boy… really don’t care about a teen larper begging to be stepped on.So considering we have an ensemble cast where only 2 characters have anything resembling development, and that development is caught in a perpetual state of Take-Backsies, I would say Bokuhaka deserves its middling score and rather poor reception, even if I enjoyed it more than the average critic. I didn’t find it cringeworthy, and I did find it funny enough, but there really is no substance. And I am not of the belief that comedy is magically exempt from expectation. series like this could benefit from.

He's a bit immature, but a pretty normal schoolboy. There's nothing really to say about him on his own.Then you have Kabuto, the chuuni. Besides being completely isolated from reality, his defining characteristic is being unimaginably stupid, both academically, practically, and socially. The most unrealistic part of this show is that he's survived to this age without dying from starvation/thirst because he forgot how to swallow, or being run over by a truck...because he wanted to fight it with magic.Finally, what really makes this show special is Utsugi. Most character-driven comedies like this have a normal protagonist, a chuuni, and some combination of tsundere, dandere, masochist, or some other dere trope. However, this show has an omnipotent sadist instead. He does everything he can to make Seri's life miserable, and since he's apparently a god, there's absolutely nothing our protagonist can do about it. Utsugi can apparently read minds, see the future, straight up brainwash people, and perform inhuman feats of strength and speed.The comedy of this show is derived from Seri being humiliated, tortured, and mentally broken by Utsugi, mostly by manipulating Kabuto as a tool to cause as much emotional pain as possible. That's pretty much it. Every time anything remotely positive happens to Seri, Utsugi lets it play out just long enough to get his hopes up and then crushes it in the most humiliating way possible. That's it. That's all there is to this show.If you have even the tiniest shred of empathy for the main character, this show is pure emotional torture. I've watched hundreds of series without ever dropping a single one, and this is the closest I've ever been to breaking that commitment. Even leaving it to play on my laptop while I go and do something else in my room is too painful to bear.

I personally don’t understand why this is rated so low. This was one of the most wholesome and cute animes I’ve watched. The characters are not unique but they are still super cute in their own way! This anime made me laugh so hard and it gave me hardcore secondhand embarrassment. It was definitely a fun watch!I had my doubts because the first episode was not that nice, but this is the type of anime that grows on you. I felt like Koyuki...was mean at first and I didn’t like the way he treated Hidenori who was a precious little bean, but eventually you realize that Koyuki is just a sweatheart that’s tsundere! This a beautiful anime about friendship and I hope people would see that :) it’s also super funny and its a great anime to watch when you want to pass time. was mean at first and I didn’t like the way he treated Hidenori who was a precious little bean, but eventually you realize that Koyuki is just a sweatheart that’s tsundere!

Why? Because I speak German and reading the ridiculous name (Miguel Offenbarung Dunkelheit) of one of the main character’s alter ego, I had to laugh, so I watched it. Now on to the review.This was a decent and rather wholesome anime.The main character, Koyuki aka. ‚Gestöber‘ is an average, boring guy. He just wants to live a normal life and study to reach his dream, but crazy chuunibyou kids won’t leave him alone. Very simple premise. Koyuki tries not to get involved with them, pities them, thinks they are childish...and also the reason for his average/worsening grades. He blames those guys for everything going wrong in his life. The thing, though, is that those guys are actually doing quite well in their own lives, and it’s not that they want to make Koyuki’s life a living hell, but just want to be friends with him.Throughout the series, Koyuki doesn’t seem to have any real friends, his grades were never good to begin with and his personality is plain (no hobbies or interests, he even has a Nice Guy moment in the show, cursing good looking people for no reason etc.) Despite all that, he can’t seem to appreciate the fact that people are trying to be there for him and put effort into making his life more fun - carefree days won’t last forever, right? He thinks he’s better than everyone without even realizing, he doesn’t really care about anyone (if he hurts somebody, he will make it up to them so he won’t feel guilty about it) yet he acts as if he didn’t need to be surrounded by childish idiots, even though really he is the child, not appreciating and accepting people (I mean, not once did he even wish for more normal friends or anything, he is completely self-involved)Not a lot really stands out here, but I liked the fact that the ‚weird kids‘ were portrayed as the more normal or sane ones, if you think about it. Koyuki is a boring guy, but he seems bitter, even at his young age (bitter is not the same as depressed) but the other guys want to live life to its fullest, and involving Koyuki is kind of like their gift to them. They know that life is hard, but that’s exactly why they don’t want to give up entirely on their inner child, something Koyuki seems more than willing to do. Society, especially in Japan, can be really unforgiving, and while the chuunibyou kids strive to change the world, Koyuki won’t even waste a thought on things like that. Also, Koyuki is literally the only person who despises those kids, the rest of the class just laugh with them and play along with their phantasies, more or less.Each time a new weird kid gets introduced, Koyuki acts as if it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Miguel to find a friend, although that is not the case at all. If anything, Koyuki should be thinking that way about himself.The comedy was fine, obviously depending on your humor, you might find this show stupid or hilarious. As is often the case, especially with comedy, a lot got lost in translation (word plays, role-language etc.) Personally, I had to laugh quite a few times.Rating it a 6 is not something bad. Keep in mind, it is still above average. It’s completely decent. I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone, maybe, but to some I would, yes. It’s not very ‚good‘ or original, but that’s OK, too. It’s good to relax sometimes.Btw, I feel like maybe ‚cute‘ stories of friendship between guys aren’t very popular among the male demographic, maybe. Had this been a Manga/Anime about girls, more people would probably like it. That's just a thought.Thank you for your time. and also the reason for his average/worsening grades.

Cinnamon the Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5848/Cinnamon_the_Movie,"['Overall rating: 4 - Light watch and nothing memorable, but worth my while because I get some 40 minutes watching my favorite white Sanrio puppy being animated.Content may contain vague spoilers.I know I shouldn\'t expect much since it\'s targeted towards an audience with a simpler processing of storylines, but I still want to dissect it without bias since it genuinely could\'ve been improved using the elements already present in the film. If they were worked on, it could\'ve been more effective and engaging in its storytelling.For the world-building, it should\'ve used more environmental metaphor. Essentially, the conflict in the film is significantly influenced by Chowder,...hence it could make sense to anchor the world\'s visuals and characteristics after the character\'s patterns. I also partly hoped that the cloud land from where Cinnamoroll fell from had more context, or at least some visual storytelling so that he can be better introduced.In the rise to the climax, Anna strived but ended up being too helpless for the amount of effort she made. Chowder, on the other hand, could\'ve been driven by more character (not necessarily him being painted as evil since I get that this is a kid\'s show, but better nuanced) so that the conflict will make so much more sense. The plot could\'ve improved exponentially if it capitalized further on the concept of Chowder\'s ""inner feelings."" Also, the final ""boss battle"" felt quite lazy in execution.I also wished that Cinnamoroll\'s character was better established throughout instead of just keeping him muted then going all out with his character only by the end of the film. He also could\'ve exhibited additional minor actions that would easily painted the kind of attitude he has. Rapport with Cinnamoroll being the newcomer was also barely achieved (except maybe for Milk).I understand that art back then was different though I wished the colors and illustrations were more vibrant (think animated Alice in Wonderland). Nonetheless, Cinnamoroll has a great character (albeit quite clueless in the beginning). His qualities could\'ve been built up better throughout the movie though. hence it could make sense to anchor the world\'s visuals and characteristics after the character\'s patterns.

Overall good anime.', 'Show of hands, who here knows about Sanrio? Even if you don\'t know them by name, you\'ve probably seen a character they made called Hello Kitty. She\'s pretty much everywhere if you know where to look. But Sanrio as a company has made many other cute, colorful characters since their inception, and continue to do so to this day. I first learned about Sanrio in elementary school, and one of the first Sanrio characters I really grew attached to was Cinnamon, the cute white puppy with long ears and a cinnamon roll shaped tail. I thought he was absolutely adorable, and still do! Yes, I...know he\'s technically referred to as Cinnamoroll now, but I remember discovering him back when he was referred to as Baby Cinnamon, or just Cinnamon, so I\'m going to keep calling him that. So years later, when I found out there was an anime movie about Cinnamon and his friends, kid me was ecstatic!...until I found out that nobody bothered to give it English subtitles. Fast forward over a decade, and somebody was kind enough to sub it via YouTube\'s closed captions system and posted it up there. I finally watched it, and...I love Cinnamon, but man, this has kids movie written all over it, and not in a good way.One day, a pup named Cinnamon falls from the sky, landing in a young girl\'s bike. Anna, the girl in question, takes Cinnamon to the cafe she works at. Cinnamon meets the other pups that live at the cafe and they all become friends. But a mischievous demon, Chowder, thinks Cinnamon is a threat to Anna, who he has a crush on, so he tries to mess things up by casting magic spells. However, one of them spirals out of control, to the point of kidnapping Anna and trapping her in a warped world of its own making, trapping everyone inside. Cinnamon and the other pups must work together to save Anna from the being that Chowder\'s spell made sentient.Not gonna lie, this is not one of the better children\'s movies. The whole thing just involves the pups going into this magic kingdom to save Anna from a monster, and they don\'t even really do anything on their own. The pups just scream a lot and the plot basically forces them to move from place to place just to get the story going, rather than actually having them do it themselves. None of the characters receive much in the way of development and are just a bunch of archetypes, and rarely do they do much of anything by themselves. It really says something when Mocha, the female fashionista puppy and a side character, winds up being much more proactive than the lead character, as not only does she frequently call out Chowder for what he did, she\'s often the first to take action. Plus, the movie doesn\'t really give the characters a chance to just sit, breathe, and show what they\'re like outside of the situation they find themselves in. Anna is just a damsel in distress who doesn\'t do anything but be saved by the pups, so she\'s flat-out useless.The story is pretty shallow and trite as well, as it\'s just a rehash of a ""save the female character"" premise that\'s been done in many other movies before, and this does nothing new with it. The main villain is barely given much development, and the themes that arise form said villain\'s existence don\'t get explored to their fullest potential. There\'s also the fact that the movie takes huge leaps in logic just to make the story progress. For example, a character flies to save Anna, but the thing is, the character is small enough that he should not be able to fly carrying the weight of one whole person on them, much less be able to maneuver around moving tentacles. Add in a random Deus Ex Machina that comes out of nowhere to save the day, and the problem is solved forever and ever. Yawn.It\'s easy to see that this movie was made solely for the purpose of just entertaining children and giving them something colorful to look at, without much in the way of actual substance and depth. Now, there\'s nothing wrong with kids wanting the occasional dumb entertainment for the sake of it, as kids can tire of stuff that\'s solely educational. I like my occasional dose of cheesy Lifetime melodrama movies whenever I\'m in the mood for them. But don\'t go into this movie expecting it to be anything more than a 45-minute babysitter. I can at least say this though: At least it\'s not the travesties that are My Little Pony: Newborn Cuties and A Troll In Central Park. know he\'s technically referred to as Cinnamoroll now, but I remember discovering him back when he was referred to as Baby Cinnamon, or just Cinnamon, so I\'m going to keep calling him that.

If you like the cute things or if you like topics like ""why friendship is important?"", ""why family is importan?"", you will be in love with this anime.Story: 8/10The story really looks like The Wizard of Oz and Alice In Neverlands. Beside of anime the movie looks like children\'s novel, or some kind of fable. There is something that I love in story is ""solving problems"". I would never forget to oven part. It was genius. So If you are going to watch this...movie, probably you feel like you are reading old tales But there is something that\'s bothers me, which it\'s Cinnamo\'s story but... It feels like It\'s Chowder\'s movie. So that is really annoying.Art: 10/10I love the art style. Its screams that this movie is cute. And If you like cute little animals in cute lands. Probably you like this art style too! :3Sound: 5/10I love the Chowder\'s voice but... that\'s it. Especially Ms. Anna\'s voice is really annoying. There is lots of scream scenes bıt her voice actor\'s voice is so down. So except Milk and Chowder their voice is kinda sucks. But because of Chowder\'s voice It didn\'t bother me that much.Character: 10/10They all have got unique personalities which is awesome! They all different and they know them. I love the fact that no matter how different they are they\'re all friends.Enjoyment: 10/10I don\'t actually like this kind of movies because they are boring. But this movie is really really sweet and in the end I almost cried of it.Overall: 9/10I really enjoy this movie and I think everyone needs to see that. Actually in this bad times. They need to remind their childhood with this kind of sweet movies. It has got lots of facts that should be reminded.By the way, If you are feeling down now... why don\'t you watch this movie when you are eating cinnamon rolls?Ps: this is my first time writing review and English is not my first language so sorry about mistakes.Thank you for reading!

Have a nice day! <3', ""Time to articulate the blorbo thoughts without making them into an entire analysis.This is a short and simple yet wonderful movie about friendship, and technically family too, but the friendship message is much more prominent. It's by no means perfect, as the titular character Cinnamoroll/Cinnamon is lumped in with everybody else until the end, and Ms. Anna mostly just gets used as the plot device. It actually focuses more on Chowder, a character that only appears here and is cited as the antagonist despite switching sides less than halfway through. I won't go into too much detail for fear of getting rambly (Remember 'blorbo...thoughts'? Yeah, it's him.) but he's shown to have more dynamics with the other characters and means well despite his impulsiveness.The movie does, however, leave some questions unanswered, such as why Chowder's spell malfunctions in the first place and how the other characters know him.It's not a movie for everyone, but if you have some free time, look it up on Youtube. thoughts'?

I would prefer it id the evil dough turned into a handsome prince and had some romance between ms Anna and him. Whatever. it's a children's movie anyways. I totally recommend it if you want to change your perspective about life.The animation was very pretty and aesthetically pleasing and mesmerizing.The sound, well, i watched it on youtube i can't really comment anything on it.Acting was so so good i even got emotional towards the end so you better have some tissues nearby...maybe you'll get emotional too just like me. Honestly can't wait to have kids so i can make them watch this masterpiece. A must watch i would say. maybe you'll get emotional too just like me.

Cocolors,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34167/Cocolors,"[""In an apocalyptic world stripped of all life and emotions, how can one find hope and the will to live ? Cocolors revolves around this concept of hope through a drawing made in collaboration with the two main characters, Fuyu and Aki.As time goes by, more and more people are dying in the colony which profoundly affects the moral of it's inhabitants, who have indulged in religious acts probably to keep their sanity. Whereas Aki is drafted to the Salvage Unit, Fuyu completes a drawing illustrating his conception of the outside world, according to Aki's description. However, one question remains : what is the...color of the sky ? The drawing, which was primarily a way to convey the thoughts of Fuyu, then takes another dimension. It becomes the metaphor of the spirit, with the color of the sky being the soul, as it is suggested by the name of the movie (I suppose it's a mix between Kokoro (spirit) and Colors thus making Cocolors).Overall, I think it's a good dystopian movie which did a good job at dealing with mature subjects though more childish elements, and has a good balance between dark and wholesome moments. Despite it's short length, it managed to develop a great evolution of the characters and build an interesting story. The OST is pretty good and relevantly used, the CGI is fairly well done and the art really nails the chaotic and cold atmosphere. Overall a good movie, I definitely didn't regret watching it ! color of the sky ? The drawing, which was primarily a way to convey the thoughts of Fuyu, then takes another dimension.

Overall a good movie, I definitely didn't regret watching it !"", 'Short review though TLDR below :pThe outside world is a strange place. We know it\'s there, but what do we know it has? You can\'t tell for sure unless you go and take a look for yourself. In doing so, do you think you have taken up the correct choice? Sometimes the knowledge of the unknown will bring about happiness and excitement, whilst other times sadness, god forbid trauma, or maybe, it is straight-up anti-climatic. You just don\'t know.And whilst ignorance is bliss, to protect us from risk. As the Latin language beholds, ""scientia est potentia"".I don\'t need to give a synopsis of the...story, so I will go straight into it and say what I liked about the story. I think the story is a good one. The concept of the ""outside world"" has been frequently touched upon in this medium, originality isn\'t a thing here but that doesn\'t make it bad. I thought Cocolors had its own quirks to spew out to the audience despite major similarities, namely, how it goes around telling the story, or the execution if you like.Cocolors has this incredibly consistent atmosphere to it in which gives nothing but really depressing undertones that constantly flake around the story, there are themes of hope here, there are themes of preserving, but most of the time, the world here is very bleak and full of despair. I have to say for a short movie like itself, it does an amazing job of presenting such a theme without feeling too shallow. This brings me nicely to my next point, world-building. Now the story inevitably faced the issue of world-building with being short and quite literally about the world as a whole. I can\'t say that Cocolors really nailed it with world-building, there were too many things left empty or just not considered at all, but I don\'t want to make this a major complaint as this didn\'t matter relative to the story goals. It is a minor complaint as I just wanted to know more about this very interesting world, unfortunately, the story doesn\'t expand too much on that matter. Pacing is something I want to touch upon as well, this is fast, which is not surprising, but it doesn\'t hold up too well when looking into the world and plot that has been given. It is hard to get a lot out of this in my opinion, it would have made more sense for it to be a 1.5-hour movie instead. No clue why it isn\'t, so I will leave that there for now.The characters are good, I have to point out that sometimes they feel very melodramatic. To be fair, it should be understood that this world of theirs isn\'t the most optimistic of places, however, with an ever depressing theme, the drama stacked onto it sometimes doesn\'t converge well, especially when done so a lot, in which Cocolors does. A lot. Drama does lose value quickly here, which is a shame but it isn\'t something I would consider too damaging. There is no real development to speak of as everything is condensed in a short amount of time, hell MC Aki is literally told he doesn\'t change. I don\'t want to make it sound bad that characters are undeveloped, they are just fine I suppose.The audiovisual side of things is amazing, the full 3D CGI is probably the best I have ever seen, nothing tops this period in my opinion, it mixed well with some 2D (sometimes 3D background drawing too), visual landscapes are always pleasing to look at here whenever the camera gives that a moment to shine, character design is pretty detailed too, the lighting on the suits gave it that touch of realism to add on to its glory. And it was made in 2017 too. Wow. Audio is in the same boat, admittedly, I don\'t have too much memory on the OST however, I do remember that I have positive comments on them. It isn\'t like average OST, it is the kind to play with your heartstrings too, but they were really good overall. Even though I have talked about melodrama, I would like to point out that there is still good voice acting that comes along with it, the seiyuus did a good job at conveying the characters they played, not feeling static at any point. I liked it a lot.I think Cocolors enjoyment lies in a different kind of aspect, most of the time with movies of its kind, there tends to be a conventional storyline to be followed, sharing good and bad moments, though Cocolors takes this incombustible formula, lights a fire to it, and hands it back to you still burning. What I mean is everything is still there, but there isn\'t quite a movie like Cocolors that is so hard on itself with bringing forward a rather depressing world. This is a sad story, not one like the other sad stories either. With pacing issues though, I didn\'t enjoy this as much as I thought I would, but it was still something I found in good light at the end of the day. It\'s time-efficient too.TLDR: Decent execution of interesting base via fast pacing, slightly melodramatic characters, undeveloped but by no means bad. Audiovisuals lit. Enjoyable but won\'t understand much.Overall - 7.6 (8)You wouldn\'t have guessed Kamikaze Douga to make a serious movie now would ya.

A lot. Drama does lose value quickly here, which is a shame but it isn\'t something I would consider too damaging. There is no real development to speak of as everything is condensed in a short amount of time, hell MC Aki is literally told he doesn\'t change. I don\'t want to make it sound bad that characters are undeveloped, they are just fine I suppose.The audiovisual side of things is amazing, the full 3D CGI is probably the best I have ever seen, nothing tops this period in my opinion, it mixed well with some 2D (sometimes 3D background drawing too), visual landscapes are always pleasing to look at here whenever the camera gives that a moment to shine, character design is pretty detailed too, the lighting on the suits gave it that touch of realism to add on to its glory. And it was made in 2017 too. Wow. Audio is in the same boat, admittedly, I don\'t have too much memory on the OST however, I do remember that I have positive comments on them. It isn\'t like average OST, it is the kind to play with your heartstrings too, but they were really good overall. Even though I have talked about melodrama, I would like to point out that there is still good voice acting that comes along with it, the seiyuus did a good job at conveying the characters they played, not feeling static at any point. I liked it a lot.I think Cocolors enjoyment lies in a different kind of aspect, most of the time with movies of its kind, there tends to be a conventional storyline to be followed, sharing good and bad moments, though Cocolors takes this incombustible formula, lights a fire to it, and hands it back to you still burning. What I mean is everything is still there, but there isn\'t quite a movie like Cocolors that is so hard on itself with bringing forward a rather depressing world. This is a sad story, not one like the other sad stories either. With pacing issues though, I didn\'t enjoy this as much as I thought I would, but it was still something I found in good light at the end of the day. It\'s time-efficient too.TLDR: Decent execution of interesting base via fast pacing, slightly melodramatic characters, undeveloped but by no means bad. Audiovisuals lit. Enjoyable but won\'t understand much.Overall - 7.6 (8)You wouldn\'t have guessed Kamikaze Douga to make a serious movie now would ya. Strange world we live in.', ""The art style was unique and was a change of pace for once, as well as complementary but not overstepping soundtrack. But don't let those qualities fool you.The show has aproximately of 45 minutes of runtime, and gives a story to match. Which is to say almost non-existent. The entire premise of the movie is presented in a 60 second OP sort of thing which you HAVE to rewatch to get what is going on.The art style and sound tracks are pretty good I think. There is use of 3D in this anime and I can see why.

It's just their motivations and actions are not really explored, which could have really sold the ending sequence in my opinion.With the aforementioned flaws as well as the grim story and little explanation of the situation, I would say it was as mediocre as it could get. The movie left me with a whole hosts of questions about the world as well as the fact that did not allow me to invest into our main duo of characters emotionally. I would say it wouldn't be mediocre if it was allowed to bloom with a longer runtime or even an acutal show.TLDR; I liked the art and sound track a fair bit and it had an interesting premise which it explored for about 60 seconds in the opening sequence (wasted opportunity) to everyone wearing a helmet.Characters as not really developed and looking at the run time I don't blame the creators.

There are fundamental flaws present in this work that I strongly consider bar it from such a rating.These are that the story is dull and the animation is trash.The story revolves around a mute, sickly boy, bullied by his peers and with only one friend. He is passionate about art in an apocalyptic grey world. You see the problem here? It's like I'm reading out of a checkbook of pity tropes. The main issue is that a fat half of the runtime is...spent on telling you just this. As a result none of the characters have any depth, even for something of this length. The paper-thin story isn't surprising when you consider it was created by a studio best known for Poputepipikku and goddamn Ninja Batman.The animation reminds me of Malice@Doll, primarily because both works intentionally structured their character designs to be easier for 3D animation. In Malice@Doll all the characters are lifeless, decrepit sex dolls, matching perfectly with the OVA's horror themes. In Cocolors all the characters are empty-faced cosmonauts, devoid of any emotions, matching perfectly with it's themes of...friendship and perserverance? Doesn't really work the same does it. It seems to me that Kamikaze Douga simply couldn't be bothered with character design, which by the way Malice@Doll does have and it alone is 10 times better than this mess. Did I mention Malice@Doll enough? Here's another fact about it, it was made in 2001. Cocolors is from 2017.Tl;Dr it's japanese oscar bait don't bother spent on telling you just this.

Daikuu Maryuu Gaiking,https://myanimelist.net/anime/956/Daikuu_Maryuu_Gaiking,"[""(TLDR: Gaiking is decently fun, with episodes ranging from hilariously wacky to pretty boring. If you're just looking for a cheesy classic super robot show without much substance, you're in the right place.)I watched Gaiking over a year ago at this point, and I've had my notes for this review sitting on my computer ever since. Since I don't spend nearly as much time writing anymore, I never got around to fleshing out those notes into a full review. Rather than trying to finally write cohesive paragraphs out of these thoughts, I'm just going to post all of my headings and year-old bullet points so...there is at least one MAL review out there for this series.How does it look?A little wonky, but I think pretty good.I can't compare to much from that era since this is the first classic super robot anime I've watched.If you can't stomach old animation, you definitely won't enjoy this.There is lots of good stock footage for Gaiking launching and using named attacks, as well as the Daikuu Maryuu (DM) using its Volution Protect.Sometimes a different animator comes on with a style that has a sketch-like aesthetic which I really like.The Gaiking itself looks awesome, but the DM is kinda derpy.It basically looks like a fat caterpillar with a dinosaur headI suppose the pilot suits for the crew are pretty typical for classic sci-fi, but that's exactly why I love them.How does it sound?The theme song is admittedly not great, but at the same time I've had a blast singing along with it for the past few months.The soundtrack is pretty decent.There is a nice range of emotion in each of the orchestrated tracks.Of course, everything has a crispy 70s quality to it.The voice acting is just fine, nothing to write home about but nothing to lament either.What does it present?A VERY episodic series with very few multi-episode arcs.There are a handful of 2 episode stories, and the finale technically spans 3 episodes.Everything else is self contained with a nice ribbon tied on the story before the credits roll.A typical episode goes like this:The Zelans cackle about having a new plan to defeat the DM.The Daikuu Mari-Crew goes to investigate a strange phenomenon somewhere in the world.They discover the phenomenon is linked to local history or mythology, and it was in fact caused by some kind of robot that the Zelans planted on Earth in ancient times.Gaiking launches and cleans up shop.Story:The overarching story of the Zelan homeworld being sucked into a black hole is only touched upon a few times.Their army is stupidly evil and their people are super pacifist, so there's not much subtlety at play.CharactersI think the characters are actually one of the series major strengths.Most of the main cast has a few episodes dedicated to them, or to conflicts between certain members.And that's the end of my notes! So who should watch Gaiking? I would recommend it to any mecha fans like myself: someone curious about classic mecha anime that doesn't want to committ to a high episode count for something like Mazinger Z. It was fun enough to turn my brain off, enjoy the cartoony shenanigans, and shout Gaiking's attack names along with them. there is at least one MAL review out there for this series.How does it look?A little wonky, but I think pretty good.I can't compare to much from that era since this is the first classic super robot anime I've watched.If you can't stomach old animation, you definitely won't enjoy this.There is lots of good stock footage for Gaiking launching and using named attacks, as well as the Daikuu Maryuu (DM) using its Volution Protect.Sometimes a different animator comes on with a style that has a sketch-like aesthetic which I really like.The Gaiking itself looks awesome, but the DM is kinda derpy.It basically looks like a fat caterpillar with a dinosaur headI suppose the pilot suits for the crew are pretty typical for classic sci-fi, but that's exactly why I love them.How does it sound?The theme song is admittedly not great, but at the same time I've had a blast singing along with it for the past few months.The soundtrack is pretty decent.There is a nice range of emotion in each of the orchestrated tracks.Of course, everything has a crispy 70s quality to it.The voice acting is just fine, nothing to write home about but nothing to lament either.What does it present?A VERY episodic series with very few multi-episode arcs.There are a handful of 2 episode stories, and the finale technically spans 3 episodes.Everything else is self contained with a nice ribbon tied on the story before the credits roll.A typical episode goes like this:The Zelans cackle about having a new plan to defeat the DM.The Daikuu Mari-Crew goes to investigate a strange phenomenon somewhere in the world.They discover the phenomenon is linked to local history or mythology, and it was in fact caused by some kind of robot that the Zelans planted on Earth in ancient times.Gaiking launches and cleans up shop.Story:The overarching story of the Zelan homeworld being sucked into a black hole is only touched upon a few times.Their army is stupidly evil and their people are super pacifist, so there's not much subtlety at play.CharactersI think the characters are actually one of the series major strengths.Most of the main cast has a few episodes dedicated to them, or to conflicts between certain members.And that's the end of my notes!

Dan Doh!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/234/Dan_Doh,"[""I just finished watching Dan Doh!! which is a 26-episode sports anime about golf. GOLF. Well...The series is the typical prodigy story. A boy suddenly realizes he excels in the sport - so much that he is able to beat people who have been doing the same thing for a lot longer than he has. It helps that he has the backing of not one, but two, ex-golf pros. Oh yeah, did I mention that his father was also a secret amateur golfer who has unexpectedly (and still unexplainedly) quit the sport? Like we haven\\'t seen that before.Animation-wise, it was a bit old-fashioned for my...taste and there was nothing that spectacular about it. Sound - it was all about the \\&quot;sonic booms\\&quot; of the drives and the \\&quot;clink\\&quot; of the ball when it goes into the cup. The only character development is ALL the characters, except for one, turns good from being bad the first time we see them. The whole series is just too... nice.But Dan Doh!! is still enjoyable and entertaining in its own way. I would have liked to see more of what happened to Dan Doh, his friends, and if he ever went to bigger things in his golf game. taste and there was nothing that spectacular about it.

Let\'s just say the writers have an overactive imagination.  *WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD*Story: So we got Aoba Tadamichi ""Dan Doh"", some kid who starts off thinking golf is nothing because the ball you hit is stationary.  The principal of his school shows him otherwise by mimicking a golf shot with... a baseball bat and ball... Umm can I get a physics check here? Anyway, suddenly Aoba thinks golf is the bees\' knees and wants to become the best. Does he do it? Oh yeah! This grade schooler puts Tiger Woods to shame. After two...weeks of practice he enters his first tournament and birdies the first hole with a bunker chip-in and eagles the second with a wayward approach shot that\'s saved by the wind. In short, the biggest piece of bull crap I\'ve ever seen and an insult to the game of golf and all the people who work hard just to get par. The saving grace of this hell-hole is the story arc where Dan-Doh caddies for a tour pro, Akano, and helps him win the Sapporo Open. Even then, the pro has a crazy number of hole-outs in approach shots for eagles. (NOTE: Tiger Woods did this ONCE in his ENTIRE 2009 season.)  The cream of the crop though, is Dan Doh getting away with hitting Driver in places other than the tee, something any pro wouldnt think twice about doing. This is just the tip of the iceberg though. If you\'re into golf, you\'ll likely be utterly disgusted by this crap. If not, don\'t be lured into thinking golf is an easy game (which this anime apparently depicts without fail). IT\'S NOT!Anyway, thanks to the Akano arc, this piece of crap gets a 4 in story, and that\'s being generous.Art/Animation: Two words ****ing terrible. Yes, you can make out when someone is talking or swinging a club, but it\'s all about the latter in this anime.  Pretty much all the swings look like they are raised to their apex in 5 discontinuous stages. Then the character can wait for as much as 5 seconds before swinging through. It\'s a mess, and if you copy it, you\'ll be lucky to hook the ball every time. Ball flight is also entirely bullcrapped. At one angle, the ball looks like it\'s been hit with good loft and then suddenly it looks like it\'s hovering one ft above the fairway as it approaches the green. Clearly, their art budget for this pathetic excuse of an anime was nil. Since other things can be made out sort of okay, I\'ll be generous and hand out a 3.Sound: Opening theme is cheesy, bgm is cheesy, it\'s all cheesy, nothing special here and gets a 4.Character: I have to take marks off here big time because they make Dan Doh a golf-tensai right off the bat, which pisses me off royally. Besides that, everyone has a constant personality and doesn\'t really ""change."" The only really memorable one is Akano, who actually does undergo some transformation and thus I award it a 4 in this area.Enjoyment: As someone who knows what it\'s like to earn every birdie and every par with months of training, this anime pissed me off to beyond the depths of hell. Making the main character a sudden prodigy sensation who can best Tiger Woods with some of his shots and having every other shot be a hole out or pin hit was just a pathetic decision on the part of the writers. The only reason Dan Doh doesn\'t get a one in this category is, again, the Akano arc, so I give it a 2 for enjoyment.Overall: 3/10; a terrible anime and a disgrace to a great game. weeks of practice he enters his first tournament and birdies the first hole with a bunker chip-in and eagles the second with a wayward approach shot that\'s saved by the wind.

I think this show is really solid. Highly enjoyable is the fact, that the show displays beautifulness of the sport nature. Sport should be enjoyable for both players and spectators, should be played fair...and without cheating and at last should be treated with respect (towards the game itself or other players).Story is mainly divided into two arcs, first arc is about main character Tadamichi playing golf with his two friends on championship, trying to fulfil his dreams. Second arc is concentrated on profesional golf player and Tadamichi as his caddie.Art:Considering the fact, that this anime is from year 2004, the art is really good.Characters:Tadamichi Aoba ( nicknamed as Dandoh ) is main character of this show. My first impression on him was not pretty good, I thought that he is going to be annoying, but I was mistaken. Tadamichi is really enjoyable character, I couldn't help myself, but love him. His nature is pure and he respects golf highly. On his was towards his dreams, he encounters many ill-mannered people like cheaters and so on. But his nature and the way he treats the sport managed to show ill-mannered people how bad their actions are. It's cliché, but to be honest, I liked it.Takuya Akano is second important character to the show, he is ex-professional golfer which is too corrected by Tadamichi's personality. He is important to the second arc of the show, as he takes Tadamichi under his wings as a caddie....Although some parts of the show seemed twisted and not fitting ( for example Tadamichi's  background story is not that much explained, his father is against him playing the golf and his mother left the family because unknown reasons ), some other things are for me left unexplained too ... but overall I am pretty much surprised how much I enjoyed the show.So if you are sports anime fans or just are looking for relaxing show with lovable determinated characters, you should give this a shot.Show is not flawless, but really is relaxing and enjoyable. and without cheating and at last should be treated with respect (towards the game itself or other players).Story is mainly divided into two arcs, first arc is about main character Tadamichi playing golf with his two friends on championship, trying to fulfil his dreams.

It's filled to the brim with amazement, wonder and excitement that keeps you enthralled where you otherwise might not have.Overall I wouldn't describe it...as a particular good anime... but it has its moments, and paired with its rather unique subject; it'll most likely be enjoyable if that peaks your interest. as a particular good anime... but it has its moments, and paired with its rather unique subject; it'll most likely be enjoyable if that peaks your interest."", ""I wish there are at least 50 episodes  it's not bad but not satisfied because i quickly finish it dandoh always forgive his cheating rivals though and dan doh is not capable to lie lot of episodes is wasted in adults tournament when mc is not even part what a waste if you dislike friendship mc dont watch definitely 8/10 for me since i'm in good mood normally this will be 6/10 for me hope there is a lot of golf anime  art style is old so it definitely fits old anime  i cant tell more than this okay please my first...review bababababa review bababababa""]"

There is an unflinchingly gratuitous scene of fatal and repeated animal abuse which is dragged out for all its worth, reaching the artistic equivalent of any and all trashy teenage gore blogs. I have absolutely nothing against extreme storytelling or explicit content, but there is little more that I despise than such distinctions being used as an illusory crutch in place of any actual depth, originality, or purpose.""The King of Pigs"" is a South Korean CGI feature with highly inconsistent production values, but in all honesty, that\'s not something that I actually hold against it. It doesn\'t seek to be a glossy anime-style production, so it mostly avoids the inherent pitfalls to the approach suffered from works like the recent ""Berserk"" films. If anything, the aesthetic is more along the lines of animated art house successes such as ""Waltz with Bashir,"" or even the rotoscoped Linklater films (albeit with far less technical care and certainly weaker scripts to build upon). I tried hard to justify ""Pigs\'"" content for the duration of the film, as there are occasional flourishes which did appeal to me, but at a certain point, it just becomes an exhausting and monotonous drag.The film opens with a static shot of a freshly strangled woman, her murderous husband serving as one half of its thematic focus. The other lead is then introduced as an unsuccessful ghostwriter, venting his frustrations through the seemingly routine emotional and physical abuse of his girlfriend. Things only go downhill from there, too. After the former calls upon his similarly abject childhood friend for the first time since their first year of middle school, they recall the traumatizing events that we\'re led to believe shaped the course of their lives. There\'s no real message to any of the film aside from the fact that people are awful by nature and that\'s that. The bullying the young men experience is increasingly cruel and difficult to watch, and like everything else in the film, is as such for the sake of being cruel and difficult to watch.I think that the most irreconcilable turn the film makes is its apparent and absolute exoneration of the evils both men would later perpetuate on the grounds of their soiled childhoods. In this regard, the film veers from being merely un-enjoyable and celebratory in its grimness into territory which is nothing short of morally irresponsible. Violence begets violence, thus effectively removing any responsibility from the destructive men themselves. In school, the boys rally around a third figure, one who lashes back at their tormentors in ways which grow increasingly gruesome as the running time wears on. In case you haven\'t yet caught on, that really is the entire modus operandi at play here. I understand that such things are widely open to interpretation, but I would argue that the film\'s treatment of this backlash is one which not only condones but celebrates the notion of harsh retributive violence.As I stated, I wanted for a long time (far longer than it deserved) to like this movie, to find something which would justify all of my stated misgivings. Unfortunately, it didn\'t want to give me much to work with on that quest. There is simply nothing about the story that feels particularly necessary. I think it\'s important to reinforce just how much this movie revels in its own ugliness. It stops trying to do much of anything else pretty early on.Admittedly, there are a few well-devised plot twists and turns, jumping back and forth chronologically as it does between the aforementioned childhood recollections and scenes of the two men drinking and then wandering the same locations as adults. It\'s not an incompetent film, merely a wildly misguided one whose lofty and undeserved self-assurance permeates most every frame. The closing moment alone instantly became one of the most heavy-handed and indulgent bull**** turns I\'ve ever seen a movie take, and let it be known that I have a remarkably high tolerance for heavy-handed and indulgent bull**** movies. Is it art? Yeah, sure, whatever, I don\'t care, but I certainly don\'t think it\'s particularly good or worthwhile art. I regret giving it the benefit of a doubt for even a minute, as well as allowing it to occupy my evening.

', ""A movie made by a studio no one really heard of, avg. score of 7.04. I really didn't have much expectation coming into this movie. Was I ever so surprised, I had the most thrilling 90 minutes of my life.Story: 10/10Story covers over things everyone is familiar with, bullying and social hierarchy. These themes are executed very well, while also very trilling to watch. Some people might think it is too brutal and unrealistic. Different culture and life experiences we have will makes us look at this film differently. The film felt real for me, but might not for people who had happy childhood....My friends in China were spanked a lot, they did things to me just like what bullies did to them (People who watched the movie will know what I am talking about, yes it is to my penis). To be honest, some scenes were a bit extreme. But how extreme it was really sent a good message to us. The movie focuses a lot on hierarchy system. And how breaking it is impossible. I think go from bottom to top is definitely possible but it takes a LOT of work, and most people aren't capable of that. The story took me through a roller coaster of feelings. I hope it will take you as well!Art: 7/10The characters looks ugly... Which is a good thing here because they aren't suppose to look good in a movie like this, in another word the art style fits the theme very well. Except how awkward they looked when some character were walking or running. But it is normal because of their low budget. They did a fantastic job with those little budget they had.Sound: 9/10Sound isn't the big case here. Animation matches the voice, the OSTs is fit the situations very well. Thumbs up!Character: 10/10Characters development is outstanding. I think some people might think that the characters are absolute nuts. When they have so much stress, pain, miserable childhood, plus physical abuses from many people, it is not surprising that they became the way they are. And I think everyone in the world are capable of doing things they did, it is in our human nature. I have to mention it again, I felt closer to the character because I had similar experiences and thoughts when I was in China. And not everyone will feel that way!Enjoyment: 10/10It is very enjoyable! Hooked me in right start from the beginning of the film. The constant plot twists made me sit through entire movie barely blinked my eye. Every new character and plot twists were where they needed to be. Even when I finished watching the film, I still couldn't stop thinking about how good the film was!Overall, I give 9.4/10. I really admire their courage of making a such controversial movie, that is the spirit of a studio without much to lose! I hope more people can give this movie a chance because it is an unique film!

Chan Young, a bright new student, exemplifies this dehumanization when his enthusiasm for school related excellence wanes, due to the callous nature of the imperious “dogs.”  The obedience of the other “pigs” is quite...evident, as their resolve to combat their oppressors is noticeably absent; except for one rebellious soul — Chul “The King of the Pigs” Kim — who aims to alter the contemporary paradigm through a series of aggressive assaults against the tyrannical rulers of the classroom.Yeon Sang-ho, director of the work in question, drowns his characters in unremitting gloom, never giving the viewer a chance to catch their breath, as he yanks you deeper into his ocean of despair.  It is a welcomed experience that far too few directors are willing to accommodate; yet, life, even for those trapped in misery, still contains moments of intermittent joy, an emotion that seems foreign to Mr. Sang-ho.  An injection of happiness, every once in a while, would have provided a nice contrasting effect for the viewer (as the characters would resonate with greater effect).  Also, the hallucinations of the tortured cat were a bit heavy-handed, bordering on absurd.  Nightmarish illusions should, in most cases, be used sparingly; otherwise, the effect will lose its potency and be rendered completely useless.Furthermore, due to the incessant need to portray life as pure hopelessness, the ending became a contrived mishmash of violence and rage.  With those deficiencies in mind, however, “The King of Pigs” is still an impressive film with a plethora of useful insights on the dynamics of societal hierarchies and the ruthlessness of life, from beginning to end. evident, as their resolve to combat their oppressors is noticeably absent; except for one rebellious soul — Chul “The King of the Pigs” Kim — who aims to alter the contemporary paradigm through a series of aggressive assaults against the tyrannical rulers of the classroom.Yeon Sang-ho, director of the work in question, drowns his characters in unremitting gloom, never giving the viewer a chance to catch their breath, as he yanks you deeper into his ocean of despair.

A tragic story about hopelessness, cruelty, pain, bullying, stigma and wasted youth. What it means to be a pig (in other words, the lower classification in the hierarchy of society and school) and what happens when the king of pigs emerges. This movie will leave a very strong impression to you and very possibly it will haunt your thoughts for a few days. Strictly recommended only to mature audience with a strong stomach! ', 'So first things first, The King of Pigs is not a happy or uplifting movie. At all. It\'s relentlessly violent, has almost no morally good characters, and offers no salvation or reprieve from the suffering that takes place. With that said, is The King of Pigs still worthwhile? Well... it\'s not that easy.Overall, The King of Pigs is a story about class struggle, and how dehumanising and inescapable class discrimination is.The story is largely told through violent altercations in a middle school between the rich kids, the ""Dogs,"" and the poor ones, the ""Pigs."" The most similar example I can think of to this film...would be 2019\'s Joker, which engages with a similar message of ""The world is fucked and the only thing you can do is get violent and show people that you\'re not someone to be messed with."" Except King of Pigs is even more fatalistic than that, and shows that people who act out like that only end up getting punished and that the situation only ends up getting worse than it was before. The only successful rebellion against the system anyone is able to make in this story is a self-destructive show of defiance that ultimately ends up changing nothing. The film portrays the process of the ""Pigs"" getting bullied, lashing out in anger, and then being punished for it as an endless cycle with no solution.And if that wasn\'t depressing enough, there are almost no characters in this film that are portrayed as good or likable people. The ""Dogs"" are all complete assholes who enjoy tormenting those with less power than them, the main cast are prone to outbursts of anger and violence, and the movie starts off with the aftermath of one of them having recently murdered his wife for unexplained reasons, even the adults in the side cast are portrayed as caring about money above all else and exerting what little power they have over those with less than them. Furthermore, there\'s almost nothing in the way of healthy relationships either. The friendship between the two leads is tenuous at best, and their mutual admiration of Chul Kim is greatly tested by the later events of the story. Even the familial relationships they all have feel notably loveless. No one in this movie is a good person, and no one really likes anyone else. The prevailing emotions in this film are bitterness and anger and hatred.On a lighter note, let\'s talk about the visuals! ...They\'re not very good. The character designs are horrendously ugly which is probably by design, but also the animation feels noticeably cheap, like they\'re trying to keep the number of actual frames of animation as low as possible. Movement is stiff, frame rates are low, and it\'s these elements along with the almost complete lack of lip sync to the dialogue that make it feel somewhat like an amateur production. The film also uses CGI models for its characters any time there\'s a mid shot or a long shot, and those models DO NOT blend in with the backgrounds in any way. It\'s not all bad though, as the usage of 3D backgrounds in some parts look pretty neat, and there are some pretty inspired artistic shots that use light and shadow to great effect.The King of Pigs is a bitter, angry and miserable movie, but is it good? It\'s definitely not enjoyable or likable in any way, but I can\'t help but respect how relentless it is in its portrayal of its message, how it doesn\'t try to sugarcoat things for the sake of the viewer. I\'m normally not a fan of stories such as this, as they often just feel like doom and gloom and violence for its own sake, but this movie actually feels like they\'re being put to use to show the injustices of inequality. I still can\'t call myself a fan since I prefer stories to have at least some measure of levity amidst all the despair, but I do think there is something to take away from this. would be 2019\'s Joker, which engages with a similar message of ""The world is fucked and the only thing you can do is get violent and show people that you\'re not someone to be messed with.""

I had a very hard time deciding on a rating for this one—and still do. However, I can tell you that this is one I will not be forgetting any time soon.First off, the animation. This film is completely done in 3d. That is probably an instant turn off for plenty people. And, as things often turn out with 3d, some parts look quite awkward and are a bit painful to watch. But...don’t lose hope yet. As a hater of 3d animation myself, you can trust me when I say some parts of this film actually look really really good. Some parts of it turned out seamless. So, I desperately urge you to at least try and get past the animation if you don’t like it at first.Next, the story itself. This film is unlike anything I’ve seen before. It scares you, but not in a horror type of way. The characters themselves scare you with what they might do next. The relatability you find yourself sometimes having with these insane characters scares you. This anime is brutal and unforgiving. There’s violence, but more grounded, realistic violence than most other anime, which makes it all the more frightening. It blows me away what this film was able to do in just 1 hour 36 min. It puts you in these characters minds, forcing you to experience what they’re experiencing. If you’re like me, this anime will make you cry. It’s depressing and it makes you SAD—in a good way of course. It sets out to tell a story outlining the apparent evil of humanity. To characterize the cold and unforgiving world that people can find themselves in, the same world that _you_ can find _yourself_ in. It’s tragic because it’s realistic, and it puts you in this terrible kind of environment that you know exists out there right now. There’s always something oddly intriguing about seemingly mentally unstable characters, in any medium. I think it activates a portion of our brain we’re not used to very much when we explore, try to understand, and sometimes even relate with these kinds of characters. But anyway, that’s a whole other discussion. In short, this film is an atmosphere. It’s atmosphere was somewhat similar to aku no hana, if you’ve seen that. I believe if you are able to immerse yourself in that atmosphere, you will love this anime as much as I do.Finally, the ending. The ending of this movie is what caused it to cling to my brain and not let go. It’s what really drove home the whole idea of it and made it a truly unforgettable experience for me.

There's been countless live-action and animated films about kids in school that are bullied and don't have great live outside of the classroom either, but I can't think of many that are as depressing and bleak as this is. While not in the same upper-echelon as films such as Requiem for a Dream or Dancer in the Dark, this had the same sort of complex emotional effect on me as...they did, where as much as I thought it was a great film, I can't see myself revisiting it very often, if at all, due to how distressing it is.From a technical standpoint, the animation is above average and has a unique style, but I could see it turning some people off. It's not particularly pretty, but then again, that may very well be on purpose, as it mirrors the tone of the film. All of the voice-acting is very good and the story is well-told with a solid pace. The characters are also deftly written, acting in ways that feel true-to-life, and have nicely constructed character arcs. There are likely those that could view this film and relate to having a similar childhood, as scary and sad as that may sound to someone like myself who didn't.There aren't many animated films, if any at all, that have scenes that make me cringe or make me feel uncomfortable, but The King of Pigs certainly does, and that's quite a remarkable feat. This is an entirely different beast than Train to Busan, so you should know that going in, but if you want to see how versatile a director Yeon Sang-ho can be, this most definitely will show you.

Gakuen Heaven: Hamu Hamu Heaven,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4353/Gakuen_Heaven__Hamu_Hamu_Heaven,"[""Well, if you have not watched the anime ' GAKUEN HEAVEN ', then I think you should watch it before understanding the 'specials' known as ' GAKUEN HEAVEN- Hamu Hamu Heaven '.I, thus, prefer to talk directly on the main anime : Gakuen Heaven.In every aspect(story, art, sound, character, enjoyment), I rate anime 10/10.I loved this story, I am not into BL, but this was a touching and wonderful story, I can't compare it to anything I have ever seen.It is one of the best anime I have watched. The story is a very simple one and cute.Gakuen heaven is a boys x...boys cute and beautiful anime.This anime shows a great and profound innocence between the main characters.Watching this anime makes one realise that true love is extremely innocent and much beyond physical level .And believe me watching this anime will be a great experience. Everyone has his or her tastes and this anime depends a lot on which angle you watch it. Going directly to the main story:Ito Keita is a common boy, and he has nothing to be recommend except his good luck. One day he receives a letter. It is a certification of the entrance to an elite boy's boding high school. At this school he is supposed to spend days of battles and sweet romance with handsome boys. He constantly questions his worth at the school. He's just an average normal young teenager.The story revolves around Ito Keita, who can't believe he can go to Bell Liberty Academy, shortly known as BL. (Yeah, I know BL also means Boys Love.) There he meets a lot of new friends, one of them Kazuki Endo  (my favourite character), who he is closest to. But there are some people who just don't want him in BL... And aside from that, what's with Kazuki anyway? What's he hiding from Keita? And why does Keita feel so comfortable around Kazuki?In fact kazuki has deep feelings for keita.He has connections with Keita's past and is very concerned for him. The anime shows a kind of spiritual relationship between them.The first few episodes are only there to get to know the big cast that support Gakuen Heaven. Later we get to be delved deeper into the story. The mysteries of why Keita was able to get into BL in the first place, since the school is only there for top students. Of Kazuki Endo, his past with Keita and his real identity. The people who are plotting to work against Keita. And then the last mystery involving Jin-san, who is close with Kazuki. In the end they will all be solved and you will feel satisfied after watching this series.The art is beautiful and bright and there are tons of bishonen to boot. Funny being the keyword, the slash is really teasing you, but there is hardly any real action going on except for that anly one kiss and the hugs. However, the relationship of the main paring is very nicely and beautifully built and that's more important to me than some steamy/hot scenes.You should not expect every shounen-ai animes to have steamy scenes. I believed that if steamy scenes were to be present in 'Gakuen Heaven', the innocence of the anime would have been ruined... What I like about this anime is that its innocence and profoundness has been preserved perfectly.And yes, I have seen many people mistaking the term 'SHOUNEN-AI as 'YAOI', especially when it comes to yaoi-fan girls. There is actually a world of difference between the two terms. Shounen-ai animes are animes that show emotional tendencies towards boys and boys. Shounen-ai animes are not supposed to show steamy scenes ,whereas yaoi animes indicate presence of physical, steamy scenes between boys and boys.So I request people to learn the difference first because there are many yaoi fans who tends to get dissappointed because they already judge shounen-ai animes as container of steamy scenes...which is absolutely wrong.Overall Gakuen Heaven is a nice series worth watching. I definitely recommend this series to you! If you miss this anime, it will be like missing a great moment in your life.And lastly, a very important lesson: patience will be rewarded.

Gad Guard,https://myanimelist.net/anime/271/Gad_Guard,"[""I've seen a good number of people online call Gad Guard a mediocre title for one reason or another, which led me to rent the series via Netflix to see if there was any validity with those claims. While the series is far from being a masterpiece, I did see some meaningful elements to the series which at least made it watchable. The series ran on an ongoing theme of overcoming personal doubts and taking responsibility for ones own actions. This theme was conveyed through the Techodes that the central characters formed from GADs as the series comes to reveal the personal problems plaguing the...characters and how these problems led their Techodes to manifest. The series does enough to flesh out these major characters to give one enough sense of their backgrounds, what they desire from their Techode and how they gradually come to develop as they meet one another and frequently clash over their differing beliefs with what responsibilities they should fulfill with their Techodes. Depending on the character, the series portrays a variety of differing moods from the seemingly mundane coming from Hajiki's deliveries to action-packed from Takumi's heroic vigilantism to dramatic with what we learn of the pasts of the characters.However, the show's shoddy plot development is what bogs the series down quite a bit. There are a number of glaring plot holes connected to elements of the series such as the origins of the GADs and some background concerning supporting characters encountered in the series is hardly explored, particularly Katana's connection with Sayuri and Catherine's connection to the GADs. In addition, the show often gets in the annoying habit of having some of its events occur too conveniently just to advance its plot, whether it be one character being saved in the nick of time or dealing with a seemingly impossible situation.In terms of presentation, don't expect much out of the visuals. While the series does feature good-looking and diverse scenery shots from the dark and vast landscapes of Night Town to scenes in the countryside, character and mecha designs look rough in their details and the latter designs also looking fairly simple with said details. Also, animation shortcuts are apparent rather frequently during action scenes. In terms of the soundtrack, Gad Guard is notable for its upbeat jazz beats used for the show's OP sequence and some of the insert musical tracks of the series, which fit rather well with the varying moods that the series portrays with its characters.While far from a perfect title, don't let the reviews from other sites deter you from giving Gad Guard a try. While the show's plot is subpar in quality, its characterization coming from the developments of the central characters and their desires with the Techodes do enough to make up for the show's shortcomings with plot delivery. characters and how these problems led their Techodes to manifest.

The plot was interesting and the mood of the show was unique to say the least. I mean any show dealing with young kids obtaining Gun… I mean mechas has to be good right? Sadly the execution of the story elements left something to be desired. I’m getting ahead of myself so let’s start with the story.Gad Guard tells the story of Hajiki Sanada, a 16 year old street smart teenager working as a delivery boy in a city called Night Town. Due to the depletion of Earth resources cities have been separated into units...and every night at midnight the electricity gets shut off. This leads to a surge in organized crime and black market deals. During one of his deliveries Hajiki gets involved with a cubed shaped object called a Gad and it seems that everyone wants it in the underworld. It’s during a skirmish for the Gad that it shows its true colors as it transforms into a Techode.Like I said before the story had a lot of potential. The contrast between futuristic mechas and the 1920’s mob crime made for an interesting plot in the beginning. Yet instead of focusing on this contrast other story elements are brought in that disrupt the balance. There were also many execution problems as well.While Gad Guard focuses on Techodes the show never truly gives the background story on the Gads and how they came to be until the end of the anime. Some of the characters also have a deep connection to the Gads and Techodes yet their stories are never brought up even though they hint at it throughout most of the anime. Most of the middle part of this anime was filled with episodic adventures that felt more like fillers than anything else. Lastly the ending goes so far on a tangent that it doesn’t feel like you’re watching the same anime.Now the animation isn’t going to win any awards but it wasn’t all bad. The saving grace in the animation department is the Techodes themselves. Each felt unique and well crafted to suit the owners as well as give off a futuristic hope in such a bleak environment. And when I mean bleak I really mean it. Night Town during the daytime looked like all the color was washed out except for gray and brown. During the night scenes everything was either too dark or blinded by the moonlight. It doesn’t help that until the near end of the show Night Town is the only location you’re going to be seeing so having to see nothing but brown and gray hurts the eyes. Needless to say you aren’t going to find great quality here and while I’m not saying it’s the worst it’s just that it feels that there is no originality in the series.The music is practically nonexistent. In keeping with the 1920’s theme most of the music including the opening rely heavily on jazz. And while it’s interesting in theory, just like the story plot, the execution was not up to par. It felt like the music was there because it had to be there. The background music in Gad Guard has no feeling and it doesn’t help set the mood for any scene in the show. The music just sits there never really standing out or helping improve the quality of the show.Overall Gad Guard is just another mecha show that you won’t remember after you watch it which is a shame. The idea of this anime had so much potential. Sadly the inconsistent story and bleak atmosphere makes it a passable show.

The characters were all unique and nothing like most animes in which you wish you can punch (shoot) them and drop the show. I honestly thought this when I decided to watch this show. Thankfully no one was really like that... with an exception for Hajiki.The story was original but doesn't go into much depth. In the first and middle episodes you don't really get an explanation about the gads which is understandable because Gads are rare and nobody really knows anything about them except for small hints. The final episodes you get a few...more hints and, in my opinion, a half-assed explanation. Some questions are also left unanswered.The art is in the middle. It is not blown-in-your-face-holy-wow-that-is-good but not I-wish-the-animation-was-better.In Gad Guard you mostly hear jazz music. I am not one for jazz myself but the music is incredible. I have caught myself humming to one of the songs numerous occasions. There are some times in which the music does not fit the scene, however.I give this a 7/10. It will be remembered like all the other animes but it will not hold a speacial place in my heart. more hints and, in my opinion, a half-assed explanation.

I watched this anime a long time ago but, had never finished it until now and I'd like to share the pros & con's.Story: First of all, Gad Guard had a good concept story that pulled you in at first, About a boy that worked Day to Day to help support his family that his father had abandoned trying to be a better man, until stumbling upon A plot twist that ultimately completely moot as the later episodes seem to skip a lot of important information and got rather confusing and feels like...it was rushed making the story kind of hard to fallow, for example Character's relationships developing without how it came to be, or how this character gained this.I can still recommend this anime though it feel's sloppy toward the end it still has a good message. The character's have rich/fun personality's.Art: The art design of this anime was kind of cheap, to many commonly used greys the colors kind of ran together at some parts but it wasn't horrible and wasn't totally bland.Sound: Music is mostly comprised of jazz music and some technobut is still pleasing to the ears. not bad, not great.Characters: The characters were fun to watch but a lot of character development was left out but you can kind of see where the characters were headed before hand.Overall:  All-in-all this is a good fall-back anime when you've got nothing better to watch, its a fun ride to pass the time and Its not totally horrible but kind of cliche, I enjoyed it enough to a certain point though it lost it's plot somewhere along the line and lost most of its potential. I give this a 5/10 it was rushed making the story kind of hard to fallow, for example Character's relationships developing without how it came to be, or how this character gained this.I can still recommend this anime though it feel's sloppy toward the end it still has a good message.

I give this a 5/10"", ""The end of the anime is the best part and it's not sarcasm, this final part is the most interesting of the whole anime, I would say that the anime has ups and downs, in some episodes it has interesting and very adult themes but the anime can't do that interestingly.The anime ended with Hajiki's romance with Arashi, in fact I think all the couples were well on their way, there was even a kiss between Hajiki and Arashi, this surprised me, I thought the anime would end open in the romance part or would there be something that pissed me off, because clearly Arashi...liked Hajiki, imagine if they didn't end up together or she ended up with someone else?Watching this anime I was very afraid that something would happen that would make me angry, but I'm glad it didn't happen, there was the part of the police officer at the nightclub, but they managed to soften and get her out of that environment.I have to make some considerations with the beginning of the story, when the main ones were still to join it was kind of unreal Hajiki, Aiko and Takumi have a very similar superhero outfit, in the same style without them having met and agreed before , if each one had a different model it would be ok but they dressed practically the same just changing the color.The characters of this anime were very charismatic although they lacked certain motivations for example Katana having a connection with Hajiki, at first he wanted to destroy the lightning, then he became a kind of stalker of Hajiki, and soon after he went after Sayuri.Hajiki started out wanting to stop Katana, then he wanted to buy his old house, then he just left, then later on out of nowhere he wanted to go to space.Aiko didn't know what she wanted to do with her life and out of nowhere after having her mecha punched she gave up on telo.Arashi for some reason wanted to have a mecha and after she got it she didn't use it, she only used it when necessary, when the scene called for it.Takumi was perhaps the most coherent, he wanted to be a hero, but he realized he was being hypocritical and tried to improve.Catherine wanted a gad, the beginning of the story basically revolved around that but then she is a character played to the side.Kogoro was made just to be the boss, in the second half he was forgotten.I would give it 6.5/10 but on MAL you can't put a broken grade so I'll give it a 6, it's not that this anime has a bad story, bad characters but its rhythm is bad and maybe the things that happen in this anime could have been done better, this anime didn't make me excited or anxious to watch it straight away, something was definitely missing from this anime, it's an anime that doesn't have anything that makes me recommend it but it would be an interesting anime to introduce a beginner to animes world.6/10PT-BRO final do anime é a melhor parte e não é sarcasmo, essa parte final é a mais interessante do anime todo,eu diria que o anime tem altos e baixos, em alguns episódios tem temas interessantes e bem adultos mas o anime não consegue fazer isso de forma interessante.O anime finalizou com o romance do Hajiki com a Arashi,na verdade eu acho que todos os casais foram bem encaminhados, teve até beijo do Hajiki com a Arashi,isso me surpreendeu,eu achava que o anime ia terminar em aberto na parte do romance ou ia ter alguma coisa que me deixasse puto,porque claramente a Arashi gostava do Hajiki,imagine se eles não terminassem juntos ou ela acabasse ficando com outro?Vendo esse anime eu fiquei muito receoso que acontecesse algo que me deixasse irritado, mas ainda bem que não aconteceu, teve a parte da policial na casa noturna, mas eles conseguiram amenizar e tirar ela daquele ambiente.Eu tenho que fazer umas considerações com o começo da história, quando os principais ainda estavam para se juntar ficou meio irreal o Hajiki a Aiko e o Takumi terem uma roupa de super herói bem parecida, no mesmo estilo sem eles terem se encontrado e combinado antes, se cada um tivesse um modelo diferente seria ok mas eles se vestiam praticamente igual só mudando a cor.Os personagens desse anime eram bem carismáticos embora faltavam certas motivações por exemplo o Katana tendo uma ligação com Hajiki,primeiro começo ele querendo destruir o lightning,ai depois virou uma espécie de perseguidor do Hajiki,a logo depois foi atrás da Sayuri.Hajiki começou querendo parar o Katana,depois queria comprar a sua casa antiga,ai depois só foi embora,ai mais para frente do nada queria ir para o espaço.Aiko não sabia o que queria fazer da vida e do nada depois de ter seu mecha socado desistiu de telo.Arashi por algum motivo queria ter um mecha e depois que obteve não utilizou, só utilizou quando necessário, quando a cena pedia.Takumi talvez tenha sido o mais coerente, queria ser um herói, mas percebeu que estava sendo hipócrita e tentou melhorar.Catherine queria um gad,o inicio da historia basicamente girou entorno disso mas depois ela é uma personagem jogada de escanteio.Kogoro era feito só pra ser o chefe, na segunda metade ele foi esquecido.Eu daria 6,5/10 mas no MAL não da para colocar nota quebrada então eu vou dar um 6, não é que esse anime tenha uma história ruim, personagens ruins mas é que seu ritmo é ruim e talvez as coisas que acontecem nesse anime poderiam ter sido feitas de forma melhor, esse anime não me deixou instigado nem ansioso para assistir direto, com certeza faltou algo nesse anime, é um anime que não tem nada que me faça recomenda-lo mas seria um anime interessante para introduzir um iniciante no mundo dos animes. liked Hajiki, imagine if they didn't end up together or she ended up with someone else?Watching this anime I was very afraid that something would happen that would make

Haunted Junction,https://myanimelist.net/anime/646/Haunted_Junction,"[""This is one of the best anime I've seen in a long while. Now for my reviewStory:This is standard school plagued with spirits fare for the most part. The Holy Student Council, of which Haruto, Kazumi and Mutsuki are members of, is tasked with keeping spiritual harmony at their school, and they accomplish this by going after errant ghosts and helping them either move on, or at least stop their foolish behaviours.Although the concept of some ruling body policing otherwordly beings isn't new, this anime pulls it off in a strict school setting, and in just 12 episodes, bonds are formed within the group through...their misadventures that's a plain joy to watch. Haruto, being the unwilling President of the Holy Student Council, is able to summon all 7 school spirits at his choosing (yeah, whole new meaning to having school spirit). Kazumi and Mutsuki are son and daughter of buhddists/shintoists respectively, and all three houses for a triangle which grants Saito High its unusual paranormal phenomenoms.ArtEh, not much to say here, the art is standard for anime, although the sequence of summoning the spirits is fun to watch, reminiscent of Sailor Moon (yes, you enjoyed it when you first saw Sailor Moon and her transformation, admit it) and a  little bit of fan service goes a long way in anime like this, which are usually overlooked in favor of more high profile paranormal police anime (Yusuke, I'm looking at you!)SoundThere aren't really that many special sound effects or much, but a particularly funny and enjoyable part of this anime is the summoning sequence, in which Haruto says &quot;Welcooooome&quot; (yes, in engrish) and every episode except the sixth, which ends in a splendid &quot;OH MY GOD&quot; (also in engrish) for a variety of reasons.Character:It is interesting to see the interactions between Haruto and his fellow Holy Council members, seeing as how he just wishes for a normal life. These interactions add a great deal of depth and conflict to what would otherwise be a happi-go-lucky anime of high school students having fun chasing after various ghostsOverall EnjoymentLately I've been seeing a lot of short anime, like BPS, Maburaho and some others, but this one is the most that struck me, as it has real character development, interesting side stories and a lot more I don't wish to spoil. So hurry up and watch this anime! You'll be glad you did! their misadventures that's a plain joy to watch.

So hurry up and watch this anime! You'll be glad you did!"", ""This is a great comedy show. With an excellent blend of a wacky, lovable cast, a light-hearted entertaining story, school spirits and ghosts you may have come across in other supernatural anime, and Atsuko Nakajima's character designs (Ranma 1/2), this show delivers laughs and keeps you laughing.[STORY 8] Haruto Houjou just wants to be a normal student, but is suckered in being president of the Holy Student Counsel......and he hates it! Now, with his friends Mutsuki and Kazima they patrol Saito High exorcising spirits, keeping the school spirits in check. It's always fun in anime when the hero is relunctant, and Haruto plays this...role to a 10. The episodes are non-linear and each is focused on a different spirit, or Japanese folklore. The premise puts this series into the mind of Urusei Yatsura or Ranma 1/2, as there is oddball wackiness with some lunatic rouge spirit that must be put in it's place.[ART 8] Haunted Junction's visuals are gold. It might take a little bit getting used to the long-legged, oddly shaped eyed characters, but helps so much when it comes to the visual comedy. The school spirits are adorable (except Bones Suzuki and Harou Sato, they annoyed me after awhile), Red Mantle is probably my favorite, and aside from the summon scene, the animation isn't too repetitve for a title this old.[CHARACTER 10] I thought this cast was just going to be a run-of-the-mill trio of teens with powers. Boy, I was off. Haruto is practically driven mad by his task as president and wants to live a mundane, ordinary life. Mutsuki Asahina is the strongest of the three, and as far as I can recall, is one of the few female characters in anime with a vicious shota fetish, and it's funny watching her torment poor Nino every chance she gets. Mutsuki I find very refreshing, because way too often is the male character pervert portrayed to the point where I think it's boring now. You don't get many female perverts in anime and I really appreciate her. Kazumi, the goofball of the trio, is the labeled with the job of getting possessed to properly exorcise the renegade spirits, and has a hopeless crush on the school's Toilet Hanako, a busty spirit who charms the boys. The school spirits themselves are intoxicatingly entertaining in their individual charm. I would've opted for more Mirror Girl and less of the Bones and Sato pair, but I digress. As per comedy anime goes, the cast has to be able to carry it, and the students and spirits of Haunted Junction does to perfection.[OVERALL ENJOYMENT 9] If you find yourself wanting to look through archives to find a great comedy anime from the 90's, Haunted Junction is worth checking out. Lightly molded in the style of Ranma and Gegege no Kitaro, it's of the wall humor mixed with a fantastic cast had me sitting through this. I wish some of the writers of comedy titles of today could do a bit of research with shows like this one and Rumiko Takahashi works and try to recapture the spirit of satire and slapstick that anime like Haunted Junction used to carry so well.PROS: Great cast, solid retro-styled comedy, very easy to get intoCONS: Mildly underused school spirits (Mirror Girl, Giant) role to a 10.

If you\'re a fan of comedy or youkai or maybe both you should definitely add this to your \'plan to watch\' list or even watch it NOW. I\'m not a beginner when it comes to anime so I\'m surprised how actually good this show is.The [PLOT-10] is pretty interesting. I\'ll give it 10 out of 10. Hilarious how they showed Aka Manto or Teke Teke here. You would enjoy this even if you have no clue at all about youkai, seriously!The [ART-5] is a typical \'90\'s anime so it\'s mediocre but that doesn\'t matter at all...thanks to this fantastic plot!The [SOUND-6] is nothing fantastic but still not bad, so...Sometimes main female [CHARACTERS-10] can be such dummies but not when it comes to Asahina. All of girls and boys have their own fantastic personalities and everybody have different tastes so you\'re going to be able to find your own personal favourite.The [ENJOYMENT-10] as you can guess is incredibly high in my opinion but that\'s true. This show is something different than the others. You can laugh, cry and learn something new about youkai at the same time. Nothing more to say, no need to explain. Such a shame how unpopular this anime is in our community.OVERALL - 9 out of 10 thanks to this fantastic plot!The [SOUND-6] is nothing fantastic but still not bad, so...Sometimes main female [CHARACTERS-10] can be such dummies but not when it comes to Asahina.
