Kawa no Hikari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6554/Kawa_no_Hikari,"['Note: This review was written by me both on my blog and in an anime-related forum. So if you see this somewhere else, it\'s actually me trying to make this film more well-known.This last weekend I had the opportunity to watch the tv movie Kawa no Hikari. In a nutshell, the story is about rats that live near a river and must find a new home cause the current one is threatened by a construction site.......if ANYONE is still reading this after that synopsis and is able to deal with watching a show about talking animals in a serious mood, it\'s a WONDERFUL story. I...mean, almost EVERY minute in this movie is relevant to some kind of reflection upon life: what it\'s like to yearn for something, how ""home"" is not a physical place but something that is part of you and no matter how good you feel in another place, you can never forget that; how you should rarely judge a book by its cover (interestingly enough, it is done both ways: there are ppl that may seem the same as you on the outside but you cannot put your trust in them); the fact that when you\'re a parent you\'re willing to do any stunt or sacrifice to assure your chirldren\'s well-being, how being different or weak is not a bad thing if you have the right ppl around you; how we should not feel so afraid of death but more willing to actually live; how you should not quit from pursuing your goals, etc etc. It even has some very poetic lines regarding the title (the light of the river); I think a lot of it (the story) works as a metaphor or analogy of many ideas, and even when most of it is pretty simple, or precisely because it doesn\'t try to feel complex, it works and makes you care as long as you do not have a heart made of stone or require highly realistic stories. With this one, I did some research and it turns out the original author teaches in an University in Tokyo and has a degree in French Literature. IMO I think it shows in the screenplay.I should clarify that I\'m an adult and can be quite skeptical or even cynical regarding some movies; I didn\'t enjoy some of Miyazaki\'s works (probably because in a couple of cases he tries too hard to hamfist his love for nature into his stories) and I\'m not precisely a huge fan of Disney or fables with morals.Having said that, I dunno why this beautiful yet apparently simple story did it for me while others didn\'t. Maybe it was because I felt a connection with Glenn\'s (a character) personality ( that notion of ""knowing that there is more to life than what you\'re doing but you weren\'t born with the right mindset to achieve it""), maybe because sometimes I need a story about nice human values and I want a break from all the sci-fi, seinen, shonen or whatever...maybe it\'s because I like animals...I can\'t pinpoint just one reason.But if I can make at least ONE person to give it a try (while knowing that indeed it\'s aimed at all ages and it doesn\'t feature big action sequences, moe or gore) and LIKE IT (or GASP, even making a thread about it or recommend it to someone), I would honestly feel happy. In the end, I guess I decided to make such a long post about Kawa no Hikari because I feel that if I don\'t, no one will.I don\'t have kids yet...but if I did, this is one of those movies I would want to see with them (specially to make up for the fact of forcing them to see the gundam movie trilogym, the rebuild of eva movies or many more). I don\'t want to make it sound like it\'s the best thing I\'ve ever seen, but I do prefer to overrate it than not mentioning it at all.Thanks in advance to anyone that manages to read through all of my rambling. mean, almost EVERY minute in this movie is relevant to some kind of reflection upon life: what it\'s like to yearn for something, how ""home"" is not a physical place but something that is part of you and no matter how good you feel in another place, you can never forget that; how you should rarely judge a book by its cover (interestingly enough, it is done both ways: there are ppl that may seem the same as you on the outside but you cannot put your trust in them); the fact that when you\'re a parent you\'re willing to do any stunt or sacrifice to assure your chirldren\'s well-being, how being different or weak is not a bad thing if you have the right ppl around you; how we should not feel so afraid of death but more willing to actually live; how you should not quit from pursuing your goals, etc etc. It even has some very poetic lines regarding the title (the light of the river); I think a lot of it (the story) works as a metaphor or analogy of many ideas, and even when most of it is pretty simple, or precisely because it doesn\'t try to feel complex, it works and makes you care as long as you do not have a heart made of stone or require highly realistic stories.

Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Next Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3318/Kimi_ga_Nozomu_Eien__Next_Season,"['I\'m going to try and keep this as short as possible. By now you have already watched the first season and understand what the plot is, but this short series runs the ""What if"" situation, where Haruka gets a second chance at Takayuki. After that, everything just falls into place. For once the predictable feel of the anime is welcomed and fits perfectly. It serves for those audience members who wanted them to get back together.Over all 10/10, still really sad though. ', ""Kimi ga Nozomu Eien ~Next Season~ is an alternate re-telling of the original KimiNozo, or Rumbling Hearts in English. Rather than choosing Mitsuki, like in the original, this 4 episode OVA follows the story where Takeyuki chooses to follow Haruka instead.STORYI can't say I loved the original storyline very much, but at least there were tear jerking moments, and very good drama scenes. In this re-telling, we see hardly exciting &quot;drama&quot;, nor a real story to begin with. Almost like it's dragging out the storyline to last 4 episodes. I wouldn't say more as the storyline is so thin, any mention of anything would probably...remove the need to watch it.I might be semi-biased though, since I supported Mitsuki throughout the original, or at the very least, Akane.ARTAs in the original, the art is quite good.SOUNDThe opening ain't bad. Not the best, but not bad.CHARACTERI see complete makeovers in Takeyuki, who suddenly became an understanding person instead of the moronic loser from the original, Haruka suddenly turned to be strong-willed, and Shinji suddenly became a relationship guru that everyone goes to him for help. Come on, at least keep the personas the way they were!ENJOYMENTI think I enjoyed it more than I'm supposed to, possibly because of the art. But there was too little Daikuji Ayu, meaning far less entertainment than the original.OVERALLIf you are a great fan of the original, or is a Takeyuki X Haruka fan, you might like this one, though it's far from the standard of the original. Too many persona changes, a mediocre storyline, and too litlle Daikuji Ayu. remove the need to watch it.I might be semi-biased though, since I supported Mitsuki throughout the original, or at the very least, Akane.ARTAs in the original, the art is quite good.SOUNDThe opening ain't bad.

Even as a Haruka supporter, I couldn't seem to enjoy this show. It felt rushed, and idiotic, and I didn't like the animation at all - its much different from the first series (not same animators)Somehow they just made it look plain and boring, and changed too much on the characters. The only good thing was Haruka moving on with her life, and she finally got the spotlight to show how strong she are, even if we did see some of it in the original series too. "", 'I  must say I really hated the ending of the original series.. but that is just my selfishness talking.I was happy when I saw this version of the story which has a better end , happy people, caring people, loving people.The original had more dramatic scenes that sometimes made you cry which I is why I appreciate itbut this is very well  made as well.You can tell the difference in these endings because of the feelings expressed in them. It is always good to see such hardships in life because they remind you of what is important in your life and how you...should cherish the people you hold dear.It made me have a better understanding of life and I hope it will help others as well should cherish the people you hold dear.It made me have a better understanding of life and I hope it will help others as well', ""With the time that was taken to conceive and release this short OVA... I was expecting a lot. It was with great disappointment that the spin-off of Kimi ga Nozomu Eien aka Rumbling Hearts turned out to be a poor crafted and rushed piece.The story was kept neatly, and that was its greatest point as spin-off. Taking some scenes from the original series as retrospective, it gave a very consistent view of the whole plot. More than the current relationship between the characters it briefly explained their past and their reasons. The story could be taken from a soap-opera, but unlike most anime it has...a very mature view about it. It's set at a grownup world with grownup problems, from casual sex to the part-time job distress, with some hints to the economic recession of Japan. One can believe that the story can actually happen. But that's also about the original season...The characters kept their strong personalities, even though they were not as explored. The mysterious Haruka (the dumb-cute girl that says &quot;ara&quot; sometimes. And that is the minor main character, if that makes any sense) was better revealed and turned out quite interesting. As for the others, it was weird to see them without depressions, despairs and other mental problems. Even anime characters can be cured with some therapy a spin-off.However... The art was terrible. Not to say it was horrible. I was expecting something cared, detailed, soft... And I see computer generated highlights in a sloppy animation. It had everything one does not want to see in animation, from broken movements to slow mouth motion... The sound was also a disappointment. I don't know what happened to the Voice Actors this time, but they did not do a good job.Overall, a good watch to an appreciator of Rumbling Hearts. The theme is real and the resolution is pretty. Just do not expect too much. a very mature view about it.

If you pay close attention, you will notice that many of the furniture foreground in the rooms look ""photoshoped"" However, the buildings were standard and didn\'t lack quality. Not only were the main characters poorly drawn, they differed greatly from the original studio production.Speaking of the characters, they greatly differed in personality. Mitsuke, Haruka as well as other characters differ greatly in personality ultimately ruining what little chance...the story had of being a sucess.  Narumi and Akane are the only characters who retained their personalities to an extent.The overall storyline diminished any tension and depth to the story, however it did give the viewers what they wanted. Which is about the only plus of the entire OAVOverall, it is not worth your time watching, even with Haruka and Takayume together. With a poor story, characters and graphics i give this anime a 6. the story had of being a sucess.

I mean if it ain’t broke don’t fix it. There is a minor opening sequence but its OK not really worth mentioning. Basically animation is standard.SoundSound is just as standard as...the animation, again nothing has really changed since the older series. The opening music is ok and all the characters sound more or less exactly the same as the older season so once again the sound is on a standard level.StoryObviously we already know the main story of this anime from the previous series but what makes this ova differ is how you get a more in depth look at how things actually went down when Muzuki was in her coma from Takayuki & Mitski’s tormented perspectives, I have to say hearing them each tell things how they saw it gives you an even better dramatic feel to the older series and it also helps you to actually understand Takayuki more.Apart from that the story shows how Takayuki & Muzuki’s fairytale ending has a few struggles to it. Sadly you also get to see Muzuki’s whiny younger sister again trying to hog some of the spotlight but even she is nicely put in her place which nicely helped the ova wrap up that annoying loose end.Although this ova has a different ending than the actual series it actually makes you believe it could have went either way and this fact alone made the story a worth while addition.CharacterBasically this series is all about more character development and this is done really well. Don’t expect a re-hash of what you already saw from season one the characters have grow up and show their maturity which is refreshing and surprising. I was quite impressed at the kind of grown up attitude this ova has and every character just shows a lot more growth. It probably sounds like I’m exaggerating but its true.EnjoymentBelieve me I was VERY sceptical about watching this but im glad I did because it was very enjoyable and it actually made a good series just a little bit better.ValueI’m not sure how this little four episode ova will be distributed but it has reasonably high value especially if you’re a big fan of KGNE.The bottom line is with this alternate ending the creators have really given some fans what they want CHOICE if you did’nt like the first ending you will appreciate this one, either way I’m surprised & impressed.Planet Tyro Rating: First ClassPlanettyro.com the animation, again nothing has really changed since the older series.

I gave it a ten because I was on team Haruka.  I accept this as canon-how it was supposed to go-not a retelling,.How could you pick your lover out of SHEER guilt? Haruka was the one he wanted to be with.  I know that loyalty and romance matter a lot, but desire is the most important force in the range of human emotions.e. If you settle-you'll stray. At least that's how i see it. I doubt tatuyuki could ever be faithful to Mitsuki. "", 'I would say ""spoiler alert"" but because there is no actual direction, climax or conclusion you could read all of this and the viewing experience would be no different.This is an alternate ending to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien or Rumbling Hearts, and it may as well be another reality.The characters are inconsistent to their personalities in the original series. Seeing Takayuki in a blissful state of complete happiness with Haruka was perplexing to watch, because:a.) When has Takayuki ever been happy? Who is this character? What?b.) Stop being so happyc.) It is as if Mitsuki never happened (...I\'m sure HarukaxTakayuki fans will dig it)Compared...to the first series, \'Next Season\' is so much less intense and angsty. Which unfortunately makes it a little dull... a lot dull. Every time something could go wrong, it doesn\'t. Every time a character has complexities (I\'m speaking on behalf of you, Mitsuki and Akane), their issues are carefully brushed into a corner to avoid the emotional confrontation that they perceive a frail Haruka to be incapable of understanding. The whole arrangement is kind of disconcerting, sort of like having hidden ingredients in your meal and wanting to know what they are but you never find out.Overall I would describe this as ""sweet"". If you found yourself frustrated by the heavy emotionality and display of raw human emotion found in the original take, this is perfect for you. to the first series, \'Next Season\' is so much less intense and angsty.

Spoiler warning should be obvious.]Where do I even begin with Rumbling Hearts? I originally found this series by pressing random on a new anime site, it led me to Akane Maniax, a spin off of the series Rumbling Hearts, it’s where I began the journey. I was perplexed by who the characters were and how familiar everyone was but still found enjoyment, the comedy especially in the first half was different from modern generic comedy. After finishing Akane Maniax I searched in on MAL to...find how low it was ranked and to my surprise it was below a 6, a 5.73. I then found out that Akane Maniax was a spin off of Rumbling Hearts and the pieces started to click.Rumbling Hearts is one of the more thought provoking romance dramas out there. The twists mainly episode 2 floored me and everything changed after that. Characters went from happy high school students to a time skip through the pain of adulthood, the tone shifted to a melodramatic state. This is the moment where I messed up BIG time. Somehow after finishing episode 2 of Rumbling Hearts, by pure stupidity and beyond any logical comprehension I started watching the final 2 episodes of the final season or Haruka’s route in the Visual Novel. The fact that I didn’t even comprehend that I skipped so damn much in the first place and to also watch not just one but the final 2 episodes is insane.The next day I went back to season 1 without noticing I skipped to the final season and started watch episode 5. Meaning I went from a spin off Akane Maniax, then the first 2 episodes of the main series Rumbling Hearts, onto the final 2 episodes of the Haruka Route, to end up in the middle of the first season very confused. After much confusion I figured out my terrible mistakes to a certain extent and started back at episode 3. I adore what the writer did with Mitsuki, having the audience anguish over the situation and hoping that the MC would distinguish his feelings before he loses both of them. The ending surprised me when it ended on the Mitsuki Route ending leaving the first season on a very melancholic note.Finally finishing in the right order, I completed the spin off series Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Ayu Mayu Gekijou, a short spin off of Rumbling Hearts following around the side characters, Ayu(tsundere,) and Mayu(dojikko,) while wacky stuff occurs. Not very good as each episode felt weaker than the last. Then Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: Gundam Parody, the final Rumbling Hearts spin off. This time in form of a 2 minute extra short, non-subbed, Gundam parody. Aged alright animation wise but pretty weak for someone who hasn't seen what it’s parodying.Ultimately I got back to the final season, Haruka’s Route! This is the true ending and at first I was puzzled because the ending of the first season didn’t align with the events that occurred earlier on. But this is a alternate path, a different route in a Visual Novel, and everything felt right.RATINGS [Out of 10]:STORY: 8ART: 7SOUND: 7CHARACTERS: 9ENJOYMENT: 8OVERALL: 7I recommend the Rumbling Hearts series to those who relish in thought over intense scenarios of melodramatic romance.

"Jashin-chan Dropkick ""Seikimatsu-hen""",https://myanimelist.net/anime/55237/Jashin-chan_Dropkick_Seikimatsu-hen,"[""This special is pretty good. It's basically a normal municipality-promoting episode of Jashin-chan, plus a Fist of the North Star parody. The animation is a bit worse than that of X (as is directly pointed out by Jashin-chan at the start of the episode), but the art direction is still attractive. It looks worse than the show, but it's not enough of a downgrade to make the special bad. We get two new songs for the opening and ending, both of which are good, but lack proper visuals.We get plenty of Jashin-chan’s typical fourth wall breaking humor, with some references to the Furano situation thrown...in. If you're unaware, a few episodes of X raised funds by advertising municipalities, the idea being that fans might send them money through the hometown tax system. One of these cities, Furano, refused to hand over the money they'd agreed upon (after their episode had already aired), claiming its content was unacceptable. The City Council cited a joke about selling organs, confirming that they have the weakest sensibilities on the planet. It was a real shitty move, and it's nice to see the staff poking fun at it.The special follows a meandering travel plot, where Jashin-chan goes on a wacky adventure, meeting every character in the process. This time the city being promoted is Takamori, and they push the local specialties less than they did in previous promotional episodes. It's still not compelling on its own, but provides ample opportunity for entertaining character interactions. If you're still here after three seasons, that should be enough. Moderate your expectations if the plot synopsis misled you into thinking this was an alternate timeline.This is as much a status update as a new episode. The dialogue at the end implies we’re getting another season, I just hope the crowdfunding makes enough money that they can chill on the hometown tax episodes. I would sell my organs if it meant getting less of those.Watch this special. And if you're a true Jashin-chaner, don't send your taxes to Furano. in.

Inazuma Eleven: Orion no Kokuin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38235/Inazuma_Eleven__Orion_no_Kokuin,"['It hurts, as a big Inazuma Eleven fan who watched the franchise ever since the first season of Inazuma Eleven was still airing, to give such a low rating for an Inazuma Eleven franchise. But... here we are.I waited until I watched every episode of this to know for sure whether or not I would be certain of my decision, and having watched all 49 episodes I can say this with no regret: I am really disappointed with what Orion has become.I also make a handful of references to the other installments of Inazuma Eleven in this review to try and emphasize my point.Story (3/10)...- All right, so those watching Orion will directly notice several things. Orion takes inspiration from the other Inazuma Eleven seasons, every one of them if you want to analyze every little frame, and this was a nice idea. It would serve as a little bit of an easter egg for the faithful fans who have watched every episode of every season where we could go ""Ah, that came from Galaxy, and that one came from the Aliea Academy arc!""... but the execution of everything is horrid, there is no other way to describe it. By trying too hard to reference everything, Orion ends up in this weird space where it cannot stand out from the others. Sure there are only so few plot ideas they could have gone for with what is effectively Inazuma Eleven\'s eighth arc, but it really feels very weak. Orion also suffers from the same pacing problem that Ares had, but then cranked up to an eleven (more on that in the Enjoyment part of this review). In short, the story tried to focus on one specific plot point but it ended up becoming a rushed mess that, honestly, was quite all over the place.Art (4/10) - With a new franchise come new techniques and new animation techniques to, well... animate the techniques. The animation of all the new techniques introduced in Orion (and there are a lot of them!) has certainly improved, but none barring one (maybe two) of these were techniques that left me with a spark and in awe.Orion also does this thing where they have goal celebrations from the characters of the main team, especially in the first half of Orion. I know that there are goal celebrations in the other installments of Inazuma Eleven, but these somehow feel... choppy and kind of awkward. I am not that big of a fan of these if that was not obvious.Sound (6/10) - The soundtracks of Inazuma Eleven has always been pretty good, and even though I feel like it has gone down with Ares and Orion, they\'re still pretty decent. I will also admit that I am a pretty big fan of the third ED of Orion and more than its OP, which is something I can\'t say I am since Maji Bomber all the way back in the original Inazuma Eleven\'s third season.Character (2/10) - Oh boy... I could write this whole review just about the characters in Orion, but... let\'s try and just get to the point. The Inazuma Japan from the original Inazuma Eleven had sixteen members at any given time. The Inazuma Japan from Galaxy had thirteen members at most. Orion\'s Inazuma Japan starts out with nineteen members right from the first episode, which is a bigger problem than most people might realize. The characters themselves are perfectly fine, that\'s not the issue. What is the issue is that there is no way for us to bond with any of them as there is no feasible way for Orion to properly showcase any character growth whatsoever (except if you are one of the main characters).The worst part of all this is that they were doing okay for the first half of Orion, because once it got to the world tournament they ended up ADDING characters to the main team. Sure we also lost some characters along the way, but we ended with a surplus of characters. And that would have been okay if those new additions got the respect they deserved, but the moment that they had their place in the spotlight they were sidelined almost immediately after. And that, to me, is sadder than if they had not been brought on to the team to begin with...Enjoyment (1/10) - Let\'s just get this out of the way early: at some point, I ended up watching Orion not because I enjoyed it or because I wanted to know what would happen next, but to find out how they would try and salvage what was left to salvage.On a very basic level, I could enjoy it when new techniques were shown. But the Inazuma Eleven fan inside of me knows that I was disappointed throughout the entire run of it. And it all can be concluded by one word: pacing. The pacing of Orion is, as much as it hurts me to say this about an Inazuma Eleven installment, horrible. There is almost no scene shown where characters are training their new techniques in the later episodes, making it seem like they ""learned the technique out of nowhere"" when they use them in the match. There is very minimal interactions going on between the characters to help us understand how their dynamic is with other characters that we do not know of already (I mean, Endou interacted with Kidou, sure, but we have seen Endou interact with Kidou all the time. Show him interacting with someone like Haizaki who he hasn\'t interacted with before). In addition, there was also very minimal downtime in between each match (downtime which could have been used to show character development or have them train a new technique together or something).And the matches, ESPECIALLY the latter half of Orion, ends up being the two teams throwing around hissatsus left, right and center. Which, to be fair, I know is what Inazuma Eleven\'s matches is supposed to be about, but thanks to the lack of training scenes shown it seems like they are pulling those hissatsus out of thin air. I would be okay if that would be for the big final technique or whatever, but it happened almost all the time.It says a lot about how disappointing this was when I enjoyed the start of Orion (say... the first 19 episodes) more than I did everything that followed. And, yes, I did rewatch the start of Orion again to confirm this.Overall (3/10) - A really neat story idea all in all with a lot of potential, but with very poor execution and finishing which ended up ruining all of that. After having finished watching Orion, I really wish they just stopped with Inazuma Eleven after Galaxy ended. Maybe my hopes and expectations were too high and/or unrealistic for Orion, but the fact remains that I am disappointed with the final result. - All right, so those watching Orion will directly notice several things. Orion takes inspiration from the other Inazuma Eleven seasons, every one of them if you want to analyze every little frame, and this was a nice idea. It would serve as a little bit of an easter egg for the faithful fans who have watched every episode of every season where we could go ""Ah, that came from Galaxy, and that one came from the Aliea Academy arc!""... but the execution of everything is horrid, there is no other way to describe it. By trying too hard to reference everything, Orion ends up in this weird space where it cannot stand out from the others. Sure there are only so few plot ideas they could have gone for with what is effectively Inazuma Eleven\'s eighth arc, but it really feels very weak. Orion also suffers from the same pacing problem that Ares had, but then cranked up to an eleven (more on that in the Enjoyment part of this review). In short, the story tried to focus on one specific plot point but it ended up becoming a rushed mess that, honestly, was quite all over the place.Art (4/10) - With a new franchise come new techniques and new animation techniques to, well... animate the techniques.

The story was incredibly rushed thanks to it's dreadful pacing. The writing was shallow at best, most of the new characters sucked and the visuals were underwhelming .It had some good moments but those moments didn't save the anime from being painfully disappointing.Before Inazuma Eleven Ares finished airing OLM announced a squeal for it called Inazuma Eleven Orion. Like with many Inazuma Eleven fans I was super excited for it as I thought Orion would be the tasteful main course that would overshadow its amateur hour starter that was Ares. I thought...this series would be amazing. So, I watch it and I wish I haven't.I just going to say this right now Inazuma Eleven Orion is not only the worst entry of the series but is also one of the worst animes I have ever watched in a long while. It's like the staff took everything that was wrong with Ares and managed to crank it up to 11.One of the main problems you will notice right out of the gate is its fan-fiction nature when it comes to it's writing. This was a massive problem in Ares that ultimately plagued it but Orion takes it to the next level to a point where became unbearable. The writing in Orion feels like it was written by a clumsy student who had no creativity and passion. The same student thought it was a brilliant idea to add dark themes and topics on a franchise that rarely had dark themes and topics in it. Ladies and Gentleman that's the plot of Inauma Eleven Orion in a nutshell. It's vapid, boring, hollow, ham-fisted and most importantly tedious to watch.As for the Orion Foundation plot itself it was hot garbage. Not only it was terribly written it's also incredibly generic. This plot is only interesting if haven't seen an organisation plot in your life. It is the most generic and stock evil organisation plot imaginable and it's not even handled well. This generic written plot was only made worse by the inclusion of politics in the second half.I wish I was making this up. The show had the nerves to throw in politics in a series that was meant for kids. This wouldn't been a problem if the politics stuff was foreshadowed in Ares but nope it popped out of nowhere just like the rest of the so called plot twists in this show. With the inclusion of politics the tone, pacing even dialogue go to shit as the devolved into this uninspired and badly written political, sports, spy series that contradicts everything that this franchise has stood for since 2008.It doesn't help that the main villain of the show Irina Girikanan is so one dimensional. She is evil for the sake of being evil. She has no motivation whatsoever other than to use children from various countries to take over the world with her contrived Orion Foundation plan.Now if you thought the pacing in Ares was bad than guess what the pacing in Orion is somehow even worse. For a long semi-tournament arc we don't see the characters actually train let along bond with each other. Sure the show has some downtime moments but it's not the type of downtime that you expect. It uses its downtime to focus on the Orion Foundation plot instead of developing its characters through training and bonding.The lack and character bonding really hurts the pacing as well the characterisation because the show would rather focus on it's contrived written Orion Foundation plot which was very rushed instead having a couple of episodes where the characters are just getting along with each other. Inazuma Japan never felt like a actual team. Sure they play in matches with each other, and they attend coach meetings but the majority of the characters in Inazuma Japan have little to no chemistry with each other.When Endou interacts to Gouenji or Kazemaru it feels natural because they have been good friends and teammates for a long time but when he interacts to any of the new characters it felt so forced and unnatural especially when some of the new characters like Kira, Hazaiki and Hiura never had a single sentence with each other. That's not all because there's hardly any training all of the hissatsu that the characters pull off for the first time felt like asspulls.The biggest problem with Orion's plot by far is the over-reliance of plot twists. Not only they were heavily abused but the majority of them were just stupid. Don't get me started with the final plot twist that happened in the final 3 episodes.I won't mention it here due to heavy spoilers but I want you to imagine the worst type of plot twist. The type of plot twist that completely betrays everything that the show previously set up. The type of plot twist that rips off another series plot twists in the different continuity.That's the final plot twist in Inazuma Eleven Orion in a nutshell. It's so bad, so tasteless it made me want me to slam my head on a wall for half an hour.Oh the characters aren't much better at all. I even go as far that the characters were way worst than the god awful plot.Inazuma Japan has over 20 characters yet almost all of them aren't develop for shit. Prime examples include Kira, Gounji, Nishikage, Hiura, Iwato, Mansaku, Norika Sakanoue and Kozoumaru. They don't do anything noteworthy in the plot and they have no character development whatsoever. Heck some of the members are literately there just for memes I wish I was joking...The OG crew are somehow even worse. All of the character development and personality quirks have been thrown out the window and what you left with are empty shells of characters we grown to love.Fudou went from being a likeable jerk with a heart of gold to an annoying edgelord who just exist for bench memes.Hiroto went from being a well written badass to a worthless background character with no personality.Kazemaru (My favourite OG character) went from being a competitive and loyal friend to Endou to a boring and hollow background character.The biggest insult of them all was Endou (My second favourite character). Endou went from being a likeable, funny, well written and developed character to a infuriating, overpowered Gary Sue with no personality and development.The only two OG characters that still had their personality quirks from the original series is Kidou and Goeunji and yet they were victim of the shows plot contrivances where they were shafted in favour of Ichihoshi who is garbage.Ichihoshi is not a character. He's a husk. A husk that is so contrived and unoriginal . He's backstory is a complete ripoff off of Fubiki with his tragic backstory. He even go as for antagonistic the OG characters by either getting them injured in a match or kicked them out of the team with some evil scheme. All of this happens because Ichihoshi couldn't control himself and he had to take out his frustration towards others.I honestly cannot for the life of me stand characters that behave like douche-bags just because they love ones have died. I understand losing your loved ones is tragic but there's no reason to take it out on others.By the time this Fubiki knockoff opens up to the team he becomes a total plot device where the only two things that he does is to be loyal to Asuto and be the tool for the Orion in the second half.Why Inazuma Eleven Orion why did you have to ruin one of the best written characters in Ares Haizaki. In Ares he had a well written backstory that made him more then just another typical soccer player. He was fighting through the Ares system as a act of revenge due to what happened to his childhood friend Akane. It was an amazing subplot that had a strong payoff.So what did the writers do to him in Orion? Well you take all of his character development, threw it out the window and turn him into the second coming of Shadow the Edgehog.The only good character in Orion is Nosaka. I really liked his character development in Orion. He went from being a distance individual who barely interacts to anyone to a badass tactics captain who is able to lead Inazuma Japan as the secondary captain.Finally we Asuto who is without a question the worst character in the entire show. Not only he was one dimensional as hell but he was also downright infuriating to watch.He's basically Tenma without the charm and quality that made him a great character in the first place. Sure Tenma did some dumb things throughout the GO saga but he's character development across the series as well his personality and interactions make up his shortcomings. Asuto has none of that. He is just a soulless, annoying, inpet, vapid, and exasperating little dipshit from beginning to end. Let's not forget that he's a total numskull. He aggressively defends Ichihoshi even though everyone in the team is against him due to his nasty actions that he committed to the team. One of those actions almost had a teammate (Endou) killed and yet this asswipe still has the nerves to value him as a teammate.Get the hell outta here with your contrived bullshit.The final nail in the coffin for this pathetic excuse of a protagonist is that he has no character development at all. From episode 1 of Ares to episode 49 of Orion he's still the same static character that we all know and hate.There's bad characterisation and there's not giving a damm and Asuto is down the ladder leading towards the rabbit hole. That's why I cannot stand this dipshit of a character and he's the main reason why I hate Inazuma Eleven Orion so much. If it wasn't for this sack of shit I wouldn't have hated this show so much.It would still be a massive disappointment due to it's character shafting and terrible plot but I wouldn't have been so mad at it but because of Asuto annoying presence I went from mildly disliking Orion to utterly despising it.Curse you Asuto you good for nothing dipshit.So how about the supporting characters? Aren't they any good? No.They are just as bad as the main team.The teams that Inazuma Japan face-off have no personality as they were full blown plot devices especially the Perfect Spark and Ole de Samba teams.Now let's talk about this show technical aspects Let's be real honest with our self's.This show came out in 2018-2019 and yet the show looks it was made over a decade and a half ago mainly due to the because of the terrible production values. The animation if you can call it animation at times was terrible. It had a lot choppy animation, heavily relayed on stock footage which became jarring fast and match choreography was clunky.The only decent thing about the visuals is the art and even then it's inconsistent as character models would go off model.The soundtrack is just as lame as the plot. The old tracks while good lost a lot of charm thanks to how overused they were. As for the new tracks they were absolutely terrible. Not only they don't fit the tone of the show at all but the tracks seem to mindlessly drown in the background with no melody to it.To Orion's credit the opening themes were catchy and memorable tho I cannot say the same thing for the ending themes as they were dull.All of these problems ties up to the biggest problem with not only Orion but this alternative timeless as a whole the lack of creativity and passion.When I first watched Orion I thought the series would go back it's classic routes that we all know and love but just after watching the first quarter of Orion I started to notice that there was a little to no passion towards this series for example almost all of the matches themselves were a void of life and excitement. The production values for the matches didn't help it at all and the matches feel like a vehicle for the shows pathetic and poorly written drama.What makes it even worse is how hamfisted the plot is. The series tried to tackle serious themes and topics such as child abuse, political control, grief, acceptance but not only they were poorly executed due to poor writing and direction but it also has the nerve to shot out how brilliant and complex it is when it's actually not.If, you don't know how handle and execute than don't put them in the show. It's makes your series more vapid and dumb than it already is.Even with my bias love with this franchise I still detest Inazuma Eleven Orion with a burning passion. It's an insufferable garbage fire that completely contradicts everything that's this franchise stood for. It's like this show was done by 25 Inazuma Eleven fanboys who had no communication with one another.As a result the plot, pacing, themes, dialogue, characters, visuals and music is broken. Not even Nosaka can save this pile of waste.Orion is not only the worst anime I have seen in 2019 (worst than Fairy Gone, Wise Man's Grandchild Index S3 and Arifureta) but also one of the worst animes I have ever watched from this decade. It's a boring, insulting, unfocused, lifeless, miserable and broken mess of an anime that has no passion and soul.I feel so betrayed. this series would be amazing. So, I watch it and I wish I haven't.I just going to say this right now Inazuma Eleven Orion is not only the worst entry of the series but is also one of the worst animes I have ever watched in a long while.

I'm reviewing this show as a 20-year old dude who has been watching Inazuma Eleven for 8 years.The story is much better; there is the usual scary organization behind the scenes that uses middle schoolers to take over the world or something. However, the team's response is finally worthwhile. Kidou gives no shits about the wholesome soccer spirit and actually fights back. Episode 6 in particular was so enjoyable because finally they decided to beat up their...enemies instead of the other way around. It was really funny to see the trope being reversed, and I laughed so hard in that episodeI also really like the progression of power in Orion so far. Goenji is as hype as I wanted, and his plays removed the stale taste from Ares. It's also great that Inazuma Japan is actually evenly matched with the other Asian teams, and they have to rely on beating the other teams' gimmicks rather than just getting powerups through the course of the match. I'm glad that they stopped the whole V2, V3, G2, G3 system and simply use hissatsu tactics, shoots and goalie moves. Endou's power up is great too, and doesn't feel forced. The team already has incredibly strong hissatsus like The Explosion, Perfect Penguins, so they can contend with the Asian teams while still developing even stronger ones that are world-level instead of Asia level.Art is really good at times and acceptable most of the time. Kinda sad that it sometimes isn't as pretty. Music is awesome and gets me hyped.Characters look good for now. Ichihoshi definitely will get a character development arc soon, and Kidou as usual is the best character of the series. Kidou, Gouenji, and Endou easily made Orion better than Ares, but so far Endou hasn't had as much impact as Kidou, Haizaki, Hiroto, and Gouenji. I'm looking forward to Nosaka coming back as he was the best character of Ares.Overall I'm giving it a 9 because the show has broken some old annoying tropes, has paced itself well, and has a solid plot progression. enemies instead of the other way around.

If planning to watch one, watch the previous season first."", ""(Might include spoilers)So as a Inazuma Eleven fan this really just hurts, that I have to write a review because this season of Inazuma Eleven has gone downhill so much from its previous season which also wasn't the best(I'm talking about Inazuma Eleven Ares no tenbin) and because I am such a Inazuma Eleven fan I tried to enjoy this I really did but it is just not it. Overall the animation is just really bad and the development of the story is just really rushed. The only small pluspoints I can give this new season is it use of old characters although they don't...seem to develop like they used to in the first season and the sound is alright the soundtracks are really fun and entertaining but the rest is just really bad sometimes there is not even a sound if the ball is passed. Anyway lets get to it.Story | 5/10: To me the story feels really forced because they are using the same Inazuma Eleven formula again, there is a team they're the underdogs and there is a traitor within the team. And because of the same formula from the first season it really has gotten predictable. And because of it being so predicatble they tried to change it by adding a company known as the Orion Foundation just as an excuse to get rid of some characters by making a person that works for the Orion Foundation participate in a match and wound a player my for example throwing spikes on the ground like literally spikes (No the referees nor anybody else exept the players notice this). And because of this absurd way of getting rid of characters this story really is bad.Art/Animation | 3/10: I already talked about this a little but the animation feels really and I mean really sluggish, Also there is no signs in improving, it just looks like they threw their whole budget into the game (that got delayed multiple times already) and because of that the animation is just straight up bad, if you look at the art/animation of Inazuma Eleven Go, Inazuma Eleven Go Chrono Stones and Inazuma Eleven Go Galaxy the animation is just really bad. Though the animation is bad the art is al right I like the way they look more grown up, the old series made them look like they were kids which they are but I mean they looked like theyre from Primary school. Anyway the animation can only improve and the art can get better in its own way.Sound | 5/10: I have mixed feelings about the sound, the OST's are good, they are reusing some of my favorite tracks from the previous seasons and the new ones are also likeable, but that is not the problem the problem with the sound lies within the sound effects. They are just so bad sometimes even the creators give op by not including the sound of a shot when the ball has been shot and  that really is a waste because some great voice actors are working on this (Endou has same voice actor as Naruto Uzumaik Ichinose Kazuya has the same voice actor as Eren Jeager). But same as with the animation it can only get better!Character | 7/10: I gotta say the characters are the best part of this season, lets start with the good part once; the base of the characters is there some of my all time favorite characters are in there, and I love seeing them mix in with the new characters who are likeable too, but the problem with the characters is that because there are this many characters some characters get no development or the development feels forced, they solved this problem in the first season and in the Go season, but in this season they really didn't put any work in this and its a shame because again the characters are so likeable but because they can't develop naturally really hurts.Enjoyment | 4/10: As I mentioned already I tried my hardes enjoying this but it is just not good I was so hyped up when I saw that there was going to be more Inazuma Eleven action because Inazuma Eleven Ares no Tenbin was not too bad, they had some of problems but not as much as this anime has so far, its just really unsatisftying to see one of my favorite shows I grew up with end up being so bad. But once again they can only get better from here on.Overall | 5/10: so I rate this anima a 5/10 just because it is the sequel of a great anime if this was a first season I would have given it even less. It really hurts inside me that I have to give it this low rating and I wasn't too strict while rating it because it is the sequel of the show I grew up with but I just can't give it higher then a 5 sorry people who are enjoying this and if you are good for you I sincerely hope you will keep enjoying it but this show just is not what I was hoping it was.well then that was a lot of work but I guess my unsatisfying feeling is gone a little, see you around people! seem to develop like they used to in the first season and the sound is alright the soundtracks are really fun and entertaining but the rest is just really bad sometimes there is not even a sound if the ball is passed.

You want a shit ton of strikers for no reason? You want 3 goal keepers? Unlikeable characters? cough cough Goujin or characters with absolutely no personality? Like many the only reason I watched this was to see my favourite OG characters in action like the Fubuki brothers which I was most excited for but my excitement quickly faded. Fubuki barely had any screen time to begin with like all the other characters since there was simply to many but then they had to get him injured and become...some spy for no fucking reason. Then they added Atsuya to the team who also got barely any screen time you could write him out the show and nothing would of changed that's how pointless most of the characters were.I do not recommended watching this most characters get shafted after a like a episode. some spy for no fucking reason.

No one is too minor in the team, everybody gets decent screen time, and the animations are way superior than they used to be. The matches are not too long nor too short and the best part of the show being Nosaka. Not gonna spoil much but how he is in control of the entire team during match and outside of match as if he knows almost everything and haizaki and Kira Hiroto give the show sufficient amount of comedy. Its a masterpiece. On top of that you can't...predict what's gonna happen next its so exciting to watch. And as many people want in an anime we say major character development and see backstory as season progresses of Ichihoshi. predict what's gonna happen next its so exciting to watch.

At this point, they seemed to stop trying. The story basically repeated events that happened in the original FFI arc; the difference was that they removed all the emotional weight. The characters didn't seem to grow as people. Certain plot lines and acts made no sense. Interesting ideas were wasted and the finale was a complete joke.What was sadder was that it started out pretty strong. There was something corrupt in the soccer world, something that may bring up mature and thought...provoking topics. Unfortunately, they didn't run with that and what I got was shallow recycled plot lines. They nearly got the antagonist right, but they did certain unnecessary things. Not even the OG cast could save the show.I tried my best to watch Orion with an open mind. There were things I found enjoyable. The artwork and OST were great, and the preliminaries were my favorite.

It\'s not perfect, but it is most certainly quality.  Watching the Reloaded special episode (23 in Orion), it was awesome to see some of the old strange designs ironed out for past characters.  Unlike the original, the pacing of the story has ramped but not because the over arching storyline was complicated, but rather poor pacing of character growth.  Like the original series, lots of characters don\'t get much development (ie. Handa, Shourin), but this...is especially so given the shorter run time for this new series.  Many characters just don\'t seem to belong or should be where they are given the pacing and lack of character development.  I will go through it in some detail, but that will be past the spoiler warning below.  The overarching story is way more believable than the last few story lines we had in recent Inazuma Eleven.  It\'s 5th Sector, but more grounded.  That said this is a show predominantly for young children so it\'s not the most crazy story line ever.  Overall, I would say the greatest appeal of the show is in the new characters with the aftertaste of the classic Eleven characters.  Though the true villain was honestly different, most that led to that was less than ideal.  I believe the show would\'ve done much better if it invested more character development (Haizaki & Hoshinari) into the stories they did start rather than ending them abruptly and frequently.tl;dr: Cool new art style and cool animations with cool new characters and returning characters! But be warned, they are bogged down by not-so-cool new characters. Also this is an alternative timeline pre-Alien Academy, post-Zeus.----SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT----Inakuni Goods:In Aries, Inakuni works very well as a close, tight-knit group of friends, but given the pacing most don\'t get much time to develop individually.  Those that did had varying results.  Unexpectedly, Iwato, the new Kabeyama, is one of the more interesting characters from Inakuni.  He has multiple gag partners and even teams up with Aphrodi and Hiroto.  Michinari also had a great moment with Endou and I really wished they continued that instead of ""Junk Food Funny Time with Goujin"" in Orion.  Finally we have Umihara, whose design I love very much.  She had some interesting internal conflicts, but none were given much time to develop.  There have been multiple times where her character development starts, but the plot had to move forward before we could get to see a well paced progression both in Aries and Orion.These characters aren\'t from Inakuni but I figured this would be the best place to mention.  Haizaki Ryouhei and Nosaka Yuuma (and by extension Nishikage) are the de facto main treat of this new series.  They brought an interesting storyline that carried all of Aries and most into Orion.tl;dr: Overall, I think there are a few decent new characters additions, but most were discarded in Orion and for some reason those that shouldn\'t have were. (Umihara, you should\'ve came back earlier...)Inakuni Bads:Goujin Testsunosuke is funny(?) I suppose, but he is really just a punching-bag gag character that is in debt.  The cost of keeping this guy in the story was to have lackluster team. He shares the forward position with 5 other characters that are way more relevant and interesting than him.  I would\'ve preferred if he was benched like Megane in the original series.  Similarly, I honestly don\'t understand why Mansaku and Hiura are on the team.  Especially Mansaku, who really hasn\'t done anything since learning his first hissatsu.  For the most part, these Inakuni members don\'t truly interact with anyone but themselves.  However, these members pale in comparison to these two characters:Inamori Asuto is just a copy-pasted version of Endou, with the added plot relevant detail that may or may not resemble Luke Skywalker.  The problem with his character is simply the fact that he has little character growth and what growth he could have gotten is either non existent (Aries) or is swept under the rug (Orion).  The writers demand that he must get screen time, but there really isn\'t much to write about for him.  The more interesting details about his character, like how life was back at Inakuni or what he thought about his fake father is treated too lightly.  This would not be that much of a concern if he was a supporting character like everyone else from Inakuni.  The biggest deal breaker for me is the fact that all his lines are literally things that Endou would\'ve said, who now has to shut up and just stare.  This simple fact makes it pains me.  This worked in GO and Chrono Stone because Endou had justifiable reasons to take a backseat and let the children pave their own path, but here it feels more like Endou isn\'t being the captain he truly is and his spirit was programmed into a talking robot.Mikado Anna is a terrible character.  Her role in Aries was disgusting to watch and she has no purpose in Orion.  Managers of Inazuma Eleven have been declining in quality since the original series and Anna takes the cake.  The three managers from the original series all had plot related relevance to varying degrees.  In GO, they were around but their character brought liveliness to the commentary.  Ootani Tsukushi (who really does look like a background character) serves the bare-bone requirements.  Anna, however, takes being dislikable (like Natsumi initially) to incomprehensible.  Her conflict like the Inakuni members doesn\'t even go anywhere.  Honestly, it kind of feels like they sort of forgot about it because they were to busy thinking about winning the next match.  Instead of redeeming or doing something cool for the team (like Natsumi) she proceeds to care about the enemy??  Her obsession over Nosaka is simply put really irritating to watch.  All managers of the past have showed team spirit and comradery in all past series.  Anna lacks this.  She simply dos her dues and moves on to more loftier concerns about Nosaka, an enemy villain at the time, rather that those suffering on her own team.  He nosiness in Nosaka\'s business and stalker behavior is unlikable.  If they wanted to add this romantic plot they should\'ve have done it in Orion, which did not happen as Nosaka straight up rejected her at the end of Aries.  It is such a waste of a nicely designed character.tl;dr: Less than stellar character development and pointless character developments made moot.Return of the Originals:To be honest, I think they did pretty well in terms of the balance between screen time for the old and new characters.  Kidou was effectively utilized in Aries and smoothly exited in Orion.  His role is similar to Gouenji in the original season 3.  I don\'t know how much better they could\'ve handled Gouenji, but they most certainly didn\'t have to cut Endou that much.  Endou is basically a shell of his former self given how much screen time he had in the original.  As I mentioned before,  Inamori has basically poached his character (episode 44).  Times when it should have been Endou to pull the team together, it was Inamori doing the mood-making.  It feels especially disingenuous when he runs off with his ""dad"" in Orion.  Endou had the same situation with Daisuke in the original and considering the pacing of the show, Endou running off to spend quality time would have been way more justifiable. There are also some nice new character developments for (not dead) Kira Hiroto and (not Gran) Kiyama Tatsuya.  It is simultaneously fan-service and actual plot at the same time.  The Fubuki twins are the same, but on a much smaller scale.  Saginuma was pretty much shafted.  It was great to see one of the coolest characters there, but he really just suffered most of the way through and left to dry.tl;dr: Overall, I\'m pretty satisfied with how they handled the OG characters, but Endou. is especially so given the shorter run time for this new series.

I\'m gonna give my most honest review of this series, plz excuse for my poor english.Overall: it is just disappointing, only watching this show because of nostalgia. Here is the reason.Plot: 1/10This series turns from football to psychological warfare, instead of kicking football, people trying to hurt each other on the field in almost, if not every matches. Most importantly, the show aint focusing on the football match. The most confusing thing is they take out gouenji in the first match.....first match!...The show hypes him up with his hissatsu ""last resort"", one of the stongest hissatsu in this show and then made him injured right away.Chemistry between characters: 1/10i have to say the inazuma japan team doesn\'t even look like a team. In previous inazuma eleven series, when endou is the mc, there are a strong bond between character and the reason behind is that everyone respect their captain endou and as a mc he cheers up his teammates, bring this team tgt and solve problems. On the other hand....this series has no chemistry as a team, more like a team with small little groups combined, for example Asuto, Haizaki and Nosaka always side chatting and there are no team conversation at all. Every group of them are up to something that the whole team doesnt know about.Character: 5/10Asuto is a disappointing mc of this series. This is just personal opinion. He has potential to be a better character if he is less annoy and not just shout things like "" this is wrong"" or be more practical and acts less childish...Soundtrack: 10/10The ost is always the best for the inazuma eleven series and this might be the only good thing of this show.Animation: 5/10Dont know if it is low budget or what, the animation is inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes bad, but overall it is alright.Design of character: .....3/10Characters from the other teams...they all have poor design, not all but most of it, but the plot doesnt put much attention on most of them anyways so whatever. For example the australian team, they dont even look like australian, same goes for other team, they are so random with a weird design.  You will know what i mean when you watch the show, just looks like ep 32 stops at 9:47,  the usa team there is a guy who looks like a snake and a guy who looks like a lion and their goal keeper looks like he comes from a science fiction movie (That ep is alright tho, one of the few that they are actually playing football and not hurting each other)Hissatsu:Many people likes inazuma eleven because of the hissasu shot, like the fire tornado. I would say the hissatsu shot in this show are pretty good, at least some of it, but not so good for endou tho The show hypes him up with his hissatsu ""last resort"", one of the stongest hissatsu in this show and then made him injured right away.Chemistry between characters: 1/10i have to say the inazuma japan team doesn\'t even look like a team. In previous inazuma eleven series, when endou is the mc, there are a strong bond between character and the reason behind is that everyone respect their captain endou and as a mc he cheers up his teammates, bring this team tgt and solve problems.

After watching the Galaxy series I felt disappointed with about how the series came to an end. After years of hoping for something new, Ares and Orion came around and I must say, it filled the holes I had prior to their beginning. Focusing on Orion, I must say they got everything about right, from the hissatsu animation to story, everything worked, however the show isn't lacking disappointment either. It's true that the years passed and my anime liking decreased, but Inazuma Eleven always had always...been something I'd always watch if a new series would come, even if I quit watching anime for a long time. i wish they had more time to finish the story, as it was VERY rushed, even worse than Galaxy, and that's saying a lot. This is a great addition to the series for the fans and for the newcomers as well. been something I'd always watch if a new series would come, even if I quit watching anime for a long time. i wish they had more time to finish the story, as it was VERY rushed, even worse than Galaxy, and that's saying a lot.

Kabukichou Sherlock,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38161/Kabukichou_Sherlock,"['Preface-Whenever a Sherlock themed work is announced, it generates a set of unrealistic expectations from fans-1. Will the adaptation be faithful to the book?2. Will the characters be in ""character"" as Doyle intended it to be?3. Will it be a procedural police/detective drama involving analytical breakdown of crime scene?Quite a number of adaptations we have seen ever since television became mainstream in the second half of 20th century. From the classic British TV to Hollywood remake starring Downey Jr. to inspired works like Case Closed in Japan and back to British TV......the list goes on and on.One of the best thing about this...magnum opus by Doyle is that the entire Sherlock franchise is super versatile- you don\'t have to reproduce the classic page-by-page and it will still do fine (or amazing) as demonstrated by Steven Moffat and Guy Ritchie\'s adaptation; something which Production IG also did. With this, we start Kabukichou Sherlock!Story-Kabukichou Sherlock is modern interpretation of Sherlock series set in the famous Kabukichou district of Shinjuku popularly known as red-light district. While the series had a bumpy start, subsequent episodes covered up for it pretty well though nothing much to the central plot has been revealed yet. The book adaptations have been neat with hilarious spin. Keep an eye out for easter eggs.Note- A 23 min. episode can only have enough space for deduction and explanation so keep your expectations low.Characters-Holmes and Watson aren\'t the only detectives in this show. We are introduced to a colorful cast with their unique traits and behaviour. Sherlock is neither too eccentric nor too ordinary to be called boring. Sherlock aside, this show has some of the most wackiest character of this season which makes it even more interesting. Mrs. Hudson is one interesting character to look out for. In my opinion. she is definitely the highlight of any episode despite being supporting character.Sound-""CAPTURE"" by EGO-WRAPPIN\' is really good. The jazz/blues piece is really music to the ears and in some way reminds me of Cowboy Bebop OP. Definitely fits the theme of the show.Art-Possibly one of the best part of this series. From the back alleys to streets and Bar Pipecat, Kabukichou looks super lively and Production IG deserves commendation for that.Overall don\'t be deterred by the ratings to enjoy this show. It is definitely not the best Sherlock but for a modern Japanese interpretation, it is doing its job perfectly. Kabukichou Sherlock show is definitely not meant for everyone, especially if you are expecting it to be like those 1-1.5hr episodes starring Cumberbatch.Six episodes in and I am enjoying this series. Try to cast your Doyle-purist lens aside and watch this show. You will not regret it.

Do you even care about writing quality, or are just a you fake anime fan?If you said yes, then look no further than this anime.Kabukichou Sherlock is a sorry excuse for a mystery anime! The art is fine, I don't mind the op/ed, or voice acting. But the characters have nothing to them! The script is so stupid. It tries way...too hard to be funny. Has no one realized how bad this show is?The main issue no one has brought up is that the case are clues are illogical. No audience member could possibly pick up on them or pieced together the mystery until the episode ends. The solution to the cases involve some characters we don't even meet until the final minutes of the episode, which makes the main “mystery” not a mystery at all.DOn't even tell me this is meant to be a comedy, because the jokes are horrendous! Never laughed once. too hard to be funny. Has no one realized how bad this show is?The main issue no one has brought up is that the case are clues are illogical.

Never laughed once."", '“A light shines in the detectives’ eyes. This row house is filled with the strangest of men, and people call it - The Detective’s Row House.”First of all, Kabukichou Sherlock is not to be taken too seriously. Although it has its fair share of mysteries, but most of the time, comedy takes the spotlight. You’ll have to be patient, and just struggle a bit to see why it can turn out to be a good mystery and even give you chills with how it connects the dots, about half-way through the series. I couldn’t promise that it would worth your time, but definitely, the twist...doesn’t disappoint.Kabukichou Sherlock initially meant to introduce an ensemble of characters resembling the ones from Arthur Conan Doyle series, with a twist. The main character is of course, the Japanese Sherlock Holmes that loves rakugou and is willing to sniff, lick or try any methods to solve the mystery. There’s also his doctor-partner, John Watson who is portrayed to be more sensitive and powerless. Following up is the mastermind of the criminals, but now a young and friendly ally James Moriarty. The side characters are comprised of a flamboyant Mrs Hudson that manages the Detective’s Row House, Mycroft Holmes that works with the government and Irene Adler - the only woman that can outwit Sherlock.If there’s one word to comment on Kabukichou Sherlock, it would be rich.It’s rich in colors. Production I.G. (Vinland Saga, Haikyuu!!, AoT..) has done a great job in creating the opening and ending that fully utilized the color palattes to bring a contrast to each of the detectives, and framed the stories in the shape of photographs and memories that is truly mesmerizing.

Other than the ordinary names that you’d find in Sherlock Holmes series, new detectives varying in their mystery-solving style are also introduced. We have a pair of sister that represents a bad and good cop, an upright gentleman with glasses, a soft-hearted ex-yakuza and a gambler that’s in it for the bonus. They have decent development, and are some of the characters that bring about comedic relief and deeper attachment to the main casts.It’s also rich in its songs. The opening ""CAPTURE"" by EGO-WRAPPIN\', is funky with its rhythmic beat. It’s one of those rare opening that actually has the whole plot inside, which you will only realize afterwards. Both the ending song is decent, the first ED - Hyakuoku Kounen has a deep and resonating vocals with characters aimlessly looking into the universe, literally. The second ED – Parade is chilling, both emotionally and physically. For both arcs, they just fits.Overall, Kabukichou Sherlock is not a spectacular anime, nor a great embodiment of mystery. But seeing how the characters shine in their own way, and how the trivial cases connect to a big reveal, one couldn’t help but stay for the last moment of it. To witness and experience the fall and the rise of Sherlock Holmes, with the other colorful detectives.

From the Sherlock who is an overly cocky, but jaw-dropping expert on criminology, criminal history and chemistry in the original novels, or the cunning expertise and meticulous memory palace using Benedikt Cumberbatch and even in more abstract forms our beloved Detective Conan. All these Sherlock incarnates connect one thing, the ability to solve every case with precision.Kabukichou Sherlock is majorly different. The story caught my interest because it dared to add the ""comedy"" genre into the mix. A mix of murder...and slap-stick comedy might sound like a terrible mix of genres that cancel each other out, but bear with me. This time it will surprise you even more.Kabukichou Sherlock is a mystery show set in a district of Japan that is mostly known from the Yakuza Series in form of Kamurocho. In fact, Kabukichou is one of Tokyo\'s centers of crime and nightclubs which has its own allure thats hard to describe. In this story our journey into Kabukichou introduces us to a dozen of wacky and eccentric characters which are connected to the Sherlock origin story by namesake, but not so much by the original role setup. In Kabukichou crime is ubiquitous and Sherlock has to solve them together with his lesser helpful squad of acquaintances.Is Kabukichou Sherlock in any way comparable to the originals? Besides of a rearrangement of characters it isn\'t. The main character Sherlock, while able to solve cases really sucks as a detective. The clues are presented to him on a silver platter and he always feels smarter than the audience despite not making much an effort. He presents the solutions to the cases in old japanese style of storytelling - Rakugo. Rakugo usually involves a dialogue between two characters which perform comical or sometimes sentimental stories and act them out. In all honesty, Sherlocks Rakugo sucks really hard, but it gives him comedic relief.People familiar with the original might be put off now, because the comedic relief in Doyles novels came more from the imbeciles in the police force or Watson himself. For me this was an interesting subversion of the original story. It also made clear to me that this adaptation shouldn\'t be treated as seriously.And god I was so wrong: What starts off as a smirky comedy about the wacky life in Kabukichou and all the chaos that goes on there slowly takes up pace and introduces us to one? of the overarching plots. Jack the Ripper is causing harm in Kabukichou by killing women and displaying them in artsy styles. This is a stylistic device of noir stories to connect the gruesome with the arts. In another subplot they are after a specific mcguffin that is connected to the Sherlock group and wanders through the hands of different characters which then become targets.As Jack the ripper makes their entry into the story the pace gradually adds up until there is actually a sense of dread lingering over the characters because they have been undermined and the culprit is among them. Believe me, this show actually picks up pace and becomes brutal at times.This mystery then spiral out of control as the story throws red herring after red herring to mislead the audience. We begin going through the people close to Sherlock and investigate their behaviour and quickly we get invested into finding the culprit before the narrative tells us. In typical Sherlock Holmes fashion there I can only quote one thing: ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.""Characters:There are a handfull of characters worth mentioning. We have Sherlock, Watson, Fuyuto Kyôgoku, James Moriarty, Mary & Lucy Morstan, Michel Belmont and Mrs. Hudson in the main group. All characters have either unique looks or personalities that coincide but not overlap with the original source materials.I advise you not to assume the traditional roles in this adaptation. Sherlock isn\'t always the good guy and Moriarty isn\'t diametrally opposite to him. Also Watson isn\'t always a sidekick and useless. Detach yourself from your expectations, everything can happen in Kabukichou.Sound:When we first hear the opening we might feel we took a detour to the jazzclub. This perfectly underlines the setting in Kabukichou. The lyrics of the song aren\'t even really deduceable without looking at the lyrics but it just somehow just wants to make you dance without knowing what is said. This is especially true for this show. You are just along for the ride but mostly don\'t know whats going on. It\'s just entertaining. The video for the opening also drags us on a wild ride through the streets of Kabukichou while showing the different characters. In a sense you could take this anime as a snapshot of life in wacky kabukichou and it works fine.Art:The artstyle isn\'t special and the show would\'ve profited from being more stylized. Instead it feels like they put thought into the looks of the characters but not so much into the world. Kabukichou while being introduced as this wacky place where everything can happen looks rather bland and like every normal city street. But a lot of the action is going on in the side streets which gives it a sense of uncannyness and that there could be danger looming everywhere. The show is also pretty dark, as in not much lighting is used. The bar where all the squad gathers greatly contrasts that with bright colors and it feels like a safe haven from the happenings in the town.Enjoyment:While I honestly did not enjoy the first episodes of this anime because I just didn\'t think Sherlock lived up to my standards both in wittyness and wits as soon the pace picks up and an actual threat is involved I was waiting for a new episode every week to find out whether my suspicions about specific characters were true or not. Safe to say this anime managed to surprise me multiple times. I wouldn\'t say the writing is great, but its salvageable and true to the intention of the show.Beyond the middlepart around ep8-11 I was hooked ultimately and so will you. But since the story is rather slow and the first cases just introduce the mannerisms of this colorful cast of characters people will drop the show before it gets good.Overall I would say if you are here for a faithful adaptation of the source material you are wrong. This show doesn\'t apply for that. If you are a fan of being led around by a narrative and fooled by red herrings and like to solve mysteries then you are definitely right here. Kabukichou Sherlock is a wacky show and I\'d call it an acquired taste.But as soon you get used to it it turns into a wild ride with colorful characters and manifold possibilities in the chaos that is Kabukichou.Thanks for coming to my TedTalk. 7.5/10 but rather 8. and slap-stick comedy might sound like a terrible mix of genres that cancel each other out, but bear with me.

It is like they are trying to fit two different shows into one, and the end result feels like an incohesive mess. For instance, the characters may be investigating a serial killer who murders women in a particularly brutal way. Then they proceed to goof around and act in wacky ways around the corpse. How am I supposed to feel here? Amused? Sad? With the tone doing 180-degree turns within seconds, who knows?Not every case...is equally savage, but the comedy usually still doesn\'t work. Why? Because it is too simple and repetitive. The same jokes are repeated over and over again until they are run into the ground. They were obvious enough the first time; they are even more so on the twentieth. Often they are character quirks that appear like clockwork whenever particular characters appear on-screen. The comedy is also very conventional. It doesn\'t challenge any established norms. It loyally adheres to the long-standing model of slapstick in its most blatant and obvious form, shouting at the audience with a megaphone: ""This is a joke! Get it?"" Yes, I get it because I have seen it before so many times.It doesn\'t help that the show has adopted a heavily episodic style with unrelated cases, random villains of the week, and significant pacing problems. It becomes very difficult to care about anything that is taking place on-screen. Sure, let\'s have a mystery show that is usually episodic. How will that work out? I\'ll tell you how. I won\'t care about the victim, the culprit, or any of the random bystanders. Besides, the mystery isn\'t much of a mystery when we know barely anything about these one-episode wonders. If you like drafting theories of who did it and why, there isn\'t really much incentive or even enough clues for that matter. Sometimes the culprit only appears near the end of the episode. Yes, there is an overarching plot, but it moves along slowly and with inconsistent pacing.Here is what an episode might look like. First, some crimes are happening: murder, theft, etc. Oh well, time for people to act in a wacky way, wearing silly clothes, falling over, throwing objects, comically chasing each other for far too long, and blushing at the mere sight of girls. Then back to the murders. But enough of that, let\'s have people get sexually harassed. Then we go through the facts of the case in the form of... traditional Japanese entertainment? What? Looks like we caught the villain of the week. Then onwards to the next episode with a mostly unrelated case but the same formula. Repeat the same process.This has been done to death. It has been run into the ground. There is only so much you can do with this repetitive slapstick comedy. Imagine a circus that visits your town every week. It seems flashy at first, but then you realize that every week the clowns, the animals, and the trapeze artists perform the same tricks. Every single week. How many times would you visit the place? This also easily grinds the pacing to a halt. Okay, so there are some differences between episodes. For instance, there is the gangster who makes ludicrous poses and speaks like a madman in every situation. There is also a bath house episode that features Sherlock only wearing a censor bar and a bunch of people in animal masks because... I don\'t know. Maybe it is some Japanese cultural reference that is meant to be funny.The one-episode characters are largely forgettable, but the regular cast isn\'t much better. Sherlock solves cases with semi-blind guesses that happen to be correct. He perfectly guesses the motives of the culprits based on insufficient evidence and profiles them based on superficial features. I suppose he is prone to this in the original novels too, but it goes even further here because most of the cases are so short and there is so little evidence available.Speaking of Japanese culture, Sherlock delivers case summaries with rakugo, a form of traditional Japanese entertainment. The show treats this as though it is funny, but the punch-lines are simply that some of the characters in the presentation (who are distinct from the ""real-world"" characters in the show) are dumber than others and slower to figure the case out. This is apparently funny because... I don\'t know. Misconceptions can be funny, but they need to be constructed in a wittier way than ""ha ha ha, you don\'t get the case"" and then proceeding to explain the case. It also doesn\'t help that it is so random. Sherlock is artificially presenting random characters in an in-universe performance that deals with a case about other random characters who only appear in a single episode. Now, I am the first to admit that I am not the foremost expert in rakugo, but based on my layman knowledge it is usually supposed to be funny. Maybe I am not exactly the target audience here.The show also features other detectives, but they mostly exist to be Sherlock\'s foils that lose to him over and over again. And they also exist for character quirks and related jokes, of course. The neat freak detective is obsessed about cleaning and feels insecure when women are around. The former mafia thug detective is all brawn and no brain and is desperate for any attention from women. Etc. Mrs Hudson owns a bar where the detectives hang out. She happens to be a trans woman who acts in a flamboyant, over-the-top manner and sexually harasses people. (The trans characters in the show are usually very stereotypical, and the show seems to assume that they are either inherently funny or weird in some allegedly interesting way.) Watson is mostly a comic relief and exists to make Sherlock look smarter. (I suppose the latter part is loyal to the original novels.) Lestrade is even more of a walking joke and barely appears. Moriarty is a high school kid who is friends with Sherlock and slow to develop. Jack the Ripper is mostly not comic relief, but being a typical evil, brutal serial killer isn\'t any better. Irene Adler is one of the better characters by being competent but not over-the-top ridiculous, though she is used for generic, predictable fanservice jokes sometimes.Even generally speaking, so many characters in this act as though they are horny 24/7. See a girl? Instant blush. Speaking with a girl? Awkward, over-the-top reactions with mumbling and arms flailing. Or even better, literally getting a hard on. If you have seen anime or fiction in general, you have probably seen these jokes before, maybe hundreds of times. I don\'t mind a fresh take on Sherlock Holmes, but not if it means reducing most of the cast into generic comic relief. It is fine to be comedic, but it shouldn\'t be as lazy as this.It wouldn\'t have to be this way. If they wanted to make more of an effort, they could have gone in a number of directions. One idea with potential would be black comedy that involves morally questionable topics. To clarify a bit, there is a difference between applying black comedy and sprinkling unrelated light-hearted comedy among serious events. Kabukichou Sherlock does the latter. It features murders and other crimes that are treated as serious while throwing in unrelated slapstick comedy. I would have preferred deriving laughter from the potentially evil actions themselves. Crimes can be funny, but they have to be committed for a suitable reason and with sufficient build-up. For instance, you could have a comedic sociopath who is doing it for reasons that are at least remotely relatable but still lacks a firm moral compass. Bonus points if he is relatively chill about it. Then you point out that the action is kind of dodgy without actually sounding preachy about it. But here we usually have generic scumbag culprits with thirty seconds of characterization or complete monsters that are portrayed in the most over-the-top disgusting, ugly way imaginable. The rest of the culprits have motives that are flimsy, nonsensical, or unrelatable.By the way, the show feels like there is a need to repeat over and over again how the eastern part of the city (where the detectives are based) is a city of neon lights, chaos, and endless crimes. A few times would have sufficed. Speaking of the city, there is apparently a Berlin wall between the western and eastern side, and passage through it is tightly regulated. When did we suddenly cross the Iron Curtain? I think we deserve more of an explanation here. This wall thing could actually provide material for jokes if used right, but of course they do not even try. (Or if they did, it is so out of line with their usual approach to comedy that my mind did not register it.)I guess this show just wasn\'t meant for me. The jokes don\'t land or deliver. It gives me the impression that I am not in the target audience at all, and that is probably the case, but the marketing should have been more honest then. I wasn\'t expecting jaw-dropping mysteries, but I was expecting something with a bit more effort. Even when there is mystery, it falls flat because it is impossible to care about the outcome, the deductions are more like guesses, the constant tone swings ruin the mood, or the culprit is driven by nonsensical motives. They should have called this a slapstick comedy from the start, though it would have still been ruined by the inconsistent tone and the sheer repetitiveness. is equally savage, but the comedy usually still doesn\'t work. Why? Because it is too simple and repetitive. The same jokes are repeated over and over again until they are run into the ground. They were obvious enough the first time; they are even more so on the twentieth. Often they are character quirks that appear like clockwork whenever particular characters appear on-screen. The comedy is also very conventional. It doesn\'t challenge any established norms. It loyally adheres to the long-standing model of slapstick in its most blatant and obvious form, shouting at the audience with a megaphone: ""This is a joke! Get it?"" Yes, I get it because I have seen it before so many times.It doesn\'t help that the show has adopted a heavily episodic style with unrelated cases, random villains of the week, and significant pacing problems. It becomes very difficult to care about anything that is taking place on-screen. Sure, let\'s have a mystery show that is usually episodic. How will that work out? I\'ll tell you how. I won\'t care about the victim, the culprit, or any of the random bystanders. Besides, the mystery isn\'t much of a mystery when we know barely anything about these one-episode wonders. If you like drafting theories of who did it and why, there isn\'t really much incentive or even enough clues for that matter. Sometimes the culprit only appears near the end of the episode. Yes, there is an overarching plot, but it moves along slowly and with inconsistent pacing.Here is what an episode might look like. First, some crimes are happening: murder, theft, etc. Oh well, time for people to act in a wacky way, wearing silly clothes, falling over, throwing objects, comically chasing each other for far too long, and blushing at the mere sight of girls. Then back to the murders. But enough of that, let\'s have people get sexually harassed. Then we go through the facts of the case in the form of... traditional Japanese entertainment? What? Looks like we caught the villain of the week. Then onwards to the next episode with a mostly unrelated case but the same formula. Repeat the same process.This has been done to death. It has been run into the ground. There is only so much you can do with this repetitive slapstick comedy. Imagine a circus that visits your town every week. It seems flashy at first, but then you realize that every week the clowns, the animals, and the trapeze artists perform the same tricks. Every single week. How many times would you visit the place? This also easily grinds the pacing to a halt. Okay, so there are some differences between episodes. For instance, there is the gangster who makes ludicrous poses and speaks like a madman in every situation. There is also a bath house episode that features Sherlock only wearing a censor bar and a bunch of people in animal masks because... I don\'t know. Maybe it is some Japanese cultural reference that is meant to be funny.The one-episode characters are largely forgettable, but the regular cast isn\'t much better. Sherlock solves cases with semi-blind guesses that happen to be correct. He perfectly guesses the motives of the culprits based on insufficient evidence and profiles them based on superficial features. I suppose he is prone to this in the original novels too, but it goes even further here because most of the cases are so short and there is so little evidence available.Speaking of Japanese culture, Sherlock delivers case summaries with rakugo, a form of traditional Japanese entertainment. The show treats this as though it is funny, but the punch-lines are simply that some of the characters in the presentation (who are distinct from the ""real-world"" characters in the show) are dumber than others and slower to figure the case out. This is apparently funny because... I don\'t know. Misconceptions can be funny, but they need to be constructed in a wittier way than ""ha ha ha, you don\'t get the case"" and then proceeding to explain the case. It also doesn\'t help that it is so random. Sherlock is artificially presenting random characters in an in-universe performance that deals with a case about other random characters who only appear in a single episode. Now, I am the first to admit that I am not the foremost expert in rakugo, but based on my layman knowledge it is usually supposed to be funny. Maybe I am not exactly the target audience here.The show also features other detectives, but they mostly exist to be Sherlock\'s foils that lose to him over and over again. And they also exist for character quirks and related jokes, of course. The neat freak detective is obsessed about cleaning and feels insecure when women are around. The former mafia thug detective is all brawn and no brain and is desperate for any attention from women. Etc. Mrs Hudson owns a bar where the detectives hang out.

Every character matters (a lot) and is interesting/quirky/mysterious.2. Story is deeper, or twistier, than you might expect and initially perceive.3. Its quite a unique work because of its setting and wonderful characters + the music and art are quite good.I am shocked this anime is not more popular, and that people dropped it after watching the first few episodes. I was absorbed into it after the first episode, but...there is a bit of a slow down in story progression for maybe 3-4 episodes towards the first half of the show. But it is nothing too major, and some important but discrete things do happen even in those episodes that have to do with a bigger plot.Most people probably watch the show thinking it is too comedic or too different from normal Sherlock Holmes works because there is a very lovable transgender side character that makes often brief appearances, and many jokes and occasional talk of rakugo come up, but this one to me is just special. The comedy is just right, and is actually funny at times. But the creators did not over do it, and gave the show a good balance of seriousness and light heartedness. The mystery aspect in the anime is VERY strong and might not be immediately apparent, but it will build very nicely. There is indeed crime solving, unlike some other ""mystery"" animes I have watched recently, and perhaps even more so the aspects of murder and disguise. Trust me, the show takes some turns I did not expect, and you just can not help but love the characters.The pacing of this show is also something to comment on. Pacing is just right, and doesn\'t drag out much at all, but is not too fast or choppy. Many recent shows lose me because of too fast or too slow pacing, but I did not experience that with this wonderful anime. Its 100% worth the watch.

The odd rakugo-crazy Shinjuku Sherlock seemed unique enough to carry this on.The addition of Moriarty as his best friend was also unexpected and thrilling, regardless of him being just a teen.Watson himself was quite alright as the embodiment of normality in this crazy world of rejects and geniuses.However, things went very wrong. The anime was probing the line between comedy, mystery, and drama so much...that is lost itself somewhere in-between.The first 12 episodes were a boring variation of the Jack the Ripper case, mixed with some ridiculous investigations varying from a corrupt sumo wrestler to a murder in a masked pop band.The second 12 episodes were even worse, with nothing to hold them together and villains, heroes, and madness splattered all-over.The characters were never presented properly and could not develop at all. The weird thing is, few of them (the Morstan sisters and Kyougoku) had their own mini-stories, but this was quickly abandoned, leaving the plot and the whole idea of the anime even messier.In the end, I was left with the feeling of watching 24 promo specials or 24 ""filler episodes"" while waiting for the real story.Too bad it never came to it. that is lost itself somewhere in-between.The first 12 episodes were a boring variation of the Jack the Ripper case, mixed with some ridiculous investigations varying from a corrupt sumo wrestler to a murder in a masked pop band.The second 12 episodes were even worse, with nothing to hold them together and villains, heroes, and madness splattered all-over.The characters were never presented properly and could not develop at all.

Unfortunately what i was met with were cases that weren't curiosity inducing at all. Sherlock mostly solves everything off screen with clues that aren't presented to the audience.

This will be updated once the series ends.~ Minor spoilers ~This show is certainly unique.  It is portrayed as an alternate version of the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes, but from watching the show, I do not think it should be taken at face value and compared heavily to the original stories.  Most of what has been shown in this has been comparative by...names rather than story and character, and this show is honestly a parody/comedy mixed with mystery.  There is the obvious nod at each of the original Holmes characters, but each one has their own style or twist to the character that shines a completely different light on them.  Sherlock Holmes especially, despite being the obviously genius detective that he also is in the novels, this version portrays him as simply a part-time detective that wants to do Rakugo (i.e. kinda-sorta stand-up comedy mixed with one-man plays).  Every time his rakugo is shown, I personally get excited, although some of it isn't high-tier, it is enjoyable to watch, especially in an anime involving mystery.  Even in general we do not see much rakugo in anime, and this use is completely unique.Story - The story itself isn't exactly linear, it starts off with an episodic formula with mystery to mystery while using that formula to show off each character before a bigger plot begins to show.  I usually am not one for an episodic series, but the way it uses the formula works to fill in gaps for future episodes and ties in to the daily life of the characters.Art - For the most part, the art is a quite basic anime style, but with certain characters, there is a high level of detail present, even with certain scenes and settings.  The best parts of art, in my opinion, were during some of Sherlock's Rakugo.Sound - Although much of the music in the show is repetitious, much of it is exciting and upbeat and seems to fit quite well with each scene.  From voice acting, I really enjoy almost every character's line delivery, and each character has their own unique mannerisms and tones of voice.Character - As stated before, each of the characters which were from the original Holmes stories have their own twist in this series, but there are also a large number of original characters only unique to this series, especially considering they probably needed some Japanese characters in there somewhere.  Each set of detectives and third-party characters have pretty varying personalities, and while some do use tropes, others have interesting backstory and depth with unique personalities not often found in anime.  I personally thought many of the character's personalities were a pleasant surprise and left me with enjoyment each time they appeared on-screen.Enjoyment - Without a doubt, I am enjoying this series.  From the mysteries, to Mrs. Hudson's character, to Sherlock's rakugo, there is a lot packed into this one series that makes it hard to enjoy, even though it's not a serious and fully linear story.Overall - All in all, I believe you should watch this series if you haven't, and you should be patient with it.  Kabukichou Sherlock should be watched with an open mind without comparing it to the original Sherlock Holmes or expecting it to be a serious show, it isn't meant to be taken seriously, and it is entirely a series you should go in expecting something fun and unique, rather than serious and story-driven.

Sure, Sherlock's an odd character, eating gummy bears with rice and all, but nothing he ever did would lead you to conclude he's a hidden serial murderer... somehow restrained by Watson's goodness and naïveté.

I think it\'s part of the reason why my view of the anime is so different: I had no specific expectations, and I had nothing to compare it to.Kabukichou Sherlock is a pretty unusual adaptation of the story, taking place in the Kabukichou neighborhood in Tokyo, aka the red light district. Here, Sherlock is obsessed with Rakugo (A Japanese storytelling format, usually comedic), Watson is more like...a housewife than an actual assistant for a good chunk of the story, Moriarty is a 16 year-old genius who is friends with Sherlock.As mentioned before, I don\'t remember much of Sherlock Holmes, I didn\'t really remember Moriarty, because I didn\'t really remember names. When talking about the show on my WhatsApp story (as I do with shows I like), my friends were baffled by my words, asking me since when Moriarty is a good guy. To me, he was just a tiny psychopath who just so happened to like hanging around Sherlock.I don\'t want to go too deep into how different the characters are from the books, because I am clearly not the person for that, and just because the characters aren\'t as they are in the books doesn\'t mean they\'re not good. In fact, the characters were my favorite part of the show, and the only thing I would say is an absolute 10/10.Sherlock is a delight to watch, being this grumpy dude with a colorful and expressive way of presenting his mystery solving, and his dynamic with basically anyone is fun as a result. He\'s also low-key a sociopath, and something about that, added with his personality, makes me love this guy even more.As mentioned before, I love Moriarty, he\'s my favorite character. He\'s intelligent, he\'s a leader, he\'s likeable on the outside, but inside he\'s an actual psychopath. I don\'t want to go into detail, because I feel like the show clarified that neither he nor Sherlock have much compassion or empathy, but that\'s also why they get along so well in this version: they get each other.I expected Irene to be one of these one off characters for the weekly case, because I paid no attention to the opening animation and didn\'t recognize her. However, when I saw that she\'s here to stay, I realized two things:1. The story isn\'t going to be as episodic from now on.2. Shit is gonna go down.Right when the format started getting a little repetitive, she waltzed in with her pretty face and her omelette USB and got us some brand new Sherlock interactions, which was very welcome. It was with her introduction when the storyline of the first episode, the Jack The Ripper case, returned to the spotlight, and her involvement helped make me enjoy it even more. So basically I like her because she\'s badass and I\'m gay, moving on.Other notable characters include Lucy and Mary, who have a special bond and are really sweet, Kobayashi, who is a delinquent detective who actually has a lot of heart, Mrs. Hudson, about whom I was skeptical about when she was introduced, but I grew to love her, since she has the most heart out of everyone in the show, and she\'s really sweet, and Kyougoku, who is so extra with everything he does, adding to the wackiness of the show.I haven\'t mentioned Watson, because he\'s really the plainest of the cast, despite being our protagonist. Even though he isn\'t as weird as everyone else, characters actually play off of him really well as a result. Insanity gets boring when there\'s no one sane there to counter it. He serves as a sort of self-insert for the viewer (whether intentionally or not), by being just as new to the situation as the person watching. Because he is so plain, he stands out more than had he been as quirky as everyone else, and he appears predictable because his line of thinking is more ""normal"" than all these wackos, but it\'s thanks to that predictability that the rest of the cast gets to shine.On a technical level, this show is nothing special. The art is good, but nothing much can be said beyond that. The OST is decent, though the opening theme is quite fun and has been added to my playlist. The voice acting saved the sound category from getting a 6 or a 7 from me, the voice acting was really good, especially Sherlock\'s, but I can\'t say much else. I do want to note about the animation that while it\'s nothing spectacular, it does an amazing job of showing these subtleties in changing expressions and atmosphere, and certain scenes were framed really well. However overall, it\'s a bit lacking in that department, though it\'s not bad by any means.The story is what kept me watching the series. Had the Jack The Ripper plotline not at least piqued my interest, I would\'ve dropped it after episode 1, because the homophobic implications made me extremely uncomfortable. I\'m really glad I gave the show a chance. The weekly cases were neat to go through, but it didn\'t really kick off for me until we got the spotlight a little away from Sherlock and Watson and focusing on the other detectives more. It was refreshing and neat, and this formula continued until Irene was introduced. Even if there was other stuff in the background, the plot was more consistent in the following episodes, and the conclusion of the case was painful, yet satisfying.Now, the Jack The Ripper storyline was technically only 11 episodes, with episode 12 serving as a platform for the characters to reflect on what had happened in the previous episode and what it meant. After that, while it was clear that the show hasn\'t ended yet, it was planned for 24 episodes after all, there was still some sense of closure, giving room for more stories to emerge. There was a break between episode 12 and 13, only adding to the divide between these two parts.Episode 13 is nothing like the previous episodes. Most episodes had a case to solve in the center, or some kind of goal they need to reach by the end of the episode, but this one was purely backstory and setup of the current status quo, which wasn\'t completely clear because of a plot twist in the first half of the series which changed everything completely. As of writing this, it is the newest episode available, and the new setup is intriguing and scary, which leaves me, and probably many other viewers, waiting for next week\'s episode impatiently. I will make an updated review when the show endsOverall, the show is good. It\'s not amazing or groundbreaking, but I don\'t think it deserves all the hate it\'s getting. The technical part of the show isn\'t great, although it\'s not completely average and shines in some areas, but the characters make this show a fun watch. Sure, out of all the things I\'ve watched from 2019 it\'s my personal least favorite, it doesn\'t mean that it\'s bad, it just means that 2019 had some really good anime. a housewife than an actual assistant for a good chunk of the story, Moriarty is a 16 year-old genius who is friends with Sherlock.As mentioned before, I don\'t remember much of Sherlock Holmes, I didn\'t really remember Moriarty, because I didn\'t really remember names.

Different stories each episode sometimes lasting two or that constant reminder of jack the ripper.The stories range from gruesome murders to silly little children stories and there is always some comedy in each episode whether its Sherlock doing rakugo or the kids doing some nonsense like chucking water balloons at drunks.for me i like that this anime has a wide range of humour and all sorts of characters, not your typical pretty boys...or girls with their boobs waving at you every second.The only thing I don't like about this anime is that sometimes it doesn't make sense or the stories are just dumb like the one they had to find the cat for Mrs Hudson.I recommend this only if want humour and a dumb Sherlock putting canned mangoes on everything. or girls with their boobs waving at you every second.The only thing I don't like about this anime is that sometimes it doesn't make sense or the stories are just dumb like the one they had to find the cat for Mrs Hudson.I recommend this only if want humour and a dumb Sherlock putting canned mangoes on everything."", ""Kabukichou Sherlock  gets a lot of criticism for being a lackluster comedy based around the character of an off brand Sherlock Holmes, but as the show goes on and on it gets more serious, emotional, and tense. The first half is primarily light hearted and comedy heavy to set the tone of how things 'should be'; but turns away from that halfway into the Jack the Ripper case, which the case and the events that are around it become the main plot of the show. The show has plot twists that some might see coming, some not, depending on if you know the Sherlock...Homes books and whether you think its going to follow the books at all.The gimmicky inclusion of rakugo is also an issue of contention with watchers, as it is gimmicky and one of the things that is there explicitly to make the show distinct. That said the rakugo has explicit reasons for being there, this Sherlock loves roakugo but didnt have enough talent for it but in his depression after realizing this was convinced that if he loved it so much then he could apply it to how he acts in his life- detective rakugo. But utmost Sherlock performs it because he wants to and finds it fun, not because he hast to as part of his gimmick. As such the rakugo fades off during the darker second half of the show.  Its a great emotional anime by the end that explores all of its characters on a psychological level by the end.This was my second review for the show after completing it, here is my original review after only watching the first half watching the show:Less of a Sherlock Holmes story and more of a weird cross between Akechi Kogorōand his Boy Detectives Club meets Sherlock Holmes, where the character ofSherlock is part Holmes and part Akechi, and his 'partner' is part Kobayashi andpart Watson.Each episodic episode is enjoyable in its own right with events and outcomeslogically making sense.

It has it's good moments and it's bad moments. It also has a bit of a slow start and you may wonder when the actual plot will begin even though they touch here and there on it.Comedy and Mystery is usually not a thing...to go hand in hand, but I've personally found an enjoyment with this due to my knowledge on japanese culture and comedy so I often catch jokes that a western person normally wouldn't catch. The reason is that western people can't understand the spoken jokes that well but understand slapstick, and while the anime does have it's fair share of slapstick does a lot of the comedy lie in the words as well.Also it has a really good opening song that I just can't skip. The opening sequence in itself is not much worth but the song is great.I would though recommend you to try to watch it. You can after 3 episodes see with yourself if you want to watch more or just stop there. to go hand in hand, but I've personally found an enjoyment with this due to my knowledge on japanese culture and comedy so I often catch jokes that a western person normally wouldn't catch.

The anime should be called ‘We Use Transphobic Jokes and Harmful Stereotypes: The Anime’As a longtime Sherlock admirer, this anime was a disappointment. Seeing your favourite character having to deal with the old transphobic trope of the killer being the implied trans woman is sickening.This was sure a disappointment since the concept of putting the greatest detective in modern Japan was fun. His way of performing the explanation was interesting and the humour was sometimes funny, except when they used another trans woman as the joke! Making Mrs Hudson not cis-passing was not the...problem, the problem was that her being strong and having a deep voice was just for laughs… let’s not forget they made her a walking transphobic stereotype and having her sexually assault men that were probably straight was weird.Even Ayumu’s performance was outshone by how disgusted I was about the cheapest and most harmful trope they used to solve an interesting real case. I wish transphobia wasn’t such a big part of the plot, it seriously made it unwatchable. Seeing it was made not so long ago makes it even worse. Are we still stuck in the same transphobic and homophobic humour and plot twists from the 90s? It is disgusting AND lazy.This show deserves to be my only review, seriously, do not watch this show! So disappointed that Sherlock hasn’t gotten a good anime adaptation. problem, the problem was that her being strong and having a deep voice was just for laughs… let’s not forget they made her a walking transphobic stereotype and having her sexually assault men that were probably straight was weird.Even Ayumu’s performance was outshone by how disgusted I was about the cheapest and most harmful trope they used to solve an interesting real case.

So disappointed that Sherlock hasn’t gotten a good anime adaptation.', 'Reason for watching: The show looks like it will be fun and pack with Mysteries too; I am looking for something lighthearted to watch for a change of pace.TL;DR: This show which revolves around mystery cases is fun at the start, then took an escalator down to the entrance of the psychotic realm, all while having the consistent subjects of what is considered as dark and taboo(in many cultures in our real world) as the underlying setting for most storylines. Due to its cross-overs with vastly different genres, that are strongly depicted in the show, if you were to slightly dislike one of them, this...show will most probably be unbearable.After watching the show and reading the reviews, I would have to say, this is the kind of show that picks its audience, not the other way around. IYKYK though~I am going to have to put this forward and say that I was not watching this show wholeheartedly, I was in a state of grieve while I was watching this show. (Is just how I was trying to cope with my grief.)  I will try to write my review as objective as I can to do the show justice.Story: Concept and ExecutionConceptThis is somewhat a parody of the famous Sherlock Holmes novels, there is of course many versions and adaptations throughout our time and we won\'t know what exactly the creators/author referenced, but they all revolves around Mystery cases. As in all parodies, there is of course the element of comedy, but this show incorporated both slapstick comedy and dark humour into the story. Comedy in general is already a very difficult genre to exhibit, but to weave two different types of humour into a story that possess quite a load of seriousness, just seem to be a lot of work. Comedy and Mystery are just two of the more outstanding genres that can be seen throughout the show. The unique environment the characters are placed in, the characters design itself, and the characters\' background themselves are all interesting. With this setting and the mix of genres, this show is the definition of peculiar.And so from my point of view, I can\'t see how this show is transphobic, in fact part of this show\'s peculiarity is its diversity of characters from all walks of life. (Well there is a diversity of characters, but not to say the show is about diversity, is really not about any particular group or category of people)Execution (Story-telling)The execution of this concept is considerably good, for all its strange events and characters that it has. They were able to smoothly transition from slapstick to mystery to dark humour to psychological to thriller and many more. The first half of the show is definitely more lighthearted and ""detached"", in the sense that is pretty much episodic and there\'s little personal involvement from the characters. Right at the ending of the first half is when the story took a turn and continued into the second half of the show with the characters getting more personal and more involved with the cases on a emotional/psychological level. In the first half, there are some dark humour lurking around in the background while slapstick plots are everywhere, but in the second half, the slapstick humour toned down a lot, but the dark humour did not ""took its place"". They did increase more storylines with dark humour, but not by a lot, instead the psychological aspect of the show comes straight up in your face, paired with the thriller element. So much so that, even while grieving, I knew that if I were to watch this on some other normal days, I would have been pretty emotional more than a couple of times. I actually have to stop watching the show a couple of days because I know I am ruining the show for myself by not being able to be invested in it wholeheartedly. But I do understand logically how the storylines unfold and how they linked to each other in the most simplest way. There is nothing confusing in how the events are told, yet the events all habour the mysteries that they should have properly. Very nimble way of executing the story. Throughout the show, there are many instances of mature and taboo subjects that appears on the scene so very ""casually"". Is only casual due to the premise of the show of course. The way the story throws in the mature-taboo contents in is quite smart, imo. They are not explicit and focused on enough to ""scar"" anyone, but they are not hidden like ""easter eggs"". They were conveyed on to the scenes like how natural the topic of ""what new animes are there this coming season?"" can be brought up in real life. They aren\'t taboo in the show, they are as normal as any of the characters in the show. Is possible that these scenes of ""sensitive"" topics are more noticeable to me due to my experience too. Hence, this is especially subjective, but I like (mildly appreciate it even) how this show engineered its depth into the story. The show is deeper and darker and more real than I had expected.Art and SoundCharacter art style is not the typical bishoujo, bishounen art. They are not pretty, they are not unique, they are just interestingly normal. Normal as in, they don\'t have all the same eyes where only the eye colour differs, or they don\'t have the same face shape where only the hairstyle tells them apart. Is almost like they are as close to real life as an anime style drawing can get (""almost"" because I think the anime <Monster> have a more real life drawing style). Well overall the character art style isn\'t wack, is interesting but not eye-catching. The background and scenery on the other hand, are a sight for sore eyes. They are pretty, colourful yet not obscenely bright, and very detailed. Opening and ending scenes are very fun to watch too. Animation is also what you can expect of a quality work in this day and age. To sum it out, Art is above average with very good colour matching senses.There are no issues with the Sound of this anime. VAs are good, sound effects are on point, opening and ending songs are above average. All is good.CharacterWell it is a parody of Sherlock Holmes, so the main characters\' design are based upon the characters of the original of course, but with a twist. Sherlock is quirky, but in what way? That is in the way he deduces the mystery with a performance, his eating preferences of unthinkable combination, and many more. Can\'t really go on describing the characters since they are all so very distinct, I would have to write an essay just to cover them. So, yes, the characters may be based on the originals but they all have their own twists and are rightfully exclusive to this show. The characters design are mostly interesting and entertaining (there are some which are really boring and possess the personality of a mob character) that I wouldn\'t have mind a minor 2 - 3 episodes arc of these characters\' origin story or development storyline. The show did at least dedicate 1 episode to some of the characters (But it focuses more on the cases than the characters). For the few characters that we do get to know more about their past, their backstories are refreshingly ""normal"" as compared to the current premise of their life in the show, which further highlights the peculiarity of the story. Hahah~ The show also established a vastly different relationship between the characters than that of the original. The twists in the characters, and their relationships to each other, along with a vivacious environment where the story takes place in, makes for a cast of mysterious characters (which also helps in making the story more dynamic actually). Out of those entertaining characters, only several of them are as deep as the story, or probably deeper though (the others are just the ""you get what you see""). But then due to the execution of the story, there are hardly any character developments in the first half, and the second half only develops the very main characters (the minuscule development of the side characters are just predictable). There is a slight discrepancy here though, where the main characters that have depth develops and grow, they don\'t actually mesh well with the other characters. (Or maybe is just me, since the characters that have depth developed through a psychological narrative, I may have felt like they were more than just simple fictitious characters) But then, due to the nature of the show focusing on the mysterious cases to be solved, the lack of character development isn\'t very obvious, after all, the story itself develops well.FYI: Moriarty is a main character in my opinion~Hint: Don\'t expect anything from this show, let it take you on this ride~ Hahaha~ show will most probably be unbearable.After watching the show and reading the reviews, I would have to say, this is the kind of show that picks its audience, not the other way around.

They are pretty, colourful yet not obscenely bright, and very detailed. Opening and ending scenes are very fun to watch too. Animation is also what you can expect of a quality work in this day and age. To sum it out, Art is above average with very good colour matching senses.There are no issues with the Sound of this anime. VAs are good, sound effects are on point, opening and ending songs are above average. All is good.CharacterWell it is a parody of Sherlock Holmes, so the main characters\' design are based upon the characters of the original of course, but with a twist. Sherlock is quirky, but in what way? That is in the way he deduces the mystery with a performance, his eating preferences of unthinkable combination, and many more. Can\'t really go on describing the characters since they are all so very distinct, I would have to write an essay just to cover them. So, yes, the characters may be based on the originals but they all have their own twists and are rightfully exclusive to this show. The characters design are mostly interesting and entertaining (there are some which are really boring and possess the personality of a mob character) that I wouldn\'t have mind a minor 2 - 3 episodes arc of these characters\' origin story or development storyline. The show did at least dedicate 1 episode to some of the characters (But it focuses more on the cases than the characters). For the few characters that we do get to know more about their past, their backstories are refreshingly ""normal"" as compared to the current premise of their life in the show, which further highlights the peculiarity of the story. Hahah~ The show also established a vastly different relationship between the characters than that of the original. The twists in the characters, and their relationships to each other, along with a vivacious environment where the story takes place in, makes for a cast of mysterious characters (which also helps in making the story more dynamic actually). Out of those entertaining characters, only several of them are as deep as the story, or probably deeper though (the others are just the ""you get what you see""). But then due to the execution of the story, there are hardly any character developments in the first half, and the second half only develops the very main characters (the minuscule development of the side characters are just predictable). There is a slight discrepancy here though, where the main characters that have depth develops and grow, they don\'t actually mesh well with the other characters. (Or maybe is just me, since the characters that have depth developed through a psychological narrative, I may have felt like they were more than just simple fictitious characters) But then, due to the nature of the show focusing on the mysterious cases to be solved, the lack of character development isn\'t very obvious, after all, the story itself develops well.FYI: Moriarty is a main character in my opinion~Hint: Don\'t expect anything from this show, let it take you on this ride~ Hahaha~', 'I liked this show a lot more than I thought I would, considering that I watched it out of spite. I\'ve reached the point where I\'ll watch any Sherlock Holmes content that isn\'t the weird shitty BBC one just to cleanse my brain. Also, it got an endorsement from Mother\'s Basement, and I trust his opinion for the most part. AAnyway, wow, this is a fun show. The mysteries are entertaining and the eventual solutions make sense and are clever and you can usually understand how they were done. I also like the characters, at least so far, specifically Holmes himself- I\'ve seen a lot...of different versions of him in various different media formats, but I don\'t think anyone has really embraced the ""Rat Man"" part of his persona until now. Watson is neat also in an understated kind of way, which is how Watson is supposed to be written. Also, making Mrs Hudson a drag queen was a legendary choice and I\'m fucking here for it.[SPOILERS AHEAD]One issue I have is (here we go) the shows treatment of trans characters. This seems to come up a lot in my reviews, and this time it was more egregious than Carole and Tuesday. I would like to formally apologize to Carole and Tuesday- I now realize it could have been infinitely worse.Basically the main villain for the first arc, ""Jack the Ripper,"" is revealed to be a minor character who is a trans woman one of the detectives is dating. When her identity as the killer is revealed, her voice drops, she begins acting in a stereotypical ""mannish"" way, and she starts to smear makeup all over her face in some kind of garish approximation of femininity even though she never had a problem with applying makeup beforehand. She also is presented as a pervert who committed the murders for some kind of psychosexual gratification.The concept of the ""psycho trans person"" is a tired and bigoted trope and I\'m really disappointed that this show used it. That\'s basically it, really.

I watched the 2 or 3 Sherlock Holmes movies with Benedict cumberatch in them and that’s about it, but I do love a good whodunit, and mystery story.This anime provides the bare minimum. The art style, and sound and animation are all good, nothing to complain about. But where it really lacks is the story and plot. I expected the anime to be episodic, but still have an overarching story line somewhere, but color me surprised...when they literally solve it mid season. With barely any lead up or clues. After they find Jack the Ripper the whole anime kind of falls apart, there’s no next mystery or anything which is why I dropped it after 2 episodes of no real stakes. You’ve essentially seen all the characters growth which is essentially none, and the storyline stagnates.The individual mysteries are whatever, none of them really interest you, ans you don’t even care about them bc they never add any growth to the characters. It’s not like each mystery makes their bond closer or anything either, they don’t grow to trust each other and no development of any kind.Even with the low expectations it still disappoints. I think this is fine for a background anime you have while you do something else, or you really crave a character named Sherlock Holmes otherwise you’re better off watching something else. I would not recommend. when they literally solve it mid season. With barely any lead up or clues.

Instead, it's Ange's meeting the new guardians which all of nice personalities, but when the whole anime has so many men in it that sometimes their personalities are not very distinct.The only characters that seemed to even break a mold for me was Charlie and Francis.  There is just way too many characters for there to really be characters...that stick out.

Kakkou no Iinazuke,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48675/Kakkou_no_Iinazuke,"['Sigh… Alright, where do we even begin with this one? First of all, if you actually finished all 24 episodes of this dumpster fire, like I did, I applaud your dedication, but sometimes I really do question the decisions I make, such as continuing to watch this week after week. Studious male harem protagonists have been somewhat of a repeating character archetype, like Futaro Uesugi from The Quintessential Quintuplets, or Nariyuki Yuiga, from We Never Learn. I am convinced however, that Umino Nagi is one of the worst harem protagonists that I have seen. He’s literally Kazuya, but gets good grades in school. He’s indecisive,...and rather dumb for a studious kid. I felt like the author of the manga just gave up on keeping the source material at least at a decent quality, because the anime just stopped trying to be good as it went along. Just like the anime, you’ll also probably find that this review you’re reading will also drop in quality as it goes along, who knows?My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 5.5/25I’m not even going to question the whole swapped at birth thing, it’s animanga, and animanga does these stupid things, and we know this. Perhaps it’s just easier to turn your brain off and just appreciate the harem anime as it is, but it’s quite an infuriating show to watch. So, we can as usual, assume that every girl likes Nagi, even his little sister, and that’s to be expected. What angers me is why the girls try to play wingwoman for another girl when they clearly like Nagi in the first place? Guess romance is weird like that. The pacing is honestly slower than I imagined, especially in the second cour, where there were cliffhangers galore. Sure, there were some well done moments, but for the most part, it just wasn’t very well written or entertaining.ART: 7.7/10The animation is fine. It’s colourful, quite a good job honestly. The character designs are quite decent.MUSIC: 8.3/10I will say I enjoyed both OPs and both EDs, they’re honestly one of the highlights of this entire show.CHARACTERS: 5.5/20I’ve already mentioned my disdain for Umino, so let’s talk about the girls in the story. First, there’s Erika, an “Instagram Influencer”, who lived in a rich household, and once she moved out to live with Nagi, she didn’t know how to do many things, and found a lot of mundane activities very new. She’s pretty inoffensive for the most part to watch, but her feelings for Umino were rather muddled. Then there’s Hiro, who was probably my favourite character, since it seemed like she might have a little bit of a good backstory, but her character writing was rather inconsistent. Sometimes she’s extremely kind, but sometimes she can come across as a bit overbearing and overly annoying as a character. Lastly, ooh boy, there’s Sachi. Why is she even in this harem? There was no need honestly, and she didn’t even have much of a role to play. Guess she made this whole show a bit more trashy.ENJOYMENT: 3.5/15I admit, there was a bit of cheap enjoyment to be had, and there were a couple very solid episodes, but most of it was a snoozefest.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 4.5/20The themes were rather muddled, honestly. What were we trying to do here? Figure out why Nagi and Erika were separated at birth? Just have a slice of life harem? This show is so lost, and the directions they took in the second cour really lost me as well, as any sign of writing quality went completely awol.OVERALL: 35/100This show was a mess, and it’s probably not going to end anytime soon, at least in the manga.

The clever guy here managed to get checkmated by some TikTok influencer in the very first 10 mins or so. Why? Idk, maybe he forgor to change settings his character settings, or maybe he...was waiting to pull a fast one. You tell me.

The only key difference is the backstory which seems new from what I've seen, but everything surrounding these guys after is so banal and dull. It took itself too seriously whilst also forgetting simple things to cover first. That reminds me, this Erika girl thought it was funny to sit somewhere wild upon entering Nagi's place because she is rich and doesn't know basic common sense. Lol.

Cuckoos are brood parasites, which means they have the tendency to find a nest from another species of bird that already has eggs in it, remove the other bird\'s eggs and lay their own there, letting the other bird species raise their young. In this way, the cuckoos trick the other birds into keeping the cuckoo eggs warm and caring for the young cuckoos. This is more exasperated in the West, particularly Germany that coins this term: Kuckuckskind a.k.a Cuckoo\'s child, meaning a child whose father is not his biological father, because the mother fathered it with another man and left the child and his social father in the belief that they were related by blood. This colloquially pejorative term as a cuckoo child includes a criticism of the mother who subordinates a child conceived with another man to her (spouse) partner; this designation may be perceived as stigmatizing by the child concerned.And this is exactly what Miki Yoshikawa had in mind when she wrapped up Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo back in 2017 and was just floating around releasing One-shots a.k.a standalone chapters. And of the 3 one-shots stories released in 2019, Kakkou no Iinazuke was the one that was well received enough to get serialized the year after. The story (or literary plot device rather) about babies accidentally switched at birth, only for them to be taken care of by the other family, until they\'ve each grown up to tell them the truth that their biological parents were someone else. This is the case for Nagi Umino and Erika Amano, a boy and a girl fatefully picked up by the other\'s family and raised like their very own, until their sweet 17th birthday that the news is broke to them that despite being cuckoo children, they are forced to be in an arranged marriage (which in these days in Japan has dropped significantly and doesn\'t happen very much anymore). And almost immediately, both Nagi and Erika vehemently refused to this plan, but it\'s not like their parents are willing to give up either. With such a case like this, it\'s a ""do or die"" situation to proceed the relationship as a ""tryout"" with both Nagi and Erika being the wiser to see where it would go.The characters in Kakkou no Iinazuke, believe it or not, goes farther than just the NiseKoi situation of finding which girl holds the key to the MC\'s pendant and then calling it a day to declare the supposed girl the key to his heart as well. Starting off with Nagi, his biological Umino family is a family of the rich, with his father being a hotel tycoon, but thanks to the mix-up he was living a frugal life with the other family and being a close-knit son. In school, he the most stellar person always acclaiming to be that No. 1 spot that he is constantly losing the spot out to one such girl that he also has a crush on. In essence, Nagi has 3 things to worry about: marriage, school and family, and he does not have 3 clones to help him negotiate through troubled waters, because there is a girl each behind each of those situations that he has to balance with as well. I don\'t think I need to say this, but it\'s an intertwining web of perchances, misunderstandings and emotions that\'ll put Nagi on a stand to choose which girl is right for him.On the marriage side, there is the already aforementioned Erika Amano, whom she has distinguished herself as a popular social media celebrity and going to a girls\' school, which has a strict non-tolerance of relationships. Both her and Nagi met out of a mere coincidence when she was trying to take videos that put her safety in peril, and Nagi assumed that she was in danger if she put herself that way to get some views (you know how this all goes). That mere coincidence hit the two off, until they were called forth for the aforementioned marriage arrangement, and making the matter worse, Erika was forced to transfer to Nagi\'s school upon the confirmation that she was hanging out with him. She would be what you call a spoiled brat, thanks to the mix-up that allowed her to live a high life, and initially against Nagi, the two being already living in 2 separate conditions (rich vs. poor) has them bickering like birds from both families agreeing to place them both in a commune house to stimulate conditions living together (like as if they\'re married already). But overtime, she has both softened and hardened her stand towards Nagi, with moves that slowly inch that Nagi would be her desired fiance to come.On the school side, you have Hiro Segawa, the consistent No. 1 student in Nagi\'s grade, and the girl whom Nagi wants to beat her in the literacy department just so that he could confess to her. Other than her family\'s job in a temple and working as a miko, she is the definition of a guilt-trip character, egging people on so that they could reach to that spot, only to tell them that ""Oops, I didn\'t mean it! It\'s just meant for my entertainment to play and toy with your feelings, oopsies *tongue out*"". And this is her relationship with Nagi, with the latter being forced to be better than her, only to know that she\'s engaged as well, but who knows if that is even true in the first place. All she does is guilt-trip over Nagi to lead him to believe that if they weren\'t ""engaged"" in the first place, their relationship could\'ve been so much more than just school rivals.On the family side, Nagi isn\'t the only child in the Umino family. There is also Sachi, but based on her family name, she is in fact Erika\'s biological sister and stands in Nagi\'s family as the adoptive daughter. Sachi is the epitome of every family\'s rebellious kid, one who\'s unable to keep herself in one place, whether will it be following the family or being overly dependent on Nagi which arises on her brocon personality. Being away from Nagi feels tough for the kin who is seeing her brother already engaged with some other girl, and the best way to be close to him is to run away from home and live together with them? That sounds like some shenanigans move right there, and I guess the semblance of the brocon trait also helps her be aware of what\'s he doing also. But then again, we\'ve seen so much brocon and siscon stuff in other shows, and when Sachi herself realizes that she is in conflict with treating Nagi either like a brother or a potential lover, that\'s where she begins to have dangerous feelings, which also pits herself in the direct line of fire against both her older sister Erika and schoolmate rival Hiro.I\'m not surprised that chief director Hiroaki Akagi is handling this alongside Yoshiyuki Shirahata here, at least I can trust the former because he has directed the Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san series and others at Shin-Ei Animation, he\'s almost like a respectable in-house director who knows his talents well. The only exception is Yoshiyuki Shirahata, and this is his debut directorial work here, so at least for his first rondo, give or take, he still has a lot to learn. That being said, to air 2 consecutive cours in a row from Spring to Summer is already a risk given inconsistent production values (even more because of the studio collab with SynergySP), but I\'m legit surprised that it has managed to keep at a fairly consistent level, and rare chances for me to spot any lackluster values in its long run. At the very least, its entertaining to a certain degree.The choice of OST was a little mixed, sadly. The 1st Cour\'s combination with Kiyoe Yoshioka (vocalist of the Japanese duo Ikimonogakari) and Sangatsu no Phantasia was a perfect introduction with striking visuals and seemingly the best efforts done out from both the OP and ED in terms of style and semblance of the song\'s narrations, it\'s almost an instant great start and finish to Spring\'s episode runs. But when it comes towards the 2nd Cour, I get that they were trying to go for the playful affair with sumika and Eir Aoi\'s song combination, but it just seemed so boring in comparison to the strong game set by the 1st half, I\'m like: ""Heck it, just let it finish already."" Other than that, it was just decent on an impressive start, only to dip to a somewhat mediocre end.When it all comes down to it, Kakkou no Iinazuke a.k.a A Couple of Cuckoos needn\'t be this elaborate in its rom-com setting, but when you have something like a cuckoo bird business running around, it\'s gonna get messy. And since this is still an ongoing manga, like KanoKari, it has to pad on for God knows how long this love quadrangle affair needs to be resolved, and that\'s the sad life of a rom-com that doesn\'t have the luxury of knowing when it would end, except by the authors themselves. I was hoping to read the manga before the anime came out, but the adverse came true, and my gut instinct was correct. It\'s definitely a mid-tier series when it comes to rom-coms, though it has its decent moments as well. As for the choice whether to delve in the anime or the manga, I would suggest the anime first then the manga, but it goes without saying this: be prepared for endless padding. name of Miki Yoshikawa, her fame that came from the rom-com that\'s the much beloved Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo a.k.a Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, I\'m left baffling at how one of her most recent works that is Kakkou no Iinazuke a.k.a A Couple of Cuckoos literally turned into a NiseKoi that\'s gone too far and being dragged on to the point of being unsalvageable.But first, an educational lesson about cuckoos.

Full of forced plot progression. A lot of fluff before we get actually plot development that's at the end of each episode. The only thing that's keeping me watching is the opening and animation. This show could have been so much better if they took more time into polishing the characters' writing. If you really want to enjoy this show I suggest you turn off your brain before the brain rot starts. I'm doubtful but hoping there's some sort of resolution by the end of this show.[MINOR SPOILER NOTES BELOW]Pros:-- Eye candy.-- Great...animation.-- Great opening.-- Sachi and Hiro are pretty much the only somewhat likeable characters in the whole series as of episode 5.-- Hiro is possibly the only rational character in this series as of episode 5.Cons:-- Full of forced plot progression.-- Mediocre writing.-- A lot of fluff before we get actually plot development that's at the end of each episode.-- Nagi makes the most ridiculous assumptions that are absolutely cringe.

It's half-baked and strange. Their relationship is very back and forth but overall tolerable.-- Erika is just another tsundere that's predictable and irrational. Likeable in the first episode until she hits us (literally hits the Nagi in his case) with a 180 at the end of the first episode.-- For some reason Nagi and Erika have the qualities of their real parents even though they've spent their entire lives with the other family counterparts.

I like Nagi. Whenever I'm laughing at this manga it's usually because of him. He also feels like a relatable character. For example you are someone who has a sister therefore it's nice to see a realistic brother and sister relationship (well for the most part but well get to that). Next is Erika. I don't feel any strong emotions towards her. I don't dislike her but I don't have anything to say about her as a character.Enjoyment: So Far So GoodOverall: 9/10 but I'm a bit worried what's going to happen between the siblings now?

He\'s assertive,  and he\'ll  say what  is on his mind without hesitation, which helps making  the  show  more  credible at times.+  Aside from the initial situation of  this show with this baby swapping  thing at birth, everything else  feels  coherent. Obviously, in a  slice of  life context,  it doesn\'t seem hard to  achieve  such a feat,  but I\'m trying  to emphasize it  because it\'s done better than in other romcoms. ( I\'m  thinking mostly about  the characters\' profiles, they all make sense and the show/manga  respects the traits given to the chars  along  the story.  )+ It\'s linked with the last point, and  it\'s  kind  of  hard  to describe without spoiling,  but let\'s  say  that regarding the  harem tag, this show  isn\'t ""binary"", usually in those romcoms  there  will be the obviously shy  introverted girl,  then the  obviously extraverted  girl   etc... In  Kakkou no  Iinazuke, while the  female MC   do   have  some common  traits, the  story  remains interesting because their profiles are kind of similar but different enough at the same time. ( I know this might seem like a detail,  but I\'m  writing  about it for the  same  reason mentionned above :  I think this point in particular is done better than the norm for romcoms  )Cons :- This show contains brocon.  Now, to qualify this fact, keep in mind that there\'s  no suggestive scenes at all  (  and this  show  doesn\'t contain that much fanservice btw  ) and   there  is  the usual  excuse  that  those   siblings  aren\'t  blood related,  but yeah, I\'m marking  this as  a con  because   some  viewers will hate the show for  this sole  reason.- I think that the  pace of the story isn\'t  done really well, but  that\'s kind of  a double-edged  criteria.  On  the one  hand, if  you enjoy  the characters and  the  sol  vibe, you\'ll enjoy every episode  and  you\'ll be  glad there are 24 of  them,  but  on  the  other hand, if you are  eager  to  see  some  quick  evolution, plot twists and so on, you\'ll be heavily dissapointed/bored by the show.All in all, I recommend Kakkou no Iinazuke for anyone that enjoys romcom : as a matter of fact, the show has an interesting enough cast, and the dynamics between characters all feel coherent, making  the story  easy to get into  and  you\'ll feel much love for your favorite character(s). The main problem with the show is its rythm/length, I reckon that in the span of 24 episodes, there might not be enough things happening, and you shouldn\'t bother with it if a story focused anime is what you are searching for. Furthermore, this show contains a bit of brocon, nothing unbearable, but it\'s always questionnable to see that kind of stuff. often find  in that  kind of animes, he\'s  similar to  mcs  like  Fuutarou  in  Gotoubun, or  Hachiman in  Oregairu.

And indeed i\'m going to be blunt, the story will probably develop deeper in those 21 episodes remaining and it will lead to a solid harem with the main girl, the fake little sister and the love interest of the MC. Im really doubtful about the quality of the future story but im going to watch it. Or so... That\'s what i said in my first review when this show only had 3 episodes....19 now and it has become exactly what i didnt want it to become. It became an unoriginal and uninteresting show with every possible cliche you can find : siscon, harem, MC forgot about Erika despite the fact they met when they were kids and so on.Another issue with this anime : the light tone in it. Sometimes out of nowhere it tries to introduce some drama scenes but it\'s so random and manichean that it doesnt do anything. Which is a shame because seeing how chaotic relationships are (3 girls in love with the same guy) it could have been way deeper... Once again it\'s your random harem where everything will eventually solve itself throughout the story without any tension between characters. In the end, they\'ll all be friends as if nothing happened which is the most manichean plot i\'ve ever seen in romcom animes.Considering the fact that relationships are wasted in this anime... Is it a decent comedy then ? Well. No.Comedy is random, i dont remember having laught at this show and past the first 5 episodes, it was boring all along. Well past the first 3 episodes tbh. Plot is really simple. Almost each episodes = ""funny"" moments between the MC and a girl (full of cliche scenes) then another girl becomes jealous and she ends up not jealous anymore for some random words MC says... Until the next moment she\'ll be jealous again cuz words wont remove her love. And as i guess that her love for MC will conveniently decrease near the end of the story...Now let\'s talk about the characters. The MC is unoriginal. It\'s the random virgin who studies a lot. Previously, i said he had some potential because he used to be manly fighting againt some scums. Well he\'s not. It\'s indeed your random MC roaming around with beautiful girls while the crowd is amazed by how ugly he is compared to those girls !Erika is quite the interesting girl. She\'s a tiktok insta girl (something that I dont really enjoy IRL despite having a lot of followers on insta, i despise people earning subs by showing superficial pictures to show how beautiful their fake life is). Actually she seems to replace real life friends (she doesnt have any) by followers on instagram. Overall she\'s quite cheerful but not too much and she has a clumsy side as she\'s the child of a wealthy family (classic cliche) but she seems really true.I was expecting a lot more about her, she\'s not bad but i\'m disappointed i was expecting the social network thing to be way more useful in the plot (could have been original and interesting) but it\'s not it\'s just to highlight the fact she\'s a beautiful girl while the MC is bland.The lil sis is a trap. Even though i saw through it right at the beginning. Dont let her fool you she was indeed conflicted with the fact she learnt that she wasnt MC\'s sister and with the fact she has a sister she doesnt know. But past the beginning of the story, her main point wont be this conflicting situation anymore but the fact she\'s in love with her own brother ! (after all it\'s legit he isnt her real bro ! even with a goalkeeper you can still goal !!!) Huuuuh. Im fed up honestly.Finally, the art is really beautiful. Characters are well made with original traits in their drawing (not the MC though), some animations are beautiful, colours are great and some moments are on par with some OVA : flash of lights in the water at night, leaves from sakura trees. Really beautiful scenes i\'m surprised.All in all, i\'m disappointed. It\'s not that terrible unlike some mediocre shows we had those last seasons but... Everything has been wasted by cliche plots and fanservice. If you\'re looking for a great show with a serious story and genuine relationships = keep looking for another anime. If you\'re looking for an easy show to watch (no need to use your brain, no drama, no emotions) then go ahead and try it. Another thing = this show should have been a 12 episode long one. 24 is plainly stupid for an empty show like that. 19 now and it has become exactly what i didnt want it to become. It became an unoriginal and uninteresting show with every possible cliche you can find : siscon, harem, MC forgot about Erika despite the fact they met when they were kids and so on.Another issue with this anime : the light tone in it. Sometimes out of nowhere it tries to introduce some drama scenes but it\'s so random and manichean that it doesnt do anything. Which is a shame because seeing how chaotic relationships are (3 girls in love with the same guy) it could have been way deeper... Once again it\'s your random harem where everything will eventually solve itself throughout the story without any tension between characters. In the end, they\'ll all be friends as if nothing happened which is the most manichean plot i\'ve ever seen in romcom animes.Considering the fact that relationships are wasted in this anime... Is it a decent comedy then ? Well. No.Comedy is random, i dont remember having laught at this show and past the first 5 episodes, it was boring all along. Well past the first 3 episodes tbh. Plot is really simple. Almost each episodes = ""funny"" moments between the MC and a girl (full of cliche scenes) then another girl becomes jealous and she ends up not jealous anymore for some random words MC says... Until the next moment she\'ll be jealous again cuz words wont remove her love. And as i guess that her love for MC will conveniently decrease near the end of the story...Now let\'s talk about the characters. The MC is unoriginal. It\'s the random virgin who studies a lot. Previously, i said he had some potential because he used to be manly fighting againt some scums. Well he\'s not. It\'s indeed your random MC roaming around with beautiful girls while the crowd is amazed by how ugly he is compared to those girls !Erika is quite the interesting girl. She\'s a tiktok insta girl (something that I dont really enjoy IRL despite having a lot of followers on insta, i despise people earning subs by showing superficial pictures to show how beautiful their fake life is). Actually she seems to replace real life friends (she doesnt have any) by followers on instagram. Overall she\'s quite cheerful but not too much and she has a clumsy side as she\'s the child of a wealthy family (classic cliche) but she seems really true.I was expecting a lot more about her, she\'s not bad but i\'m disappointed i was expecting the social network thing to be way more useful in the plot (could have been original and interesting) but it\'s not it\'s just to highlight the fact she\'s a beautiful girl while the MC is bland.The lil sis is a trap. Even though i saw through it right at the beginning. Dont let her fool you she was indeed conflicted with the fact she learnt that she wasnt MC\'s sister and with the fact she has a sister she doesnt know. But past the beginning of the story, her main point wont be this conflicting situation anymore but the fact she\'s in love with her own brother !

Similar to what other people said in their reviews, the show had a lot of gaps and loose ends, but neither of those were solved, this also includes the manga. Ironically, the latter half of the show is somewhat a bait for the viewers to...read the manga to ""know more"" and yet the manga itself became confusing and made more loose ends.Overall, save your time and spare yourself from watching this 24-episode show.

Adorable family moments. Has Nisekoi vibes.Now what sets it apart from other rom-coms, THE MC ISN\'T A COWARD. He is loud and annoying at times but he is very forth coming and wears his heart on his sleeve and actually confesses his feelings at appropriate times. No more of that tired trope that is used to extend series like Love is War and Nisekoi. If either of those story\'s MCs were half the man Nagi is, they would both be so much better. It not relying on the worn out crutch of...the ""will they wont they"" but allows for enjoyable progression with a lot of comical and original situations.It deals with parental expectations, both positive and negative, with things like arranging an engagement or being completely accepting and welcoming of a child who you just recently learned about.One of the most interesting things in the story isn\'t just how they interact with each but also with their long lost families. Saichi especially makes for an adorable younger sister to both of them, and is easily one of my favorite younger sisters in anime.It is amusing hearing Touyama Nao voice Segawa Hiro given her infamous track record of short-haired girls in romance anime. No matter how stacked the cards are against her character you can\'t help but hold out a little hope that she will be the end-game girl.In short an amusing and beautiful rom-com which has quickly become one of my favorites. the ""will they wont they"" but allows for enjoyable progression with a lot of comical and original situations.It deals with parental expectations, both positive and negative, with things like arranging an engagement or being completely accepting and welcoming of a child who you just recently learned about.One of the most interesting things in the story isn\'t just how they interact with each but also with their long lost families.

Not that bad, otherwise I wouldn't have felt like watching any anime, but I simply didn't feel like doing anything else. I also didn't feel like spending a lot of time searching for a new anime to watch, so I happened to click on Kakkou no Iinazuke.Probably due to my state of headache I did find myself enjoying more than expected during the first half. However the second half seemed pointless. I can't say whether it was due to my headache dissipating at that point, or whether the second half was simply much worse....I doubt I would have finished the whole show though without a hangover. So if you've got a hangover, I recommend this with some reservations. Otherwise, stay away.The art and animation seemed bland. They waifus were cute, although Sachi especially seemed to do little else than complain. At least it's realistic for a teenage girl in her defiant phase.The story itself started better than expected, but in the second half little of importance seemed to happen. The basic notion of two children having been swapped at birth isn't anything special, but worked somewhat in the show, however it wasn't really explained how the parents happened to find it out when the two main characters were sixteen. Did the hospital staff suddenly realize they had made a mistake over a decade ago, did they do a DNA test or what?Nagi is a decent main male character for a love comedy at least, as he isn't as whiney and incompetent with women as usual. He even confesses to Hiro early on. The story sets things is motion fairly well, but ends up dropping the ball.The main failing of Kakkou no Iinazuke are plots hooks that seem to go nowhere. A photo is shown of the Amano family with both Erika and Nagi as children, suggesting they'd met as children already. Also Erika reveals that the reason she's uploading images to Inusta is to connect with someone. The show seems to suggest that the main characters are osananajimi although only Erika remembers it, however later it's revealed that the boy in the picture is not Nagi, but his older brother, Sousuke, who has disappeared. Erika wants to find him, but Erika's father (Nagi's biological father) pretends like he doesn't exist. Yet the father had planted the photo purposefully at a summer home so others would see it, suggesting he wants Nagi and Erika to know about the non-existent brother. Yet it's never explained what the father's ultimate plan is.The plot hook about the missing brother is simply terrible, and quite disturbing. It's not explained what kind of events lead to the brother's disappearance and when. Did he have a fight with his parents and ran away, did the brother simply disappear one day and the parents pretended he never existed? Nagi, despite supposedly being smart, doesn't even ask these questions when trying to find him. A child had disappeared when he was underage, and the parents pretended like he doesn't even exist. A reasonable person would suspect foul play and call the police.None of this is explained in the show. If there's a second season, it might be, but so far it doesn't seem likely there will be. That's the main gripe. Kakkou no Iinazuke has 24 episodes instead of the usual 12. They would have had enough time to wrap things up, but instead of doing so, they just keep screwing around in the second half instead of advancing the plot. It felt like a mystery box show where the author doesn't know the truth behind the mysteries, and is just making it up on the go.In the final episode another mystery is hinted at. It shows old pictures with the Umino family with the parents and the children, Nagi and Sachi. Although there's one picture that shows two little girls instead of just Sachi, suggesting that Erika had possibly met her biological family and Nagi a decade ago. Perhaps both Amano and Umino families had conspired to switch their children at birth for unknown reasons, or there was something else going on, but we never find out the truth. This is simply aggravating.Also there is no conclusion which girl does Nagi end up with, or perhaps none of them. Unfortunately this is all too common in anime romantic comedies that the author doesn't have the balls to make a decision and have the story come to a proper conclusion. At least it's made quite clear that Nagi and Erika continue to live betrothed to each other, although time will tell whether they're actually in love or not. I found the ending better than I dared to think. As the amount of episodes left to watch decreased, it grew increasingly clear that the story wouldn't have a proper ending.

The only logical route and girl is, of course, Erika Amano, but, as one might expect, the MC is dense and refuses to admit his feelings for her and see her as a love interest majority of the time.

However, I can\'t blame Sachi for being mad all the time with her brother because she\'s treated like she isn\'t important and is just in the way of his chase for Hiro; why wouldn\'t she be mad? Not to mention when she popped the question, he immediately called her his \'kid sister\' again, even though there was a whole episode of her being mad bc she wanted to be treated like an adult human being.I\'m mad at myself for ignoring other people\'s reviews saying it was bad and going through the whole thing myself.3/10; honestly a waste of time.', '[This review contains the reference from ep 1-6, ive only seen ep6 so far, i hate waiting every week but the wait is worth, trust me on that]Oh yes another HAREM ROMANCE anime, another unlikeable characters, another mediocre generic plot, another rent a girlfriend ripoff, another kanojo mo kanojo ripoff, another TRASH romcom anime.Here we go again, now shut the fck up for a second and hear me out, this show is actually a solid from its genre, the characters are very much likeable unlike some annoying mfs out there, the chemistry and dynamic between the characters is enjoyable and overall good, the comedy is...always right on the spot which is good, the story pacing is just right, and the plot, hell yes its just your typical and generic plot but thats what makes it good on its own is the chemistry between the characters and is what makes it superior than the rest in its genre.We pretty much have this ""typical mc"", typical may be a word with alot of negative connotations but im not talking about it in the anime perspective but in real life, this male lead has the potential to become one of the best harem mcs out there, hes not dense asf unlike the rest of harem mcs out there as he can easily understand and keep a keen in a situation overall hes pretty much a likeable character, and the other 3 characters are ugh...

The main girl bears a strikingly similar personality to those from my previous ventures into the anime realm.The predicament echoes a familiar tune—a forced faux relationship entangling our protagonist, causing ripples in his pursuit of the girl who held his affections prior to this unexpected twist.Artistry, while acceptable, lacks that distinctive flair. Characters exhibit signs of depth and growth, a saving grace amidst the fray.Decent it is, indeed. However, it's disheartening that the heralded romcoms of yore—save for the exemplary Love is War—seem to dwell in the realm of nostalgia.Many fall into a...predictable mold, rendering them unremarkable, a shade of their potential. Though I dare say, Rent a Girlfriend stands tall among the current romcom repertoire, a testament to its quality in this age of familiarity.A footnote, indeed—incest, confined to blood kin, doesn't rear its head here. It teeters on the border of discomfort but does not tread the sis x sis path, a fact that merits clarification amidst the murky waters of societal norms. predictable mold, rendering them unremarkable, a shade of their potential.

I thought that this might be THE romcom I wanted to watch. Not just a 12 episode long series where every episode feels like a filler. (This anime has 24 episodes. Its just an example.) It started pretty good. I was hyped because I thought that the plot is actually pretty deep so It cant be just a ""normal"" romcom. Well, It is. Through the whole series I thought, ""Why do they take this so lightly? They were swapped at birth and meet their real parents after 16 years so why?"" I thought that this anime would be a bit more...serious.It started pretty good, I liked the character and I expected an interesting show. After some episodes, though, I noticed that it isnt what I expected. But here is the thing. You might think ""Then why did you continue to watch it? Just drop it"" Well, everytime I felt like I wanted to drop this anime, something happened that gave me hope. Hope that this anime might still get more interesting. But shortly after, they just continue like nothing happened. At the end of the day, I finished this anime and was dissapointed.Plot: 3/10Yeah, like I said: The start was pretty interesting. Swapped in the hospital by accident and then meeting their real parents 16 years later.The rest, however, was dissapointing. They just did what they always do, like nothing happened. Its like they didnt even care. Its not like they just found out that their family with whom they lived for 16 years isnt their real family.Character: 5/10There was very little character developement. Also, like I said, I dont get how they take their situation so lightly. There were only 2 characters who had a bit of developement in this series. The rest were pretty boring characters. There is one character I though was really interesting but that character had about 10 minuetes of screen time so...Sound and VA: 6/10First of all: The openings. Liked them. It was nothing special but I liked them. Its nothing I would listen to in privat but they were fine.I liked the endings too. The first was better than the second imo. But again, nothing I would listen to in privat.The OST\'s were also pretty basic I guess. Nothing special. The only one I really liked was when someone in the anime thought of something in the past. You will know what I mean if you watched it.The VA\'s were fine. Dont get me wrong, they did a good job. But, Its the same as any other romcom. Nothing too special. Props to the VA of the mc though. The MC screams pretty often and the VA did good.Animation and art: 7/10The animation was pretty decent. I really liked the facial expressions and the character designs. The outfits are also pretty cool.What I liked the most was when a character smiled.So, I will say this: Dont expect too much if you want to watch this anime. You will be dissapointed at the end. serious.It started pretty good, I liked the character and I expected an interesting show. After some episodes, though, I noticed that it isnt what I expected.

After all, a genre is popular because it\'s, well, popular and that means it\'s enjoyed by the masses. I certainly am part of the massesStory:While the whole ""real family"" thing is the basis, it gets forgotten fairly quickly and the whole thing devolves into as I said basic harem rom com and I really wish it didn\'t because the premise is actually great, here\'s hoping it\'ll gain more importance later but so far nothing noteworthyArt:Art is great, everything is colorful except the guy. I kinda wish...they\'d portray him differently because insofar as story goes, he\'s not incompetent and while the girls get a lot of details, the guy is sort of.... there.

Seeing him is super boring, and considering how many generic harem protagonists there are, that\'s saying somethingSound:The VAs do a good job, the BGM is... okay? Not everyone gets to have banger BGM every episode like Kaguya sama but once you\'ve experienced it, anything short feels..... short. Sound effects are not over the top but there\'s nothing memorable in here. OP is good but again nothing memorableCharacter:Characters are well defined and don\'t seem TOO outlandish. For some reason the ""popular but no friends"" trope is used too much and I don\'t like it but the characters themselves behave quite normally.One thing I enjoy is that this time around the guy is capable of processing social cues, unlike many other protagonists who can\'t identify social cues if they\'re dancing naked right in front of himEnjoyment:The art is great and that helps a lot with enjoyment. Each story doesn\'t progress too fast but not too slow either, plenty of time to understand what\'s going on but things don\'t drag on. I think that\'s far more important than great characters because generic tropes with good pacing is better than uniques with shitty pacing.Overall:So far so good. It doesn\'t have anything too exciting but interesting enough that I wanna know what\'s next. they\'d portray him differently because insofar as story goes, he\'s not incompetent and while the girls get a lot of details, the guy is sort of.... there.

While the plot sounds like it would make for an interesting romance story, it really is nothing like what it should be. The entire series plays out like a horrible version of Toradora! where the MC is ""in love"" with another girl while ""engaged"" to his fiance, but it is a horrible comparison to put it up against something like Toradora! because there really are little to no redeeming factors for the series.The story hardly ever progresses. In the early episodes, it feels like it is leading up to something more, while they develop the characters and you watch as the studious and diligent Nagi clashes with his fiance, the Famous Inusta Influence, Erika. Beyond the first few episodes, everything after that just continued to get duller and duller for the story. The romance hardly actually progresses, and I\'m not sure if it is because of the hard-headedness of each character, or just the cause of poor character development.They mention multiple times in the series that ""You seem to have changed lately"" in a positive tone, but it is relatively impossible to actually notice any change between the characters from episode 1 to episode 24. With that, the characters are really just....disinteresting and bland. The background characters are all absolutely god awful to the point where I actually started skipping the scenes where any of them were talking (Shion might genuinely be one of my least favorite characters of any anime to date). Even the Main Characters just become bland as the story becomes more and more flat.There wasn\'t even really a redeemable season finale to make this feel like it was a worthwhile watch, it ended the same way as it began, mediocre. I was extremely excited to watch this anime because I heard good things on it originally, but I genuinely can\'t resonate with any of those positive opinions. Bland characters, a dull story-line, non-progressing development. Even if this was just a S.o.L without the romance, it still wouldn\'t even qualify in my personal top 50 of the genre.This would get a lower score if I haven\'t personally watched significantly worse series\' but I still can\'t rate it anything more than just ""bad"". I can almost see where some people may find an appeal to this series, but if they are finding it here, they can most definitely find it in a more significant quantity in dozens of other/better series\'.Animation: 5/10Voice Acting: 5/10Art: 4/10Story: 2/10Characters: 3/10 more reasons to dislike it than there was to actually enjoy it.

', ""It's like my 3rd review out of the 200+ shows I've watched and I'm writing just to warn you that don't waste 8 hours on this thing.(Mild spoilers ahead)It started as a romance and switched genre to harem midway and in these 24 episodes nothing happened besides that like no noticeable progress. The One or Two weak attempts on mysteries weren't answered, no kiss or anything like that, MC still doesn't know what he's going to do and I'm pretty sure this won't be getting a 2nd season so no need to waste 8 hours on an epilogue like content. "", ""Rejoice, all guilty-pleasure seekers! Because this show presents itself with all the requirements to make a satisfying junk food show.Should a brain rot story be a pleasant show? Well, yes, but with strict conditions. The obvious one is the audiovisual aspects. It's no jaw-dropper that these shows have their specific niche of an audience, me included, if you may. We might desire the best-looking waifu, the perfect synchronization of character portrayal by the voice actors, the array of potential harem targets, or simply the fanservice factor. The show might even be better off without any needless genre. The bottom line is: I dare say...Kakkou no Iinazuke have delivered all of the points above with such a fine execution.The show has given us several charming scenes revolving around the supposedly main protagonist pair. We know how some plot points will fold out. The cliches are so apparent that some might even call it tolerable but neither good nor bad. By seeing the title, the premise is already explained to some extent. The allure of freedom and love vs. parental decision is there, so it's hard to dislike, even though arranged marriage in rom-com is an overused trait.So far, the background story of everyone is still foggy, so there is a potential for a future pick-up in the story. But, for now, just enjoy whatever fanservice the show might throw at us.Have to say, the VAs do be carrying this show quite a lot. At least so much so that it weighs its worth to be an adaptation. The main heroine, Erika, is the one with the highest screen time right now, and with Kitou Akari voicing her, she definitely sounded like your typical princess character with a very whimsical feature. Well, nothing new there, so I am waiting for more Hiro and Sachi screen time. Especially Sachi, since she's the more interesting character to voice, in my opinion.Lastly, some appreciation for a proper main protagonist in the form of Umino Nagi. There is a need for a good portrayal of someone to pair with the heroines. Even though it sounded like the most sensible thing to do,  believe it or not, some shows actually failed to do that. While it's not a rare occurrence in the genre, Nagi seemingly has okay chemistry with Erika does make the show fulfilling.

Not-so-average protag is a good thing, and the VAs and Art quality make it aesthetically good. Hope it stays that way.PROS (so far):-Protag having a personality and not being an insert-self character has been a good thing so far.-Good VA, BGM, and Art quality are making this very easy to watch.-It\'s also doing...well with the pacing and planting of story seeds. Pretty sure the first half will mostly be a setup/build-up spot and, it\'s looking like they\'re not planning to rush anything... at least I\'d hope so (They\'ll have 24 episodes to play with. No excuses when this ends up being all over the place).CONS (so far):-The ""Real Family"" issue seems to have been taken too lightly. I get that it\'s just an excuse to put the leading characters in a complicated situation and that it\'s for a comedy story but, it was still the reason why I, personally, got interested in this initially. They might go deeper into that at some point (Idk as I haven\'t read the source material) so, I guess we\'ll see.-Not much unique substance from Erika yet. So far, her character is only being entertaining when Nagi is onscreen as well to play the straight man to her Funny-woman during comical bits. The newly introduced Segawa on the other hand, has shown a little twist on her character. But it\'s not fair to compare her to Erika yet as she just showed up and pulled a comically surprising twist. well with the pacing and planting of story seeds.

Nisekoi 2.0, IMHO, but without the gravitas to make me want to continue watching.', ""SWEET HOME JAPALABAMA!!The premise to “A Couple of Cuckoos” is simple. Nagi, a gloomy, honour student with no friends and a mean right hook who comes from a poor family discovers he was swapped at birth with Erika, a beautiful, semi-famous and kinda stupid influencer with no friends who comes from a rich family. Their parents decide to arrange for them to be married as a way of solving that slight mix up so they can be both sets of parents children. However, this doesn’t sit well with Nagi because he only has eyes for Segawa, a beautiful, over-competitive honour student at his school, and...it doesn’t sit well with Erika as she's fiercely “independent” and hates having decisions made for her. It also doesn’t sit well with Nagi’s bratty little sister Sachi either, who kind of likes the thought of her brother not being her brother at all for harem anime reasons that you can probably guess if your brain has been poisoned enough. Did you get all that? Good.Although the show uses a lot of old harem tropes such as accidental boob grabs, the main couple forced to live together, prolonged will they won’t they moments interrupted by coincidental accidents, etc, etc, it’s surprisingly entertaining. This is definitely down to the extremely likeable core cast of characters, who have strong, memorable personalities and character chemistry, so the story is able to mix and match between the four whenever and comedy will ensue.Despite how safe the show feels as a harem rom-com there are enough subversions to make it stand out from it’s trashy peers. The cast is small so we spend a lot of time getting to know them as people instead of having a new, shallowly produced girl being awkwardly squeezed into the harem every other week to try and shake things up, there’s an actual, real love confession made by episode 4, Nagi has an actual personality and although he’s not good with women he’s not a wimp who can’t stand up for himself or speak his mind, although the fan service is still present it’s usually Nagi doing the accidental stripping and I like the mascot they use to censor his peep-peep, and the show is actually laugh out loud funny which if you’ve watch a lot of harem rom-coms you’d know is rare. Segawa became one of my favourite characters very quickly.It’s not perfect as a show though. The animation is fine, but it could be better, and I do not like Shion, the forced, male “best friend” side role who I actually think I’m supposed to dislike as part of that subversion I was talking about, but his vibe ends up clashing with the core cast too much and it’s annoying. I also think the actual romance is a bit too slow and meandering at points. There are some moments between Nagi and one of the three love interests which feel distractingly forced and it can really takes you out of a scenes believability, but when it does get those moments right the show can be surprisingly sweet.“A Couple of Cuckoos” is totally ludicrous even for a slice-of-life harem anime, but if gotta admit, it’s very enjoyable. A real “Romeo and Juliet” story once you’ve take two steps backwards and asked yourself “What the fuck?…”.I was a bit worried that this would be the anime equivalent of a southern-American mouth-breather and admittedly it felt that way a few times, but not enough to stop me from watching and enjoying this very silly yet, very fun harem show.7/10 Good. it doesn’t sit well with Erika as she's fiercely “independent” and hates having decisions made for her.

Good.Although the show uses a lot of old harem tropes such as accidental boob grabs, the main couple forced to live together, prolonged will they won’t they moments interrupted by coincidental accidents, etc, etc, it’s surprisingly entertaining. This is definitely down to the extremely likeable core cast of characters, who have strong, memorable personalities and character chemistry, so the story is able to mix and match between the four whenever and comedy will ensue.Despite how safe the show feels as a harem rom-com there are enough subversions to make it stand out from it’s trashy peers. The cast is small so we spend a lot of time getting to know them as people instead of having a new, shallowly produced girl being awkwardly squeezed into the harem every other week to try and shake things up, there’s an actual, real love confession made by episode 4, Nagi has an actual personality and although he’s not good with women he’s not a wimp who can’t stand up for himself or speak his mind, although the fan service is still present it’s usually Nagi doing the accidental stripping and I like the mascot they use to censor his peep-peep, and the show is actually laugh out loud funny which if you’ve watch a lot of harem rom-coms you’d know is rare. Segawa became one of my favourite characters very quickly.It’s not perfect as a show though. The animation is fine, but it could be better, and I do not like Shion, the forced, male “best friend” side role who I actually think I’m supposed to dislike as part of that subversion I was talking about, but his vibe ends up clashing with the core cast too much and it’s annoying. I also think the actual romance is a bit too slow and meandering at points. There are some moments between Nagi and one of the three love interests which feel distractingly forced and it can really takes you out of a scenes believability, but when it does get those moments right the show can be surprisingly sweet.“A Couple of Cuckoos” is totally ludicrous even for a slice-of-life harem anime, but if gotta admit, it’s very enjoyable. A real “Romeo and Juliet” story once you’ve take two steps backwards and asked yourself “What the fuck?…”.I was a bit worried that this would be the anime equivalent of a southern-American mouth-breather and admittedly it felt that way a few times, but not enough to stop me from watching and enjoying this very silly yet, very fun harem show.7/10 Good."", 'This anime made me miserable absolutely miserable.The leading characters didn’t get any time togetherIt was always him and secondary charactershaving moments together and itwas honestly a let down.The plot started off promising but most of the episodesweren’t even focused on their engagement orthem growing together it was a really big let down....Like why introducethe two main characters in the beginning ifthey aren’t going to have any romantic moments?He might as well have been engaged to Segawa.They should have introduced Segawa and Nagiin the first episode instead of him and Erika.Honestly just very disappointing.The art style was good but everything else genuinely sucked.

And the opening of Kakkou no Iinazuke is pretty great. It\'s punchy, catchy, creative, vibrant, well directed and animated, and overall just feel-good. Everything this anime isn\'t.Warning: This review CONTAINS SPOILERS (but this show sucks and has very poor sense of foreshadowing so it honestly doesn\'t matter) and is quite longThe Westermarck Effect is clearly a product that has not yet found import into Japan. I haven\'t seen such aggressive pandering on incest since Domestic Girlfriend. But whilst Domestic Girlfriend actually went into the...characters\' psyches and explored how a relationship such as being in love with your (not like they\'re blood related) sibling could actually impact your life and the relationships of the people around you, this series doesn\'t scratch a single micrometer past its initial gimmick. And that\'s the whole problem with this show- it\'s all just pandering without any sort of pay-off. There\'s a distinct lack of any sort of direction being applied to this series outside of being a pure, cold-blooded advert for the manga because I make no small assertion when I say this anime, at it\'s hollow core, does nothing. Absolutely nothing.The cast is made up of some of the most unlikable dregs hauled over from the south side of Rent A Girlfriend. We have our supposedly smart male protagonist who lacks any sort of common sense. We have the classmate he has a crush on. We have the one he was swapped at birth with and is engaged to and is the most nonsensical tsundere I have ever seen. And we have the little sister. None of these characters have any sort of redeeming qualities to them and none of them rise above the haphazardly -stapled-together-skeleton of tropes and cliches they are made of. I\'ll get into more detail on them later. The anime sets him up quite well early on as he has a goal of winning the heart of his classmate Segawa Hiro by taking first place in school marks since she has a strong inclination towards those better than her yet the MC always remained second-best to her. It\'s this small plot point that mixes with his mutually-unwanted engagement with the second harem member Amano Erika that drives the story for the first few episodes as the anime focuses on the hi-jinks and escapades which result from such a ridiculous situation.Umino Nagi - our proud harem protagonist - is just every other generic harem protagonist who is perverted, indecisive, always misunderstands every situation, selfish, and just a huge moron in general - yet he somehow is surrounded by girls who like him for no reason. I\'m constantly surprised by how stupid the anime can make him look every episode. It\'s actually impressive how awful he is. When given a simple thought experiment to determine who he loves, he ends up with all three of the main girls (including his own sister mind you) and it\'s this indecisiveness that kills any sort of serious character interaction in this show. Segawa Hiro seems like a nice girl at first but the actions she takes as the series goes on - especially near the end - are so bizarre and almost cruel. I\'m sure she was intended to have some sort of implication that she wanted to escape from her fate (she\'s also engaged against her will) but she practically constantly leads-on Nagi with various ""dates"" and other fun interactions - knowing that he likes her - and yet afterwards always ends with ""Yeah no I\'m engaged"" which ditches him in his mire of indecisive thoughts and a cold, ambiguous feeling of what her real feelings are. It\'s not just the main character being naturally a massive idiot who overthinks things but Segawa doesn\'t help at all.Of course this means nothing actually happens between them the entire runtime of this anime. And get used to that because nothing happens with every other contrived plot the author managed to shit out. Amano Erika is supposedly the main girl of he show given her status as the main character\'s fiance and the token tsundere of the harem. Yet for her supposed importance she is given very little spotlight. Her interactions with the male lead are limited and forced. And it was so easy for it not to be since she shares the same opinion with our male lead that arranged marriages in the modern world is stupid and they could have naturally build up from that. Instead, because this anime has no concept of pacing, her time on the screen is butchered apart and smeared thin throughout the anime. Because of this there\'s no consistency between her actions. Is she trying to help Nagi get together with Segawa like in the first few episodes? Or is she being a jealous bitch trying to ruin that pairing at all cost like in most of the second half? Because we see so little of what she thinks and feels all if it is jarring to say the least. She\'s also the one who introduces one of the stupidest and out-of-place plot twist in fiction with the introduction of her (Nagi\'s biological) older brother near the goddamn end of the show. It\'s a valiant attempt to give her any sort of personality and try to justify her also starting to lead on Nagi but it comes off as unnecessary and too-little-too-late. And how does this anime treat this pretty important plot development which is almost as contrived and bullshit as Nisekoi\'s keys? Nothing. I told you this show doesn\'t do any sort of payoff.And finally there\'s the little sister Umino Sachi. I don\'t know where Japan\'s obsession with incest is but I can honestly forgive that as a simple quirk if only she was given any sort of writing to explain why she is so thirsty for her brother. The anime just writes this off as ""Oh yeah, incest. That\'s a thing"" and shoves it down our throats without questioning exactly how these two siblings would develop any sort of romantic feelings towards each other. They literally just do it to pander to the incest imouto audience because it is quite literally just dropped in like Sachi goes all ""Oh so he\'s not my biologically-related brother that means I can sleep with him"". The series makes no attempt to explore anything about her developing feelings towards Nagi and it plays the same game of ""Will they won\'t they"" with those two as it does with Nagi and every other girl. And you know what\'s worse? The anime actively encourages the shipping between Nagi and his sister. Segawa, Erika, and the poorly-written father guy are not averse to such a relationship and I can deduce this to be more pandering from the writers. It wouldn\'t even be so bad if Sachi was actually given any sort of personality but she never steps outside the ""imouto who is jelly of her onii chan and wants his dick"" circle. And she isn\'t even the only incest wannabe. Erika is also unable to escape such a fate as the author seems to believe that it is not possible for siblings to grow up together and NOT want to bone each other. It really baffles my mind how such a simple premise was turned into unironic incest pandering this hard without the full intention of the hack of an author.I haven\'t seen a piece of romance fiction where the characters have this little chemistry with each other. It\'s written like some predictive text AI that was fed bargain bin mid-2000s harem anime because the anime seems to think that loud and funny interactions is the way people grow to like each other romantically when in fact the end product is contrived, uninspired, and generic and doesn\'t make me like the characters in any way. Thanks to the actual lack of substance in the screenplay, this has got to be one of the slowest anime ever made. It has 24 episodes yet the amount of major developments is small and spread thin. Half of every episode is narrative chafe that pads out it\'s runtime with the aforementioned loud haha funnies. The actual ""story"" so to say is mostly made up of a bucket list of every harem romcom ever made and there\'s little done to add any sort of twist to it. It\'s so generic I could see the curve of every half-baked interaction between the characters and tell exactly where the story was going at every minute. There\'s almost no setup for any of the few plot points that grind this anime along its rusty tracks and the anime ends seemingly in the middle of an arc so there\'s no resolution to any of these initial setups. Though you can forgive yourself for being unable to find any sort of story arc in this show since it\'s mostly made up of random scenes that are hastily glued together with little thought as to what level of progress the characters are actually on. And yeah they do progress. Slowly. Eventually. Sometimes. As the series went on it became a complete chore to watch. I got tired after the male lead walked in on a bath scene like it was 2003 (which was played completely straight). I got tired after the 5th time the little sister basically said she wanted to bone her brother. I got tired after the 7th time the parents outshone the rest of the cast but quickly got shafted. I got tired after the 7th time Erika did some poorly designed and drawn cosplay as some sort of attempt to give her a quirky character trait but ended up being a cringe-fest instead. I got tired after the 9th time they brought up ""fate"" as a theme but then immediately abandoned it for more stupid scenes. I got tired after the 5th time this one comic relief character whose whole shtick is that he\'s the funny man whose name no-one remembers isn\'t being funny at all. I got tired when they tried to bait a new character (the missing childhood friend trope) very late into the series in a hypothetical second season. I just got tired.The animation is like the story and characters - hollow and lifeless. Off-model and awkward movement is the norm for the entire anime from the first episode to the last. There are even scenes where there is more than one character and each character looks like they were drawn by two different people who didn\'t check what the other was doing. There are plenty of examples of the characters looking less like humans and more like garden gnomes since their heads are drawn way larger than the proportion of their bodies. And the same is true for the opposite in many shots where the head is too small. I would like to say this happens only a few times but it\'s an epidemic in this series. It really feels like no one checked it and everything was rushed. The actual anime also has a cheap feel to it with it\'s terribly bland colour scheme and it\'s often poor mixing of backgrounds and foregrounds. The cheap feeling also spills over into the direction. There\'s an uncomfortably high frequency of extreme close-up shots of the character\'s faces for literally no reason. It\'s especially prevalent just past the halfway point of the show where I was mostly internally screaming at the screen to just pull back the camera for even a few seconds because the camera was that close to the character\'s mug shots. To be fair most of the wide-angle shots are poorly animated so this must have been a way to save on time since faces are less detailed than full bodies. There\'s very little polishing done in this show outside of some select few scenes and indeed this show can look good. I think the character designs are generally quite cute and the opening gives us some nice expressions and body language we never see in the rest of the show.The music is similarly boring to listen to. I really don\'t remember any unique songs in the entire 2 cour runtime that made me think of anything.Only both opening songs are worth remembering in any capacity. The voice acting was passable for the most part though half of the cast seemed to phone-in their roles. Touyama Nao gets man-of-the-match for managing to not sound completely bored the entire time and actually trying to make the terrible script work. Poor Kitou Akari and Ishikawa Kaito should fire whoever got them their respective roles since there was nothing they could say that wasn\'t filled with cringe. Kitou Akari does a good performance for the most part and I could feel from the character that she was having some fun. But of course her character is completely butchered and she can\'t even get 5 seconds of great emotional acting. Poor Kouhara Konomi doesn\'t sound like she got any sort of direction at all. She\'s fine for the most part but she does get some of the worst lines in the anime aside from Ishikawa.If I\'ll be honest I personally started this show because I wanted to see some of that mid-2000s\' cheesiness. Maybe I could capture the free pre-censor-happy spirit from that time that is translated for the modern audience to enjoy and generally just have a good-hearted vibe. But instead I got egregious pandering, some of the worst waifu baiting from the modern era that all started with Nisekoi, a nonsensical tone, and a complete lack of direction on behalf of the author, writers, and directors who simply used this cheaply-made anime as an advert for an equally slow and insipid manga. And yes I checked a small part of the manga since I couldn\'t believe the lack of faith I felt from this project. Maybe the staff genuinely put their heart into adapting this work but were beset by common troubles leading to the poor quality. Maybe they just did it for the paycheck since SynergySP are a relatively small studio who had to collaborate with the larger but-still-obscure Shin Ei Animation. I heavily suspect that there was some break-down in communication that lead to such an awful product being produced. But I can\'t give a pass on the author on this one. I haven\'t read Yamada and the 7 witches but from what I\'ve heard it\'s a pretty standard romcom harem as well but a generally well-respected one in the community. I have no idea if he watched Eromanga Sensei and thought that was the way to go but damn I hope this doesn\'t spread further.So yeah this anime is pretty bad. I can\'t believe I found a worse harem romcom than fucking Rent A Girlfriend. That anime has far more despicable characters but it was at least somewhat interesting to watch what with seeing the main ""character"" self-destructing the entire time. Kakkou no Iinazuke offers far less. It\'s pandering to it\'s absolute zenith at the cost of any sort of positive writing. 24 episodes man. You could do way better.Thanks for reading if you made it this far. characters\' psyches and explored how a relationship such as being in love with your (not like they\'re blood related) sibling could actually impact your life and the relationships of the people around you, this series doesn\'t scratch a single micrometer past its initial gimmick.

Also Idk how Sachi is feeling because her brother is engaged to her biological sister- or for the parents their kid that they care for is engaged to their biological child-. interesting but totally invested! im kinda sad with nagi's character design. all the other characters have nice colored hair and his is plain black, not that thats bad, it doesnt fit the theme and makes him stand out. anyway cant wait for this show to end only cus i need an ending!"", ""The love interests are similar to a couple of pretty stickers, the main exception being that one might be blood-related. Honestly, the characters are more 2-D than a blank piece of paper. Five episodes into the anime the only growth we've had has been directly contradicted in the very next scene. Is the dynamic good between the two main characters? No, it sucks. Isn't it supposed to be that way so that you get to see them become closer? Maybe, but it's done badly enough that there's no way anyone would even care. Everything else about the show is perfectly okay and nothing more.

I knew when I reached about episode 19 that there was way more that needed to be done in order to close this off in the next five episodes and it never properly was. They just cut ties and left those...storylines broken right off. Nagi disappoints me more than any of the characters because he never made any improvement for the entire series.

I believe every store teller should have their freedom and it beautiful in its own way and the animes that I enjoy, I give them a great score considering the efforts put on to make the show for me to just watch it in so less time.Back to the review now. I had High Hopes from this anime and the start was okayish but then they messed up real bad! I mean I was...basically watching an anime in which the influencer was using her smartphone and unfortunately I am not into that stuff..I mean imagine switching on your TV and finding the Main Characters just goofing around and watching TV without any real progress in the show.The Character design is good and is similar to Love and Lies (even the concept is somewhat) except for the MC who looks like the MC of an average isekai with a weird hairstyle maybe. The show is no fun to be honest (for me that is) obviously some people might find it watchable but trust me, there are better animes to spend your time on..rewatching an anime is better than watching it in my opinion. Even the story's pace is kinda slow. And all the sibling stuff is weird and literally it feels like incest..Well I have watched Domestic Girlfriend and Scum's wish and they were terrible but man this is awkward too. (I didn't rate those animes that high either) but man I feel even scum's wish is a better anime than this (even though its hard to deal with the cringeness).It had a great concept but Man did they messup big! Even love and Lies messed things up but this was on a different level. Nagi (MC) as a character himself sometimes feel of a very less importance. Basically what I hate the most in this anime is the social media obsessed girls! We don't watch animes to see the shit that's actually there on earth itself and we have to see everyday!

Perhaps it's part of the decline of the harem romcom in general; one can only watch the same trope a finite amount of times...before feeling bored and disengaged.

Hope more 24 Episoders are made like this so they don't feel as rushed."", 'To be completely fair, I wasn\'t expecting a ton from A Couple of Cuckoos, and while it\'s not really a snoozer of a series, not enough high points were introduced into the series, and any dramatic parts feel half-done.Story & Characters: A Couple of Cuckoos introduces us to a family of four - Nagi Umino, his sister Sachi, and their parents, who run a small family-run restaurant.  Nagi has had a long crush on Hiro Segawa, and he considered her to be his rival because they both bounce back and forth between being at the top of their class.  After school one day,...Nagi runs into Erika Amano, who is a pretty popular Instagram-er (or whatever they call their version).  Thus, we see pretty early on this that series is likely going for a comedy-style Harem series between Nagi and our three female characters.  Nagi is eventually brought out to dinner where his parents tell him that he was actually swapped at birth... with Erika Amano.  Both them, and Erika\'s parents have brought them together, as they feel they\'d make an excellent couple in an arranged marriage.I didn\'t hate the premise of the first few episodes, as it seemed mildly interesting.  Erika\'s clearly very popular and spoiled, but she\'s not that bright in terms of her school work.  She\'s been given everything because of her father\'s wealth and her interactions with him are actually reasonably amusing.  Nagi\'s quite the opposite - he\'s extremely hard working, doesn\'t have the wealthiest parents and does everything he can to make sure they\'re well off.  However, I just didn\'t see the chemistry between these two.  Now, the goal of any decent harem might be to make sure the other female cast members aren\'t far ahead of the others, so maybe this is planned, but there weren\'t enough quality interactions that made this arranged marriage feel like much of anything.  Add to that Nagi acts like too much as your typical male-in-a-harem character, and this series doesn\'t really shine on him as much as you\'d like.  Sure, he\'s smart and is decently considerate of others, but there\'s not enough there.Hiro doesn\'t fit into the typical harem trope quite as much, as there are some surprising elements in her story that could make you root for her.  Sachi doesn\'t get quite as much inclusion as the others until the second half, and even when she does, it doesn\'t feel like she fits particularly well.  Her backstories are never explored, and it just makes her come off as the fourth character.  Shion gets introduced in the second half as a fan of Erika\'s, but he\'s honestly so annoying that you really cringe at anything he says.  He doesn\'t fit into the crew and he\'s not even the least bit amusing.  Both Nagi and Erika\'s parents are decently involved in the story, and both their dads have some decent elements to them every now and then.  As a whole though, the side characters don\'t bring enough to this story, and Nagi and Erika make an incredibly awkward couple.The story never feels like it gets going quite enough.  Maybe that\'s on purpose because you have to stretch the story across two cours, but it just felt slow and lacking much of a direction.  You know the goal is to see how well Nagi and Erika end up together, and while I\'m okay with their interactions if you\'re looking at this from the standpoint that you want these two to ""start"" to date, as opposed to getting married, that\'s not what this series is trying to sell you on.  There needed to be more about our characters that made us care, and while there was certainly some of that, it feels halfway done, not the least of which is when the series tried to force a character who Erika used to know into the story, then completely ditch the idea without reason.  The series doesn\'t have to be a drama series, but there needs to be more to make us care about our characters.As you get past the second half, the series does move forward in some meaningful way that made it more tolerable than the first.  Living arrangements change, characters meet with outside side characters and they seem to care more about each other as things happen.  That part does shine a little here and there.  The way the series ends does end up being a little awkward though because, even the finale was fine, it didn\'t really feel like a finale.  It just felt like another episode.  Maybe there\'s more to come as the source materially gets worked on, but unless it ends, I\'m not sure there will be enough to hold me for much longer.  (Story: 5/10, Characters: 6/10)Art: This series looked decent enough, and I\'m happy to report that the animation didn\'t really suffer the way many other seasonal series does as it carries on.  The way the series attempts to use visuals to make you feel surprised for brief moments are also done decently well as well.  Fan service is kept to a minimum too, which is something surprising considering the genre. (7/10)Sound: The sound was fine and not distracting, which is good for a series like this.  Neither OPs or EDs were terrible either.  VO work was a bit of a mixed bag, though our main cast with Lindsay Sheppard (Erika), Nicholas Andrew Louis (Nagi), Bryn Apprill (Sachi) and Amanda Lee (Hiro) seemed fine.  It felt like Lee tried too hard to sound like the other two female actresses at times, is all.  Brendan Blaber (Shion) and Dave Dixon (Mr. Amano) both felt weird at times.  Gianni Matragrano (Mr. Umino) was definitely perfect for the part though.  (7/10)Overall: A Couple of Cuckoos doesn\'t really live up to what I was hoping it would be, as it falls into a lot of harem tropes rather easily, and ditches parts of the story here and there.  The sense of progression as the series goes on is definitely present, but the lacking in closure on the ending didn\'t make it feel like a really strong ending to a series.  There\'s just too many hole in the story, and I\'m not sure I pick this up, should it continue, unless I know it\'s ending from the source material.

Adding the spoiler warning just in case someone thinks the minor details I provide are spoilery.At the start of the anime, it was the typical rom-com. And in typical fashion, the girl that the main character sees first always ends up being the main love interest. The more the anime went on, the more and more I disliked the main character's biological father until I ended up fully despising him. I also ended up disliking his sister for basically being a spy in order to eat fancy food all the time. As for Erika, she's pretty annoying. The basic tsundere-type. For once...I wanted a manga/anime that would subvert my expectations and let the main character get the girl he originally wanted. Yet in the last 2 episodes, they totally change her character's personality into some bad girl that loves booze. Why do all manga/anime follow the same bland linear path instead of subverting people's expectations? It's like I am watching the same stuff over and over. Main character sees girl, funny/awkward things happen in the first episode, plot forces them into situations, plot introduces other love interests that end up being pointless, character's personas change abruptly, main character gets with first girl even if it seems forced in the end. I mean, I give the animation and sound a 10/10. As for the story, it barely gets a 7 from me. I'm being generous since the story isn't complete garbage. Just tired of the same old plot.

Then it just turned into another RomCom, Harem anime. It should of been a litte more...interesting and faster paced. It felt way to slowly paced.

But what did they do?They made 24th episode.   So our main character Nagi has a crush named Segawa-san, She is perfect Mary Sue but our boy Nagi is gonna win her heart by passing her at grades and finally confess his love to her. Why does he do that? Because our Mary Sue likes people smarter than her. At the start of anime after we see him with his brocon sister Sachi, Nagi meets with Erika when she is trying to take a photo on a bridge because of Instagram likes....So Nagi gets this wrong way and tries to save her by groping her. We basically learn that She is an Instagram influencer and her family wants her to marry with some stranger. And as you all can guess that stranger is our boy Nagi. So It turns into a love rectangle between Sachi Erika and Segawa. And all 23 episodes you can see that main ship is Segawa x Nagi. Also they stay at some hotel together and just when ship is gonna win. Segawa says let\'s buy alcohol and at that moment i knew that anime is done.  So Let\'s see Segawa actually confesses that she wants to marry Nagi then I ask you the viewers why she is looking for alcohol when she can win this shipping game.  Also Nagi is still in love with Segawa at 23th episode. and now worst episode ever 24th episode Erika suddenly gets sick and Nagi suddenly falls in love with her.(BRO WTF IS THIS WRITING). Sachi and Segawa quit after hearing that. Look there\'s literally no reason for him to pick Erika all of a sudden. Nothing happened. This anime is using ""Nagi-kun change my fate"" line all the time. Like this was the main theme of the anime. Nagi was trying to change Segawa\'s fate by passing her on grades and we can also say he was trying to change Erika\'s by trying to find her brother. But Anime finished before they even found that BROTHER.I mean They could write Erika ending after they found Erika\'s brother.(It would have been better but we still on team SEGAWA). They also showed us some white haired girl at the finale for NO REASON.  As for Sachi, she didn\'t even had a chance. I think she tried to confess at episode 20 but nobody had a gut but Segawa-san.Anyway sorry for bothering you with my poor Grammar skills.

First half of the anime got be. I was starting to enjoy felt like a harem. You know there is 24 episode in this anime not 12 but 24. So i thought in my mind it would be good. When i was watching it through 15 episode it felt really boring. You know a typical boring ahh romance anime. Normaly shitty romance anime would only have 12 episode but this has 24 episode. Its all about engagement. Two girls and one boy. The main character boy...loves another girl who is engaged. I thought in the last episode or 23 he will choosse between those two girls. But guess what? the whole fucking plot was chaged. The plot was the most shittest plot i have ever seen in my entire life. Like god damn 24 fucking episode for the shittest plot. I dont recommend this anime as it was a waste of time. My whole time was wasted watching this absolute trash.  Legit no one asked for that plot. No character development at all. No happy endning. Instead why not make it 12 episode waste of timeEnjoyement-6/10 throughout 10 episode onlyRomance- 2/10 absolute trashDevelopment-2/10 shit plotOverall-3/10 not enjoyable waste of time loves another girl who is engaged. I thought in the last episode or 23 he will choosse between those two girls. But guess what? the whole fucking plot was chaged. The plot was the most shittest plot i have ever seen in my entire life.

Fast forward 10 episodes later and I\'m basically obsessed, every time Erika and Nagi are interacting on screen this is just about as good as romcoms get for me. I don\'t know how the writers managed...to create two characters who get along so well but I\'m definitely not complaining. Man it sure would be a shame if this show were to introduce a new love interest, who so happened to be painfully boring and drag down every scene she\'s in... Unless?Man where do I even start with Segawa, undoubtedly one of my least favourite harem characters of all time and oh boy is it not for no good reason - for starters, she has the personality of an old, sort of soggy McDonalds Chicken Nugget, and our main character Nagi is only into her for a single reason - her intelligence. Nagi, my boy, soon you will learn that people can in fact be attractive for other things aside from some stupid quest you have to become the top in your class. It\'s honestly laughable how little she compares to Erika, someone who literally brightens up every scene she graces vs. Segawa making me eye roll at just about everything she says later on. Oh but it doesn\'t stop there, in fact we\'re just getting started - imagine if the show focused on Erika for the first half and then proceeded to throw away essentially all of that development and focus entirely on Segawa, while you (the viewer) are there screaming at the screen whenever Nagi has one of those ""hey guys did you remember I\'m in love with Segawa (for whatever reason)"" scenes.I\'ll be the first to say it - Segawa is a manipulative sociopath whose sole goal is to drive the people Nagi cares about away from him through cheap tactics and toxicity. Firstly, she leads Nagi on through some crazy proposal about having to beat her in exams 10 times or something that he, of course, agrees to and through this spends way less time with Erika and Sachi. Secondly, Segawa constantly finds excuses to go alone somewhere with Nagi where absolutely nothing of any substance happens but Nagi still for some reason can\'t get enough of it, even though the other girls are left worrying over him because they actually care about him unlike Segawa ever could. Not only this but Segawa lets slip secrets that were not intended for other people to hear, along with constantly trying to victimise herself and pry into other people\'s issues that ABSOLUTELY do not concern her and it\'s just such a drag to sit through at points.Now, you\'d think it\'s just Segawa who\'s trying to drive Nagi away from Erika but you\'d be mistaken! The story itself goes on a futile, pointlessly long and ultimately inconsequential subplot that exists solely to help drive Erika and Nagi apart in favour of Segawa. Without going into crazy detail, there subplot involves a mysterious ""brother"" of Nagi\'s who, somehow, Erika grew up with and has been in love with this whole time. Never has there been any prior mention of this evidently pretty substantial character whom, you\'d expect, would have had a huge impact of both family\'s lives. At first I thought he was made up and that it was actually Nagi the whole time but as it """"unfolds"""" there is more and more evidence pointing towards the fact that he really does exist and it\'s just ???????????But get this - there is absolutely no closure to this huge part of the show. In fact, the finale just pretends that basically all that I just mentioned about Segawa and the brother NEVER HAPPENED and puts the focus back on Erika for one saving grace of an episode. Crazy how not focusing on the worst character for even a single episode can make you completely fall in love with a show again, so I\'m gonna take the same route as the finale and also pretend that none of that brother stuff or any of that focus on Segawa ever happened and live out the rest of my days peacefully, pretending that the focus was on Erika the whole time because she is the superior character in every single asset and it\'s laughable how incomparable the two are, not just in terms of character but in terms of entertainment value for the show. Seriously I would watch a whole season of just Erika and Nagi hanging out because it\'s absolutely when this show is at its best.This show started off as a 10 for me, then went down to maybe a 6 or 7 solely because of Segawa and that brother subplot, but the finale basically made it so that canonically I can pretend that none of that ever happened and so I\'m giving this a 9 overall because when it\'s good it\'s SERIOUSLY good, but when it\'s bad my god. to create two characters who get along so well but I\'m definitely not complaining.

Since these interactions are the main part of the story, it requires more focus on character development, which is lacking in this show.

The issue is sadly that the anime peaked before it even got halfway, and quickly stagnated, filled with plot holes, and the story didn't seem to match what it was trying to put out.There are three female interests for the male protagonist. Personally, I think the anime would have been way better with just two. The male protagonist his entire life has devoted to studying to confess to the smartest girl in school. Obviously the fellow cuckoo also has to be a female interest. But...the sister, who isn't related by blood, just completely messes up the story. He literally has no feelings for her, and yet its almost as if the maker of this story was biased in her favor, because it tries to prop her up as a potential love every chance it gets. I think its obvious to everyone that the person the protagonist, Nagi, favors is his lifelong crush. He is anything but indecisive, yet the anime acts like he sees all three female characters on the same level, even though there is a extreme difference in how he reacts to his lifelong crush compared to the other two. There is actually character and relationship development between the two cuckoos, so it is completely believable for her to be a love interest as time goes on. But his kid sister? Seriously? Yet the story acted like Nagi did a whole 180 and changed from seeing his sister as his sister to a woman on par with the love of his life in less than 2 episodes. In addition, most of the content that consists of interactions between the first two female interests mentioned above and Nagi are quite wholesome and enjoyable, while any interaction with the sister character quickly becomes intolerable as for the most part she seems to be there to give the mc more choices and to make him indecisive.As the anime continues to stagnate, it begins to add dramatic surprises to make the story even more complicated. Besides for the 3 love interests, Nagi, and the parents, there is only one other character who can actually be called a character and he is as annoying as possible. The other cuckoo, Erika, has her own crush, but it never goes anywhere in the season. There is a strange relationship between the sister character and Erika's nonbiological father where he takes her out to dinner and she tells him how everyone is getting along. The dad is a strange yet likable man who seems to find this engagement thing between Nagi and Erika a game that he can manipulate to a certain extent.There are multiple incidences where the anime episode ending doesn't match the beginning of the next episode, as if certain scenes were skipped, and some parts of the anime aren't very friendly with people who don't have a great depth of knowledge about the culture of Japan. For example, I spent about 70 percent of the anime convinced that shrine maidens engage themselves to a god of their choice and aren't permitted to marry, even though the maiden in question is a daughter of the head of a temple.

The anime starts off with a decent setup: main character Nagi Umino and girl 1 Erika have a Nisekoi-esq meeting and relationship while Nagi still has feelings for girl 2 Segawa Hiro, with pretty animation for the first few episodes. The first sign of going bad is hints of not-blood-related incest with the Imouto character Sachi Umino, but the character development in the first half is good enough and the plot ignores it enough to be overlooked. However, the plot has a negative progression in the second half....They cover all the same points, but in reverse order, and with weirder sister stuff, and worse animations. The last episode feels the exact same as the 4th, except they hint at a 4th girl, and it's 20 episodes later with no plot progression.

My overall impression is that there is almost no progress in the plot or character development since chapter 12. They even ended the show with Nagi and Erika saying ""I can\'t stand being engaged with you"" which refers to chapter 1. Therefore, No progress at all.The main characters are good...I guess. I liked the three female characters, they have pretty different personalities and have interesting interactions with the MC. However, their relationship does not progress at all. Probably, the relationship between Hiro and Nagi is the one that progresses the most but for a 24-chapter anime is too slow.The worst part of this show is Erika\'s brother sub-plot which is not resolved at all and is pretty much irrelevant for the characters. The best of this show is its character design and even though the animation quality is pretty average they made some cool scenes. I guess.

For somebody whos academically smart, he\'s really really dumb. None of the characters in this show are likable, especially his sister Sachi.Throughout the whole show, she has been nothing but a nuisance every time she appears on the screen. I had very little hope for Segawa and some hopes for Erika. I atleast thought there would be some kind of romance between Erika and Nagi but no, he\'s only fixated on Segawa who already has a fiancé, we all knew how this would turn...out and he just kept trying to go for her, he\'s not just stupid but morally inept too. You don\'t just go for girls who are already engaged.. This is very childish and impulsive behaviour.Segawa had Nagi by the balls and kept stringing him along, she knew the he liked her and when their relationship seems to be making progress, she throws the ""I\'m engaged"" line. She\'s already being unfaithful by even humouring MC\'s feelings, why would Nagi want to be with someone like Segawa in the first place? Because he\'s a stupid man.In the end, Nagi didn\'t even pick any of the girls, not even Erika, the most likable girl (in my opinion). Not only that, but the whole part about finding his twin brother was just weird. Nagi even helped her find his twin brother, only for her to tell him to stop. So what now, is she just going to keep fantasizing about some random guy who looks exactly like Nagi?24 episodes of dog sh*t.

I like all the characters involved they can be both surprising at times as well as very well thought out. The art is simply fantastic on every episode with lots of care and detail put in. The sound both in the anime and during the OP and ED are great.There really is not a lot you can say to those who may dislike these complex...narratives but for me this is one of the shows that has me excited to watch it every time a new episode comes out. narratives but for me this is one of the shows that has me excited to watch it every time a new episode comes out.', ""Watching this felt like dragging a dead horse along while participating in cbtCouple of cuckoos is pretty much a very bad take on Nisekoi but the only thing it has going for it was a decent art style and a catchy opening music. But as everyone knows you can't have just those two things try and carry the show.The story was just bat shit boring with 24 episodes of purely slice of life with no progression in the main plot with only the romance options of the MC's sister who's not related by blood but still his sister who has an annoying personality and no...contribution to the story, a tomboy who the MC prefers at the beginning of the story and is set to take over the shrine but is an A* student at school which makes no sense as to why she's restricted to taking over the shrine and the daughter of a hotel giant who's also an instagram influencer who what would you know, is dumb af.The MC is the worst purely from the fact that his personality is the most boring since all he does is study to try and surpass the shrine girl in exams thinking that's what he needs to make her like him, which again is dumb logic.I personally would tell you to miss this hot garbage and give it a kilometre wide birth is I sat through 24 episodes of no progression, no decent comedy(not even a breathe out of my nostrils) and definitely little to no romance.So save yourself and go and watch something else.

It's got a lot of similarity, so if you like that show you'll most likely like this one too. For me? It was okay. Nothing special, but it's not bad. It's in the middle. There were some enjoyment parts, but most of the time it was kind of boring to be honest.Animation/Music: 9/10 I like this style of anime. Aside from the MC, all the girls look lovely. The OST was also on point.Characters: 7/10 No one is unique or special, but no one is particularly bad, well except for the MC....Nagi is very plain and boring, which I guess is what the author was going for since it appeals to a certain audience group. I don't hate it, but it's just that I've seen that before in a billion other animes. Also, for a guy who is supposedly very mart, he makes a lot of stupid decisions. His fiance, Erika, is alright. Cardboard cut out of those happy-go-lucky no consequences for me yayay hooray type. Over all, I like her, but she doesn't like...do anything. Next up is contestant #2 which is Nagi's sister Sachi. I actually adore her. Again, a typical cardboard cut out, but I don't know if its her design or VA, but I think she adds the right amount of spice to the anime. And lastly, contest #3 Hiro Segawa. She's probably the most interesting one. Starts off reeeeeeaaally boring as a character, but near the end she finally starts working the gears for herself by plotting things behind the scene. Finally, I just want to point out that this show has one of the worse character in all of anime history- Shion. Jesus Christ he's annoying.Plot: 6/10 Weakest part of the show. The premise is interesting- swapped at birth, forced engaged, and then let theew be cute and chaotic moments. However, the problem is that NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS. The plot moves at a snails pace. I think nothing significant even happens until some 16 episode in. There's no consequences because all the characters don't make any decisions. They're just all there together. Don't get me wrong- some of the interactions are good, but eventually you'd want something to happen, right? The ending was super typical as all the characters are literally the same as they were at the start of the show. No progression whatsoever.I still give this anime a 7/10 because I think 6 is too low. It has positives and I think some will enjoy it. I just think they could've cut out 70% of the mundane parts to move the plot along and that would've been so much better.

The concept is interesting but the execution is very mediocre.It feels like this anime tried to put every trope of a rom-com anime in it. There's nothing special about it. You can predict every episode's very poorly written plot from a few seconds of watching. That's how unimaginative and basic rom-com trash it is.The plot, if you can call that. It has more holes than Swiss cheese. How do two completely different infants get mixed up? One is a male with black hair like his parents, and the other is a female...with orange hair like the mother. You must be blind to mix them up. And I'm assuming that the parents knew the baby's gender before. So why didn't they question it when their baby came out with different hair color than the parents and a different gender from what they thought the baby is?Overall, this anime is incredibly moronic. Don't watch. 3 out of 10, animations bumps it up to a 4. And ofc incest. with orange hair like the mother. You must be blind to mix them up.

Characters are somewhat stereotypical for a romcom harem-esc anime. The weird thing is this type of anime is one of those shows that I watch ironically and eventually get really into it for some reason. This didn\'t really happen because of the stop and go of the story, what little of it there is. I liked it but at the same time I hated it. *MINOR SPOILS AHEAD* - shouldn\'t harm your viewing experience.Let\'s talk about the art first and foremost. It\'s some of the best art I\'ve seen...in a while. I normally don\'t pay much attention to the art style but this one felt just right. It hit the spot. I\'m not going to pretend that it\'s the greatest looking art I\'ve ever seen but it\'s definitely in the top tiers and what really made the show stand out among the rest for me.The characters are just, whew. Male MC is an over used stereotype. Male MC is interested in someone else and almost relentlessly trudges after her. No problem with that in all honesty but he does it so fervently that it honestly made me want to beat my head on the wall. This is REGARDLESS of whatever emotions he might develop for the Female MC. Speaking of Female MC, she can be irritatingly cheerful at times and borderline wildly emotional. She too is interested in someone else and this interest is, for the most part, why I started to REALLY dislike the show. One term: Bro-con. At least that was the vibe that I was getting, take it as you will. What\'s worse than one of the MCs being a bro-con? Having two bro-cons (Technically) in the same show. This trope ruins shows for me if it isn\'t kept in check.Now let\'s address the elephant in the room, the story. Oh wow, male and female MC are engaged and they\'re both totally against it. Been there done that. As the story develops coldness starts to go away like it typically does and then enter the plot twist and wham episodes. It got me interested, enough to forget about dropping it at least. At the end of the 24 episodes what are we left with? Nothing, absolutely nothing but up in the air ""What just happened"" feelings. As mentioned earlier, the story does a stop and go thing. A little development and then a lot of fanservice. Rinse, mix, and repeat. Except at one point pretty much all development just kind of went out the window.I really wanted to like this show because the characters grew on me. But at the end I just felt melancholic at best. In fact, it would be more accurate to say it was more of a feeling of irritation both with the story and with the MC and his frustrating wishy-washiness. There were 24 episodes to make some decent progress but nothing really happened. Bit of a rocky start huge wham moment in the middle and then nothing comes of it. It almost feels like the show was robbed of it\'s potential because the creators wanted to try to set it up for another season. Something that doesn\'t happen as much as it should.

anime's rating is poor and the reviews are really harsh on it but i still liked it and there's nothing wrong about it, while another show for example might be the fan's favorite and has a really high rating and u may not like it, it is just a matter of taste and i was about to skip this good show just because of the Majority effect, this show really taught me to always watch 3 ~ 5 eps of...whatever the show i find interesting and then decide for myself whether i like what i see and i'd like to complete it or not and i'll definitely be going back to some drafted shows that i've decided not to watch based on poor rating and bad reviewsAbout the Anime,This show is about a couple of kids who got switched at birth by mistake, their parents discovered this after 16 years if i remember correctly and decided it was too late to re switch back so they decide to introduce the kids to each other and engage them in order to get them married to each other in the future, it's a conflict of love, romance and comedy with self desires because each of them has his own stuff to look forward to like ambitions careers lifestyle and even crushes and the effect of their relationship on everybody around them through their wayThe Bad,,the story is not that deep tbh, it may seem a bit childish and shallow, some events are really shallow and feel forced as well and i guess people who hated the show for this are absolutely right if they really really care about the plot and event flow but however it is only mediocre at those, it is not very bad like shallow no events, progression or development whatsoever shows but they did not nail these aspects right in this show as well you might also find some cringe thoughts and actions especially some that are repetitive makes the anime kind of predictable and not so fun for plot and depth enjoyersThe Good,,IMO they nailed every other element rather than the story and the plot in this show, the characters are cute, not cringe and funny as hell and tbh i don't like shallow shows with no events or a weak story plot myself but this anime is absolutely forgivable because it provides so much fun and comedy as a chill anime that did not lose the entire story thing (like Horimiya for ex) it still has some sort of a story, events and end goals and progression which is understandable if you really know what romance and comedy shows are about and even the repetitive hesitations and events are kind of reasonable to some extent because who would not be hesitant about his love life when he's 16/17 years old right ?my opinion,,you should definitely give this a try and treat it as a chill anime, don't expect deep story or plot..etc expect the funny events the good romance with some cliches, just some, and you'll have a good time with it if you enjoy these kind of shows, the story is not good enough to be taken seriously but as a chill anime it really serves it's purpose and for me it is special because it will make me try

Needless to say, it was indeed a very very nice anime to watch and I just loved the character development in this. The way they met, the way they grew and the way more and more secrets and twists just unfolded.Lets get some of the ratings outta the way shall we! Firstly, the plot or story of the anime is very interesting to me. Arranged marriages have always been something that I could never truly understand but sometimes it does bring...out some precious memories and life lasting friendships. The way they developed this concept was nicely done adn they obviously added some good harem notions throughout the 24 episodes. The music wasn't that amazing to me, it definitely provided a good ambience and emotional presence to different scenes and so on but if I'm being honest I never really saw the music 'shine' in the anime, it was mostly the scenes and animations that outdid the music and that's what caught my eye. Nevertheless, music still played a integral part in the anime and it deffo wouldn't feel the same without. Next up is the characters themselves. All of them have their own quirk and goals to reach, and I love how most of their goals revolve around our main man here. I think that Segawa is super adorable and her design is just AHHHHHH!! The character development as I mentioned is really nice! The way their emotions and behaviours change as time goes on together, and how more friends are made along the way is all a nice pace of development.Well, the anime had left a very nice warm feeling in my chest and I seriously am hoping for more! I'm trying to be spoiler-free so as youc an see it's not very CRAZY as I usually write my review, a lil too sophisticated?? AHHAHAI'm also writing this at like 11.30 am, not right after watching the anime so its probably also a reason. But overall I reallly really enjoyed watching this anime, didn't know it was 24 eps to be honest but that made it all the better, deffo a good anime to watch if you just want to relax and see some rom com. out some precious memories and life lasting friendships.

I am saying this because the anime is kind a messed up, I mean in my opinion, that's because when I watch the anime i get this feeling that the MC is beeing trolled and he is constantly being thrown in many difficult situation like whenever he is about make a good point, the girls make a silly excuse and escape and the total theme of Harem is kind of rigged, I mean the girls are kind of troughing them to him but not in a way that they persistently doing that. The...girls are Really cute I mean really cute!!! We can see that the MC is very strong in mental pressure, very calm and collected in some times. Whenever I watch the girls it's really difficult to decide which girl is a better suit for the MC (I mean whenever we watch an anime, we like to see that MC is to be with the best loved one). In that was for me it was really difficult to see. I mean whenever i see SACHI she is doesn't realize that she is in love with NAG and she doesn't realize that she is betraying her bro she is in touch with erica father, and whenever i see ERICA i can see that she is in love with his older brother and she is using him as a replacement this makes the viewers to get angry, whenever i see HIRO I can't really put it in a place that she is kind of cute but she is kind of sus because she is plotting something. And there is ERICA's father he is really something like a bad Villan in this anime. (if you guys are really into some romance this anime has less of it but i assure u that this anime has lots of comedy. The story line is kind a ok i will give a solid 8/10. well, the anime is based on a bird called kokku bird its like the bird leave its egg on other birds' nest and make them raise their bird until they mature and leave the nest. So, the anime is also like that, the ERIKA's father did this on purpose, and he planned this all along this is what the story line is about. girls are Really cute I mean really cute!!!

Nerd, sometimes he make stupid decision also make stupid face, tbh i was reading the relationship spoiler and i was shocked, the MC confessed that he love Erika, but ended up dating Hiro.............. tbh i really hate that kind of personality when you already declared that you love someone and still dating another person, kinda makes you the worst because i feel...like he\'s toying with people\'s feeling ( tbh i also experienced this kinda of relationship irl LMAO ), anyway it was pretty good if you\'re bored or have nothing to watch, but you might have to hold your anger back xD like he\'s toying with people\'s feeling ( tbh i also experienced this kinda of relationship irl LMAO ), anyway it was pretty good if you\'re bored or have nothing to watch, but you might have to hold your anger back xD']"

This film felt like a parody of Lupin\'s 50 year legacy and I\'ll explain why in this review.Animation: clean, colourful and with the old school charm that is part of Lupin III\'s iconic visuals. However, at the end of the movie, it was quite inconsistent.Sound:1) Lupin III\'s iconic theme song was ruined by some dodgy lyrics and vocals. For 50 years, the instrumental has been a constant presence in every episode, movie, OVA, special. Yet, for some odd reason, this movie wanted it to be different and it was just...awful. There\'s a saying that goes ""if it ain\'t broken, don\'t fix it"" and it fits perfectly here.2) ""Super Hero""\'s version for this movie had terrible vocals. Again. if it ain\'t broken, don\'t fix it.Story and characters:1) this film is more cartoon-like in terms of comedy and action and I feel that this new approach didn\'t help the level of enjoyment at all because it\'s just not Lupin III\'s style.2) Lupin\'s gang and Zenigata and his assistant felt like parodies of themselves: Zenigata is never really focused on arresting Lupin, Lupin doesn\'t act as expected towards Fujiko, ... just to give a few examples.3) the story feels rushed and many events make no sense whatsoever.4) SPOILER: in every Lupin\'s story there\'s always a girl/woman that happens to pretty and they need help. I would love to see some creativy story-wise because it just gets old and too predictable for it to be enjoyable.Overall, because the story is poorly executed and the characters don\'t feel like their real selves and also because the iconic soundtrack got butchered, I have to rate this film a 3/10. awful.

This special is really fun and nostalgic. Within the first opening scene they used the Lupin III theme with vocals and it was truly music to my ears.ART 10/10I think the art style is really crisp and clean for 2019. Although I’ll always love the classic Lupin artstyle I quite like this new modern art style too! I guess it’s important to realise that anime is changing and so will old art styles. It’s good to appreciate both!MUSIC 10/10I always love Lupin III soundtrack. Love going on a drive...and putting the OSTS on. I definitely downloaded the remastered vocal version and played it a couple of times and many of the other tracks from this special.STORY 8/10It’s quite a good story but there definitely has been some more outstanding storylines within the Lupin III series. I really enjoyed that they maintained the personalities of the characters especially Goemon when he is a bit moody haha. I guess I am quite open minded and mostly appreciate the overall of the special but it’s quite enjoyable and worth a watch!CHARACTER 10/10What can I say? I love all the characters and they were well maintained! I love how they were shownOverallI loved this special and I look forward to more in the future. Lupin III is a series getting recognised more world widely instead of just Japan and I hope it continues. The special was very enjoyable and nostalgic. Give it a watch! and putting the OSTS on.

Give it a watch!', 'WARNING: WILL TALK ABOUT SPOILERSThis is my first review on this site and just in general, so excuse me if some of my points don\'t come over all that well.Lupin III! After hearing about the animated movie it has gotten, I\'ve gotten very interested in the series and genuinely enjoyed what I saw of it. Watched First Contact, and absolutely loved it, so I looked for something else in the series that might give me about the same level of enjoyment. Eventually I settled on Prison Of The Past after some site recommended it. It came out last year too, so surely it must have...at least the same amount of quality, if not more?Yeah, that hope died down very quick.Story: 3/10This movie\'s story starts rather interesting. Breaking into a prison known for being impossible to break? So you can save an infamous thief inside it so that he might lead the main cast to his treasure? This premise sounded like something genuinely appealing to me, but the way they handled it just really rubs me the wrong way. Instead of them going on an Indiana-style treasure hunt after stylishly breaking the criminal out, they made this movie take place in the same location for almost the entirety of the film. The adventure-packed chaos that had me so hooked to First Contact was entirely removed, and it just saddens me how they made such a fun concept into the snore-fest that was this movie in general. And there are a lot of things that don\'t make sense taking the context behind them. A supposedly unbreakable prison with only 3-4 security measures, one of which kills everyone inside? Inspector Zenigata abandoning his obsession with catching Lupin because this prison is ""unbreakable""? This is just horribly executed in my opinion.Art: 4/10While it\'s not absolutely the worst, it definitely ain\'t the best. The art in some parts of this film is visually confusing, and it definitely dragged down my enjoyment. Nothing outstanding.Sound: 6/10I\'ve noticed that other people dislike the trademark Lupin III theme in this movie, but I am one of the seemingly few people who liked it. Could be better admittedly.Character: 3/10Man, they did Lupin dirty.All the main characters were just watered-down versions of the ones I liked in First Contact. Lupin in particular just felt so... Wrong. Instead of the master thief who tricked the opposition in hilarious ways, he just... Did that once. That\'s it. He gets to do basically nothing like ""him"" for the rest of the movie except maybe some funny dialogue here and there, and even those moments are not as enjoyable as the ones I knew and loved. However, I did like the clash between Goemon and the masked man halfway through the movie. However, that\'s really the only moment that concerns character that didn\'t bore me halfway to death.Enjoyment: 3/10But hey, not all the previous things would matter all that much if the movie was at least enjoyable right? You can enjoy a movie if it has a bad story or bad art, right? But Prison Of The Past hasn\'t accomplished that in the slightest. As I have said in the previous sections, the way everything was done horribly just dragged down it\'s quality and my overall enjoyment of the movie. It\'s absolutely boring, it\'s terribly obvious at some times what exactly is going to happen, and the fact that I watched First Contact, another Lupin III movie that I absolutely loved FROM MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO, before watching this movie really didn\'t do it any favors. You shouldn\'t watch this movie for enjoyment, even ironically.Overall: 3/10As someone who believes a series or movie needs to be most of all enjoyable in order to be called a good piece of media, this film sticks out as an incredibly sore thumb. It bored me out of my mind for a good 5/6th of the movie\'s duration and really shouldn\'t be called a Lupin III movie in my opinion. The character were so bland, especially in the case of the main cast, which really sucks because I love Lupin and the gang. Probably the only thing to really sit through this movie through is the IMO stellar edition of the Lupin III theme, but who wants to waste more than an hour of their time just for that?TLDR; Prison Of The Past sucks, go watch First Contact instead. at least the same amount of quality, if not more?Yeah, that hope died down very quick.Story: 3/10This movie\'s story starts rather interesting.

THEY SPRINKLE IT AND GIVE HINTS AT IF AND JUST LEAVE IT LIKE THAT. PLEASE GUYS JUST FUCKING. USE THE MATERIAL.But other than that the character moments were so good and funny and the dub cast sounded...like they had a good time recording it :D in terms of the dub script I’m still miffed modern lupin dubs never do anything fun anymore, but this one really had that bang zoom way too true to the source material vibe like anyone who wasn’t in the main loop gang sounded so stilted and stiff which was sad. The bang zoom curse has poisoned lupin now too 💔 hopefully whatever they dub next will be more loose and goofyI now realize everything I’ve said so far has been negatives. BUT THE MOVIE WAS SO MUCH FUN I WAS SMILING THE WHOLE TIME. I ALSO noticed the character designer for part 6 also did the designs for this movie which was fun to see!!!! I like how they make lupin look a lot older w the wrinkles, makes it feel like he’s actually aging in some way. Also his mouth is constantly going :3 which is obviously another big plus. Soundtrack wise this movie has to be like one of my favorites ever omg yuji ohno fuckinv does it again!!! This time most of the ost was remixes of old songs which was really fun given that the name of the movie is “prison of the past”. I heard Manhattan joke, superhero, gift, and there’s probably a lot more I just never noticed was playing. In terms of remixes this one is definitely the best hands down.Anyway prison of the past was so much fun I loved it a lot even if parts of it were a little bit on the blander sideI give it B/C rating like they had a good time recording it :D in terms of the dub script I’m still miffed modern lupin dubs never do anything fun anymore, but this one really had that bang zoom way too true to the source material vibe like anyone who wasn’t in the main loop gang sounded so stilted and stiff which was sad.

Though, I don't reccomend you to replace the 1st season with this, because you won't see the interesting little detail that make Aqours as they are now.Art are still the same because they literally just take clips from the main anime. No OP song or ED song, but have a cool opening and ending...scene. You can also see Aqours real life clips from here, oh yeah and Numazu too, where the anime take place. So, should you watch this? If you are a superfan of Aqours or have a poor memory, go ahead and watch, its only half an hour long. There is just so little I can talk about. Thank you for reading my review. scene.

His only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It's a nice different location for Lupin, with the desert and that hot exotic feel.One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place than Lupin. On one hand their classic dynamic together is missed, but it is a change of pace. Plus, this way, Lupin can focus on the ladies...Fujiko rules in this. Throughout the entire feature she is seducing...Lupin, and us viewers. Then there's Lara, the damsel of this particular tale, and she's quite likable. This one has more nudity than any other Lupin anime, which is a fun distinction to have.There's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this, and naturally he has some great fighting with Goemon, as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata of course is also on a warpath here, in fine form.Pretty much, this is a smooth ride with Lupin. The plot is average and there are some slow spots, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy. Lupin, and us viewers.

Once the original series was over and the amazing movie in Castle of Cagliostro, Lupin featuring in a good or even decent movie has been a tough ride. Luckily, The Secret of Twilight Gemini and its’ B-movie plot is a sight long awaited for in the Lupin franchise featuring likeable characters, good action and adventure, well written, and of course comedy with a little fan-service thrown in.Twilight Gemini takes quite some inspiration from Cagliostro from a family heirloom leading to a massive hidden treasure (Cagliostro...was a ring, Gemini is a diamond) to the crazy strange controversial enemy group that is also hot on the trail. Though still not nearly as good as Cagliostro, Twilight Gemini is very enjoyable.Lupin and this story take a bit to get moving, but the solid treasure hunt adventure more than makes up for that. The usual crew remains separate for most of the film, but this also gives Lupin more time with the ladies such as Fujiko and new babe Lara. Usual and not so new action scenes are ever so present and in this sense, is fairly bland for Lupin. The cult and political conspiracy written into the story gives the viewer a sense of uneasiness which makes this enemy especially evil. Towards the end, it is unfortunate that several plot holes appear leaving this Lupin adventure on a bit of a sour note.While the sound and voice acting, both Japanese and dub do the series justice, this doesn’t make up for a sub-par animation job. Studio TMS was one of the top studios of the time, so bland colors and awkward moving animation scenes leads to a low budget assumption.Twilight Gemini is the best Lupin movie since Cagliostro but a mature fan-service setting (not for children) and sub-par animation with too many ending plot holes leaves this great Lupin adventure downgraded to only a good Lupin movie. was a ring, Gemini is a diamond) to the crazy strange controversial enemy group that is also hot on the trail.

The setting was likewise really cool, they really got the most out of it.

There's a non-binary villain that gets called some derogatory terms. In all of Lupin not a lot of non-binary or non-heterosexual people appear, but it seems that when they do they have to be villainous.

Everyone should watch as many Short OVA's as possible."", 'Politics is often thought of as a dull and dreary affair; several old men in suits debating issues like agricultural legislation and increasing taxes a little. But perhaps the most uninteresting of all is international affairs; a battle to get as much as you can from someone else while giving them back as little as possible in return. It’s a world of faked smiles and awkward handshakes.If only the countries of the world could compete against other like men; pitting themselves against one another in fierce competition, as they battle for ultimate supremacy.And what better way to do that, than a game of 2v2...Mahjong?‘The Legend of Koizumi’ sees the former Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro doing diplomacy with six of Japan’s deadliest enemies, including North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Chinese Premier Wen. Also taking part in the (trash) talks are a range of Japanese and international political figures.While all but the most informed of Westerners are unlikely to recognise all but the most infamous members of the cast, this barely detracts from The Legend of Koizumi’s humour. Even if the names are new, the characters are not; Dictators that don’t play by the rules, and exaggeratedly manly “heroes of freedom”.And it is this that makes Legend of Koizumi very accessible, even to a foreign audience; something that isn’t easy for a political satire that uses localised, real world figures. In fact, the main reason Legend of Koizumi is funny is simply because it is so over the top; from letting out a primal scream while declaring Riichi to intercepting a nuclear missile with a Fighter Jet, Koizumi is so ridiculously manly that he can burn a hole through a mahjong tile simply by pressing his finger up against it.Since Legend of Koizumi is mostly about poking fun at political figures, it doesn’t really have much of a story. Essentially, he settles Japanese diplomacy by battling various communist dictators. Given that there are three episodes and each one is only ten minutes long, we can forgive Koizumi for lacking any real character development or providing much in the way of introductions before the games begin. But remember that although these figures may not be well known in the west, in Japan they are household names; they don’t need any lengthy introductions.Koizumi is the single product of a small animation studio, and hence did not receive a very large budget. Thankfully however, the art doesn’t really feel cheaply made; animation is largely avoided, however the animation that is there is as smooth as any television production. Reaction shots are kept to a sensible length. And while they are somewhat frequent, multiple angles are used to prevent it from feeling static. What’s more, these flaws only become apparent with a well trained eye, or upon closer inspection.The art style is reminiscent of fighting or martial arts anime; butch, muscular bodies and faces, with blood vessels ready to pop at any second but are still recognisable, bearing obvious resemblances to the figures they parody (if you know what the figures they parody look like, anyway).The background music is mock suspense; loud and heavy percussion throughout, spaced with tense silences and touches of dramatic, orchestral strings. Most of the cast have exaggerated deep, masculine voices; dialogue is delivered in a style similar to a bad action movie. For example, in one scene, Koizumi (having been shot only moments ago) calmly steps out of a helicopter and simply says: “Let’s delegate”.Aside from catchphrases delivered like they were lifted from  a Schwarzenegger movie, Koizumi’s dialogue is limited guttural screams when declaring a hand, and trash talking his opponents, who are given silly accents and have their mannerisms and characteristics blown out of proportion.But being so over the top is what makes the Legend of Koizumi so good; even without the satire it is still hilarious to watch and easy to enjoy.  And, since it only lasts 30 minutes in total, it doesn’t have enough time to become stale or repetitive.If I was going to be diplomatic about it, I’d probably cite that the easily accessible humour, the very short running time and the large enjoyment factor that Legend of Koizumi has, make for good incentives to watch it. But then, diplomacy never gets anyone anywhere does it?So watch Legend of Koizumi, or I’ll declare ‘Rising Sun’ on your ass, pinko!

Despite the fact that they\'re all political figures, the lack of very much introduction is very jarring.The story is also very jarring, as it simply jumps from one scenario to the next, trying to squeeze as much as possible out of each episode\'s 8-minute runtime. This seems unnecessary, especially considering each story doesn\'t actually have very much...of interest going on, and they all follow the same basic formula of ""Koizumi gets into a match of mahjong with a political leader and pulls off some great play"". Perhaps these stories would be more interesting to me if I understood the rules of mahjong, but since the writer doesn\'t do anything to explain the rules, I don\'t have that context, so the stories simply fall flat to me.There also isn\'t much comedy to be had here. The funniest part would likely be how they paint George W. Bush as being a child, but that\'s simply one good joke out of a 27-minute runtime. The rest of the humor is supposed to come from flashy sequences that are supposed to be so over-the-top that it ends up being ridiculous, but this didn\'t actually work very well for me, so the presentation just ended up feeling somewhat lackluster.That\'s not to say the art is bad, as it\'s very nicely done, with great character design befitting the political setting, and smooth, detailed animation as one would expect from an OVA. However, the art can\'t save the poor directing and pacing.The sound design is also very well done, feeling loud & powerful at key moments, and the voice actors also do a nice job with their characters. The soundtrack is perhaps a bit generic and forgettable, and while the ending theme is catchy, I doubt it will stick with me for very long.Still, despite these good aspects, the lack of congruity or interesting aspects in the story make this no more than simply a fun romp through a crazy world. It\'s a somewhat enjoyable watch, that has a handful of flaws and overall manages to feel somewhat tepid and uninteresting in terms of it\'s story, despite it\'s over-the-top, ridiculous nature. of interest going on, and they all follow the same basic formula of ""Koizumi gets into a match of mahjong with a political leader and pulls off some great play"".

New Dominion Tank Police,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1152/New_Dominion_Tank_Police,"[""New Dominion Tank Police, 6 OVA action series. Fans will immediately recognize the returning cast of Leona, Al, Brenten, Puma Sisters, and other supporting characters. Their roles and actions are pretty much maintained from the last OVA run, so you can expect about the same comedy and plot.Since this was around the mid 90s, the animation is nothing to complain about. If you haven't seen the other Tank Police OVAs or possibly the manga, and thinking about just jumping into this one, you might wanna reconsider. For one thing I'd say the original run had a bit more deeper enemies than this one, at times...NDTP heavily relies on its comedy to maintain the viewers enjoyment. When it can't do that and mix in the action it presents, the continuing story becomes flat and uninteresting at times. In some OVAs here, this problem is evident. But you still get kick ass explosions, cyborgs, swearing, and hilarity in about every act. There's tons of twist, some are apparently foreseeable, but that doesn't interact with the anime too much and should keep you glued.Overall, I think this is pretty much fan based. Fans of the series should enjoy NDTP, others will probably will still but they'll have a much harder time grasping character relations and the like.

This second anime adaptation of Shirow's manga retains the wacky cast and the over the top action humour of the original but raises the stakes and introduces an overarching plot that makes for some tense moments throughout the OVA.Story - 8A huge step up from the chaotic plot of the first Tank Police, NDTP has an overarching plot revolving around the attempts of a megacorporation specialising in armaments to undermine the tank police and assassinate the Mayor, who...is trying to impose an embargo on weapons to the city. Most episodes are linked by the ominous background puppetering of the megacorporation and really gives you a sense of happening and high stakes. Plenty of great action sequences too from trying to stop an apartment sized truck to duelling with a relentless spider tank. Beneath all this action is the commentary on totalitarian martial rule through the irony that is the Tank Police. The Tank Police can be every bit as corrupt and arguably, even more destructive than the very criminals they fight against. If the anime took itself more seriously, we'd be seeing ALOT of civillian collateral. Overall, while more sophisticated than your average OVA plot, it is still 80/90s action anime to the core.Art - 8There are better looking OVAs than this one, even from the 90s. But what these sort of OVAs lack in animation detail and smoothness, it always more than makes up for in art direction and designs. Being based off a Shirow manga, there is no way the character designs and especially the mechanical designs couldn't be anything short of awesome. The setting is your typical cyberpunk megacity but unique that, it is depicted with; a bright blue sky and an abundance of greenery! All the pollution a city like this would create mean that the two shouldn't ever go together; but so is giving the police battle tanks I guess. Utopian in look, a police state underneath, very interesting.Sound - 9The sound effects are not too great; as far as an anime with police tanks go (so its still cool XD), the English dubs are great and bring the emotions across and draws the characters to life. What really sets this anime apart in the sound department are the amazing opening and ending themes. The opening is a poundingly intense pop metal song (No those two usually don't go together), one of the best in its genre I've heard, beating out scores of western pop metal songs I've heard. The ending theme is a rather hauntingly beautiful ballard, attributable to the great vocalist. It playing through the final airport sequence is a perfect culmination for all the emotions, hardships and motivations of the entire series.Character - 9The characters are so loveable, each and every one of them; they are depicted well and perfectly compliment each other. Prior acquaintance with them however is preferable. Leona starts out as a fully fleshed out character, a hardened, made of steel veteran of the tank police force who's passion for her work is only surpassed by her love (and I mean love) for her tank. Her character is the driving force for the whole anime, filled to the brim with fiery passion and serious guts. Its good that they give her plenty of motivation too; revenge for her old partner's death. Is she too tough to like? No way! She's got plenty of vulnerabilities as well whether from her recklessness or the fear of losing her tank.The supporting characters are also great but I've hit a word limit!Enjoyment - 10Police men with tanks; that very premise makes for some seriously entertaining stuff but add that with themes on excessive government control and megacorporations and great characters make this anime a must watch for cyberpunk, Shirow, police anime and retro action OVA fans alike.PG for mild violence and coarse language is trying to impose an embargo on weapons to the city.

Nerawareta Gakuen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14293/Nerawareta_Gakuen,"['After watching this, I was torn between regret of even trying it and a slight satisfaction that I was able to complete it.STORY (4)This movie starts off in a cliche manner. There\'s a new transfer student who, from his very first lines, we can confirm is not from Earth. We are introduced to the main set of characters- a typical, ""you pervert!"", finger-pointing anime girl who is the neighbor of the main character, the girl that the main character likes who\'s talented, shy, and also typical, and the main character himself who seems to be the typical anime guy who does not measure up to...the hotness of the transfer student. To sum it up so far: typical. Then, out of nowhere, cellphones are accused to be the spawns of devils and the reason why teens are unable to communicate efficiently. Magical powers and sparkly objects begin their work in damaging your eyesight by attempting to blind you at every turn. You suspect a love triangle, a love square? How about some conversation? Oh wait, no. Apparently this has something to do with telepathy. Or no wait, physics? Which is it? Oh look! There\'s a back story between the neighbor chick and the main guy! Wait, I thought they were just neighbors? Where\'s all this water coming from? Why do we need to see this scene? Am I supposed to be reading into this? It\'s symbolism isn\'t it? No? It\'s just pretty? Wait a minute- are they trying to throw in some Shakespeare in here? Is there going to be fighting? This seems to have potential but seriously what\'s happening? And these questions are what lead to headaches- which is precisely what you\'ll have after you\'re done watching this. So please, for your concern, I suggest you watch this movie on your off-time, during a free day, and certainly not when you\'re ill because then you\'ll just suffer from migraines.ART (9)It\'s truly the art that keeps you watching and still hoping that there\'s some thread of story line you haven\'t picked up on. The color palette is gorgeous and everything is so shiny and clean and bright that you begin to appreciate your eyesight- even when you\'re being blinded by the bubbles, rays of the sunset, odd glowing magical items, and school floorboards. Movement is fluid, and it leaves you feeling fresh and wholesome with its incorporation of nature in every aspect. You\'ll even pause or replay some parts in order to appreciate the hues. Overall, it\'s magnificent. Consider making some screenshots.SOUND (8)Just as wonderful as the art. With soft piano (played by the transfer student, of course), the music comes across as subtle and easily blends in with the feeling provided by whatever scene is playing. Voices, tapping, the blowing of the wind- all are displayed to near perfection. Any vocals you hear are softly sung and blissful to say the least.CHARACTER (5)As I\'ve stated before, the characters are undeniably second rate- the female ones more so than the males. While at the beginning they seem unexpected and interesting, they quickly fall into the routine of what every other anime school girl/boy does. I particularly detest the female characters\' behaviors on some occasions. The neighbor chick (Ryouura Natsuki) is an emotional wreck- and not even the hot kind. She\'s ridiculously agile, jumping everywhere, and teasing one moment and the next she\'s slapping the main guy (Seki, Kenji) for one, naive statement before crying and running off despite the fact she\'s the one who just shoved him to the side of the road. I really despise the fact that violence is displayed acceptable by female anime characters simply because she\'s doing it since they\'re \'close\' and \'joking\'. It\'s not funny, it will never be funny, and personally, I would never want to be friends with someone who smacks me every chance they get.The second girl (Harukawa, Kahori) is another lackluster piece of recycling. She\'s shy, has big boobs, is in the student council, does music and surfs in her part time, is friends with the violent neighbor chick, and interested in the transfer student (Kyougoku, Ryouichi). We see these two talk more, bond over the piano, and this girl goes on her merry little way- gasping dramatically at everything he says and clutching her body parts as if- despite being under the pretenses that they\'re trying to display her as nervous and cute- she\'s coming across as someone who\'s being turned on for the first time. It\'s sort of awkward to say the least, and I couldn\'t even spare a pitiful smile for her despite having a soft spot for quiet characters.But perhaps I\'m being too harsh, the magical guy seems to be rather intriguing after all and he\'s got that mysterious aura going on too. Maybe he\'ll turn out to be evil or even cross the line into the gray area an-- oh nope, there he goes. He starts preaching about the \'kokoro\' as its some sort of heart condition people must be made aware of... And, now he\'s glowing..Finally, the main guy. Well, let\'s see- how would you define a guy who lets himself get beat senseless by his female neighbor/childhood friend, continually forgets to zip his pants, breaks windows in attempts to apologize for something which he hasn\'t even done, and walks into a council room of people wearing a horror which even speedoes can\'t outdo, puts his hand in there, pulls out a cell, and throws it across the room while uttering some dramatic line that I\'m pretty sure was supposed to add to the plot had we not all been busy screaming no? You don\'t define that sort of guy. You give him the one eyed twitch before getting the hell out.Overall, the characters aren\'t horrifyingly annoying to the point where you want them all slaughtered, but they are rather mediocre, slightly disturbing, and highly disappointing because they had some essence of potential.CONCLUSION:So, should you watch it? On boring, event-less days during which you are healthy, sane, feeling as if you could care less about story lines, and prepared to let the confusion mold itself into a ball that rolls off your back with a shrugging ease. It\'s not a bad movie, but it\'s definitely not something you\'d want to share with your friends when hanging out for fun. It\'s an anime you\'d watch twice in order to appreciate the animation once again and perhaps attempt tackling whatever mumbo jumbo is thrown at you- crafting it into a plot you can actually comprehend without having to be part of that niche group that read the novel (who knew there was a novel?), but it\'s not a film you\'d consider worth mentioning as an award-winning production since it clearly did not make it a goal to cater to the general audience. All in all, give it a shot, but keep your expectations low- even those of the art and music, just so you\'ll have something to be pleasantly surprised about. the hotness of the transfer student.

She\'s ridiculously agile, jumping everywhere, and teasing one moment and the next she\'s slapping the main guy (Seki, Kenji) for one, naive statement before crying and running off despite the fact she\'s the one who just shoved him to the side of the road. I really despise the fact that violence is displayed acceptable by female anime characters simply because she\'s doing it since they\'re \'close\' and \'joking\'. It\'s not funny, it will never be funny, and personally, I would never want to be friends with someone who smacks me every chance they get.The second girl (Harukawa, Kahori) is another lackluster piece of recycling. She\'s shy, has big boobs, is in the student council, does music and surfs in her part time, is friends with the violent neighbor chick, and interested in the transfer student (Kyougoku, Ryouichi). We see these two talk more, bond over the piano, and this girl goes on her merry little way- gasping dramatically at everything he says and clutching her body parts as if- despite being under the pretenses that they\'re trying to display her as nervous and cute- she\'s coming across as someone who\'s being turned on for the first time. It\'s sort of awkward to say the least, and I couldn\'t even spare a pitiful smile for her despite having a soft spot for quiet characters.But perhaps I\'m being too harsh, the magical guy seems to be rather intriguing after all and he\'s got that mysterious aura going on too. Maybe he\'ll turn out to be evil or even cross the line into the gray area an-- oh nope, there he goes. He starts preaching about the \'kokoro\' as its some sort of heart condition people must be made aware of... And, now he\'s glowing..Finally, the main guy. Well, let\'s see- how would you define a guy who lets himself get beat senseless by his female neighbor/childhood friend, continually forgets to zip his pants, breaks windows in attempts to apologize for something which he hasn\'t even done, and walks into a council room of people wearing a horror which even speedoes can\'t outdo, puts his hand in there, pulls out a cell, and throws it across the room while uttering some dramatic line that I\'m pretty sure was supposed to add to the plot had we not all been busy screaming no? You don\'t define that sort of guy. You give him the one eyed twitch before getting the hell out.Overall, the characters aren\'t horrifyingly annoying to the point where you want them all slaughtered, but they are rather mediocre, slightly disturbing, and highly disappointing because they had some essence of potential.CONCLUSION:So, should you watch it? On boring, event-less days during which you are healthy, sane, feeling as if you could care less about story lines, and prepared to let the confusion mold itself into a ball that rolls off your back with a shrugging ease. It\'s not a bad movie, but it\'s definitely not something you\'d want to share with your friends when hanging out for fun. It\'s an anime you\'d watch twice in order to appreciate the animation once again and perhaps attempt tackling whatever mumbo jumbo is thrown at you- crafting it into a plot you can actually comprehend without having to be part of that niche group that read the novel (who knew there was a novel?), but it\'s not a film you\'d consider worth mentioning as an award-winning production since it clearly did not make it a goal to cater to the general audience. All in all, give it a shot, but keep your expectations low- even those of the art and music, just so you\'ll have something to be pleasantly surprised about.', 'Having just returned from the apparent world premier, I can assure you that if you are a fan of anime with compelling stories, well constructed plots, and a suitable amount of intrigue, this film is most definitely not for you.I\'m sure the original story is as nuanced and engrossing as the reputation of its author would suggest. However, what the director of this film has managed to cram into these (approximate) 90 minutes is not so much a tale of psychic rivals and their attempts to impact history as it is a mishmash of awkward, stereotypically \'anime-ish\' relationships and overt use of inanely pretty...scenery and characters. The first 20 minutes of the film are unnecessarily accompanied by the constant falling of cherry blossom, for example.Indeed, in making use of as much cliché and anime trope as he could muster, the director completely destroyed any semblance of an engaging story line, reducing the plot to a series of awkward encounters, embarrassing emotional confessions (that see the constant and mind numbing use of anime\'s favourite phrase), failed philosophical musing, and out-of context and particularly unmindful quoting of Shakespeare (which seems to, of late, be quite the fashion in anime).So, yes, if you enjoy anime simply for awkward teenage crushes and angst, as well as cute characters and pretty images, then you will likely enjoy this. Anyone looking for a tale as touching  and well constructed as the likes of ""The girl who leapt through time"" or ""Millennium actress"" should look elsewhere. scenery and characters.

Half of the time I didn\'t even know what was going on. It starts of as a sort of slice of life, school romance with a touch of sci-fi but and then moves into weird territory concerning cellphones (and their banning), psychic powers, time travel and a troubling dictatorship subplot. And the characters, my god, don\'t get me started.There\'s the dull and boring main character, the life-long best friend neighbour girl...(who, obviously, has a crush on the main character), there\'s the best friend of the neighbour girl (who the main character, obviously, has a crush on, leaving the neighbour girl jealous for half the movie) and then finally there\'s the mysterious (Nagisa Kaworu clone) transfer student that the best friend of the neighbour girl, obviously, falls in love with and thus creating a love triangle (love quadrangle?). As you may have noticed, the plot is very obvious.But then you start to notice something. The art and animation. It\'s beautiful. Well, the backgrounds that is. The character design themselves look like you just straight-up copied whatever you found under the google search ""anime character"", but the art, from the 2D backgrounds to the 3D water, look amazing. But then there\'s the thing with the animation that caught my attention. It doesn\'t look right. It\'d look great if it was an action movie, because the characters are always jumping around and wailing their arms about utilizing a neat (but disorienting) motion-blur technique, but it\'s not an action movie. And then there\'s also the excessive use of lens flares and colorful special effects that is definitely not needed.It\'s also obvious that they recorded the voices after the initial animation because the mouths are almost never in sync. It makes for an unpleasant experience.It\'s as if the movie tried too hard to look and sound like a Makoto Shinkai movie that it ultimately forgot what the movie was about. It\'s obvious that more time was spent on the art and animation than the story itself, which is good in some cases, like Ghost in the Shell and The Sky Crawlers, but in this case it flat-out doesn\'t work. There\'s just too much dialogue and too much jabbering about with the story for that Mamoru Oshii approach to work.My final verdict is, if you\'re looking for cool new computer wallpapers, then you\'ve hit the jackpot. But if you\'re looking for something cohesive with a good story and interesting characters, you\'re better off with the jokes you find on the opposite end of a popsicle stick.SPOILER: THE CELLPHONE IS IN HIS SWIMMING TRUNKS.

Not once did anyone have a psychic battle against one another, let alone a war. From what I saw, a new handsome transfer student brainwashes all the students that had an aptitude to do some little magic, and were sent out to bully those who do not have powers. This in turn led to the tyranny of the student council, who created an inquisition hellbent on reprimanding those...who bring cell phones to school, because of course cell phones are the root of evil in a learning institution. Hypocritical I say. Of course, the underdog hero saves the day with his pervasive powers and changes the heart of the transfer student responsible. Turns out, humans were living on the moon in the future.ART (10)Admittedly, the art was very good. Very fluid motions throughout, and very beautiful scenery. I had a problem at the beginning with the sakura petals floating everywhere in every scene: on the beach, outside on the streets, at the edge of a cliff, and somehow inside a subway train. Reflections of the most random things like stairs and tables did also irk me a little. The amount of realistic details remind me of Makoto Shinkai's works. But overall, I think the animations were the only thing other than the sound that made me watch this all in one sitting.SOUND (8)They captured everything pretty well to be honest. The wind, the drops of water, and the piano. Though somewhat generic, the soundtrack was soothing and fitting for the scenes they were played in. And with a cast with Kana Hanazawa and Daisuke Ono, you know that the voice actings are not half-assed.CHARACTER (5)Generic hot guy transfers into school. The main hero is known to be a pervert and at times can be serious. Pathetic-looking, and his heart wavers too easily. His childhood friend loves him ever since they were little and he never took notice. He also cracked her windows yet no one actually cared to mention anything about that. A girl whose past we barely even know attempts to commit suicide, however a hot time traveling transfer student saves her and she becomes his henchman. Another girl from the student council falls in love with the transfer student at first sight. They all have a some form of relationships with one another. Be reminded that they are all in the 8th grade.ENJOYMENT (6)I was seriously looking forward to Nerawareta Gakuen. From reading the synopsis, I thought that the new transfer student will rule over the school and create a brainwashed army to send them to defeat the badass main lead. With awesome battle actions and stuff. Boy, was I disappointed. Near the end of the movie, I thought they were going to go all out since the main character realized his powers. Instead, he offered to have a gathering at a beach. Pretty anticlimatic.OVERALL (7)All this anime had were very pretty and fluid animations. The plot was pretty generic, the characters generic, and my expectations were not even close to being met. When I think of psychics, I think of people reading each other's minds, planning out each other's next moves in some sort of strategy. Not feeling each other's soul or whatever and create a cliche with other psychics. I would rate this lower, but averaging the above scores, I got a perfect 7. Should the score be lower? Maybe. But I decided to be fair and just average everything together. Unfortunately for Sunrise, this work has disappointed me. who bring cell phones to school, because of course cell phones are the root of evil in a learning institution. Hypocritical I say.

Unfortunately for Sunrise, this work has disappointed me."", ""It is a hard and often under-appreciated craft to bend cliches to your will and use them to create a beautiful and astonishing piece of art. The authors of Nerawareta Gakuen have succeeded.The first thing that draws attention are the visuals. This is one of the most beautiful anime movies that I've ever seen. The quality of art and animation is absolutely top-notch. It is very bright and colorful, but we're being bombarded with the faerie-like palette with absolute mastery. I would say it is worth watching for the visuals alone. The music and sound production follow in line, complimenting the breathtaking graphics perfectly.But...a beautiful world is definitely not everything this feature has to offer. We are being thrown into a world populated with refreshingly likable characters. In fact, it's almost too easy to sympathize and grow attached to them. It's a rare achievement for a movie set in a school setting - the characters are well written and none of them makes us wish the scene was already over - the plague of irritating cast has been avoided completely.When it comes to the plot, we spend a good half of the movie wondering what the heck is going on. As it unfolds, it turns out to be a very interesting take on the theme of time travel, and as would be expected from the previous paragraph, it unfolds naturally and is a product of a myriad of choices made by the characters - they behave in a natural and believable way and what we receive is an endearing tale of an idyllic setting disrupted by a mysterious transfer student. Personally, I love this kind of a story - it manages to show how a potentially world-altering event affects characters on a personal level. It certainly doesn't flip everyone's life over, people don't suddenly become detectives and heroes - they are still their old selves, even in a face of overwhelming circumstances.I can certainly see that this is not a movie that will appeal to everyone, and people looking for action, multiple-layered intrigue and a massive conspiracy would be disappointed. But if you're looking for more of a slice-of-life drama and allow yourself to be enchanted, you won't be disappointed.In one word - stunning. a beautiful world is definitely not everything this feature has to offer.

But if you're looking for more of a slice-of-life drama and allow yourself to be enchanted, you won't be disappointed.In one word - stunning."", 'To the casual viewer, Nerawareta Gakuen ostensibly appears to be about three seemingly average junior high students and one mysterious time traveler posing as a transfer student. However, if one peels back the first layer, it becomes obvious that Nerawareta Gakuen possesses myriad levels of complexity as it blends metaphor and reality.  By cleverly using love, telepathy, and cell phones as metaphors for various forms of personal connection while simultaneously allowing them to serve as key plot devices to drive the corporeal story, Nerawareta Gakuen attempts to tackle and frame philosophical questions such as the meaning of personal connection, loneliness, individuality, and privacy.Though...the story is also called ""Psychic Schools Wars"" in English, it is important to note that the primary adjectival definition of \'psychic\' refers to the human mind or soul in general and not to the more common nominal definition suggesting one who is sensitive to psychic phenomena. By explicating this subtle, but important, difference and examining it in light of the underlying philosophical narrative, the title of this story gains not only a different meaning but also aligns with the film\'s message that forming human connections is a battle.Story: (10)The corporeal story concerning the three students and one mysterious time traveler, though not cliché, utilizes story telling themes familiar to many cultures. The most prominent of these include unrequited love, love lost, time traveling, and psychic powers. While the script writers took more of an absurdist approach to the themes of time traveling and psychic powers by using them as plot devices without supplying an inherent explanation, this should not be negatively viewed as these devices lead the viewer more toward speculation than the creation of plot holes. Since neither psychic power nor time travel are used as plot gimmicks, the corporeal story ultimately and expectedly focuses upon unrequited love and love lost. When viewed in tandem with the deeper complexity of Nerawareta Gakuen, these themes resonate more soundly and serve as adapters, fastening the corporeal story to philosophical narrative.Though Nerawareta Gakuen explores philosophical questions concerning connection, it is does not directly answer them. Instead, the film continues the narrative begun by numerous philosophers, and demonstrates the pain of loneliness, and the struggle to make meaningful connections while retaining one\'s individuality. Though no solution is posited to this ancient and inherent problem in human society, Nerawareta Gakuen offers reassurance that no matter how painful forming a connection between human beings may be, bonds are important to our survival and that ultimately we will struggle to survive to create connections or create connection to survive.Characters: (10)Though rather plain, the characters are likeable and memorable. Though some may find their actions cliché, they are more mundane than anything. Though it is common for characters of Japanese anime and manga and American film, modern literature, and television to possess interesting or irregular personalities, abilities, or traits; human beings are rarely flourished in actuality. In consideration of Nerawareta Gakuen\'s philosophical narrative, it seems obvious that the writers would deliberately create characters who are average (or as some may declare cliché), like most people.  They do this to demonstrate the tenacity required to make connections, the pain of being lonely, and the difficulty of hiding secrets. Since each of Nerawareta Gakuen\'s characters are average, they all attempt to find ways to differentiate their individuality while seeking ways to connect with others. Even the most unusual character, who is a time traveler and can awaken the psychic powers of others, is merely an average adolescent seeking to fit in a place where he does not belong. As such, Nerawareta Gakuen\'s characters are perfect in their own right. They are normal because they are representative of humanity and changing these characters to possess unique traits or personalities would undermine the power and meaning of Nerawareta Gakuen\'s story.Art and Visuals: (10)Like many anime films, Nerawareta Gakuen possesses astonishingly beautiful artwork and animations. By themselves the backgrounds are highly detailed breathtaking works of art, but when combined  with animations brought to life with meticulous effort, one finds oneself overwhelmed with visual stimulation. Many of the backgrounds are so enchanting it would not seem unlikely if they were found displayed in an art gallery. Each new background that occupies a frame could easily be paused and examined in great detail before moving to the next. Character designs, while not unique, are well drawn, do not detract from the visual experience and allow for easy animation.With respect to the animation, the characters\' movements  are fluid and the CG is well designed. In general, characters\' movements are natural and rather fun to watch. The animators added many discrete movements that benefit the film\'s overall realism. At first, one may find oneself distracted by such movements because he or she is not accustomed to such quality animation. However, as the movie progresses, the viewer acclimates and begins to enjoy this degree of animation. The CG was beautifully created and positioned and added to the scene, but never unnecessarily took the focus.Though still frames are often the mark of a lazy animator, they are often quite effective given the proper set of circumstances. Nerawareta Gakuen is unusual in that still frames are rarely, albeit effectively, utilized. Interjection of still frames is often paired with exposition,  explanation, or extrication from lively scenes, facilitating the viewer\'s comprehension of important details, allowing a moment for the viewer to procure and understand the meanings of symbolism, or to engage the film with questions of the viewer\'s own.Audio: (10)Nerawareta Gakuen\'s voice acting is superlative. Despite a combination of seasoned veterans and rising stars, it is often difficult to tell the difference between two. Each voice actor easily conveys her or his character\'s feelings and words without forced effort or contrivance, which favorably augments the overall suspension of disbelief. Conversely, the voice actors did not overact their characters which adds to each character\'s individuality and believability.The film\'s musical score is enchanting but subtle. Nerawareta Gakuen\'s score often supports the characters\' emotions and in turn the scene as opposed to creating the emotion and the scene. As a result, the music adopts an important side role, but rarely takes a center stage in serving as the focus. The one exception is the direct mention of and reference to Debussy\'s ""Clair de Lune"" which in turn alludes to the poem of the same name and Shakespeare\'s ""A Midsummer Night\'s Dream."" Since ""Clair de Lune"" and its allusions epitomize each character\'s struggle for personal connection and against insecurity and loneliness, its significance cannot be understated.Conclusion: (10)Nerawareta Gakuen is easily one of the best anime films ever produced. It\'s voice acting and music help to respectively build a strong suspension of disbelief and rich emotional world. It\'s artwork and animation are flawless, allowing the viewer to focus less on nitpicking poor animation and more on the story and the questions raised. The film\'s simple corporeal story coupled with its complex philosophical narrative makes it both a joy to watch and adds immeasurable re-watch value. If you enjoy heartrending stories of personal connection, beautiful animation and artwork, powerful voice acting and musical scores, or having a film force you to think, and have yet to watch Nerawareta Gakuen, this film is for you. If you have already watched Nerawareta Gakuen, but missed the basic allusions and philosophical narrative, watching it again might amply increase both your comprehension of and affection for this film. the story is also called ""Psychic Schools Wars"" in English, it is important to note that the primary adjectival definition of \'psychic\' refers to the human mind or soul in general and not to the more common nominal definition suggesting one who is sensitive to psychic phenomena.

However, is it really so easy to impersonally call someone a friend from having their cell phone number or email address? Rather than speaking through the ""mind,"" simply expressing your feelings through words and actions can be more effective than any kind of computer or cell phone can offer.Blending elements of time travel, psychic awareness and philosophy, ""Nerawareta Gakuen"" (Psychic School Wars) focuses on...a group of students who get caught up in a time traveler\'s attempts to change the bleak future that seems to await humanity. Through loosely connected sequences, the film poses questions about when to express your actual feelings and the morality of whether or not to change something that inevitably will happen. Set in a vibrant world of color, the film uses two interlinked love stories to tackle these questions, linking the stories with the overarching theme of the difficulty of forming connections.Using psychic powers and time travel as a medium, the film wants to challenge the notion of what it means to stay connected. The psychic powers here are mostly telepathy and psychic awareness, as opposed to things like psychokinesis and pyrokinesis. It is a complex plot with many things to take into consideration, and it will take creative thinking to piece together the loosely connected sequences into a single, overarching story that has many, many layers. Peel a layer back and another more complex one replaces it. It is smart and refreshing, and linking the themes to the story gives a wistful interpretation of staying in contact with one another. For the time traveler, who lives in a hopeless future, and for the psychic, who lives in relative peace,  their interpretations of personal relationships and ideas of love are considerably different.One of the most striking features of the film is the beautiful animation and diverse color palette. Shades of red, blue, and green dominate the scenery, and the characters make references to fairy tales and plays, almost giving a self appreciating kind of awareness. With the animation quality rivaling other films known for this, such as ""Kotonoha no Niwa"" and ""Byousoku 5 Centimeter"", both directed by Makoto Shinkai, ""Nerawareta Gakuen"" is definitely one of the best looking anime films. The sky in particular looks beautiful, with many different colors used. Watching the film almost feels like a dream, with one fantastic background moving to another fantastic background. Colors flow and blend easily, immersing the characters in a vibrant world. Lighting is also a high point of the film, mimicking the sun\'s rays and emphasizing the contrast between light and dark.One of the most common staples in anime is cherry blossoms blowing in the wind, or falling from the trees. The beginning of the film in particular has cherry blossoms scattered everywhere, from train tracks to the path leading to school, almost saturating the film with the flowers. It is toned down significantly as the film progresses, but their presence is a common reminder of the passing of seasons and fading beauty.The film\'s soundtrack consists of soothing instrumental pieces and piano themes. The transfer student in particular likes ""Clair de Lune"" by Claude Debussy, a fitting piece for him given the character\'s background. It\'s placement is smart and is a major point in one of the central love stories, bringing the two characters to a common love of piano playing. The opening theme is ""Giniro Hikousen"" by supercell, and the ending theme is ""Sayonara no Hashi by Mayu Watanabe, one of the voice actresses. The soundtrack captured the mood of the film perfectly, with breathtaking, dreamy scenes accompanied by a resonating soundtrack.The characters talk about fairy tales, dreams, and acting, and that\'s almost precisely what this film is, a modern interpretation of a fairy tale. Its moments of blending reality and fantasy is visually and emotionally spectacular, and something that will bring with it many questions. Common to fairy tales, there is a lesson to be learned, but I think I will leave that lesson to be learned up to you. Interpretations, after all, are the most important thing when watching a film of this complex nature. It\'s re-watch value is very high, and a second or third viewing will lead to new interpretations and new insight to the time traveler\'s and the psychic\'s journey. While difficult to digest, I believe  ""Nerawareta Gakuen"" is a worthwhile experience that will leave a positive, if bittersweet impression on the viewer.After all, even in the hustle and bustle of increasing technology, and even when fantastical elements are introduced, simply reaching out to someone else can make all the difference, affecting the present and the uncertain future. a group of students who get caught up in a time traveler\'s attempts to change the bleak future that seems to await humanity.

I especially thought that the surprise at the ending made up for the confusion throughout. Yeah, it wasn't packed full of action, and twenty more minutes to clear up the plot would certainly have been welcome, but, regardless, I definitely thought it was worth the just shy of two hours I spent watching it.From this point on, there WILL be SPOILERS. The next section are for people who watched the movie and were confused. This should clear up a lot.Let's start from the beginning.Ryouichi Kyougoku's father went back it time FIRST, in...order to save the future (in which humanity had made the Earth uninhabitable, forcing them to live on the moon). He failed (presumably thanks to Seki Kouji (Seki Kenji's grandfather). However, Ryouichi Sr. did meet his wife and took her to the future, where she would give birth to Ryouichi Kyougoku before shortly dying (due to her lack of telepathic ability).Now, apparently, time traveling puts a lot of strain on the heart, as such, you can pretty much only make a round trip (to one time period and back). With that said, already having went into the past once and failing to accomplish his goal, Ryouichi Sr. sent his son to the past (and the same time period his wife / mother was from) to complete the mission (either stop humanity from destroying the Earth by connecting people through telepathy or bringing those telepaths to the future to help stave off the dying human race, as in the future, only those with telepathic abilities can survive.Now, at some point before Ryouichi Kyougoku enters, Seki Kenji is born and grows up with Suzuura Natsuki, a childhood friend who developed strong feeling for him at an early age. He DIED. Seki Kenji DIED as a child. She, being a telepath, used her powers to go back in time so that she was injured instead. However, since everything has a price, she lost her powers but saved Kenji's life. As some point, Kenji's grandfather, Kouji, SEALED Kenji's telepathic abilities.Enter Ryouichi Kyougoku, a time traveler sent to complete his father's mission. As per, he takes over the school relatively easily. The missing students seemed to be staying at home due to fear or suspended for carrying their cell phones to school (it was also mentioned that the vice president moved away) or taken by Kyougoku himself for his mission.I'm assuming everyone understood the romance part, so I'll only give a brief recap. Natsuki likes Kenji, who likes Harukawa, who likes Kyougoku, who likes Harukawa in return (just like 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'). It causes problems. Nevertheless, Harukawa and Natsuki are attacked and both find out about Kyougoku's mission. Natsuki stops going to school. Kenji saves Harukawa, and the three convene and decide to keep going to school even after learning Kyougoku's true purpose.The cell phone ban gets worse (all apart of Kyougoku's master plan), and Kouji releases Kenji's sealed telepathic abilities (also a part of the master plan), which he uses to save Natsuki from the angered student council (as both he and her broke the rule by carrying cell phones to school and were caught). Knowing that Kenji intends to stop his plan, Kyougoku challenges him to a fight. Kenji refuses, and the four go to the beach in an attempt to understand one another and bring peace. It goes well; and everyone ends up with the person they are supposed to (Kenji X Natsuki; Kyougoku X Harukawa).However, Kyougoku needs to return to his own time or be 'eaten' by the one he is in. Despite, Harukawa's love for him, he refuses to bring her for fear that she will die (as she is not a telepath) just like his mother. There is a slight skirmish between him and Kenji that happens INSIDE the time stream, but they are both returned to the moment they left. However, Kyougoku is injured due to his excess time in the past. So, Kenji uses his power to sent them both into the future (a one-way trip as Kenji will not have enough power to return). Natsuki and Harukawa and everyone else forgets that Kenji and Kyougoku existed once they leave. Seki Kouji has a stroke or heart attack.Since Kenji destroyed the device and went to the future (which he COULD live in as he had telepathic abilities), everything at the school went back to normal, though both Natsuki and Harukawa felt some sort of longing for the love they lost. However, Kenji (who is TRAPPED in the FUTURE) was able to sent back a device that allowed Natsuki to regain her memories and for them to talk (for how long was not specified). Kyougoku's mission was a success, and the future Kenji called from was from Earth, which in this future had NOT been destroyed by humanity. order to save the future (in which humanity had made the Earth uninhabitable, forcing them to live on the moon).

Nerawareta Gakuen is a supernatural romantic drama that starts off simple but gradually builds into a beautiful story that drops 2/3s of the way through. Allow me to explain what I mean. Nerawareta Gakuen starts off as a touching middle school romance between a set of friends that turns into a heart wrenching love triangle of pure unrequited love for each person involved. The love triangle gets even more complicated when Ryoichi, the new transfer student enrolls. Said transfer students turns out...to be from the future and has come to turn more people into ""psychics"" to build a better future for humanity. I won\'t tell you the entire plot but basically the plan ends up looking more like a strict and frightening dictatorship instead of a peaceful and happy society. It\'s up to the main character, Kenji to stop Ryoichi and his ""psychic"" followers and this is where things get complicated. The overall movie contains two plots, a touching romantic drama and a supernatural drama. The movie builds up to an amazing climax and then quickly drops into a confusing battle between Kenji and Ryoichi that makes little to no sense once it\'s all over. I attempted to go back and look for any missing or misunderstood moments but I still came up with ""WTF Just Happened?""Don\'t get me wrong, this is actually still a good movie to watch but keep in mind that the last half hour of the film will be pretty confusing. I think the producer and writer were probably thinking that they had no idea where to go after building such a stunning climax and just decided to jump off and see where they land. The animation and music for this movie are both incredible but neither of them make up for that last half hour of the film. I say go and watch it yourself. Hopefully you can come up with a better answer to the ending than I did. to be from the future and has come to turn more people into ""psychics"" to build a better future for humanity.

It's still fresh in my mind, and while I won't intend to do the normal layout of a review going over the story, art, sound, etc. separately, I felt I'd just give an overall.Before watching this, I had finished Hotarubi no Mori e on youtube and Nerawareta Gakuen came up in the sidebar so I thought, why not give it a chance. And it was worth it. At some points, like in a lot of movies, there's a lack of action,...and instead they focus more on building the characters which I was completely fine with seeing that you needed all that background knowledge in order for the movie to really hit and forge an emotional bond with you. The only true thing I disliked was the inclusion of awkward fanservice scenes, which, since it's about highschoolers, are too be expected, and they were definitely not as bad as the majority of animes- But I could have done without. Some things were definitely unclear while watching, and at times I was left confused and asking questions- And even in the end I was left with a few, but overall, the story was great. It was original, and the best part, the ending wasn't cliché.I sat there the whole time expecting to be able to guess the ending. I prepared myself for what may have happened, and then it never did, and I'd explain my presumptions, but I wouldn't want to give anything away. While I have to admit, still, the ending was a tad anticlimactic and I would have honestly LOVED it if it were just a bit longer to get in some other minor details, it was definitely a heart breaker. I will most definitely be sharing this movie with ALL my friends and I'll probably force my family to sit through it too.Any movie that's capable of making me cry definitely earns it's way onto my favorites list because it's a rare occurrence that you're able to forge such a strong connection to characters over such a minimal time. To sum it up, Nerawareta Gakuen is definitely worth your time. and instead they focus more on building the characters which I was completely fine with seeing that you needed all that background knowledge in order for the movie to really hit and forge an emotional bond with you.

Don't get me wrong, I liked the characters, the sound as well as the art work, but that becomes a mute point when the actual plot line leaves a lot of unanswered questions for the viewer. Everything else ends up feeling like it was wasted. There is that much lack of closure by the end. It's to the point I'm frustrated and annoyed, particularly when I was honestly looking forward to this one.One of the main issues comes from the fact the movie isn't just about certain characters having powers, it's about time travel. As I watched the...series, I found the use of time travel theory to be poorly used. Which particular time theory they were trying to use honestly isn't made clear, everything is that vague.    Actually, it is vague to the point where the identity of one of the characters remains vague even until the end, and yet said character (Ryouichi's mother) remains unidentified.Which is one of the intriguing things about the characters that is missed out upon, how the relationships between the various characters work over all. Only the surface is touched upon, everything else is... well... the mystery that ended being so hyped up ends up bearing no fruit what so ever.

The film is plagued with aimless direction, among other things, that prevents it from being any more than eye candy. Besides being pretty to look at there’s nothing to be gained from seeing this film that’s a chore to finish.The premise of Nerawareta Gakuen, which translates to the cooler sounding, but very misleading English title Psychic School War starts out simple. Introducing four characters into what appears will be a romance story with light elements of sci-fi. Following four characters each...of whom contain bland characteristics leading to force conflicts that could have been easily been resolved. Being dragged out in order to pad out what little story it has. If it was only focused on the romance in the story, it would have been bland if it revolved around childhood friends along with a love triangle that’s entirely one sided nor add much of a conflict between the characters. Seeing, let alone learning about the character's relationship with one another is spread thinly in the film. Emoting a sense of boredom that plays the usual tricks (will they won't they hook up being the main element in use) in its setup.If it was only a sci-fi than it would have still been incomprehensible. Vague explanations are given on how time traveling works, character backstory is revealed with sparse bits of information, the apocalypse that occurred gets a quick brief mention with unanswered questions, and how psychic powers work is flimsy. Some of it is explained like how other character can unlock the ability to read other minds, but what exactly it can do is left up to the imagination. One of the most crucial elements in the film that receives muddle explanations is an hourglass shaped device that Ryouichi carries around with him which he uses in order to create more psychics. He uses this device predominantly to achieve his goal and by badly presenting it purpose it’s easy to lose sight of how he’s going to accomplish what he sets out to do.It’s so bad at telling its story that the whole plot has to use a very weak plot point involving a school policy which prevents students from bringing cell phones to school in order to show visible progress of the central conflict. In the worst possible way it tries to use this plot point to say some sort of commentary on social interaction by having students ignore or enforce the no cell phone policy. On a dramatic level this plot point becomes exaggerated that anything serious it wanted to say is downplayed in delivery. Seeing students expresses their hatred for cell phones in an over the top presentation is unable to be enjoyable in silliness because it wants to be taken seriously. There’s no build up to steadily show its central conflict becoming larger nor provide enough visual cues that more students are becoming psychic. At most, it only shows two students becoming physic which isn’t enough to provide a glimpse at the bigger picture. Instead characters have to exposition it to each other to get important information out. Sounding unnatural in several conversations.The characters aren’t any better. Our four main characters in the film are archetypes that get introduced and three of them remain static in their journey. Kenji Seki is a dumb teen who has bad luck and oblivious to the fact his childhood friend Natsuki Suzuura loves him. It’s reasonable why Kenji is oblivious about Natsuki feelings since in one minute Natsuki teases him, punches him, and calls the police on him. He’s an idiotic character who’s unable to process thoughts. Unable in the fact he doesn’t how to handle any situation when comforting friends. He’s simply lucks out in how problems play out. Kenji is underdeveloped, though the only one who seems to grow in the film. In some ways he matures gaining a different outlook on life. Without much of a character to explore he ends up banal like the other characters.Natsuki Suzuura is the typical girl next door who picks on Kenji to hide her true feelings from him. The way she acts needlessly prolongs an easily solvable conflict. She even says herself if she was more direct in expressing herself she wouldn’t be going through any overblown struggles. She’s another bland character who's made entirely unlikable by how she acts. The first time she’s seen in the film she reports Kenji to the police by lying that Kenji was going to rape her. This is also how Natsuki character is introduced in the film, which gives a bad first impression of her character. Around the 23 minute mark Natsuki slaps Kenji for a comment he made regarding loving someone without mutual feelings being returned. Natsuki up to this point has shown no sign of even liking Kenji. Within that time frame she acts like a tsundere hitting Kenji throughout the film and teases Kenji nonstop who does not like getting teased. Despite acting how Natsuki does she wonders why Kenji doesn’t love her. When the film ends she still hasn’t a change bit proving she’s the film most dense character.Kahori Harukawa is an unimportant character. Besides one brief scene the writers prefer to keep Kahori entire character one dimensional. Her backstory is glanced over with a brief mention which ends all of her characterization with a couple of seconds. As a character she’s weak and her place in the story is unimportant. She has no conflict nor does anything to advance the story. She also falls in love with Ryouichi Kyougoku for shallow reasons. It’s explained she fell in love with him at the first sight of Ryouichi and the material reinforces that fact. There is hardly a scene of Kahori and Ryouichi getting to know each other. The only thing they know about each other for a majority of the film is they both play piano. That’s about it. Once it reaches the hour mark both characters are lovey-dovey towards each other despite only sharing one scene of actually doing anything together outside of school. This later comes to affect the final act of the film. Due a specific revelation both characters won’t be able to be together. Instead of being a strong dramatic pull in the story it’s simply just there as fluff.The worst character in the film is Ryouichi Kyougoku who's the popular, mysterious transfer student with a hidden agenda. Ryouichi single handedly brings down the time travel and physic aspect of the film. He’s a poorly written character, giving out his backstory unnaturally as possible and providing vague explanations on the process of time traveling and physic powers. He knows how everything works, but the audience doesn’t making any scene that has anything supernatural onscreen become convoluted. Almost as if literally making up the rules of how time traveling and physic powers work as he goes along in the story. He receives scatter characterization some of which gets dropped. In the film its mentioned Ryouichi will execute a revenge plan. What exactly it was is delivered in a throwaway line that’s easy to miss.The animation is done by Sunrise studio and it’s virtually flawless. Director Ryosuke Nakamura eye for details is rich in every single scene of the movie. Meticulous details in the visuals from the cherry blossom petals being blown in the breeze to the gleaming rays of light shining through the classroom windows. Everything from beginning to end looks beautiful. Another outstanding feature is the use of color hues and tones to accentuate and render scenic clouds and evening skies. There usually something always moving on screen with high detail that it becomes mesmerizing. For a majority of the film it movements sticks to the ordinary with the occasional over the top short burst moments and supernatural elements when on display. No matter what’s on screen the amount of time it must have taken to animate the film is something to appreciate.The voice acting is in general is passable, but underwhelming due to the material. Kana Kanazawa plays Kahori who I already mentioned is pointless in the story. It’s a performance that I can’t blame Kanazawa for phoney in since her character hardly changes emotion limiting options in her portrayal. Daisuke Ono, who plays Ryouichi Kyougoku has a similar problem. A big role with limited range, which again limits the voice actor abilities to portray the characters. That’s two talented voice actors who are handicapped because of the material.Yuutaro Honjou plays Kenji Seki whose performance does allow ranged. Unlike his more experience co-stars his balance of drama and comedy generally misses the mark. When he’s meant to sound sincere it comes across as a bad rehearsal take. Sounding mundane when experiencing important life changing events. Mayu Watanabe plays Natsuki Suzuura does a good job. Unfortunately because of how her character is written she also comes across as the most annoying. Playing a tsunderes she sounds sweet one moment then flips the switch to being angry the next. That’s our four lead actors, each of whom are unable to overcome the material shortcoming. The supporting cast because of limited screen time don’t suffer the same problem. They’re fine in small roles. There’s no English dub for the film which given the sloppy delivery of the story is understandable.The soundtrack is done by Shusei Murai and it’s repetitive. Nearly all the tracks sound sentimental working against the film. There’s hardly any variety in the music Murai composed. Becoming aggregating to listen to when most of the tracks are soft piano ballads that sound similar to one another with just a minor variation of one track. Too many tracks sound too similar to each other its entirely lazy. To paint a clearer picture on the lack of varied music the OST for the film there are 25 tracks and 22 of them are soft piano ballads. If it doesn’t feature a soft piano ballad it’ll feature a Violin another instrument Murai goes out of his way to make annoying to listen to. Hearing the soundtrack is infuriating because no effort is made to make each track sound different. Getting the suspicion that the soundtrack simply looped one song over and over again. There are only two distinctive sounding and noteworthy tracks in the film coming from artists Ryo and supercell. Like the rest of the score, the songs these two artists provide are blissful with usage of soft piano ballads. They are nice songs, even if they are forgettable immediately after they end.Nerawareta Gakuen is a complicated mess and poorly told, but does make sense. Although this being my second time seeing the movie I wrote down notes which in the end made the story sensical. However, the information is so poorly relayed to the audience due to brief throwaway explanations that reveal very little or simply glancing over important details that are essential to understanding its story. Before reaching the one hour mark the film fails to provide characters good enough to carry a story, wanders around aimlessly without a purpose, and finally a conflict that uses convoluted plot points making it uninvolving. The remainder of the film will feel longer than it actually is. That’s not even taking into account the repetitive soundtrack becoming grating on the ears as it goes making the experience worse. Pretty to look at, no doubt, but with no substance whatsoever it makes you ponder what a waste of beautiful animation. of whom contain bland characteristics leading to force conflicts that could have been easily been resolved. Being dragged out in order to pad out what little story it has. If it was only focused on the romance in the story, it would have been bland if it revolved around childhood friends along with a love triangle that’s entirely one sided nor add much of a conflict between the characters. Seeing, let alone learning about the character's relationship with one another is spread thinly in the film. Emoting a sense of boredom that plays the usual tricks (will they won't they hook up being the main element in use) in its setup.If it was only a sci-fi than it would have still been incomprehensible. Vague explanations are given on how time traveling works, character backstory is revealed with sparse bits of information, the apocalypse that occurred gets a quick brief mention with unanswered questions, and how psychic powers work is flimsy. Some of it is explained like how other character can unlock the ability to read other minds, but what exactly it can do is left up to the imagination. One of the most crucial elements in the film that receives muddle explanations is an hourglass shaped device that Ryouichi carries around with him which he uses in order to create more psychics. He uses this device predominantly to achieve his goal and by badly presenting it purpose it’s easy to lose sight of how he’s going to accomplish what he sets out to do.It’s so bad at telling its story that the whole plot has to use a very weak plot point involving a school policy which prevents students from bringing cell phones to school in order to show visible progress of the central conflict. In the worst possible way it tries to use this plot point to say some sort of commentary on social interaction by having students ignore or enforce the no cell phone policy. On a dramatic level this plot point becomes exaggerated that anything serious it wanted to say is downplayed in delivery. Seeing students expresses their hatred for cell phones in an over the top presentation is unable to be enjoyable in silliness because it wants to be taken seriously. There’s no build up to steadily show its central conflict becoming larger nor provide enough visual cues that more students are becoming psychic. At most, it only shows two students becoming physic which isn’t enough to provide a glimpse at the bigger picture. Instead characters have to exposition it to each other to get important information out. Sounding unnatural in several conversations.The characters aren’t any better. Our four main characters in the film are archetypes that get introduced and three of them remain static in their journey. Kenji Seki is a dumb teen who has bad luck and oblivious to the fact his childhood friend Natsuki Suzuura loves him. It’s reasonable why Kenji is oblivious about Natsuki feelings since in one minute Natsuki teases him, punches him, and calls the police on him. He’s an idiotic character who’s unable to process thoughts. Unable in the fact he doesn’t how to handle any situation when comforting friends. He’s simply lucks out in how problems play out. Kenji is underdeveloped, though the only one who seems to grow in the film. In some ways he matures gaining a different outlook on life. Without much of a character to explore he ends up banal like the other characters.Natsuki Suzuura is the typical girl next door who picks on Kenji to hide her true feelings from him. The way she acts needlessly prolongs an easily solvable conflict. She even says herself if she was more direct in expressing herself she wouldn’t be going through any overblown struggles. She’s another bland character who's made entirely unlikable by how she acts. The first time she’s seen in the film she reports Kenji to the police by lying that Kenji was going to rape her. This is also how Natsuki character is introduced in the film, which gives a bad first impression of her character. Around the 23 minute mark Natsuki slaps Kenji for a comment he made regarding loving someone without mutual feelings being returned. Natsuki up to this point has shown no sign of even liking Kenji. Within that time frame she acts like a tsundere hitting Kenji throughout the film and teases Kenji nonstop who does not like getting teased. Despite acting how Natsuki does she wonders why Kenji doesn’t love her. When the film ends she still hasn’t a change bit proving she’s the film most dense character.Kahori Harukawa is an unimportant character. Besides one brief scene the writers prefer to keep Kahori entire character one dimensional. Her backstory is glanced over with a brief mention which ends all of her characterization with a couple of seconds. As a character she’s weak and her place in the story is unimportant. She has no conflict nor does anything to advance the story. She also falls in love with Ryouichi Kyougoku for shallow reasons. It’s explained she fell in love with him at the first sight of Ryouichi and the material reinforces that fact. There is hardly a scene of Kahori and Ryouichi getting to know each other. The only thing they know about each other for a majority of the film is they both play piano. That’s about it. Once it reaches the hour mark both characters are lovey-dovey towards each other despite only sharing one scene of actually doing anything together outside of school. This later comes to affect the final act of the film. Due a specific revelation both characters won’t be able to be together. Instead of being a strong dramatic pull in the story it’s simply just there as fluff.The worst character in the film is Ryouichi Kyougoku who's the popular, mysterious transfer student with a hidden agenda. Ryouichi single handedly brings down the time travel and physic aspect of the film. He’s a poorly written character, giving out his backstory unnaturally as possible and providing vague explanations on the process of time traveling and physic powers. He knows how everything works, but the audience doesn’t making any scene that has anything supernatural onscreen become convoluted. Almost as if literally making up the rules of how time traveling and physic powers work as he goes along in the story. He receives scatter characterization some of which gets dropped. In the film its mentioned Ryouichi will execute a revenge plan. What exactly it was is delivered in a throwaway line that’s easy to miss.The animation is done by Sunrise studio and it’s virtually flawless. Director Ryosuke Nakamura eye for details is rich in every single scene of the movie. Meticulous details in the visuals from the cherry blossom petals being blown in the breeze to the gleaming rays of light shining through the classroom windows. Everything from beginning to end looks beautiful. Another outstanding feature is the use of color hues and tones to accentuate and render scenic clouds and evening skies. There usually something always moving on screen with high detail that it becomes mesmerizing. For a majority of the film it movements sticks to the ordinary with the occasional over the top short burst moments and supernatural elements when on display.

However, having full enjoyed the movie, I got on the Internet and started poking around - where did this come from, what was the vision behind it, that kind of thing. And everywhere I go - whether it's Anime News Network or here on MAL, every says that the story is about the main characters battle for freedom at their school.That isn't true at all. This anime is about the characters, period, and the plot only works to emphasize their relationships. All of the cast are very simple characters - there really isn't...anything in their personalities that we haven't seen anywhere else. But the motions, acting, and their depth of feeling come across extremely well. Natsuki's continued annoyance at being unable to tell Kenta about her feelings; Kenta's omni-present inability to understand the people around him; Harukawa having to deal with falling in love for the first time - they are presented earnestly and really got under my skin. Every time Natsuki fought with Kenta, I braced for the break-up and my heart dropped. When Harukawa sneaks into the music room to listen to Kyogoku play the piano, my own feelings when I first fell in love came back to me. Despite having a plot that revolves around time-travel and psychic abilities, it's the characters emotions that resonate most deeply.It's not all dramatic though. There are lots of moments of levity, mostly revolving around Kenta. I won't lie, he's a stereotypical shonen type - stupid, but honest and true - and his simple nature helps keep the movie from taking itself too seriously.As for the specifics of the plot, I really liked this movie because it's all there, it's just never spelled out. After finishing the movie, I walked to my local grocery store (literally a five minute walk) and talked out my confusion to myself. And yeah, you WILL be confused. Nothing about the plot is very well explained, but for someone who is paying attention and is willing to draw the lines, the background story adds so much. Small revelations - for example, Kenta's dog, Shiho - made me appreciate how well thought out the story for this was.Artistically, holy cow. Nerawareta is full of bright colors, lushly painted scenery, well-animated characters, and MOVEMENT. One of my personal problems with anime shows is that there are a lot of stiff, standing characters who just talk. Or even worse, the director just focuses in on the eyes for a five minute speech - AND THE EYES DON'T EVEN BLINK. But not here. Characters bounce, and shift, and blink, and even something as simple as slapping a person's face has extra movement added to make it more dynamic and impactful. When Kyogoku plays the piano, there are not only shots of his hands on the keys, but matching animation for the reflection in the wooden surface. That is the focus on quality and realism that I came to appreciate about this movie.Ultimately, Nerawareta Gakuen is a love story - and even better, it's TWO love stories. I can't say that everything makes perfect sense. This is a time travel story and I feel like there is a lot left out in regards to the time travel stuff. But at it's core, this story is about Natsuki and Kenta and their struggle to find each other despite being neighbors forever. anything in their personalities that we haven't seen anywhere else.

I was delighted by the simple, but yet gradual story line that changed from everyday comedy, to intense drama. Drama that was very raw, and so that not a second of it was wasted to cause the viewer a sense of ""too much drama"". The art was beautiful from the very beginning, and it only gets better as the true ""psychic war"" unfolds. This anime will keep you...at the edge of your seat in the sense of romance if you\'re a sap like me, and the deep meanings that it touches upon will keep the not-so-into-romance type happy with the plot.In the end, a TOTAL must see! Definitely something to watch to lighten your mood. Even if you\'re in-between different animes right now, give this one a try. If nothing, it will give you a change of pace from other animes, and will prep you to watch something else...but really I hope that if you do decide to watch this that you will enjoy it as much as I have!!!!!!!Final: 9.7/10 at the edge of your seat in the sense of romance if you\'re a sap like me, and the deep meanings that it touches upon will keep the not-so-into-romance type happy with the plot.In the end, a TOTAL must see!

We had four choices: AnoHana Movie, Hotaru no Haka, Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo, and Nerawareta Gakuen. Because I thought the rest of the choices would be too sentimental for a casual watch, we went with the last choice, Nerawareta Gakuen.Don't make the same mistake I did.I'll say it right away. I am not sure where this story stands in terms of science fiction writing (the source material), but in terms of an anime movie adaptation, it is horrible.Story (3)I do understand that everyone enjoys a different type of story. Some prefer drama, some prefer...action, and some prefer science-fiction, and the rest like other types of stories.If you had to ask me what type of a story Nerawareta Gakuen is, I am not even sure where to begin. There is the romance, the science-fiction element, a fair share of drama, and just pure slice of life moments without ever being funny. As a romance-drama story, it could do away with the complicated time-travelling superpower back story. As a science-fiction, it suffers from melodrama and deficiency of plot structure. As a school slice-of-life story, there is not even a slice of comedy.Anyways, no matter how we define this movie, one thing is for sure. By the end of the viewing experience, I bet most of us viewers did not understand what-the-fuck happened in the movie. The story might made sense in the more detailed story-telling of the original science-fiction novel, it sure did not make any sense here.One thing that the production team screwed up worse than the story itself is the pacing. The painful experience of watching this movie is like watching a slug moving across the road. Individual preferences differ significantly with pacing, but I dare to say the majority of viewers will agree with me.Art (8)Artwork is very well-done in this movie. I really like the emphasis on the various scenes where sakura petals fall from the sky. The animation is also pretty good. Highlight include Natsuki's complicated gymnastic maneuvers whenever she appears on screen. Strangely enough, the art in this movie didn't really do anything for the story as a whole, unlike perhaps in Makoto Shinkai's 5cm per second. Put it this way. You could spend 2 million dollors on animating a person walking from point A to point B, making it looks gorgeous. However, in the end it would still just be the a person walking from point A to point B, no matter what kind of elaborate background you draw.Sound (7)I wanted to give a higher score for the sound, but the truth is, the only outstanding part about it is the OP, which is a no-brainer really because it's done by Supercell. The sound tracks, if there were any, did not do anything for me, nor was it particularly bad. Hanazawa Kana's voice acting could be identified at the first minute of the movie, but her performance in this work is mediocre. Just mediocre.Character (6)Overall, the characters weren't bad, nor were they particularly interesting people to watch. I really don't want to comment too much on the characters because I feel like in this show, whether or not viewers like these characters would very much be subjected to viewer's whimsical discretion. Though, no matter how good a character is, he would just be dull in a dull story.Enjoyment (3)The first five minutes of listening to Supercell's Giniro Hikousen gave me hope. The next hour extinguished most of my unrealistic expectation. I did not particularly liked or disliked the ending, since I was already desensitized to this movie at that point. I was just glad that the producers decided to play the last minute of Giniro Hikousen at the last minute of the show.Overall (3.5)I finally know why this movie was ranked at #1882 (Nov 6, 2014).

However, art isn\'t the only category that makes a movie great or a flop. What pulled this movie down was the story/plot.Story (3):One world to describe the story: Confusing! The story was just all around the place. A new plot was  brought up even though the previous one has been left unsolved. The first half was fine since it was still introducing the characters &  the plot was still developing (exposition), and the tension and issues were building up(rising action). However, when the second...half started, it\'s just hard to follow or keep up. The climax, falling action and resolution was like ""WTF is happening"" or ""huh, what just happened""?Art (10):As aforementioned, this movie displays beautiful imagery that is relaxing and pleasing to the eyes. The colors were vivid, the scenes or background creative and breathtaking. The art in this movie is what allures us, viewers, to watch this film.Sound (9):Like the art, the soundtrack was relaxing and soothing to the ears.Characters (5):Characters were a tad dull and lacks development. Only a couple of the main characters showed progression. I felt that the remaining characters remained ""almost"" the same as the beginning of the film. The minor characters on the other hand, are not even worth mentioning. The plot didn\'t resolve any of the issues of the minor characters, basically, leaving them idle and unsettled.Enjoyment (6):I really enjoyed the art and soundtrack. In terms of storyline, I only enjoyed the romance and the comedy that was depicted. Aside from that, I wasn\'t please by the confusion the plot brought - the fact that there were a numerous loopholes and unsolved issues.With this, my overall would be a 6. The art/sound really compensated for everything else it lacked to be a great film. I was immensely disappointed in this film. Keep your expectations rather low and you\'ll probably enjoy the film. half started, it\'s just hard to follow or keep up.

In fact, good enough that I could have given it a 7-8, but I had to reduce it down to a 6 because, even though the idea was a very good one, as I was watching it, I felt that the story was very 'jumpy' and 'all over the place,' and also rushed through. They left a lot of unanswered questions too, which brings it down more as well.This could have been avoided by playing things out in a straight forward manner that was easy to follow, at least so that you knew what was going on...at least 90% of the time instead of 60%.Basically, they could have saved the story line if they didn't make it so that it was confusing and leaving the viewer feeling like they missed out on some of the movie even though they've watched it all.ART ~10The artwork in Nerawareta Gakuen saves the movie completely. Every scene was beautiful and colourful; you can tell they really put a lot of work into the animation.SOUND ~8Not much to say about this, but it was enjoyable. Nothing to praise, nothing to diss.CHARACTER ~7There was nothing particularly wrong with the characters -they were relatable and pleasant to watch. That being said, I feel as though there was something missing from them. It's like I just couldn't get attached to them like I normally get attached to the characters while watching something. There wasn't a lot of character development for any of them, besides for maybe Natsuki, but even at that, there wasn't much for her.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL ~6.5Overall, however, I enjoyed watching Nerawareta Gakuen because even though I thought the plot progression was a bit of a mess, I was constantly wondering how things would end up in the end throughout the movie. Although I doubt I'll be watching this again, and if I do it won't be for a long time. at least 90% of the time instead of 60%.Basically, they could have saved the story line if they didn't make it so that it was confusing and leaving the viewer feeling like they missed out on some of the movie even though they've watched it all.ART ~10The artwork in Nerawareta Gakuen saves the movie completely.

Nothing to praise, nothing to diss.CHARACTER ~7There was nothing particularly wrong with the characters -they were relatable and pleasant to watch. That being said, I feel as though there was something missing from them. It's like I just couldn't get attached to them like I normally get attached to the characters while watching something. There wasn't a lot of character development for any of them, besides for maybe Natsuki, but even at that, there wasn't much for her.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL ~6.5Overall, however, I enjoyed watching Nerawareta Gakuen because even though I thought the plot progression was a bit of a mess, I was constantly wondering how things would end up in the end throughout the movie. Although I doubt I'll be watching this again, and if I do it won't be for a long time."", ""TLDR: Don't watch unless you're one of those sadists that likes watching garbage films.Before I begin this review and go into depth about my reasons I must first inform you that this is the absolute worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching. I hope this will save you the agonizing ~2 hours of your life that I unfortunately threw away watching this train-wreck of a movie.Story:The story is confusing, painful, and just plain difficult to watch. The first major plot line introduced is the fact that cell phones are banned at the school because apparently (you don't...learn this till you're already an hour into the movie and even then it doesn't explain it well) some girl tried to kill herself or something because she was being bullied, I have no clear idea why or how since everyone seemed to be absolutely fine with her once she came to the school. Anyway this random sub plot continues for the entire movie slowly progressing in it's strictness (no reason besides the one previously stated) until it literally has girls sobbing on their desks and I believe some random person also gets killed because they opposed the rule (kinda ironic since the entire reason they banned it was because someone almost died. Further more the main plot revolves around a guy from the future (who's a psychic) trying to take control of the school to help his father with something (never explained) and the main character (who's apparently a badass psychic) putting and end to it after he gains his power.Art:Absolutely beautiful, one of the best animations if have seen. The only issue I have is that there was an excess amount of cherry blossoms in every scene.Sound:Clear and easily hear. The sub had a couple of obvious mistakes in it though.Character:The main character is hard to like in my opinion and only becomes tolerable until the very end when he gets his psychic power or whatever. The reason I gave this a 5 was because the love interest between him and his neighbor was the only redeeming quality I could hope for while watching the movie and he totally fucks it up. Like to the point of being unable to watch without cringing.Enjoyment:If you read the rest I think this goes without saying. Truly difficult to watch and enjoy.Overall:The only reason why this wasn't ranked lower is because of the art and the minuscule love interest between the main character and his neighbor. learn this till you're already an hour into the movie and even then it doesn't explain it well) some girl tried to kill herself or something because she was being bullied, I have no clear idea why or how since everyone seemed to be absolutely fine with her once she came to the school.

That shit that I just watched was like a fever dream. Let's just start now while it's fresh in my mind.[Story?]To begin with, the story gets a 1/10. The pacing in this anime is ridiculous. Let me put it this way: this should have been a 24 episode anime, not a movie. There is just too much shit going on at the same time. By the end of the movie I was just fucking confused. Like, I understood everything that happened, but I wasn't invested...in any of it because it all happened so fast. I guess i'll talk about the art now.[Art!]The art was by far the best part of this anime. If nothing else, this anime would make for great wallpaper fodder. Stunning visuals up until the mouths start moving. Yep, of all things, this anime has lip syncing issues. Checking the wikipedia page, this anime was originally made in Japan, so there isn't much of a reason for this either. What a shame.[Sound]Why is there piano music playing for no reason? Why is there music playing over a dramatic moment? What the fuck is going on? I mean, the sound was by far the least notable thing about this anime, so i'm just gonna move on.[Characters]*character 1 enters*Hi. I'm in this anime. Now be emotionally attached to me.*character 2 enters*Hi. I'm in this anime...and so on...This is mostly the fault of the pacing, but I just didn't care about any of the characters at all. I mean, it started off fine, but then things just ramped up to such an extreme degree that I couldn't even be fucked to care.[Enjoyment]Despite all of the things I've said, I do recommend that you watch this anime. You won't understand what's going on, but you should watch it. It's a bizarre experience.[Overall]Why was this released in this state? I have a theory. Maybe while negotiating a deal with the studio, the mangaka accidentally said he wanted a movie instead of a 2-season anime deal. I dunno, that's all I've got. Feel free to come up with your own theory, but mine definitely fits the best. in any of it because it all happened so fast.

There will be mild spoilers ahead you have been warned! So this movie has time travelers and psychics involved and what they do with it as iffy of subject it is for time travel to pull off of...LA will be at least a bit lenient and say that Nerawareta Gakuen did....""ok"" but even then it has some problems but that a bit later. The voice acting wasn\'t that bad all thing considering with Kana Hanazawa doing...her typical nice girl scthick down to a T to the straight-forward violent tsundere of Mayu Watanabe as Natsuki AAAAAAAND that\'s it.Well let\'s get down to one of the strength\'s weaknesses LA pointed out, that of time travelers and psychics, well as much as the plot has this for a setting and some of the characters are one and everything, Nerawareta Gakuen focuses more on it\'s character relationship dilemma\'s and cellphone banning than time travelers and psychics. Though some might defend the cellphone banning being tied to the psychics BUT that plot point is brought up constantly saying how cellphone is bad for the school and everything however what the problem with this defence is the mere fact that once Kyougoku stops changing people to psychics, the cellphone banning isn\'t brought up AT ALL, almost like the cellphone banning wasn\'t going anywhere, thematically or plot-wise. Kyougoku\'s plan of ""saving the world"" is also kinda weird as well, like turn people into psychics then bring them over to his timeline and that would work through cellphone banning???..huh?...see how the cellphone banning isn\'t exactly thematically woven in properly?, well that and what was the point of Kenji, Kahori and Natsuki defending their ground against cellphone banning?...don\'t bring your cellphone and get turned into a psychic, bring your cellphone and get severely and hilariously put on trial (no seriously this happens).  LA DOES get the point of the cellphone banning situation, due to psychics having telepathy thus the need for cellphones are useless but again...it isn\'t brought up again and that rather kills it\'s theming of ""knowing people\'s feelings"" if it just drops like this for a sorta shaky time traveling sideplot.So those characters...yeah there ALL bland characters, we got the ditzy bland male protagonist Kenji Seki who has a crush on Kana Hanazawa\'s character Kahori with her also having a crush on the new mysterious transfer student Kyougoku and finally we have the violent tsundere Natsuki. Kenji and Natsuki defiance against the cellphone banning does tie into their relationship theming of not understanding each other and as blatant as possible of the entire ""show your emotions, but if your psychic it\'s pointless and it\'s not their true feelings"" spiel is executed weirdly considering the situation. The rest of the cast really have no bearing on the plot as the main focus are just on these four. Sure we find revelations about Kenji, Natsuki and Kyougoku but base personality wise all that changes is Kenji turns from ditzy main protagonist to...confident protagonist. KAHORI is the worst of lot as she really doesn\'t change from ANY of this.So characters and the plot turned on it\'s head, how about the animation?..from Sunrise no less?...well the best way LA would say is a combination of ""visual overload"" and ""movement porn"", what does LA mean by that?, well visual overload occurs frequently in Nerawareta Gakuen due to excessive use of lens flares ANY chance it gets to characters\' movement being rather erratic any chance that gets to, so seeing those two elements think of combining the two with some pretty decent backgrounding only for ""things"" to distract you with LOTS of movement any chance it gets. LA will be honest but LA was hit with the visual overload in less than 5 minutes of the movie with how it bombarded LA with this much hyperactively bright animation and constant motion. And this leads LA right down to the fundamental problem of Nerawareta Gakuen animation and LA will take an excerpt from the Nostalgia Critic\'s Smurf\'s movie review if that isn\'t a bother to anyone.""This safe, boring and repetitive movement is the same as looking at a watch waving back and forth. They\'re both trying to hypnotize and relax you so that you don\'t think about what you\'re watching. And that\'s not what a movie is supposed to do. You\'re supposed to think about it. You\'re supposed to be sucked in. But this method is an ingenious way to numb your brains without feeling bored, so you think it must be doing something right, when really, it\'s just junk food for your mind. And it\'s all over the movie.""AND that\'s just how LA felt about this movie\'s over-excessive use of animation on that front too, just the difference between Nerawareta Gakuen and Smurfs is that the Smurfs were being lazy  and placid for the sake of laziness to prove this point, Nerawareta Gakuen does it because of it\'s over ambitiousness and hyperactive nature to prove the point.So essentially we have a movie where the more interesting elements of the movie isn\'t used to it\'s best potential (or at all) and favours ""talking"" and typical relationship dilemma\'s instead, characters are as bland as cardboard and hardly develop, over-excessive animation barring on visual overload and movement porn any chance it gets with some decent voice acting here and there. Is Nerawareta Gakuen like some illegitimate love child of Hand Shakers and Glasslip or what?.As harsh as LA had been with this movie and yes LA was harsh in some instances, LA DID want to like to this or find some strengths that might redeem itself however too many factors barred LA from enjoying this movie let alone desperately find something to hook LA but how Nerawareta Gakuen was executed especially in it\'s over-excessive animation and especially the last quarter of rushed plot was the final nail in the coffin for LA from even trying to enjoy it. Nerawareta Gakuen ""tries to be interesting on visuals alone"" but fails in this regard and LA won\'t say this is the worst movie LA has seen of all time but uhhh...it\'s up there, it\'s up there. her typical nice girl scthick down to a T to the straight-forward violent tsundere of Mayu Watanabe as Natsuki AAAAAAAND that\'s it.Well let\'s get down to one of the strength\'s weaknesses LA pointed out, that of time travelers and psychics, well as much as the plot has this for a setting and some of the characters are one and everything, Nerawareta Gakuen focuses more on it\'s character relationship dilemma\'s and cellphone banning than time travelers and psychics.

The reason why it’s confusing may be because it went though about eight different adaptations. ‘Nerawareta Gakuen’ was a science fiction novel written by Taku Mayumura in 1973. It became a television drama in 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1997 with two live action films done in 1981 and 1997. The one I am talking about now is the 2012 animated film version which came out around the same time as the manga. There is one small problem here in...my tackling this animation, I have never seen any of the other adaptations, nor have I actually read the novel. I feel like I missed a lot within this story sadly.Where do I begin with this show? To talk about the characters would spoil so many things sadly and you can’t really talk about the story without spoilers as well. I will do my best but it’s hard not to spoil. Our main character, Kenji Seki, is a middle school student like any other. He has a girl next door, Natsuki Suzuura, who has been his childhood friend for much of his life, and the crush on one of the popular girls who seems pretty much perfect in every way. Of course, there is this three way love triangle that is in all romances, where you just want to yell at them to confess their love to each other. One day, a mysterious new student shows up as the people around the school are starting to act a little strange... and that’s pretty much all I can say without breaking spoilers. The story, I’m not going to lie, is a bit dull. The major points do make you think and have a rather deep meaning to them if you are like me and love diving into psychology and sociology, otherwise it’s basic and bland clichés.So, this is the point where I have to tell you to skip this paragraph if you do not want spoilers at all. I am going to be talking about a bit of philosophy that is set within the movie and why I feel like I missed something really important in watching this. This may also be sort of a rant because it’s hard to explain fully.Spoiler stuff starts sort of.A big part of the show talks about the limitations we place on ourselves and how to break those limitations. One aspect that we limit our evolution is using cell phones and our way to express how we feel though words. According to them, the cell phone is only a false sense of bringing people together. Instead of bringing people together, its pushing people apart but we cling to the cell phone like a security blanket as to not feel lonely. They even make a very large attempt at banning cell phones in the school, going as far as to expel anyone caught with a cell phone. Opinions of people who wake up to their psychic powers also seem to change their views very fast to follow what the group thinks making the concept of the psychic mind sound much more like a hive mind, similar to the monster called “Legion” or “Unity”. There are two small problems with this concept that they have brought up to this movie. The first is that I love a world where we can voice our own opinions (I am talking civilized discussions, not trolly ‘I’m right and your wrong’ yelling matches). It’s a way that we can see others point of view and even if we disagree, we may find that we have more in common then first thought. Second, the idea that cell phones are pushing us farther apart (or even the internet pushes us apart) just doesn’t seem right. I have friends I have met online who live thousands of miles away. They are some of the best friends I have ever met and though we do not talk often enough, when we do talk, it’s like we are in the same room. I don’t even think psychic abilities would even be able to replace that. While the movie does seem to change the idea and try to make up for it, these concepts take up most of the movie.Spoiler stuff ended.The backgrounds of this show are so beautiful and serene as though you’re only getting a faint glimmer of the world around you. It’s as though you’re looking through a fog or you’re not quite awake through the whole movie. The times when the art gets a bit darker and more defined are the more intense scenes, much of how we will see most dramatic points in our lives more vivid then say what we had for breakfast two days ago (unless you had a awesome breakfast that day). Sadly, the characters seem to be lacking against this sort of background. Many times, they feel as though they lose their proportions or have almost a weightless feel. There is even one scene where a girl sort of jumps another on the back but yet she seems to float in place for a few moments. The other doesn’t even show that any weight has been put on her body as well in this same scene. The clothing also doesn’t seem like its actually flowing right on the forms that are there. These might be very little things to nit pick about but when you have such a beautiful landscape and then you see the characters, it sort of pulls you out of the moment.The music is amazing, with a very beautiful piano melody that feels like its placing you within a dream. This piece works really well with the very soft watercolor/pastel style artwork. If you want to look it up, the song is called ‘Clair de Lune’ which is French for “Light of the moon” or “Moonlight”. They played is so much that it’s the one piece of music that stands out in my head now looking back but it never got old. The English voice acting is not bad at all, although it did sound a bit preachy in some spots. I don’t know if this was because of translations or if it was because the sub was that way too. What I found was this movie first was showed off at a thing called ‘Scotland loves Animation’ so I think that the dub had been made first though this is only speculation.So is this movie worth the watch? I say it is. Although there are a couple things I did not understand or did not agree with, the show did make me think and has a very sweet little romance story involved. The backgrounds are a work of art and the use of ‘Clair de Lune’ made it all that better. Some things to note before you watch it; the story is a bit lack luster in how it was executed, very cliché. The first part of the show almost made me want to fall asleep to it. They didn’t get into the interesting stuff until they got farther in the story. If you like shows that make you think, then you’re golden. If you like more action base, then you might want to look elsewhere. my tackling this animation, I have never seen any of the other adaptations, nor have I actually read the novel.

This anime movie is indeed a bit cliché, but in a good way.Not too many animes try to take the concept of using an old story, ""A Midsummer Night\'s Dream"" which is continually referenced, but made a subplot out of it and making a somewhat modern story out of it.I do agree that the title, ""Psychic School Wars"", a bit of a disappointment when you don\'t see too much psychic abilities featured or warfare. I was kind of...hoping the plot was more like ""Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!"", but with psychic abilities. But they weren\'t actually referring to actual war in the movie either, the quote ""All is fair in love and war"" loosely fits the plot of the movie.There are however some moments in the movie that they failed to develop much plot behind, almost as if there was originally an anime had been planned at one point. (Like as if this movie was supposed to be a sort of recollection of the actual anime. Something like ""Star Driver: The Movie"".)Over all the movie is great if you enjoy brain teasing plots, classical music, and beautiful design. If it wasn\'t for the fact I\'m used to animes using tear-jerking moments, this may had a chance of being a tear-jerker too. hoping the plot was more like ""Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai!"", but with psychic abilities.

I can tell immediately that the director like Sunrises, ray of sunlight throught the windows and the beach, ahhh and don’t forget the trains, or sakuras, sakuras in every single shoot.Animation/ Sound ( 9/10)…. Like I wrote before, is the only good thing about the movie, the scenery and the cute...animation.Plot (1/10 ) :  Nonexistence, inconsistent, very boring and full of WTF , yeah at the end anything make sense.  I have no idea how I manage to end this movie.Characters (1/10) : They barely show any development, you have no idea what are their purposes , dialogues are plain and don’t give any support to the plot, they are barely a medium to show the reason (which is still stupid) of the movie, replace them with cardboard and will have the same effect. I can even say they are the typical archetype since they are even more boring that that.Enjoyment (5/10) I kind of like the first half, then I have to pause the movie, continue with my life, then again take ir back since I rarely drop a movie, I mean I spent my time on it, but I get bored with sakura petals in every single shoot, even on the beach, I think that was overdramatic, force drama, force love, force everything.Overall ( 4): I kind of enjoy first half then I thought maybe character will show any development or maybe plot with make sense, but no, WAS even worse, plot was a mess, character stay right there in the “I´m generic boring zone” and well animation was cute but come on don’t make all the movie the same.I don’t recommend this movie, you can do better with the time you will spend of this ._. animation.Plot (1/10 ) :  Nonexistence, inconsistent, very boring and full of WTF , yeah at the end anything make sense.

And really bad at times…. Tons of 8/10, tons of 7/10, what anime did u guys watched today?? I mean, maybe my experience was ruined because, I did watched till the end…and I realised, something went wrong… I was about to make this an 8…. BUT no, I didn’t!!When I...watched the trailer I was like, omg, the animation, it really tops the level of the anime. And then after that, I went crazy and mad after watching thisI was hoping a good expectation, but did u guys even know what just happened after watching this? There’s no way they’re ending like that with all those holes!To me…. This anime was a BEAUTIFUL LOOKING DISSAPOINTMENT. Starting off the beginning. the Story was FINE.. Literally fine from the beginning and then it destroyed the plot at the end. There are parts of HEART TOUCHING ROMANCES which is fine… TBH, I’m more into romance animes, I’ve SEEN TONS OF GOOD ROMANCE ANIMES and bad ones.  It devolves into Braingames and clues which you need to frickin know what the heck it’s going on!!!! I went like what… cuz its similar to that masterpiece movie, Kimi no na wa! That ending was one of the confusing and open ended scene. So we’re gonna have to WAIT until the next sequel!! It made me feel, like everything I went through it was for nothing but a waste of time!(4/10)Despite some ANIMATIONS!! FANTASTIC! I LOOKED THE STAFF AND FOUND OUT HE WAS THE SAME GUY WHO MADE “GRIMGAR, FANTASY AND ASH” AND I CAN’T STOP LOVING THIS ANIMATION AND ART. IT’S WAY BEAUTIFUL THAN GRIMGAR! THAT’S THE WHOLE PART I LIKE ABOUT THIS WHOLE MOVIE! That’s probably why the rating is, higher than it should be. (10/10)The music! Again! Fantastic! They did a perfect timing when comes to some scenes and we have to listen the beautiful orchestra while watching the anime! It has a beautiful and heart-warming feel to it. Pretty much everything (10/10)SPOILER AHEAD!!!Some characters were okay and some aren’t… I’m okay with the characters! HOWEVER! HOWEVER! There are characters which the movie never explains how and why!!! OMG, I got so angry when this CHARACTER, Kyougoku, Ryouichi, like how did he get on earth, what is his purpose ?!?! And what is he trying to do with that thing….whatever that Thing, this magical tool thing….. YES, there are Little details about that tool is…. Same goes TO Seki, Kenji. AGAIN! How did he got those powers? Female characters went slightly out from the plot, especially the side characters…. Romance parts I saw were good! SOME PARTS! AGAIN! Heart-warming scenes for some parts… OH RIGHT! I ! There’s one part that this main guy came in to the atrium with his swimsuit! And he takes his phone out from his underwear!! YEAH!! IM NOT JOKING! Like from the front. That gave me a mind blown because how the phoneis not clearly seen in front? What is this? DORAEMON’S NEW POCKET?! (4/10)## Overall – The final verdict for this anime is a 5/10. Maybe lower… I know it sounds good! I know it looks good! But the plot is the problem here for me. The STORY IS THE PROBLEM HERE… THE ENDING…. Parts of it were okay! But it overuses the plot holes up till the ending. THAT ENDING you will have felt cheated even after reading the articles, finding the ending explanation! It made me insanse! There are tons of UNANSWERED QUESTIONS and I know that may have been the intention but opening an ending like this have been done better. I wanted a satisfying ending and no plot holes that leaves me wanting more… not this where I BET YOUR THIS 2nd SEASON is going to COME AND FINISH THIS.It’s okay, enjoyable at times… BUT CONFUSING, ANNOYING, UNDENIABALY, TOO MUCH PLOT HOLES! If you’re looking for a GOOD ANIME like this, I’ll tell you what, START WITH “GRIMGAR, Fantasy and Ash” I WANT YOU TO WATCH THAT SERIES and then after THAT, should you give this one a try? Well….

If you are looking for an actual psychic war, this will disappoint, but in an odd way its slow pace and reticence about the details makes it a lot more watchable than if it was explicit and explained everything. It\'s more of a healing anime than anything, something you watch to relax and enjoy the gentle points being made.Unfortunately the downsides of the anime are...many and prevalent. The art is good, but tries to evoke nostalgia too much and resembles a Thomas Kinkade painting will all the emphasis placed on multicolored light. Towards the end, too many things just happen without much grounding in a solid plot. And the first twenty minutes are slow enough to turn you off the anime, with focus on rather normal school lives and obsession with mobile phones as a barrier to real communication.You can\'t help but wish for a bit less blushing love, and more of the awakened psychics acting in the school (done absolutely wonderfully, as it\'s not really a ""war"" at all, and then the whole obsession with mobiles make sense) and just a little more of the science fiction part of the film.I found it good to watch, but I can definitely understand the low scores. It\'s a film you\'d need to watch to find out if you like it or not. many and prevalent.

You'll probably be lost anyway but that's not surprising. As there's 25 characters credited in a 105 minute movie.The story line is fraught with cheap tricks and annoying shifts in focus. There's the continuous use of interrupting the characters while they are in the process of moving the plot forward. Tolerable in very small doses, but more than once or twice it becomes annoying and  lets you know that the author is just trolling you. There's large swathes of...exposition lapsing into pretentious mysticism that's meant to convey the background of the world and the rules of how things are working. Unfortunately it just makes it a talky confused muddle. Worst for last there are the cliche plot devices, love at first sight, the woman who sacrifices everything for their love, lovable clueless guy, he's really a superbeing but we locked downs his abilities for reasons, they really were meant for each other all along. Get the feeling they tried to pull too much here to do anything well ? You are not wrong.The ending literally makes no sense at all, and the afterward feels like it's tacked on to leave you even more confused giving even less of a f**k about what happened.The art is something of a Jekyll and Hyde affair. The CGI for the psychic special fx, and the light special effects is really down beautifully, but the character designs and drawn backgrounds could all be better. The music is very good if rather overpowering and needed to be deployed better. You had those previously mentioned exposition/mysticism bits fighting with background music. I often found myself wishing I could turn off the dialog and just leave the music to go with the animation. I think I might have been able to come up with something on the fly that was more entertaining.Verdict: Skip exposition lapsing into pretentious mysticism that's meant to convey the background of the world and the rules of how things are working.

The title of the anime is definitely relevant, however it\'s only REAL purpose is to start your journey into the many hidden meanings throughout this anime. It doesn\'t require a high intelligence to understand it, but it does require a little bit of inquisitive problem solving. Story wise of course. The word ""feel"" is important in this story AND in this review.The art work and the fluid motion of it is truly amazing. You literally feel that something is in motion every second and it really expresses itself...with it. The music, voice acting, and all the subtle little noises and sound effects are top notch. You could close your eyes and still enjoy the show. It\'s not the best I\'ve experienced, but it\'s pretty up there and one I will remember.The character development is natural and you can really feel as if these are real people living in that town. The way they interact with each other, and express themselves. You can watch not only their facial expressions, but their body language and immediately know what they might be feeling/thinking. The scenery and setting pieces in this puzzle fit perfectly enough that you couldn\'t even slide a sheet of paper between them.The story itself is deep. On the surface it may come off at first as another generic supernatural story line with fancy visuals. But within the first 10 minutes you realize you couldn\'t be any more wrong. I was enamored by the many levels of this story that were going on at once and continued throughout. It also is good at not adding anything unnecessary to it\'s purpose. So, no random pointless tangents. I\'m not throwing out any examples as I\'m trying to avoid solving any story mysteries or answer any potential questions because it\'s best to experience it all as you go, and find your own conclusions.This anime does have deep meaning throughout and may give you pause at some moments, but it\'s brilliant in it\'s execution. After all the praise I have for this, there is but two things I feel are off. Almost everything about this was fantastic to me, except that I feel it had just a couple too many ""ah ha, so that why"" moments, and if I had to ask, they could have stretched out a few of the quickly tied up ends around 3/4 the way through. All in all, I really would recommend this to anyone who appreciates a deep meaningful story and excellent artwork.Side Note: Sit through the credits. with it.

Please don't get angry.I've watched very little anime and most of my time watching said anime is rewatching anime that I've already watched because they mean a lot to me. Things I've watched I would say that they were very easy to follow. I'm a very emotional guy but I love to look for romance when finding new things to watch. But with watching much romance, for me, I get a very bad emotional baggage (which I enjoy because I feel like I grow as a person when struggling with it) where I think about the emotional coaster the anime has...gotten me into. The anime Nerawareta Gakuen was very hard to follow for me. Throughout watching the anime, I couldn't relate or get emotionally attached to any of the characters. Nothing in the plot made sense. I understand that explaining the entire plot is boring and I understand that as long as you understand what is freaking going on, there's no need for explaining. My favorite show which does this correctly is House Of Cards and Black Mirror. Both shows not needed to explain the plot because it is easily understood. Leaving the viewers to question plot holes is very much part of the enjoyable experience. An anime example I would like to throw out there is Your Name. Very little explaining of the plot, but very easy to catch on to and very enjoyable plotholes. The anime Nerawareta Gakuen might not be an anime for me altogether. Maybe I just don't like plotholes and open-ended questions that I need to answer on my own when watching anime. But I know that's not the case because there is a short film that I watched that counters this argument, Shelter. Full of questions, a very enjoyable part of the experience. All in all, I didn't enjoy the plot of the film, nor get attached to the characters. But I will rewatch it because maybe knowing what's going to happen next while rewatching will help me catch the details that I missed.P.S. Another anime I've watched where I felt the same way like this* (in said review) is Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. I've given it an 8 because it was doing well during the early half of the film but then gotten crazy during the rest of it. If you guys know what's wrong with me and what is something I can improve on when watching these types of films to get what's going on, I'm all ears. gotten me into.

I generally found myself enjoying it. This anime has its issues and I would call it far from a master piece. But it also has its moments. Firstly the characters in this movie felt real and their emotions  were genuine. Next were the was the art which I have got to say amazed me every time from small details such as the sand on the beach to the way that the characters looked. Overall I would recommend people to give it a try and I'm probably going to rewatch it sometime . "", 'The animation in this movie was STUPENDOUS! Very well done in the art department and fluid animation. The characters had many different facial expressions and their actions were realistic and well done. The storyline was pretty good as it went along, although it left some to be desired. The thing that bothered me the most was the ending, there are SOOO many unresolved questions! Other than the ending, I enjoyed the animation and watching it was fun, but mainly because of how well the animation was. Overall an enjoyable movie. ', ""Spoiler free article: A short description that's just a bit longer than normal synopsis to give you rough idea what to expect from this anime. Conclusion for TL;DR at the end of the articles.Reading time: 2 minutes readReview:I'm not sure where to start with this...the story is long but short, it's simple but also complex, it's truly something else, just not in a good way. They started very simple, with everyday life of junior high school students and their interactions, paced really well as if it's a slice of life anime, then the mystery started to unfold slowly, and here starts the confusion, the story...getting even more complex by minutes but at the same time, the pacing of the story also multiplied by many times, a lot of things happened suddenly, without proper explanation, time skip here and there, then suddenly I'm at the end of the story, with ending that's not explained at all, how they can reach that ending, why, what, who, none of it... So this is what I get when someone tried to do some scifi, but in the end get themselves confused and just throw anything to complete the show.The visuals can mainly divided into 3 parts, the background, the characters, and the animation. The background are the only part that stood out from the visual department, partly thanks to Takumi Tanji, the guy who also made the breathtaking background in Kimi no Nawa, 5cm per Second, or Garden of Words. The characters are on par if not even worse than some of those generic characters, it's sorely lacking of unique points, and the quality are dropping every now and then, inconsistent quality and generic design? A superb recipe I guess...for a disaster. The animation are something else, due to any reasons, they need to have small count of frame rates, so what did they do? Put effects everywhere to hid partial if not all movement to give the sense of movement, or just put motion blur for the other half, or just pan out the frames, right? They did this blatantly for most of the movies, that I don't even remember any scenes with a proper animation...By the time I listened to one of the songs, I know the rest of the OSTs will be of high quality, with ryo from Supercell to arrange the songs? Nothing can go wrong, supported also with Watanabe Mayu (ex-AKB48) the songs deliver even more feels than the story itself, it have a huge impact for me while watching this movie, the lyric and the melody emphasize what happened in the anime way above the requirements. These are OSTs that you will repeat over and over again. The seiyuus are okay, they're not that bland, but, it feels like they didn't realize what their current situation, is it cheerful, is it calm, is it dangerous, I can't feel any change in their voice at all, although the arts and dialogues are clearly different for each scenes. The sound effect are also disappointing, most of them are recorded in studio if not made from scratch in studio, it felt so artifical...Not to mention the bad syncing of the lips movement and the voices, ugh.Conclusion:Reasons to watch:-If you're looking for some great anime wallpaper-Great OST throughout the movieReasons NOT to watch:-Bad story with confusing plot and bad pacing overall-Generic characters design-Bad voice acting and the time syncing of the voice getting even more complex by minutes but at the same time, the pacing of the story also multiplied by many times, a lot of things happened suddenly, without proper explanation, time skip here and there, then suddenly I'm at the end of the story, with ending that's not explained at all, how they can reach that ending, why, what, who, none of it... So this is what I get when someone tried to do some scifi, but in the end get themselves confused and just throw anything to complete the show.The visuals can mainly divided into 3 parts, the background, the characters, and the animation. The background are the only part that stood out from the visual department, partly thanks to Takumi Tanji, the guy who also made the breathtaking background in Kimi no Nawa, 5cm per Second, or Garden of Words. The characters are on par if not even worse than some of those generic characters, it's sorely lacking of unique points, and the quality are dropping every now and then, inconsistent quality and generic design?

I was assuming that this was some sort of sci-fi drama about struggling against psychic control over a school. Instead, I get a film that appeared to be trying to create something like Makoto Shinkai films that involve long-distance relationships complicated by some sort of paranormal gimmick. But whereas Shinkai at least created natural chemistry between characters to make the relationship developments in his works feel genuine, the ones here feel more forced and unnatural thanks to the title's milking of melodrama and rather sloppy and cliched storytelling.The storytelling and character elements to the film...mostly milk cliches typical of high school and sci-fi titles with stuff such as the mysterious transfer student, time traveling, childhood friends, a love square and one of the love interests being a violent tsundere. The milking of melodrama such as use of overly dramatic music and exaggerated emotions hinder the film more than help it as it only makes the cliched characters within Psychic School Wars more unbearable to put up with as the slightest tensions make a character get angsty. The writing for this is also rather sloppy as it acts pretentious in trying to make you think it has meaningful things to say about human relationships with cell phones, forgetting to address or resolve lingering plot developments and sudden plot twists that were not properly foreshadowed thus leading up to a rather convoluted and anti-climactic ending.Visually, Psychic School Wars appeared to be trying to emulate Makoto Shinkai's drawing style and does this well for the most part. Scenic shots are gorgeously drawn and highly detailed, and movement with characters and vehicles were fluid for the most part with only some occasional still shots I took noticed of. On the bad end though, the character designs for the movie are rather average in quality and it has a bad habit of overdoing things with lighting effects as such where they can usually obscure things taking place onscreen.Overall, Psychic School Wars is rather underwhelming as a movie since it attempts to and fails at trying to incorporate story elements of Makoto Shinkai's films to create a coherent and engaging film. I wouldn't recommend watching this unless you go into this with low expectations for what it has to offer. mostly milk cliches typical of high school and sci-fi titles with stuff such as the mysterious transfer student, time traveling, childhood friends, a love square and one of the love interests being a violent tsundere.

The positive points of this movie are basically animation and the romance of the protagonist Kenji and the character Natsuki.The rest of the cast of characters aren't as endearing, especially Harukawa and Kyougoku (basically it's a less weird copy of Nagisa from Evangelion).Another positive point is the art direction and the music direction that together is harmonious, in short animation has a quality worthy of a movie.

I went into this expecting a generic shonen action-fest, and instead got a slow-paced romantic drama. The artwork is gorgeous, done in a hyper-colourful Shinkai-esque style, and the animation is expressive. The story raises some interesting themes, but suffers from a lack of focus. The major characters feel oddly disconnected from the conflict unfolding at school (what passes for the psychic 'wars' in the title), and that side of it doesn't really develop or resolve in a satisfying way; it just gets dropped as the film shifts its focus elsewhere. This becomes an ongoing problem. The strongest part of the...film is the first hour of build-up. Once it gets into the endgame, half-explained plot points get shotgunned around so much that it's hard to latch onto any one thing. The characters themselves are pretty good and generally sympathetic, though the girl-next-door has that annoying trope of constantly punching and abusing the boy she claims to like.Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable movie that is a delight to look at, but never quite manages to pull its plot threads together into a cohesive whole. Its approach to science fiction and tone reminded me of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but it's not as polished a film as that one. film is the first hour of build-up.

Nurse Angel Ririka SOS,https://myanimelist.net/anime/616/Nurse_Angel_Ririka_SOS,"[""During the early to mid nineties, Sailor Moon was sweeping the nation, being one of the first magical girl anime to make it big in the US, and becoming wildly popular in Japan, so much so that it trumped other shows airing around the same time, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS being one of them. I first discovered this on Anime News Network in the form of a Buried Treasure article. Naturally, I got interested, so I tracked down the first episode and watch it. Unfortunately, I didn't get into the habit of completing shows quite yet (it was around the time I was eating up...Shounen Onmyouji like a hungry wolf), so it took me a VERY long time to get back into this. Thankfully, two years ago I did, and I'm glad of it, as, while it starts off as rather cliche, it definitely stands out from other magical girl shows. It's sweet, charming, genuine, sincere, and when it comes to tear jerkers, it does NOT mess around.Our main character, Ririka, is just a normal girl who goes to school and squabbles with her friend Seiya like cats and dogs. Her father works as a doctor, so she's familiar with lots of medical issues. One day, on her birthday, she receives a gift from the cutest, most popular guy in school, Kanou Nozomu. But the gift is a nurse's hat, and she isn't quite sure what it is until monsters begin attacking. When she puts on the nurse's cap, she becomes the Nurse Angel to fight them off. As it turns out, Nozomu's real name is Kanon, and he's from a planet called Queen Earth, which has been destroyed by the evil organization called Dark Joker, and now they're closing in on Earth. In order to defeat them, the Nurse Angel has to find the elusive Flower of Life. But she's having some trouble taking her duties seriously, but when things get serious, she steps up to the challenge.The animation is your typical shoujo-y nineties look: big eyes, soft colors, elegant transformations, etc. It's not bad, though! Heck, I thought it looked a lot better than Sailor Moon at times! It does its job well, and I didn't see any corners that got cut. The soundtrack...eh. Do you ever come across a show/movie where the producers throw in music that's completely unfitting for certain scenes? Like, for example, playing happy, cheesy, and hopeful music during a really sad and tear jerking moment? Unfortunately, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS has fallen into this trap. Now don't get me wrong, the soundtrack for the series IS very good. It's composed by the guy who went on to do the soundtracks for Rozen Maiden and Yu-Gi-Oh. For the most part, the soundtrack fits the atmosphere well for low key scenes, but...for certain tear jerking scenes, they play the series' light and hopeful leitmotif, which I thought really dampened the scenes' emotional weight. I won't say which scenes due to spoilers. But be on the lookout, because it'll stick out like a sore thumb and be VERY hard to ignore.The characters, understandably, start off rather cliche. We have the happy and energetic lead female (who, happily enough, ISN'T a ditz!), her childhood guy friend who she fights with a lot, the mysterious cute guy who gives her her powers, her two gal pals, the female arch enemy who's trying to win the mysterious cute guy's affection, the evil characters trying to take over the world, etc. But after a while, they really start to grow into genuine and likable characters, especially with the twists that the show pulls off. Even though they look and act cliche at first sight, they actually develop quite nicely, and even avert some of the common magical girl tropes. For example, Ririka's powers are dependent on a kind of liquid, and if she runs out, she can't use her powers, and even has to retreat at some points. I found that a really good use of magical girl items, as most of them usually just have an endless supply of magic and energy, and if the energy source is low, it creates more tension. Plus, I really liked the episode that developed the female clique leader who hates Ririka. The only characters I didn't really like are Mimina and her fairy friend whose name escapes me, but even they get better near the end.The show itself is fun, nice, light-hearted, but still genuinely tasteful and full of heart. But do be warned, when things get serious, BY GOD do they ever! Especially the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will tell you this: if you watch it, everything you thought Nurse Angel Ririka SOS was gets torn to pieces and hacked at. No, the ending is NOT bad. It's actually extremely good! It's daring, it's bold, and doesn't give a rat's hat about any cliches or anything stupid like that! It's actually a really ballsy move, as most kids shows don't even DARE tread on this kind of territory! Not even to this day, and this is what sets Ririka apart from other magical girl anime, and it's MUCH better off for it! I love what it pulled! From what I hear, there were supposed to be three more episodes to really close off the series and resolve some plot threads, but apparently they never got aired due to low merchandise sales, which I can understand, considering Sailor Moon was still trumping every other show airing at the time. One thing that really bugged me though: Ririka's grandmother is voiced by a MAN. WHAT?! Why did they pick a man and not other old lady seiyuus at the time? Were there just not enough? Or was it due to executive meddling? Why couldn't they get someone like Taeko Nakanishi, who's pretty much THE go-to woman for old women at the time, to voice her? Whuuuut?If you're looking for a fun and sweet magical girl anime to give you your magical girl fix, I wholly recommend this. But DAT ENDING! It will stomp your heart into the ground! VERY VERY HARD!

Nurse Angel Ririka SOS is one such anime. Then again, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m really surprised that the series has been lost in time &ndash; while it&rsquo;s a solid little magical girl tale, it&rsquo;s not really a something worth going out of your way to see.Nurse Angel Ririka SOS stars, a ten-year-old girl who finds out she has the ability to transform into the legendary nurse angel and fight evil. She runs into trouble with villains, she...makes new allies and friends, and she has to live her normal life in the meantime. In other words, the series has the most utterly normal magical girl plot possible. If you&rsquo;ve watched Sailor Moon or any of the myriad of series that it inspired, you know what&rsquo;s going to happen in Nurse Angel Rirka SOS. Even the surprising mood change near the end, while effective, is not uncommon the genre. Granted, if you&rsquo;re a magical girl fan that may be what you want, but keep in mind that nothing in the plot will surprise or impress you unless you&rsquo;re utterly unfamiliar with magical girls.The production values of the show are solid but forgettable. First off is the music: it&rsquo;s nice. Really, that&rsquo;s all that can be said. The opening and closing songs are cute and easy on the ears, but won&rsquo;t be going on your mp3 player anytime soon. The background music generally goes well with whatever scene it&rsquo;s playing in, but that&rsquo;s about it. If music is an important component to your enjoyment of an anime, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS is not necessarily a series you&rsquo;ll want to seek out.The art is significantly better, but still fails to reach any real notability. Quite frankly, this series looks exactly like a 90s shoujo anime should through and through. Character designs are generally sweet and pleasant to look at and reflect the character&rsquo;s personalities fairly well. At the same time, though, they&rsquo;re rather bland. The series&rsquo; animation is nice, however; it&rsquo;s easy to see that the animators had a decent budget to work with. Another factor in the series&rsquo; favor is the full use of cel animation &ndash; it has the typical warm, friendly feel that classic anime tend to have.Characterization is about as interesting as character design, which is not very. You have the sweet little magical girl, her close male friend who drives her nuts, the fluffy little pet, the villain who turns out to have a heart of gold, the mysterious older guy, and the mystical princess who must be saved. While they serve their purposes to further the plot, no character in Nurse Angel Ririka SOS truly stand out as memorable.While it embodies many of the traditions of 90s magical girls, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS simply doesn&rsquo;t do enough things differently from other 90s magical girls. If you do enjoy the many troupes of the genre, the series is still one that you&rsquo;ll enjoy, if only as a way to revisit some classic plotlines and character archetypes. If, however, fighting evil by moonlight is not your thing, Nurse Angel Rirka SOS simply does not have much to offer for you.Note: Nurse Angel Rirka SOS was fully released on VHS fansubs a while ago, but only episodes 1-21 are currently available as digital fasubs.

But for this, I felt like I had to.A little background:I first watched Nurse Angel Ririka SOS when I was living in Korea, I must have been around 3-4 years old. I remember watching it and loving it!!!Of course, being so young I had no idea what it was called because I didn\'t know how to read Korean at that age.Years after, I somehow managed to find this! And I have to say, overall, I enjoyed it a lot! More than I should have, I think. I\'m 18 years old now and I still love these kinds of anime ಥ⌣ಥNurse Angel...Ririka SOS is basically one of those ""transformation girl"" anime. Similar to Sailor Moon and Wedding Peach :)The art is fantastic! I love the art for older anime because it gives the show a more classic look. You know, the big eyes and small nose that you can barely see. Sometimes it\'s nice to take a break from the newer realistic anime and sit back and relax while watching this.

Who told them he went to London? Why did they not question why Ririka, Seiya and Kanou disappeared suddenly during the kendo match? Where did Dewey live? What happened to Mimina? What happened to Queen Earth?the reincarnation aspect was confusing tooMore in depth in my character analysis.characters.RiRika: found Ririka to be a delightful young girl, very mature for her age and very kind to others. Her unending love for Kanou/Kanon was...irritating at times as it made her gullible. I found her unnecessarily mean to Seiya and her younger brother.Seiya: His love for her was never faltering and persistent, always willing to give up his life for her. Nothing to dislike about him. Probably best character in the show imo.Kanon: I found him a creep and couldn\'t get to like him. His reasoning for letting Ririka sacrifice herself at the end seemed cold, like it was just ""meant to be"" that she died on her 11th birthday with no reasoning behind it. I don\'t understand how he died, then Buros (?) revived him and no one seemed to think this was unusual he kept coming and going and his odd behaviour. Surely others found him kind of creepish too?Miyuki: never came across someone quite as annoying as her. She was always calling Ririka a ""barbarian"" which was sooooooo annoying.. plus her obsession with Kanou and friends supporting her bullying. The only reason they gave for her being mean was her father wasn\'t around. No character growth at all.Anna/Karin: Ririka\'s best friends. Karin was boy crazy and Anna more of a dreamer and a supporter. Not much character growth, but Karin got a episode where she had a love interest. After that episode, they didn\'t continue her story with him.Dewey: He was one of the main villains for a time, before becoming a good guy. He was a shy kind of guy and awwkward once he became good. His personality was mean to start with, but then he started saving lives so he had great growth in that way. I loved his kindness towards others as the series progressedothers: Buros- decent bad guy. Kind of a ""Queen Beryl"" type.Keto: he was ok, don\'t understand what happened with his death though because Ririka purified his soul? Cant remember if it showed his spirit leaving his body like it did for Kanon and his ButlerShihon- Kanon\'s butler, wasn\'t talked about his connection to Kanon, just somehow they both came to earth together from Queen Earth I guess.Mimina- annoying, didn\'t like her. She didn\'t grt much episodes. How could she just came and go to earth as she willed?Queen Helena- no back story on her, she just sat in bed sick and at times using telepathy to communicate with Ririka.Animation:brilliant. All of it was a delight to look at. Reminded me a lot of sailor moon.sound: I loved the opening and ending songs for the first arc. I didn\'t like the second arc songs as much, but they were still pleasant to listen to. I didn\'t notice anything with songs at the wrong time (sad song for happy scene etc) as I\'ve seen in other reviews.other:amount of swear words was unnecessary for a kids show.Could\'ve done with more episodes on this show to say what happened afterwards, Karin\'s love story and my confusions initially listed.

Felt incomplete.', ""I came across this anime by accident and starting watching it on a whim, but after finishing it, I cannot recommend it more.  It appears to be a cute and childish magical girl show (and sometimes, it is) but there is so much under that surface that can only be uncovered by watching the whole series with an open mind and heart, and if you do so, you will definitely not regret it.Story: 7/10 (good)The story of Nurse Angel Ririka SOS is about a girl, Ririka Moriya, who finds out she is the legendary Nurse Angel destined to protect both Earth and Queen Earth...(another Earth-like planet in the same universe, apparently).  In order to do this, she must defeat the evil forces of Dark Joker and find the Flower of Life.  Throughout the story, lots of different characters and situations show up that either challenge or support Ririka in this quest, and something I liked more about Nurse Angel Ririka SOS was that it had waayyy less filler episodes than Sailor Moon, which allowed the plot to stay mostly on track with few distractions.  Without spoiling too much, I really want to say that the ending was super unexpected, extremely bold, and an overall emotional rollercoaster.  It's worth watching the whole show just to fully appreciate (and be hit really hard in the feels) by that insane finale.Art: 7/10 (good)Some people don't like the style of old shoujo anime, but I personally love it, and the overall aesthetic of this anime was beautiful.  It was simple, not too glittery, cute, and perfectly appropriate for the type of story it was used to tell and the audience it was targeted at.  There were moments when the art could've been better, as there are with many anime, but there were also moments when it was stunning and it was possible to tell that the production team pulled out all the stops.  The final episode is an example of this.  Emotional, dramatic, and significant moments are always given more consideration and effort when it comes to art, but that doesn't mean the more everyday moments were badly drawn or anything.  The art was, to my pleasant surprise, pretty consistent in its quality.Sound: 6/10 (fine)Nurse Angel Ririka SOS has a great soundtrack, and the opening and ending songs are too good to ever skip.  The problem is that some music is reused too many times throughout the show and there are moments when the soundtrack seems out of place, but overall, it's not badly done at all.  The first opening song was my favorite, but all the other pieces of music are pretty good.  This is one of the only anime whose soundtrack is so good that I listen to it on its own sometimes.  As I already said, the only problem is that it's repetitive and sometimes misplaced.  The voice acting was also done well, and all the characters' voices seemed to fit them really well.  I personally really liked Dewey's voice and I was surprised to find that he was actually voiced by a woman, but I think that was a good choice and her performance was impressive.  The VAs for all the other characters also did well.Character: 9/10 (great)Characters are where Nurse Angel Ririka SOS really shone.  All the main characters are developed SO. WELL.  Let's start with our heroine, Ririka.  She started out as carefree and a bit whiny, obsessed with her crush on Kanou-senpai and perfectly content with her trouble-free life with her friends.  She was clumsy and irresponsible, but as the series went on, she changed gradually and eventually became selfless, strong, and a character I could easily get behind and support.  Something I liked a lot about Ririka is that she actually has to THINK, unlike some other magical girls.  The source of her power, the Green Vaccine, is in limited supply, and different attacks require different amounts of the Vaccine, so Ririka really has to be smart and think about which attacks she uses, when she uses them, and who she uses them against.  There was even an episode completely dedicated to Ririka learning how to pay attention to her enemies and use their weaknesses against them instead of just attacking blindly.  Her relationships with other characters, specifically Seiya and Kanou, were also really well-developed, and I liked seeing how she grew from being super dependent on Kanou and obsessed with him to being independent and fighting to protect him rather than the other way around.Seiya started out as the annoying childhood friend with an obvious crush on Ririka, and I didn't expect him to be super important, but he also grew and changed gradually and became very strong and worthy of fighting by Ririka's side.  Seiya was honestly one of my favorite characters in this anime and although it's hard to talk about his development without too many spoilers, I have to say that he deserves the title of Best Boy™ for sure.  Another important character was Kanou, and even though he got on my nerves in the beginning because of Ririka's dependence on him, I eventually came to appreciate him and everything he went through just to protect his home and the people he loved.  The final character I'll talk about is Dewey, and there are MAJOR spoilers related to his development, so all I'll say is that he became one of my favorite characters (after Seiya and Ririka) and the way he grew and changed is impressive and endeared him to me in a very unexpected turn of events.  He's a pretty strong contender for Seiya's Best Boy™ title.Enjoyment: 9/10 (great)I really enjoyed this anime!  I started watching it when I was suffering from a super intense sunburn and was overall not in a very good state, and let's just say that I was cured by Nurse Angel's magic.  Nurse Angel Ririka SOS quickly became a comforting show I could turn to to unwind and get swept up in, and it took my mind off whatever pain I was in.  It made me smile, made me tear up, and became unexpectedly important to me.  I really had fun watching it and I plan to rewatch it sometime whenever I need a pick-me-up or just whenever I have nothing else to watch.Overall: 8/10 (very good)It's not a perfect anime by any means, but it's definitely amazing, and I highly recommend it.  I just can't say that enough.  So many good shoujo series, both anime and manga, get forgotten and overlooked, and it makes me sad to see how underappreciated Nurse Angel Ririka SOS is, so let's save it from being eternally forgotten, shall we?

Persona 5 the Animation TV Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38431/Persona_5_the_Animation_TV_Specials,"['I hate that MAL updated this to include both OVAs because it means I need to delete my review and rewrite it. Anyway, thank you for upvoting my previous review to the top spot and I appreciate every single person that takes their time to read what I write.So without further ado, hoy lads. Welcome back to the review. On today\'s episode, I promised to show you how to how to hack into the Pentagon whilst only using Futaba\'s social link.It\'s the same shit as the 26 episode anime. It\'s an uninspired mess of a good game and it\'s truly just sad to watch....It\'s potential gone to waste. Now for step 1, make your way to Washinton D.C. so you can use the Pentagon\'s free wi-fi.I\'ve written a full review on the first 26 episodes already and it mostly applies to this OVA too; pacing is off and feels gross. animation quality is poor albeit improved a tiny bit for the OVA, sound design can get awkward, and some of the greatest moments are either cut or cut down to meet that 55 minute mark. Speaking of, it\'s much too long and should\'ve been just been with the original episodic run, especially considering the quality. I found myself constantly checking how long I had left which is not a good sign of anything. They could have easily split this up into 3 to 4 additional episodes, 4 preferably so it wouldn\'t feel as stupidly rushed as it does. The fight scenes are still a disgrace to watch, I mean they\'re summoning demons that represent themselves, you can do a bunch of cool stuff with that. What is supposed to be the \'final\' fight of the game just turns into a snore fest; Persona breathes fire, character hit, some voice foley, rinse and repeat until the dude breaks. Things simply just happen. Some other scenes were awfully pointless too, such as Tae casually walking passed LeBlanc or Kawakami sitting with the protag asking if he wants a massage. These could\'ve easily been removed in favour for absolutely anything else that drives the plot forward or to reduce the duration of the episode. As for step 2, on their wi-fi, Google ""how to hack into the pentagon"" and follow the first YouTube tutorial.The second OVA, Stars and Ours is no better. In fact at times I thought it was even worse. The 3D models they used are what stood out to me the most, as well as the horrid framing of specific shots that should not have been so terribly framed. Pacing was gross, music was lacklustre, it’s what you’ve come to expect from the anime, however this time voices often felt out of sync with mouth movements. That could have been a clientside issue but I’ve never had this happen before so I’d like to believe it’s not. Personally, I was hoping for an alternative ending, considering someone in CloverWorks said they were going to do something different. The only thing different to the original game is this dreadful quality. Step 3, throw your phone in the bushes across the road and turn location on; this\'ll distract the pentagoons as you do the next step.Finally though, the anime has come to a close. We’ve been given an announcement for Persona 5 The Royal and things are looking fairly okay for the future of Atlus’ most profitable franchises. But to reiterate and round this review off: Sega/Atlus, get rid of CloverWorks and whoever owns the license to do your adaptations now. They either don\'t care about your work or you\'re forcing them to pump this out at ridiculous speeds, and I\'m starting to think you may not care either if it\'s netting you income. That\'s not a good look. Final step, enter the building with Futaba, she has the keys. It\'s potential gone to waste.

The pacing was rushed which I was expecting and the animations were not consistent during the episode. Some segments felt like they had very good quality and some felt like average.Glad they are sticking with the same scenarios as the game too and that they kept the finale for another special ep coming in march.I recommend it for all persona 5 fans that already played the game, yea it won\'t be as iconic as the game but you will relive the memories that the game left in you.OH AND THEY HAD A CLOSE UP...SHOT OF MAKOTO\'S BUTT SO ARIGATO! SHOT OF MAKOTO\'S BUTT SO ARIGATO!', ""HAHAHAHAHA IS THIS FUCKING *COMEDY*? BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT! Jesus, I was wrong to place my hope on Cloverworks.Want a brief summary? BAD ANIMATION, RUSHED PLOT, NO EXPLANATIONS!But seriously, this was bad! Let me get started with the plot in this special episode. It adapts the 2nd to last arc, and guess what? Wait, no, you don't need to guess because the answer is clear, they handled it horribly, well, I mean the post credits scene is good, but the rest, nuh-uh. They gave no explanations and just rushed through it! And GUESS MORE WHAT? Joker is the only one that is important here,...some scenes here and there, they completely forgot the rest of the gang. Probably so they can give more time to the story, even though it's STILL rushed.Okay, we're done with the story, let us go to the world of Cloverwork's animation. As you can see, P5A has an animation problem and guess what, jesus I say that phrase a lot, the animation problem isn't fixed! In fact, it's more obvious here! Deformed people, and lack of frames. And it was 51mins for fuck's sake!To be honest, anime-only watchers would get REALLY confused by this, trust me.Overall it's 4/10, Cloverworks oughta work on their budget, and you're better off playing the game instead of watching this garbage.Thanks for reading this review and goodbye~ some scenes here and there, they completely forgot the rest of the gang.

Overall it was quite disappointing, I had really enjoyed the first special, but the second/conclusion, left a lot to be desired, simply the final battle is decided with a cry of support, an invocation of a very strong ""persona"" who decided everything with a blow, besides those classic phrases of effect that have no effect at all, because we agree, are very bland, honestly, it seemed like generic anime that has no idea for a battle or for the construction of a dialogue, another negative point were the characters that...had a prominence in the scene as if they had in fact some relevánica in the anime, and they did not have. In the end, I was really sad at this conclusion. (sorry for the spelling mistakes) had a prominence in the scene as if they had in fact some relevánica in the anime, and they did not have.

I have not played any of the Persona games, full disclaimer, so I can not compare whether this was a good adaptation of the game. Overall, this is a decent anime, and this review assumes you'll be watching the actual series prior to the specials.The story and characters have to be summarized for a project of this nature, so there is a sense that a lot of the minor characters are sort of shoved into the...narrative. This is a bit sad considering that the Persona4: the Animation and Persona5 (from what I've seen), plays heavily on the idea of forming relationships with characters.The animation seems to get a little spotty at points, but that is more the exception to rule. The music is catchy and I can see why the original game got a lot of praise for the soundtrack. Overall, this show has a decent story with decent pacing, though a cliffhanger ending to the first special made me angry after the series proper ended on a brutal cliffhanger.I would recommend this series to either a fan or a novice who wants a summary of the game rather than playing. It also works as a very long advertisement for the game, and perhaps I will edit my review once I play the game.Until then, I hope you enjoy. narrative.

Finally trying to give sympathy to the major villains of the game and in turn finally gives Joker a chance to face his demons because of this and becomes something like his character development and lastly the voice cast obviously reprised their roles and LA is happy for that at the very least.Ok, soooo...Persona 5 the Animation: Dark Sun...has some problems, some that LA forgave in the original season but Persona 5 the Animation: Dark Sun... only presents these flaws front and center. The biggest flaw and the one LA forgave one in the original season being it\'s rushed pace, but where the original season could truncate events if it wasn\'t linked to the major plot, but here where Phantom Thieves face off against what is essentially the Penultimate and Final Boss of the game, only to be rushed to hell. Everything mostly using quick time skips, like speeding through the Final Boss\' dungeon, to facing the Dragon of the game then quickly shift to the Phantom Thieves leaving their call cards and then quickly move onto the Final fight in the next transition, like really?. LA did say the animation was slightly better but the animation still has CloverWork\'s occasional derps aka. wide angle shots where their facial features is diminished and not only that but some of the fight scenes had some blurs to appear, it\'s was only because so many effects occurred within the same frame it became too much at once thus the cause of the blur at times and yeah because the first half of Persona 5 the Animation: Dark Sun... is pretty much exposition for 25 minutes then yeah it becomes a slog with all the characters trying to explain EVERYTHING to us, when we got the gist of it by the first 10 minutes. Finally as good as we see Joker get to face his demons and FINALLY gives us some character development to him as well as the dragon and mastermind of the game. LA didn\'t see why we needed to see at least the mastermind\'s sympathy, especially when is in essence a corrupted politician stereotype, LA found the mastermind\'s sympathy to be cliched to say the least.Ohh and we have even more what with Stars and Ours Special, to that LA says, CloverWorks, you rushed your way to the final boss and tied up the majority of the loose plotlines, what more is there???????.So yeah, Persona 5 the Animation: Dark Sun... was a rushed unexplained mess at times, yes the actual climax to Joker\'s demons and showing off who the traitor and final boss is was actually fine especially for someone who\'s never played the game but it was really outweighed by CloverWork\'s animation and how rushed this special did itself in.""You never saw it coming""...ohh how right this is...for CloverWorks. about their plans and how they executed it, in GREAT detail.

Is P5A what are we talking about.This is my first review and I never feel the need to write one but...Let\'s start with the positives: they made it 50 minutes long and Rivers in the Desert. That\'s it, now with the negatives...*inhales*The direction and the pace were as bad as always. The animation wasn\'t that bad but it\'s still nothing remarkable and impressing and has the same problems that the original series had. Then we have the clip collection of the group exploring the palace. I hate this...parts, every palace in the anime had it and it feels so stupid, it feels like I\'m watching a trailer more than an episode of anime. Why did they put this? The writters probably wanted to put EVERYTHING that happens in the palace, but they don\'t have the time to do it. That\'s when the word ""adaptation"" comes to play. You don\'t have to put all of that, if you make changes that make sense with the plot it works perfectly. That is why I liked so much P4A, they make some changes here and there (mostly with the confidants), but in order to make everything work to the overall plot of the series. CloverWorks words of ""wanting to make something different"" where just a bait after all?And now, let\'s go with the most importants parts of this arc: Akechi\'s death and the battle with Shadow Shido.Akechi\'s battle was boring, and his death was emotionless. Akechi wasn\'t one of my favorite characters at all, but his death in the game make me feel sorry for the poor guy. Here, the direction completely killed any attempt of make me feel something about his death.Shadow Shido\'s battle was as boring as always, and now let me say something. Most of the battles in P5A are so boring and lifeless, they aren\'t dynamic, they aren\'t like what you would expect from an anime. I know that this is the adaptation of an RPG, but for the love of god that doesn\'t mean that the battles in the anime has to be like an RPG too! The first phase of Shadow Shido was just him standing still waiting to be attacked literally doing NOTHING! And then when he transformed in his second phase the battle was so short that it just falls flat. In fact, that part makes Shadow Shido look very weak. Gaining a power-up and finally start to fight back... just to end up defeated almost immediately. Wow, maybe they couldn\'t make me feel sorry for Akechi but they did it with Shadow Shido because of how weak he was!At the end, this special wasn\'t anything remarkable at all, something that doesn\'t impress me at this point. When I watch P5A, I don´t feel like I\'m watching an adaptation of a game, I feel like I\'m watching a resume of the game made for the Wikipedia. The only reason that I have to wait for march is to know what the hell is P5R.4/10. And for the next special...

Pokemon Movie 11: Giratina to Sora no Hanataba Sheimi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4026/Pokemon_Movie_11__Giratina_to_Sora_no_Hanataba_Sheimi,"['As the 11th movie to come out for Pokemon, I seriously think this one higher than recent ones (Manaphy\'s film coming to mind). I found that not only did it achieve what it was meant to (admittedly, to advertise Platinum) but gave a great story while doing so, though it had some pitfalls here and there.To be clear, I find my enjoyment score biased on behalf of Giratina. ^^;Story:I found that the story itself was smooth, and the fact that is brought in some information from the 10th movie (Dialga vs Palkia vs Darkrai) was great, and showed continuation (unlike many of the movies,...whose storylines stay fixated in their own space bubble). I did enjoy how Shaymin\'s journey to the Garden ended up leading Ash and co right into the Zero and Giratina conflict, instead of Ash and co immediately jumping into it - so there were ultimately two plots. As I\'ll explain in detail later, the villain in this movie was exceptionately good and well-crafted for this installment. He effectively posed a great threat to the world. And, as expected, there are plenty of instances of humor.Art:Though Pokemon artwork may not come close to some animes, I believe FOR Pokemon, the art was a ""very good"". I appreciated the Reverse World, to name something in particular. It certainly set the mood as a place fit for a Pokemon like Giratina (spooky and almost like a dangerous fun house). However, things like Zero\'s giant ship/machine was...out of place. It was a little too 3D for the 2D world it was thrown into. However, that\'s a matter of taste. It\'s the same effects of Pokemon 2000\'s catching sky-mecha.Sound:I always find that the sound effects in Pokemon movies are actually quite good, and that\'s no different here. For Giratina in particular, I think the sounds they had it emit fit it very well, very ""other-worldly"". As usual, background music fits. After that, I don\'t really pay attention to this area much.Character:And here\'s where it gets interesting. Ash and co are generally the same as they are in the show - kinda corny, good-hearted people who would help any Pokemon in need. (take that any way you please). That\'s to be expected. Now for the real characters, because to be completely honest, I felt the whole time Ash and co (as well as Team Rocket, for that matter) took a back seat and watched the new characters have the spotlight.Shaymin and Giratina were the ""stars"" of this movie, and certainly played as so. I liked that Giratina was made out to be a villain the whole time and then at the end, it really wasn\'t, which made it seem like a guardian at his post - doesn\'t care about anything else but it\'s duties, even when people are trying to help. Shaymin, on the other hand, I didn\'t like so much. I know some people might get tired of it\'s stuck-up-ness after the first few times. It just gets irritating, especially in the dub. Bascially, it acts like a spoiled brat. Upon turning into Sky Form, it gets better, but it doesn\'t stay like that long enough to save the character. -.-Zero, the true villain of the movie was great, and so pulls the whole score up to where it is. I did find him similar to the second movie\'s villain, in that he is trying very hard to capture a legendary Pokemon and has a large, souped up machine to aid him. However, his objective is completely different. In fact, his diabolical plans have nothing more to do with Giratina but take its powers (in the process, killing it, though it\'s not mentioned outright) and ruling the Reverse World. He is completely insane...and I love him. XDEnjoyment:Personally, I really did enjoy it, but in effect, I felt it short and then even lacking at parts. It starts off with a bang and ends beautifully and the climax is all there...it\'s just that rising action that wasn\'t very...action-y. There was some information to take in, but a lot of it was filled up with trips to the reverse world and fights against Zero\'s hoard of Magnemite. Hard to explain...all I can say is that if you loved movie 2, you\'ll like this one.Overall, I give it an 8, biased as I might be.XD  I think any Pokemon fan will like this one, whether its for one specific reason or not. I don\'t think it\'s possible to like everything about it, but it is entertaining for one reason or another. whose storylines stay fixated in their own space bubble).

Well it actually wasn\'t that good and only mentioned it\'d prequal once or twice. Sure the animation and characters were all good, but the story bored me even though it was creative.  It had a sort of ""Protect the earth"" kind of vibe to it and even though I\'m a green person I\'m getting pretty sick of the message here. Now you might all hate me for saying this, but everyone...has their own opinion and mine is this is one of the worst pokemon movies yet. has their own opinion and mine is this is one of the worst pokemon movies yet.', ""One thing this film does really well is making us want to travel with Ash and Shaymin to the flower fields. Too bad the film doesn't let us.I've got two main gripes with this one. The far bigger one is Zero himself. The villain in this feature is an overly designed, white haired, badly tempered wunderkind. Impossible magical technology and fantastical flying CGI fortress included. Hastily screwed backstory and inane dialogue, too.Gripe number two is the lack of a character arc for Shaymin. The film essentially starts as a completely different beast than it ends up being. We're treated to a vulnerable pokemon crossing paths...with our heroes. It's Shaymin, the purifier of nature. He's being hunted by Giratina and in order to secure himself, he needs to meet up with other Shaymin at the fields high up in the mountains. Altruistic as always, our team decides to help and thus we've got an adventure.Shaymin is rude to them time and time again. Especially towards Ash. He's not really likeable, at least not all the time. Acting like a brat, you may think it's his way of coping with the feeling of powerlessness. Maybe it's a facade to hide his soul drenched in fear? Nope. By the end he's not learned anything - he's exactly the same as he was at the start. All the film makers had to do was rewrite ten lines and there'd be a weak arc in there somewhere. Instead, we get throwaway jokes aimed at small kids.This is a shame, because the film could have been a great character focused adventure, something pokemon have a knack for. Or would, if they ever focused on it. This leads me to my second point. Shaymin's neither terrible nor unbearlable, thus the film should have been a good adventure, even if a bit shallow. This is where my first gripe returns and strikes again. Half way throughout the film, as you enjoy the landscapes, Zero butts in. Proceeding to derail the film, Zero makes every scene he's in eye-rolling or boring. His plan makes no sense. His backstory is a hastily thrown out one-liner. His beliefs inane ramblings of a madman. Action he offers lasts too long and more often than not, borders on stupid. Due to bad direction, it's not particularly engaging, either.While there are a few neat moments, such as Regigigas appearing, the film ends up a very flawed character focused story and a bad villain-of-the-film flick. Reverse world was a fun location, even if somewhat underwhelming. A few locations looked gorgeous and Shaymin's interaction with other Pokemon were pretty fun. Giratina stole every scene it was in. In the end this film falls right in the middle. There are multiple good scenes here. The question is whether it's worth watching the whole thing. Since it's the middle part of a 'trilogy' (using the word very loosely), I recommend giving it a spin if you're watching the others. Otherwise, no. with our heroes.

Perhaps intentionally so, who knows... Sure, there was comedy there, especially between Shaymin and Ash, but...the Pokémon\'s behavior and attitude just didn\'t work.Other than that, another movie with a good plot, but there were holes here and there. It didn\'t run smoothly. The beginning seemed a bit too slow and confusing, but after that it was a rather enjoyable ride to the end.Newton Graceland didn\'t get nearly enough screen time or depth, or his relationship and life in Reverse World, and same has to be said about the ""villain"" Zero (who is one of the best villains in Pokémon so far, I think). They could have had a much bigger impact if we truly understood them and their history/motives.Not a bad movie, and well worth the watch. Standard Pokémon quality for sure. the Pokémon\'s behavior and attitude just didn\'t work.Other than that, another movie with a good plot, but there were holes here and there.

Which makes it sort of a sequel to Dialga vs. Palkia vs. Darkrai.Lore from the games is used to make this movie but the story is still generic. Evil guy trying to capture strong pokemon and Ash stops him. A little bit of backstory is given to the evil guy and there is only one side character, who is also related to the evil guy, which is excellent and makes the story better than most of the generic evil guy pokemon movies. And also evil guys were missing...for a long time in pokemon movies so coming back to old strategies is not that bad.Art and sound have always been great in pokemon movies.A major problem is Shaymin's character. It is too bratty and annoying. I guess they made Shaymin like this because Manaphy wasn't that different from Mew, Jirachi, and Celebi. So, at least Shaymin is unique.Action scenes were not as strong as Deoxys vs Rayquaza but the choreography is good enough to make them memorable. And the scene where Regigigas enters with Mamoswines was cool. for a long time in pokemon movies so coming back to old strategies is not that bad.Art and sound have always been great in pokemon movies.A major problem is Shaymin's character.

Pokemon Side Stories,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2363/Pokemon_Side_Stories,"[""Ok the enjoyment score is high, I'm a pokemon nut and I'm not ashamed. If you're reading a review for chronicles then you probably know what pokemon is and have a good idea about whether or not you'll like it. But here's the clincher; an entire series of pokemon with no ash/satoshi whatsoever! I know, great right? anyway that's why this series earns a respectable seven. "", ""“Old friends! New adventures! Never-before-seen stories from the world of Pokémon!”I honestly don't know what to think of Pokémon Chronicles. It's a great idea to have side-stories on secondary characters that we don't get in the main series, and it would've been nice if they had kept this going in later seasons. However, what was good about the series tended to be overshadowed a bit by the bad, and that nearly ruins Chronicles for me. Maybe it's because I expected a little more out of it because it wasn't part of the main series, but the thing about Pokémon as a whole is it's not...the best idea to have “high hopes”. After all, I'm not the target demographic (though I think it's safe to say no one here is), what I personally would like to see is not something that could fly in a franchise geared towards children, or at least not fly the way I want.I've come to consider Chronicles as the “awkward tween” of the Pokémon series, and I say that because it seems to appeal to a specific group of fans without getting out of its “kiddy”, or “advertising” stage in this case. It wants to fit in, but it doesn't know where, let alone how to balance it out. A better way to describe it is this is a “testing the waters” entry, to see if a well-known show like Pokémon can still stand on its own without its name and face, Ash Ketchum (and Pikachu), being the main focus. Luckily it does, but not without its problems—most of which get fixed in future specials.Story (6): It's hard to pin-point what the “story” is for Chronicles as not all of it is connected. Sure, there are recurring characters, but each episode deals with a different adventure, or conflict that needs to be solved. For instance, in one episode, you may have Brock fighting with his mother for the rights to the gym, while in another, you got Misty wanting to get new gym badges from a cranky old guy who makes her and her two companions with her work for them. And then in another batch, you may have the recurring villains kidnapping Professor Oak for information on PokéRus, and in the next episode, Ritchie's going back in time to help save an old Pokémon Center. So Chronicles is a little unique in that you can technically watch any of these episodes out-of-order because, well, they're side-stories. You can pick any episode, and you have an equal chance of liking it, or disliking it.Unfortunately, some of these stories sometimes fell short of the potential they set up in the beginning. Some of the better-received episodes are “A Family That Battles Together, Stays Together” and the three-parter “Legend of Thunder”, and possibly “Training Daze” for delving more into the Team Rocket trio's past (although I feel like that one retconned something or whatnot), and one could consider those the highlight of the series. Others like “A Date with Delcatty” and “Those Darn Electabuzz!” weren't so well-liked due to being boring or a missed opportunity, although there's a fan for any episode.Art/Animation (7): As Chronicles was most likely in development when Pokémon moved to digital, and it debuted alongside the beginnings of Advanced Generation, the animation and digital coloring thus reflects the same style as Advanced Generation. Colors are bright and lines are clean with the animation quality being the same as that from the show, though in some areas, it's reminiscent of Mewtwo Returns' animation (which was a TV movie/special, so slightly higher production quality). The best-looking Chronicles had gotten was “Legend of Thunder”, although that's not really saying much, to be honest. It's fair for its time, but it's nothing special.Sound (5): Just getting this out of the way that I watched Chronicles dubbed. I'm sure subs exist, I just can't find them, so all comments on the voice-acting is all on the English dub. (I typically watch Pokémon dubbed anyway, just a personal preference.)With that said, the dub is just awful here, and it's distracting. It's odd how 4KIDS slipped on this one—it's probably understandable given the circumstances at the time (this was dubbed just as 4KIDS' contract was expiring, so it may not have been them at all who did the scripts and voice-directing), but the script was terrible—whether it was directly translated or not—to the point it didn't feel like 4KIDS. Even the voice-acting was a step down from the main series, with some awkward line readings and lack of passion in some areas, although this is probably a more personal issue as there were times where I got uncomfortable with Rachael Lillis' voice, and Mike Pollock as the narrator just didn't sound that great. (He's a great voice actor regardless, being Pokémon's temporary narrator just wasn't his brightest highlight.) Cassidy had a new voice actress for this series, Andi Whaley, and while she's not that bad, she's no Megan Hollingshead. Kerry Williams as Casey had to have been the worst voice-acting in the show (not counting tertiary characters). I'm sure she's okay when properly directed and casted, but I never found her charming as Casey even in the main series, so whoever did the voice-directing had to have brought out her worst here.The soundtrack comes mostly from the 4KIDS archive, ranging anywhere from the movie soundtracks to those from Totally Pokémon or 2.B.A. Master. I'm sure music from the original soundtrack still remains like the main series, but they don't stick out to me as much, interestingly enough. The theme kicking off the series is “Pokérap GS”, but mainly the “P-O-K-E-M-O-N (Party!)” and “Gotta catch 'em all!” portions with Mike Pollock giving a very, very brief tagline as to what Chronicles is. It's short, but it's... kind of cringe-worthy to watch and listen to. But damn that beat, I fight to keep from bobbing my head to it every single time.Characters (7): I cannot deny that Chronicles was a fresh entry to the Pokémon anime (even if the debate of it being canon or not seems to be a thing in the fandom), and part of that freshness is because Ash isn't the main character. His absence didn't take away from the rest of the cast that were featured, giving them a chance to stand on their own, and that's part of its charm. One-shot characters do exist in this series, however, Chronicles is more like a reunion than anything. Some of them had more screentime than others (whether they really needed it or not), but while some of them I personally never cared for even if they have pleased other people, it's clear the characters are who carried the series along more than anything.Then there's the factor on whether-or-not the characters had some kind of development—something Pokémon's not really known for. In some areas they appear to have character development (although this is rather subjective), but most of the time they were the same as when we first met them. Brock, Misty, and Tracey, for example, got a little more to their character in this series (yet this does depend on the episode they're featured in), but they're still the same Brock, Misty, and Tracey from when we last saw them in the main series. Ritchie and Casey were the worst offenders in not changing at all, but this is not counting Butch and Cassidy who were actually regressed as characters to fit Jessie, James and Meowth's roles—despite the trio being in the series as well.To be frank, I doubt anyone really “grew” in this series, and I'm not sure if that was really a good thing or not considering the series is more-or-less a fanservice show. Considering just about every single recurring character here has at least one fan somewhere in the world, it's safe to say that liking or disliking a character is purely based on personal preference, and there really is something for every Pokémon fan. If all one really cared about was just seeing so-and-so again, that's fine, and was probably the objective of that episode all along.Enjoyment (6): It was tiring to watch, I'm not going to lie. I love Pokémon, I really do, but this felt more like a chore than it should have been. Do I regret watching the series? Well, that depends. It was nice to get episodes with characters I never thought I'd see again, and there were plenty of good ideas that were to be had, whether they delivered or not. However, there was still some repetition (even as a side-project, it still couldn't escape the formula), and some episodes had issues whether it was because of a poor script, or time-constraints (“Celebi & Joy” is my least favorite episode of the series—I found it makes Pokémon 4Ever look better in comparison), and you can't really help that. You're not always going to get a three-parter to make for a decent Pokémon adventure, and even if an episode comes off as a bad filler, there was always at least something to it that was an interesting inclusion.It's not a rewatchable series in my opinion, just something there on the side in case you're curious enough to take a look before moving on. And because it's more of an optional series and not so much a “must-see”, it does come off as a waste of time with some of the episodes nearly intolerable to watch dubbed. As a Pokémon fan, however, I would like to see as much of the anime as possible, even if only to say I have seen it, thus I did set aside time to watch an episode or two almost every day or for that week. After finishing it, I found it didn't take away anything, but it didn't really add much either. And that is more disappointing to me than it is frustrating. the best idea to have “high hopes”. After all, I'm not the target demographic (though I think it's safe to say no one here is), what I personally would like to see is not something that could fly in a franchise geared towards children, or at least not fly the way I want.I've come to consider Chronicles as the “awkward tween” of the Pokémon series, and I say that because it seems to appeal to a specific group of fans without getting out of its “kiddy”, or “advertising” stage in this case. It wants to fit in, but it doesn't know where, let alone how to balance it out. A better way to describe it is this is a “testing the waters” entry, to see if a well-known show like Pokémon can still stand on its own without its name and face, Ash Ketchum (and Pikachu), being the main focus. Luckily it does, but not without its problems—most of which get fixed in future specials.Story (6): It's hard to pin-point what the “story” is for Chronicles as not all of it is connected. Sure, there are recurring characters, but each episode deals with a different adventure, or conflict that needs to be solved. For instance, in one episode, you may have Brock fighting with his mother for the rights to the gym, while in another, you got Misty wanting to get new gym badges from a cranky old guy who makes her and her two companions with her work for them. And then in another batch, you may have the recurring villains kidnapping Professor Oak for information on PokéRus, and in the next episode, Ritchie's going back in time to help save an old Pokémon Center. So Chronicles is a little unique in that you can technically watch any of these episodes out-of-order because, well, they're side-stories. You can pick any episode, and you have an equal chance of liking it, or disliking it.Unfortunately, some of these stories sometimes fell short of the potential they set up in the beginning. Some of the better-received episodes are “A Family That Battles Together, Stays Together” and the three-parter “Legend of Thunder”, and possibly “Training Daze” for delving more into the Team Rocket trio's past (although I feel like that one retconned something or whatnot), and one could consider those the highlight of the series. Others like “A Date with Delcatty” and “Those Darn Electabuzz!” weren't so well-liked due to being boring or a missed opportunity, although there's a fan for any episode.Art/Animation (7): As Chronicles was most likely in development when Pokémon moved to digital, and it debuted alongside the beginnings of Advanced Generation, the animation and digital coloring thus reflects the same style as Advanced Generation.

I can't complain too much because really Pokemon is just to show what your favorite pokemon does in the wild. But this show is something I really like, it shows what the more memorable characters like Misty who left after Johto, Richie and a few new faces.

Especially the “Legend of Thunder” trilogy was a strong start.The art was pretty good, the sounds and stories the usual Pokemon-style and quality you might expect.

Occultic;Nine,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32962/Occultic_Nine,"['TLDR: Skip to final paragraph.Water’s bottom, many people, drowning, giant cow-tits…transmission died.Clearing out the elephant in the room. Nikola Tesla never had an illegitimate child as he was a virgin who devoted his love towards a peculiar pidgin. What if I told you he did father a child, and this child capable of being a poltergeist, has managed to possess someone all this time. Occultic;Nine is a show that explores the occult and probes into the spirit realm. The series scrutinises paranormal activities and tries to rationalise it in a scientific manner, hence tries to inform us that anything can be disproven my science....Occultic;Nine had one of the worst opening episodes that I’ve experienced in a long time. The pacing was frenetic in the sense that it was uncontrolled and hard to follow. How on earth do you adapt a whole light novel volume into a single episode? The standard is usually 4 episodes per volume but this series is purposely shooting itself in the leg by having the nerve to do this. This series is a combination of the Tatami Galaxy and Durarara at its finest. The lightspeed dialogue combined with a relatively large cast has conceived a child in the form of Occultic;Nine. The child inherited some of the undesirable genes and turned out inferior to its parents. I’ll explain why.The plot is pretty much focused on the detection of ghosts, material or not. Material ghosts are detectible with the latter being unrecognisable. Gamon Yuuta, our high school NEET runs a blog dedicated on the occult, only to find himself caught up in a crime scene. The murder of professor Hashigami, a leading researcher in the occult field, causes panic for our distressed main character who flees from the scene to avoid getting prosecuted. Good move there as Japan’s judicial system is seriously flawed.The murder wasn’t the main incident of the show. An intentional mass suicide of 256 people in Inokashira lake sets the precedent for what entails later. The discovery of the corpses in the morgue reveals a shocking truth. The concept of being alive while looking at your own corpse seems alien to most folk. This sounds contradictory but bear with me as the show does explain the circumstances later down the road. The situation is that some of our main cast are alive without feeling dead, the idea of being conscious after parting with the material body can only be explained through science.Now talking about the main cast, the series does switch around from person to person giving different perspectives. Our main character Gamon Yuuta is being instructed by a voice from a radio. This reliance on a tool indicates that he can’t get things done properly. I compare it to stabilisers on a bike, which is what this character is going through. He doesn’t have any independence and his actions are limited.Narusawa Ryouka known as Ryo-tas by Gamon is a person whose physical traits defies the laws of motion. Her breasts are so unsightly, that every time she makes an appearance which is usually accompanied by a silly dance. She is literally known as the big-boobed girl who serves no purpose until later on where her character becomes the focus and not her melons.Hashigami Sarai is the son of the murdered researcher and just like his father exhibits an extreme amount of intelligence which is not normal for his age. The knowledgeable Sarai is able to deduce problems and other riddles in the blink of an eye, which to me is just incredible. Geniuses exist but even then, he struggles on some occasions making it somewhat realistic.Aikawa Miyuu is a high schooler who is extremely skilled in fortune telling. She has built up a reputation due to the fact of making correct predictions. She is a character for the audience to relate to as she doesn’t comprehend scientific jargon just like myself. Her quirk is surprisingly useful when it comes to putting the pieces together. These four characters are the most important to the series with others such as Minase Ria getting their own screen time but aren’t worth talking about.The show is produced by A-1 animation, which in recent times has gotten quite some stick for churning out series like the Asterix War. The art style is a breath of fresh air with the character designs being relatively unique. The only downside is Ryo-tas whose has been fetishized with enormous breasts. No fricking way is it breast hypertrophy. The animation as expected from this studio is relatively good with most scenes being aesthetically pleasing and generally fluid. It would be a stain on the studio’s portfolio if it did have poor animation but I’m glad it met my expectations.The sound is amazing and is composed by Yokoyama Masaru (Your Lie in April, Plastic Memories) with it just adding to my immersion to certain scenes. The mix of electronic and contemporary rock music through auto-tuned measures immediately catches my attention by sending a statement. The use of casual jazz music in the downbeat scenes is a good indicator for the tone shifts. Lastly, the music is great at setting up a creepy atmosphere with extensive use of fading in/out and selective piano compositions. The music used generally follows a certain tempo to match the timing of certain segments, this is useful for scene transitioning and makes for some good cinematography.TLDR-The first episodes annoyed me initially but this show manages to redeem itself as it goes on. The mystery regarding the incidents are cleared up in a way you wouldn’t expect. The plot twists cannot be understated with it being interlinked with events. They may not all have a direct relation but by following the lines you gradually see the bigger picture. I would definitely recommend this series for those willing to give it a few episodes. In food terms this is slow cooking, which is higher praised than the generic fast food shit. Occultic;Nine had one of the worst opening episodes that I’ve experienced in a long time.

Here we are at the end of the Fall season; hyped animes, some satisfying, some disappointing ones keep ending one by one. From the creator of Steins;Gate, director of Your Lie in April and well-known studio A-1 Pictures, Occultic;Nine can be placed in all these categories. I am really confused and have really messy opinions about this anime so I hope I can explain them properly.Genres: Mystery, Sci-Fi, Supernatural, ThrillerPros:-Unique style of pacing-Really interesting story...-Mysterious ambience-Somehow loveable characters-Music and art-Good use of science materialsCons:-Extremely fast talkings and pacing-Not enough screentime and developments for characters-PlotholesStory: 8/10Occultic Nine's story is like a puzzle. First, you have puzzle pieces and a few places to put them but the rest of it is dark and empty like space. You understand nothing don't know what to do, but when you put one piece to its place, then you achieve to unlock other places. So more you understand something, there comes more to understand.In the first episode, first of all the anime introduces (well, not really) us the characters and tons of pointless talkings. And at the end of the episode real story starts off with a crime mystery. First the pacing seems really fast but when you get into the story and get used to the style of anime it feels more acceptable. The actual problem of pacing and talkings are being too fast is not like ''Oh I can't understand anything'', the problem is watchers live too much emotional and situational changes in a very little amount of time. You don't have time to laugh, upset, stress, surprise or even think about anything. But this is why I said ''unique style of pacing''. After sometime you start loving it, how all those things happen in one episode. Until the last 2 episodes, it was okay but I wish it was 3 episodes, not 2. So that we can understand the story better, feel all the emotions and maybe they can cover the plotholes.Talking about plotholes, they're not killing the story. First ''mutual recognition''. I was just thinking about how can it possible that Yuta has the key, they answered it with ''mutual recognition''. It was an impressive and somehow logical answer to me, but when he get back the key and come back after Ryo-tas kissed him, it lost its magic and caused plenty of question marks. It really should have had a better explanation. The second one is Nishizono Ririka. What do we know about her? Almost nothing. How can she know and draw all the things? Why and how did she disappear at the end? These are probably the biggest questions of the story. If it was 3 episodes, maybe they could explain her too.Last thing I want to say about the story, is really impressive. It tries to handle occultic science, supernatural powers (like Myu-pom's vision) and time travelling. It has a mysterious ambience from beginning to the end and did a great job answering the questions (except the ones I told) by using scince. It has cliffhangers, and a really important plot twist that changed the story's course. But if you watch the first episode properly, there's a chance of predict that plottwist (except the one about Ryo-tas)Art: 9/10I am really affected by the art, especially using of light and shadings. It makes you live all that dark, bloody and scary moments.Sound: 10/10Soundtracks are amazing and thrilling. The opening and ending are awesome, too. (I won't write so much things about art and sound since they're mostly subjective and don't know what to write about them.)Characters: 8/10The characters are so diffrent each other. They're all special, generally energic and intelligent. Anime told us most of their backstories but still characters did not have enough screentime and because of that  their developments are not completed either. Since the pacing is too fast and anime focuses on the story this was a possible situation. Gamotan, Ryo-tas, Myu-pom and Sarai's developments were kinda ok but others (Again, especially Nishizono Ririka) are not.Enjoyment: 9/10We can say that most of the people didn't like at least the first episodes of the anime by looking at the score (it fell to even 6.59), but I enjoyed it from beginning to the end. Ryo-tas' breasts are bigger than Everest, they're talking too fast so it's hard to catch, pacing is too fast, characters are a little bit childish, first episode is really messy (even that nothing happened)... These are acceptable reasons why people hated it but still I found it enjoyable.So here is my thoughts about O;N, had a lot of potentials and used most of them. As I said, it would be better if it was longer, even 1 more episode. I hope you liked the anime and my review :) -Mysterious ambience-Somehow loveable characters-Music and art-Good use of science materialsCons:-Extremely fast talkings and pacing-Not enough screentime and developments for characters-PlotholesStory: 8/10Occultic Nine's story is like a puzzle.

It has cliffhangers, and a really important plot twist that changed the story's course. But if you watch the first episode properly, there's a chance of predict that plottwist (except the one about Ryo-tas)Art: 9/10I am really affected by the art, especially using of light and shadings. It makes you live all that dark, bloody and scary moments.Sound: 10/10Soundtracks are amazing and thrilling. The opening and ending are awesome, too. (I won't write so much things about art and sound since they're mostly subjective and don't know what to write about them.)Characters: 8/10The characters are so diffrent each other. They're all special, generally energic and intelligent. Anime told us most of their backstories but still characters did not have enough screentime and because of that  their developments are not completed either. Since the pacing is too fast and anime focuses on the story this was a possible situation. Gamotan, Ryo-tas, Myu-pom and Sarai's developments were kinda ok but others (Again, especially Nishizono Ririka) are not.Enjoyment: 9/10We can say that most of the people didn't like at least the first episodes of the anime by looking at the score (it fell to even 6.59), but I enjoyed it from beginning to the end. Ryo-tas' breasts are bigger than Everest, they're talking too fast so it's hard to catch, pacing is too fast, characters are a little bit childish, first episode is really messy (even that nothing happened)... These are acceptable reasons why people hated it but still I found it enjoyable.So here is my thoughts about O;N, had a lot of potentials and used most of them. As I said, it would be better if it was longer, even 1 more episode. I hope you liked the anime and my review :)"", 'Light novels have been a popular adaptation these days, there are dozens of anime that have been adapted from this. It has been one of the best solutions to decrease the over-dominance of manga in the past. It\'s a good strategy, though. But I should say that ""adapting literature into an anime is not an easy work"".Why? Because the director has to adjust a hundred pages of story into a fit 24 minutes per episode in a limited one-cour (or two-cour if they lucky to have that time), with the same feeling & content of the literature itself. Many anime failed to bring...this to the screen.  And what I thought about Occultic; Nine is similar as I stated above. Occultic; Nine has failed to wrap both story and characters in its adaptation.The story somewhat brings us into certain cases of death with many supernatural elements haunt them. The story tries to persuade us to see from a different perspective in supernatural things, the \'there is nothing that can\'t be proved by science\' theme is actually a neat theme, in my opinion, it has its own noteworthy in my mind.One thing that disturbs me is the pacing. After 8 years I watch Japanese anime, I\'ve never seen a character talks like it has been fast forwarded 2x by a remote. It is really ruined the entire feels about the anime. I could see that sometimes I must rewind the minute bar in order to understand the story. Another cancer that this anime has is the ineffective information dumping. The story struggles to throw much information to make us more understand. But what we got is an enormous endless wave of information with fast forwarded dialogues and heavy feelings which make the story\'s full of plot holes.I could honestly say that the ending is not so good at all. It felt really rushed and poorly wrapped episodes of calamity and ends with an all-happy cliche nonsense ending.The animation is in the hand of one of the most prestigious studios in Japan, the A-1 Pictures. Is not that because I hate the story (or the studio), but the art itself failed to bring a meaningful contribution to the anime. It was poorly done, it just like the characters has been blended with the color of the background, like it has the same texture. It is really different from other works that the studio has done in the past, really less-colorable with dark colors has been the dominance.Characters, from what I saw is also has been poorly-handed, especially our main character, Gamon Yuuta. It still follows a \'hero wannabe\' stereotype character that hasn\'t have a single meaningful character development. Other characters are cookie cutter, almost seems to be random & feels a lack of originality. Villains felt one-dimensional, without having a single purpose on their actions. The problem is the anime was too busy to bring us it world building while abandoned the in-depth character development, which makes it more vulnerable.The only fairly accepted elements is the sound settings. Both opening & ending are lovely to hear. While I can\'t say anything except \'disappointed\' for the voice actors & their fast forwarded role. I never heard such character talks like that before.While in some minutes, I found out that this anime actually succeed in bringing mystery elements, I felt the mystery thingy in my mind, thirst to make me wanted to know what\'s comes up next. While in some minutes, I felt the \'rushed\' things is also annoying. In the same time,  it makes you want to continue it or dropped it in a weird mixture of feelings.In the end, watching Occultic; Nine is one of the worst ways to end a year. It is obviously not recommended if you seeks a deep sci-fi/mystery anime. It leads our mind to a desperate situation where you struggle to understand it but the story doesn\'t give you any chance to understands it, a total wasted potential because of a bad execution. It just another pitiful attempt to adapt a light novel. this to the screen.  And what I thought about Occultic; Nine is similar as I stated above.

It just another pitiful attempt to adapt a light novel.', 'As you can probably guess by the semicolon in the title, Occultic;Nine is another entry from the Science Adventure franchise, except this time it\'s based on a two-volume light novel series written by that other semicolon writer not named Naotaka Hayashi. Not that it really matters too much because the basic plot is pretty much the same as all the other semicolon entries: a bunch of professional adults go apeshit for no reason other than they\'re bastards and try to take over the world through some specific scientific area that\'s been weaponized, and end up involving a bunch of eccentric young teenagers or college students...who just so happen to have an interest in said field, as well as wield the only (nerdy) means that are capable of defeating said organization. And since this is a semicolon anime, that means all the characters are either a NEET or a cosplayer or an idol or some irritating ""man, we sure love anime"" trope that is about as un-relatable and accurate in regards to portraying the human being as Steven Seagal in every single movie he\'s ever made or been in. Which makes even less sense here because the other entries have been all about technology, so they\'d all somewhat fit in Japan\'s electric town. But Occultic;Nine is more about the supernatural, which isn\'t an otaku-bait subject at all, so having everyone be a nerd is as jarring as all those fanservice-y characters in those Zero Escape games.Speaking of Zero Escape, it seems that the writers of this series are friends with the guys who made the Nonary games, because this show borrows a lot of storytelling devices from stuff like 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue\'s Last Reward. You\'ve at least heard of those games, right? Those handheld sci-fi mystery visual novels that raise so many questions to the point of frustration, only to info-dump the answers to you at the very end to the point of tedium whilst being obsessed with the number ""nine""? They\'re tolerable to get through when you\'re actually playing them, but outside of the interactive medium, they\'re a fucking grind - something the writers of this show seemed to miss entirely when they somehow mistook that Punchline anime as VN-to-anime genius.Occultic;Nine also differs from the other SciAdv entries in that it tries to mask the slow-ass pacing that generally happens with light/visual novel adaptations in that it borrows heavily from Ryogho Narita\'s style of writing, particularly Baccano with the multiple character jumping through different seemingly unconnected phases of the mysterious incident. This may seem like a compliment at first, but I think most of us who didn\'t have the nails lodged in their brains required to acknowledge Durarara!!x2 as ""not absolutely cancerous"" can see at this point that Baccano\'s style of storytelling hasn\'t aged well at all. Because over-the-top characters with no personal flaws, interesting philosophies, or reason to be in the story other than to be cool whilst backed by an energetic presentation trying desperately to cover up for the lack of plot progression is about as entertaining as watching bird competitions where the competitors ate Chinese food during the pre-competition feeding time. And it doesn\'t help when that presentation is applied to a plot that is about as over-complicated and impenetrable as a steel wall with candy canes of fifty different colors painted all over it.Getting past the presentation is a tall task in of itself due to how much of a tonally inconsistent joke it is. For one thing, this show has constant hyper-stylization all through its run time that never calms the fuck down - playing ill-fitting music every time a murder happens to the point that it resembles a Green Day soundtrack in an Anne Frank movie. The animation itself is of decent quality when the show bothers to take a break from cutting to a new scene every two seconds, but it\'s also horribly mismatched. Having the characters make exaggerated faces with the show\'s sketchy style every time an important dramatic scene occurs to the point that you\'d swear everyone in this show was horribly miscast. And they never blend in well with the realistic-looking backgrounds, looking more out of place than an animated character from Coonskin dancing on the set of How I Met Your Mother.Not helping at all is that Occultic;Nine has what is possibly the worst directing/cinematography in an anime I\'ve ever seen. A majority of the screen time consists of long long LONG scenes of characters sitting/standing around in one place delivering boring exposition that is almost completely unnecessary to understanding what\'s going on, and often brings up more questions than it does answers. And because the director of this show lost all his talent after making Your Lie in April, he somehow approved the idea of a drunk cameraman doing the shooting for this show, because 90% of the show is shot in an angle. Most of the times, it\'ll be dutch. Sometimes, it\'ll be upside down or sideways. There\'s one time when the camera just spun around for no reason and gave me a headache in the process. This is not how you make dialogue more engaging. You know what you do to make dialogue more engaging? Write some actual good dialogue.Speaking of the dialogue, in addition to having some of the worst directing in an anime ever, I think Occultic;Nine\'s writing was the product of some bet with the Kingdom Hearts guys to see who can make their audience slice their ears off or turn off the subtitles the fastest. Not only do these characters not shut the fuck up, but when they\'re not delivering exposition against dull still backgrounds regarding Nikola Tesla and how the story intends to rape his corpse, they\'re prolonging scenes with quips consisting of nothing but explaining the logistics of some minor thing or engaging in otaku dialogue in a show that has nothing to do with otaku. There was one exchange in Episode 5 when the character kept saying the word ""pukey"" for like five minutes because they wanted their conversation to be ""cute"" for no reason whatsoever. And even earlier in the episode, one of the main characters info-dumps a lot of signs regarding how Gamon is lying to him from the amount of time his eyes wandered to his facial expressions, even though I don\'t care how he knows since everything about Gamon\'s personality should make that obvious. Yes, the dialogue is that bad.Doesn\'t help that even by the standards set by the specific visual novel company\'s previous track record, the nine characters that make up this show are all just completely unlikeable, Rewrite-style. It\'s like they were written by someone who forgot that the pre-requisite for wanting to see how everything connects together in a mystery show as it goes on is to have individual character stories that can stand on their own do most of the leg work in regards to telling the story. For example, there\'s this one girl who was so delusional about her brother\'s death that she ended up living with his corpse for a year until the neighbors realized that onii-chan was starting to smell a bit. You\'d think this would give an insight into some serious psychological issues or play a vital role in what exactly the fuck is going on, and you\'d be more wrong than a typical 4chan commenter. It\'s never brought up again, all it did was make the girl creepy without giving me a reason why I\'m supposed to care that she\'s creepy. And just to put the cherry on top, she has no literally no purpose in the main plot at all. I\'ve seen teen stereotypes in 80s slasher films that were more three-dimensional.Of course, when compared to the villains of this mess, Jason Vorhees might as well be any of the characters that Gary Oldman played in his career. I know the evil organizations in these series tend to be a load of crap, but I think Occultic;Nine was trying to out shit the Sinister Six with the motivations it gave its antagonists. Without spoiling anything major, the evil SERN replacement that looms over this show\'s shadow wants to control the rich in order to rule the world for no other reason than because they\'re nameless bastards. You\'re probably thinking at this point that this sounds like a shitty comic book plot, and it is; but somehow things get even dumber when it\'s revealed how they\'re going to accomplish their master plan. Someone want to explain to me who\'s providing the funding for these guys and their convoluted plans? Because I think Akihiko Kayaba from Sword Art Online presented a more engaging business plan in regards to his quest to kill off Japan\'s youth.Oh and for the love of god, ENOUGH WITH THE GODDAMN TIME-TRAVEL/ALTERNATE WORLD SHIT, ALREADY! From Higurashi to Clannad to Madoka Magica to anything written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, I am fucking sick of visual novel companies/writers using it. It was old when those products did it, and as of this point, it\'s pretty much just a dead corpse kept in cold storage with people fighting over who gets to unfreeze it next. Occultic;Nine doesn\'t even make good use of it. It\'s only hinted at through a few characters whose sole purpose are to be McGuffins, and then used as a last-minute deus ex machina for its finale, which is pretty exposition-heavy for an episode that\'s supposed to conclude things with a bang. But even if the creators had fixed the infamous pacing problems that turned many people away to start with, that still wouldn\'t have fixed Occultic;Nine\'s biggest problem: it fucking sucks.I mean between the numerous plot points borrowed from every visual novel ever, horrible motivations driving the characters forward, and awful humor that couldn\'t make Barney fans laugh, the shit-ass production of this show just twists the already-deep knife wound so hard the blood fucking explodes. What on earth does this show have to offer anyone? What exactly is it about? When the mystery is over and the answers are revealed, what then? How does this show have anything to do with the occult? You\'d think a show called Occultic;Nine would pay more than lip-service to its many practices, but it never does. Instead it does what every awful mystery show does: bait the viewers with questions throughout the entire journey whilst having that bait be the substance rather than everything surrounding it, answer only a few of the questions tediously at the last minute, and have said answers be unsatisfying dogshit.Well fuck you, Science Adventure guys. And fuck you too, A-1 Pictures.

The writer has seriously been thinking about pretty acceptable theories (and using ones that already exist). This makes the paranormal activities in this serie more realistic, just like he did with the time travel theories in Steins;Gate. It is really funny how some small jokes refer to certain moments in Steins;Gate. But don't get me wrong, because this serie on it's self isreally good.I love the way things are being made mysterious and every strange thing you see has a meaning.

The story behind the characters is good and sow are theiractions, but they are not that special furthermore. I think theyused just some stereotype characters and merged them with the amazing plot, which made it pretty succesfull. The serie contains a lot of characters, but you should bear with it because otherwise it will ruin the story.Character: 7The art was done really well and detailed, which is important in these types of series where you need eye for detail. The intro music is pretty good and the other sounds/music in the serie is pretty good too.Art/Sound: 10I enjoyed this seriea lot and I hope you too!!!

I haven't watched any of those two, but it's nice to know that a series I love is based in the same world as two other anime on my to watch list.Now for specifics on Occultic; Nine.  I'd have to say that the story was interesting, although it was  a bit rushed.  The dialog was very fast and you ca tell that the scenes went by quickly.  Even with the fast pacing, I still really like...the idea the show had; having nine people become ghosts and be all specifically linked to a certain blog was quite interesting due to all the weird supernatural phenomenon that occurred.I'll admit that characters are really all that developed.  Each of them did fit their role though and everyone of them actually did something to help advance the plot that can only be fulfilled by them; a side character was not randomly chosen to perform a task that a main character could've done.The art and sound weren't the best either, but they did fit well into the show.  I do like the opening and ending themes.Overall, Occultic; Nine can seem like a mess, but it was quite enjoyable.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out at first, but I became really interested in seeing how it would unfold by the third week or so. I'd recommend this to sci-fi fans who won't the fact that it will seem rushed. the idea the show had; having nine people become ghosts and be all specifically linked to a certain blog was quite interesting due to all the weird supernatural phenomenon that occurred.I'll admit that characters are really all that developed.

In this season this will be occultic nine. Adapted from the light novel series of the same nameSo then lets get startedOccultic Nine has a rather unique story in that it combines the traditional evil organisation/corporation's evil plot with the occultic which in this case deals with the use of spirits. The story combines the elements of these two type of story types with elements of mystery into one storyline that is full of twists and unexpected revelations. Indeed while the...story can be difficult to understand at first and indeed this is one of the complaints that i have seen other viewers have expressed the story does become clearer as anime goes on. The story of occultic nine follows the lives of nine characters that in normal life situations would not have likely have met each other but are drawn together when they discover the evil plot and that they have all been affected by it. One of the things that i like about the story for occultic nine is that it brings people with sometimes differing personalities together and force them to work together to hunt down the truth while at the same time allowing them to expand their knowledge on what they think is real. All in all i thought that the story behind occultic nine while certainly slow to start got better as it went on.Yuta Gamon voiced by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel world and Attack on Titan fame who is usually referred to as Gamon in the series is one of the main characters of the series. A high school student like Ryouka and Miyu Gamon is a self described Neet that runs his own blog that centers on the occultic and the paranormal that he calls Kiri Kiri Basara. Gamon has a rather simple outlook and view to his life in that he wants to merely run his blog in peace and live off the money that he runs from that while at the same time looking for interesting strange and paranormal phenomenon. Personality wise Gamon changes quite a bit in the course of the series so much in fact the its almost like he's a different person. In the early parts of the story Gamon is laid back and cowardly and cares little for others and only cares about the blog and himself and at the same time gets scared rather easily when confronted by the unknown. However this changes after he begins to unravel the truth in that he becomes a more determined and serious person that while still getting scared at times has learned to not let that affect him as much. Gamon also become braver and closer to his friends and more than willing to protect them which is a far cry from when his character was first introduced. I thought that Yuki Kaji did a great job portraying Gamon and his character is arguably one of my favorites on this show.Ryouka voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte Fame is one of the main characters of the show. A high school student like Gamon Ryouka is Gamons best friend and indeed only friend at the beginning of the story. Ryouka is a affiliate of the blog that Gamon runs and is one of the reasons why its popular. One of Ryouka's most prominent traits is the size of her breasts which is often used for comical effect within the series. Personality wise Ryouka is a bit of a ditz but nonetheless has a kind and caring personality and it is apparent that she cares about Gamon as a friend. Around halfway through the series Ryouka's personality changes due to to her being possessed by the spirit of the granddaughter of a  well known inventor and real life persona that changes her personality. Here Ryouka/Aveline  is a more serious person and a more driven one that while still caring of Gamon and co is also determined to stop the main enemy plot. This leads to her trying to decide on what actions to take for the endgame which i thought was well done. Ayane Sakura i felt did a great job portraying Ryouka here.Miyu voiced by veteran seiyuu Hitomi Yoshida of the Digimon adventure tri fame is one of the main characters of the show. A high school student like Gamon and Ryouka Miyu is relatively popular due to her beauty and personality and is also a well known fortune teller that makes use of tarot cards to divine fortune and as a result she has a rather large fan club following her despite only being a first year. Personality wise Miyu is a kind and caring person that cares about her friends but at the same time is fearful of the occult and things that she doesn't understand. Miyu's friendship with her best friend Chizu who she calls Chi chan forms one of the foundations of her personality and also forms one of the sub arcs of the main story. When Chi vanished without a trace Miyu's personality changes and she becomes more withdrawn and depressed which is different to her usual positive self and at the same time she becomes obsessed to discover what happened to Chi. Though the arc ended with a sad fate for Chi Miyu at least found out what had happened and from that become a stronger person that become braver and at the same time caring towards her friends.Sarai voiced by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa is one of the main characters of the show. A university student unlike Gamon Sarai is also a realist that believes only in the facts that he sees in front of him and as such being confronted with the paranormal which itself is difficult to prove as there is no proven facts about it proves challenging for him to understand. Sarai is the son of Professor Hashigami a renowned and respected professor that was well respected within his field and is indeed a character central to the overall plot of the series. Sarai is a serious, intelligent and clear headed person and indeed among the cast along with Touko is the main brains within the cast. Sarai's relationship with his father is one of the main points of his character and seeing him try and understand the reason why his father decided to look into Paranormal and how he was connected with the main plot was actually quite hearwarming to see especially when it become apparent that his father was trying to stop the same plot that Sarai and co was. Another aspect of Sarai that was interesting was his relationship with Gamon. As a realist Sarai did not agree with Gamon on a lot of things including Paranormal and as such they are often at each others throats due to their differing viewpoints and beliefs. However as the series progresses and Gamon and Co discover more paranormal Sarai is forced to admit that even in life there are things that define common sense and ultimately results in Sarai actually calling Gamon his friend that opened his eyes.Touko played by veteran seiyuu Shizuka Itou is one of the main characters of the show. A veteran reporter for a famed occultic magazine Touko is a highly motivated person that does her best to determine the truth behind the paranormal that she discovers. Like Sarai Touko is a bit of a realist but she is more willing to believe in something that can't be proven by facts if the theory behind them is sound. Being a reporter Touko crosses paths with many of the main cast before she too is dragged into the plot by the machinations of the villain. Personality wise Touko is a determined, efficient and focused person that is serious about her job and at the same time is also a smart and freethinking person that is not afraid of thinking outside of the box. Despite her rather serious nature Touko does care about her subjects and friends which is best seen in her interactions with Miyu in the aftermath of Chi's disappearance. In the cause of the series Touko develops a catchphrase of sorts in which she mutters the words Ascension whenever she discovers something and when something becomes clear in her mind. This i found to be quite amusing. In the course of the series Touko develops a good working relationship with Sarai as they are often out together looking for clues and at the same time she also makes friends with Miyu which i found to be nice.Asuna voiced by veteran seiyuu Satomi Akesaka of Gate fame is a support character of the series. A special agent of the FBI despite being a high school girl Asuna shows up near the halfway point of the anime having been sent to replace her sempai Morisaki who had vanished during the course of his investigation. As expected of a detective Asuna is a perceptive, inquisitive and intelligent person thats also logical and dutiful. Asuna both respects and admires Morisaki a great deal and her reasons for investigating the case is as much as in finding out what had killed him as it is in finding out exactly what is going on. Not merely being content with examining evidence at the station Asuna also goes into the field quite often and as such crosses paths with the main cast when she encounters Gamon. Despite being confronted with a case that deals that the paranormal that is well outside of her expertise Asuna was able to determine the various connections that linked the various cases together something that local police had trouble in doing which ultimately led her to assisting the main cast in stopping the evil plot. Apart from having great deduction and investigation skills Asuna also has some sort of power in that she is able to see the last few moments of someones life as a movie. This i found to be quite interesting and actually made her character stand out more.Aria voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of Sword art online and High school of the dead fame is a main character of the series. A teenager that practices the art of Black magic in which she can place curses on someone by using a piece of their hair. Before becoming her current self Aria whose real name is Rin Minase was a somewhat rich girl who lived with her brother Takaharu in a large house within the city. As a result Aria had a rather close relationship with her brother that many mistake as incest but this is far from the truth as Aria saw him as parent figure that was the only person that cared for her. The shock of brothers death that resulted from a botched operation was the result of a kidney transplant ultimately drove Aria over the edge where she become Aria who is able to speak to the devil. Like Ririka Aria does factor in the main plot but only provides advice to the main cast indirectly.Ririka voiced by veteran seiyuu Mamiko Noto of  the Persona 3 movies is a renowned Dojin manga artist that seems to have the ability to predict the future. Her manga's serve as a central plot element within the show. Ririka is familiar with Professor Hashigami's work and is also familiar with Sarai as they both go to the same university. A mysterious, intelligent and mature person Ririka is an interesting character in that while she certainly knows more about the events that are going on she doesn't do anything to either help or hinder the villains and indeed seems content to wait and see what happens instead. Indeed Ririka like Aria only provides indirect advice to the main cast.Arts and animationI felt that the character designs for the main characters was well done and detailed and that the environments were well designed and executed. Animation i felt was well done especially with all the occultic scenes.MusicThe music for the series i felt was nicely done and i liked both the ending and opening themes that i felt set the mood for the series.Voice actingVoice acting in general i felt was good with Ayane Sakura, Yuki Kaji and Hitomi Yoshida deserving praise as i felt that they managed to portray their characters pretty well.ConclusionOccultic nine i felt was an interesting series as it combined the traditional evil corporation troupe with the paranormal and though it wasn't perfect by any means i quite enjoyed the story that i found to be both interesting and at the same time kinda disturbing. Animation and art i felt was reasonably good as was the music and voice acting. With regards to the characters however i felt that not all the characters were given enough character development. Certainly the main investigation team of Gamon, Sarai, Miyu and Ryouka were given great character development but the characters of Aria and Ririka both of which were voiced by veterans were not and apart from having a good backstory which even Ririka lacked they were not featured in the main plot that often. I felt that the story could have been expanded to include them in and give them a bigger role than what they had in the current story.Apart from that however i quite enjoyed the story of occultic nine which mixed the evil corp troupe with the paranormal. story can be difficult to understand at first and indeed this is one of the complaints that i have seen other viewers have expressed the story does become clearer as anime goes on. The story of occultic nine follows the lives of nine characters that in normal life situations would not have likely have met each other but are drawn together when they discover the evil plot and that they have all been affected by it. One of the things that i like about the story for occultic nine is that it brings people with sometimes differing personalities together and force them to work together to hunt down the truth while at the same time allowing them to expand their knowledge on what they think is real. All in all i thought that the story behind occultic nine while certainly slow to start got better as it went on.Yuta Gamon voiced by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel world and Attack on Titan fame who is usually referred to as Gamon in the series is one of the main characters of the series.

For most people browsing sites like anichart and putting upcoming seasonal titles into their proverbial shopping cart, any show that has a semicolon in its name immediately gets thrown in the basket thanks to its storied legacy. As of late however, it’s easy to lose faith since the majority of the semicolon titles have come with mixed reception. Fall 2016 has rolled around, and the first semicolon entry since 2012 unveiled itself as Occultic;Nine. 2016 was, in many people’s eyes, an...overall weak year for non-sequel anime, so many saw Occultic;Nine as the last bastion of defense of 2016 before going into the new year. In many minds, this begged a controversial question filled with a lot of expectation and (in some cases, hesitant) excitement: would Occultic;Nine be a Steins;Gate or another Chaos;Head?As the final minutes of the 12 episode long series come to a close, I unfortunately have to conclude that Occultic;Nine falls under the latter category. While it has its fair share of interesting and cool moments, the majority of the show is marred and sabotaged by its overall abhorrent pacing and sloppy execution.Upon watching Occultic;Nine for the first time, the most immediate aspect of the show you might notice is the blindingly fast dialogue. In moderation, this style of narrative isn’t automatically terrible; it can be considered a stylistic choice to help support the atmosphere of the show. Unfortunately, the dialogue speed feels less like a stylistic choice and more of way of squeezing as much content as possible within a given time frame, and it remains consistent in all 12 episodes of the show. The result is a sloppy, exhausting mess that drags down nearly every other element of the anime, including character development, setting, and plot progression. But it’s not simply the dialogue speed that’s the problem; it’s the little breathing room in between each line in the next, and this dramatically affects the immersion and effectiveness of the show. It doesn’t matter if the characters are talking about what they ate that morning or revealing important plot elements to the viewers, each line of dialogue falls directly over the next and this continues until each episode concludes. The viewer is given almost zero time to absorb any information at all and it becomes difficult to distinguish what is fluff and what is important. Because the dialogue moves at such unrealistic speeds, the scenes and characters seem more unnatural, almost as if they’re reading lines from a script. Any build-up effectively gets ruined, and any investment diminishes even at reveals or character development. In addition, quick dialogue is often times a specific character quirk meant to tell us about a character’s personality. In Occultic;Nine, everyone shares this unnatural quality which greatly homogenizes the already bland cast.It’s not just the dialogue that moves unnaturally either. The plot jerks around at different speeds, often spending either way too much time in extraneous details or suddenly advancing the plot with no warning at all. While the first episode pushed the plot forward a little by unveiling a murder scene in the final moments, not much actually occurred in the show until around episode 6; until then, the show was mostly exposition. Aria is one such example; her exposition occupied an entire episode, yet she remained relatively uninvolved with the story even at the end of the 12 episodes. Now it’s not necessarily a bad thing to give more exposition to side characters, but it is when it comes at the expense of the main plot. In the latter half of Occultic;Nine, scenes would sometimes jerk from one to another, and often times I would bear witness to a scene where I had no idea what was going on. The most noticeable moment of this to me was when a scene shifted from our cast of main characters to suddenly the board meeting of villains (unveiled for the first time) with zero transition or exposition. It’s disorientating for no reason and made the show not only feel rushed but also unnecessarily confusing.The story on average isn’t well-polished either. While there’s grounds for a relatively interesting and creative plot, it’s watered down by the amount of telling over showing. Occultic;Nine at its base is supposed to a thriller, and most tend to stay more dynamic in order to keep the viewer invested. Occultic;Nine rarely does that, and most of the plot isn’t explained through action but through dialogue (and like I said earlier, the style of dialogue is horrendous). As another friend of mine put it, “the show is all exposition,” or in other words, rather than letting the plot itself do the talking, it’s often the characters that have to explain the plot and pseudo-science toward us, which 80% of the time is mostly just unnecessary filler to justify the hazy connection between hard science and spiritual superstition. To elaborate on this further, the reason why I say that that the explanations are usually unnecessary justifications is because despite how fervently the anime might try to insist scientific jargon, a lot of the time it invalidates itself, often through the use of deus ex machina plot devices (one such example is Gamon magically sprouting wings under the validation that he is in fact a ghost, the possibility conveniently unveiled to him only at the final episode of the show). Finally, as you might expect from the dialogue, the show ends blindingly fast, riddled with more loopholes than a Starbucks Wi-Fi network. What happened to Ririka? Who is the mastermind that orchestrated this phenomenon? What on earth happened to the other 250 victims? Many large questions are still left unanswered if not straight up forgotten, which is incredibly frustrating and borderline unforgivable for a narrative that claims to be a mystery.The characters, in my opinion, are painfully bland as well. Both Touko and Sarai are incredibly dull characters that fulfill the same role, that being the smart and composed type. Ryo-tas served mostly as a nonsensical background distraction (which was occasionally charming but overall dismissible) who eventually turned into an equally nonsensical character (Tesla’s daughter) with no unique personality with her appearance having about as much effect as a shallow plot device. Miyuu is an overall boring personality with no qualities that make her stand out from the rest of the cast. And Shun is an incredibly boring character who seemingly knows pretty much everything for no reason, often deflating otherwise interesting conflicts with randomly obtained knowledge. Gamon is actually not a bad main character since he serves as an everyman in this cast of characters and bizarre setting. Ultimately however, he’s shoved with conveniently tied character traits that make him artificially special instead of naturally developing his own character to connect with the viewers as an everyman type should. The antagonists in Occultic;Nine are also insultingly boring. They have zero connection to any characters of the plot and as a result only fulfill the role as a vague, stereotypical organization that the main characters are tasked to defeat. The aspirations are as usual the most boring possible, which is to expand their businesses and create profit. Their designs are laughably typical, simply looking like corporate CEOs and businessmen. Most other solid thriller shows have interesting villains, whether it’s something as simple as being visually striking or psychologically threatening or slightly more complex as being relatable and empathetic or sometimes a little mix of both. Occultic;Nine’s villains are none of this, and it makes the story much harder to be invested in.To give credit where credit is due, I do think Occultic;Nine did a few things right. The show on average was consistently well-animated, and the majority of the character designs and settings are aesthetically pleasing and occasionally unique (save for Ryoka’s unrelenting force that is her stupidly massive chest). There are even a number of well-executed shots throughout the entire anime. In particular, the scene where Gamon stares over his lifeless body was particularly brilliant and awesome. And the overall set-up for the plot isn’t necessarily bad. As much as I’ve harped on it, combining hard science fiction with the supernatural has the potential to be interesting due to how contrarian they are, and the duality of characters being both dead and alive in a single show hasn’t been explored as deeply in narratives as it can be. It’s not necessarily that the plot is bad, it’s more that it was executed poorly.I’m sure most of us that were hoping for another installment of the semicolon series were looking for another Steins;Gate since a lot of us want to relive those thrilling 24 episodes that we experienced way back in 2011 over again. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is anything but that, delivering a sloppy and mediocre experience for those that have stayed dedicated to the series. With Chaos;Head and debatably Robotics;Notes, Occultic;Nine is a third strike, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who will dismiss the next semicolon anime when browsing for things to watch in future seasons. overall weak year for non-sequel anime, so many saw Occultic;Nine as the last bastion of defense of 2016 before going into the new year.

Who is the mastermind that orchestrated this phenomenon? What on earth happened to the other 250 victims? Many large questions are still left unanswered if not straight up forgotten, which is incredibly frustrating and borderline unforgivable for a narrative that claims to be a mystery.The characters, in my opinion, are painfully bland as well. Both Touko and Sarai are incredibly dull characters that fulfill the same role, that being the smart and composed type. Ryo-tas served mostly as a nonsensical background distraction (which was occasionally charming but overall dismissible) who eventually turned into an equally nonsensical character (Tesla’s daughter) with no unique personality with her appearance having about as much effect as a shallow plot device. Miyuu is an overall boring personality with no qualities that make her stand out from the rest of the cast. And Shun is an incredibly boring character who seemingly knows pretty much everything for no reason, often deflating otherwise interesting conflicts with randomly obtained knowledge. Gamon is actually not a bad main character since he serves as an everyman in this cast of characters and bizarre setting. Ultimately however, he’s shoved with conveniently tied character traits that make him artificially special instead of naturally developing his own character to connect with the viewers as an everyman type should. The antagonists in Occultic;Nine are also insultingly boring. They have zero connection to any characters of the plot and as a result only fulfill the role as a vague, stereotypical organization that the main characters are tasked to defeat. The aspirations are as usual the most boring possible, which is to expand their businesses and create profit. Their designs are laughably typical, simply looking like corporate CEOs and businessmen. Most other solid thriller shows have interesting villains, whether it’s something as simple as being visually striking or psychologically threatening or slightly more complex as being relatable and empathetic or sometimes a little mix of both. Occultic;Nine’s villains are none of this, and it makes the story much harder to be invested in.To give credit where credit is due, I do think Occultic;Nine did a few things right. The show on average was consistently well-animated, and the majority of the character designs and settings are aesthetically pleasing and occasionally unique (save for Ryoka’s unrelenting force that is her stupidly massive chest). There are even a number of well-executed shots throughout the entire anime. In particular, the scene where Gamon stares over his lifeless body was particularly brilliant and awesome. And the overall set-up for the plot isn’t necessarily bad. As much as I’ve harped on it, combining hard science fiction with the supernatural has the potential to be interesting due to how contrarian they are, and the duality of characters being both dead and alive in a single show hasn’t been explored as deeply in narratives as it can be. It’s not necessarily that the plot is bad, it’s more that it was executed poorly.I’m sure most of us that were hoping for another installment of the semicolon series were looking for another Steins;Gate since a lot of us want to relive those thrilling 24 episodes that we experienced way back in 2011 over again. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is anything but that, delivering a sloppy and mediocre experience for those that have stayed dedicated to the series. With Chaos;Head and debatably Robotics;Notes, Occultic;Nine is a third strike, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who will dismiss the next semicolon anime when browsing for things to watch in future seasons.', ""I am so happy that I did not listen to the thoughts of others, and just went into this show blindly!All I see is others saying that this is rushed, and the pacing was off yada yada yada. THEY'RE WRONG. It is so important to go into this with an open mind, and to just accept what you see. Just because the story is told in an unorthodox way that doesn't stive to be like other animes, does not mean it is told incorrectly. The story is told in a unique way, wherein they answer one question while simultaneously creating 5 other questions. I...personally love this since it kept me guessing the whole way through. The storytelling was fast but that was the uniqueness of its own style. Nothing was rushed, everything was explained with no plot holes (maybe save for one, honestly). The story was incredibly unique and I fully understood and quite enjoyed the picture they were painting. Also, I really have to appreciate how everything, even the smallest detail, will be integral to the story.I greatly enjoyed the characters. The mystery was so engaging where I was so hooked, and could not stop watching. The art was satisfying and pleasing to view. The ending song is EVERYTHING and I NEVER skipped it.This anime really showed me to take others reviews and thoughts with a grain of salt, because this was a lovely little gem that I would definitely recommend. personally love this since it kept me guessing the whole way through.

There are going to be people that will say... ""This anime is too confusing, I have no idea what is happening, my brain is killing me."" and people who are like... ""This anime is so smart with it\'s story, it totally makes sense... omg, give me more plz!"" To me, this anime does start out very very confusing, then I was like... DAMN!!! Let\'s get to the pros and cons of things.**Story - 7/10Cons:Oh What a...Rush! - Ok, the main problem is in it\'s first 3 episodes in this anime and it\'s how rushed and fast everything is going. It was very hard to tell what was happening because 1... The dialogue was going so fast that I had to pause alot of times, take a breather, and read the subtitles again. 2... It felt more rushed then Sword Art Online, I couldn\'t tell at all what this anime was even about in it\'s first 3 episodes. At least in SAO, the rushed mess that that anime is, you would already know what it\'s about...  but  in this anime, you\'ll have a hard time understanding anything.Pros:Wow!... What a Twist! - This anime started to become slower at episode 5. At episode 4, I knew, I finally get to know what it\'s about, and things start to make sense to me. Even the dialogue was a bit slower actually. Some will say it\'s still fast but I noticed a change of pace in the dialogue... That\'s probably just me idk. Anyway, the story was no longer too complicated to me, and when things started to pick up and become interesting, I was enjoying watching these later episodes. This story has alot of neat surprises that are dark and intriguing. You get to know why and how this mass suicide happened. I love these types of stories so much, it does remind me of Steins;Gate a little. It\'s also fun to make your own theories for later episodes. The last episode was actually just good, it wasn\'t anything too spectacular until the last couple scenes.Characters - 6/10Cons:*Can you repeat that again please? - The character, they talk too fast for me, especially in the early episodes, they were talking like freaks. A lot of times the characters would talk over other characters. Where I have to pay attention to what both of them are saying. Again though, to me, they\'re talking has slowed down a bit in the later episodes but still though.*Big Melons - So there is this one main female character whos, and you probably already know about this... It\'s that girl Ryouka. Her tits are just too big, like idk how she is even standing, dancing, and running around. They\'re bigger than the girls breasts from Highschool of the Dead I believe, and it\'s just too much. It\'s pretty unnecessary, It\'s very distracting.... Like i know there is alot of fan service in alot of different anime, even anime that aren\'t ecchi anime, but this is seriously dumb.*Annoying - Sometimes, Gamon can be pretty dumb and annoying. In the very first episode, he picks up a knife that has blood all over it, and he acts like he doesnt notices it. He finds it, starts playing with it, then finds a dead body 10 seconds later, then finally realizes he\'s got blood all over the palm of his hand. Also, this dudes panics are so annoying sometimes, that\'s when he never stops talking and slows down. Like, yeah I would be spooked if I was in his situations too, but still, this guy needs a fucking chill pill. He\'s also the least interesting character in my opinion.Pros:*Personality - Yeah, alot of these characters are pretty damn interesting though, even Ryouka, you might think she\'s just there for laughs and giggles but no, she adds alot to the story in this anime. And that surprised me, when she showed her true self to Gamon, that blew my fucking mind. Also, the detective dude, Shun, has such a funny personality, I like how he gets into everyones  business, sometimes making jokes at them, annoying them, scaring them, and sometimes just having a normal conversation. He\'s such a funny dude, he\'s me laugh quite a bit here. Other characters I find interesting is Aria, who talks to that ghost looking dude, she\'s pretty cool. Also Touko is a very good character, I like how serious she can be, and she\'s always seems to make really good choices too.*Development - Most of these characters had some pretty decent development here. Like Aria, we get to see alot of her past with her and her brother. And we get to see why she is who she is now. We get to learn Sarai\'s past a bit, with him and his father. Ryouko actually had some major development, in the later episodes. And it was all surprising to me, something that happened to her that I never saw coming. Miyuu gets some development as when she loses he friend. And also the gay bartender gets some good development, we learn alot about him in the later episodes.Art - 10/10Pros :I gotta say, I was a huge fan of the art and animation of this series. IT had it\'s own unique style and it\'s a style I really like. I also love the character designs. Most of them, because...well... ya know lol... All of the character designs were pretty unique as well. I haven\'t notices any derps on the characters faces either. The artist really paid close attention to detail, even on the things you won\'t notice in a scene, and I\'m a big fan of that.Sound - 7/10Pros: The Op and Ed was nothing too special, it was just... good. I wasn\'t loving it, I wasn\'t hating it... I just kinda like it. The OST was pretty good. Had some pretty spooky sounds in scenes where things were getting... ya know, pretty spooky, and those sounds were nice to my ears actually, I liked those sounds lol. And sounds that were not so spooky were ok as well. No big complaints here. It was all just slightly above average.Enjoyment - 9/10I gotta say though, despite the complaints I had with this series, I enjoyed this anime a ton. I loved the twists, I loved the nasty reveals of the characters, I love the development of the characters, and I love the interesting story. Story is only a 7 becasue of it\'s major issue in the first few episodes, I can\'t give it any higher than that even though I loved it, because of the huge rush. But yeah, I definitely enjoyed this anime, again it\'s not for everyone, some people aren\'t going to get it, and will probably drop it before things get intense... but it\'s whatever.I\'m giving this anime a strong 8 to a light 9. Thanks for reading this, have a good one guys :) Rush! - Ok, the main problem is in it\'s first 3 episodes in this anime and it\'s how rushed and fast everything is going.

Thanks for reading this, have a good one guys :)', 'Occultic Nine is another dark anime involving mind bending story and so to say, mind bending timeline. You need to pay really big attention with the timeline, especially when the DATE appearing on the screen (3rd of March is the main date where everything is start happening).Ok, back again to the topic. Honestly, the concept of the story is really great, mystery keep happening the entire series and I always have this feeling of want to know what gonna happen on the next episode with STRONG curiosity.The only hard time I have finishing the series is catching up with the SCREENWRITING. Yes, the screenwriting...if you...don\'t know what is screenwriting, in short it is the dialogue. I am not a native Japanese and I DON\'T like watching dubbed anime so I have quite hard time following the barrage of the subtitle while trying to catch up with what\'s exactly going on. It seems like the series cramped screenwriting of 24 Episode series into 12 Episodes series. EVERYBODY talk WAAYYYYY too fast and I feel like watching the anime on a rollercoaster. Seriously...it\'s a high speed train, the paces can feel like out of hand, some episode was feels really fast that I don\'t even feel ...""What? Did I just finish a 20 Min worth of Episode...what?""This is the first time I met this kind of story so I could say that it\'s kinda original and fresh. I love it from the bottom of my heart but since this rollercoaster series going full speed from the start up to the very last episode but BOOM! the last episode was stopping in a FULL BREAK and I feel like ...errghh,,,what\'s the term of it..ah! yeah right! I feel like WHIP LASHED! That\'s the perfect word. Imagine you ride a rollercoaster and then suddenly its stop after running 100km/h. No no no, not that I don\'t like the ending (or so I wish it have a better ending but it doesn\'t) The way the story closed looks like it will have 2nd season or something so yeah...it is a bit hanging. So in summary, Occultic Nine leave me WHIP LASHED HANGING *lmao *cryThe art & animation? Always love Studio A1 and I will say EVERYTHING is IDENTICAL with SHELTER (that MV of Porter Robinson song) except that SHELTER have much better animation detail but that doesn\'t mean Occultic Nine not good, in fact thumbs up with the art, I enjoyed it so much (Just try to adapt with those nose drawings, it\'s a tad odd but yeah..it is odd). It is exactly like SHELTER but with far darker ambience.Character. The entire series is filled with tons of type of character (except lollicon and tsundere) and all of them coming from different background, not knowing each other and then one by one introduced to each other through a perfect chain of events and all great. Secret after secret, mystery after mystery, why after why revealed one by one and connected to each other finishing the puzzle.One thing I would suggest is try to open your mind to the logic, flip your head a bit because this series is good in term of mind bending. It is filled with rationally impossible theories (something beyond science yet the entire series is close to science) so I would say Occultic Nine is involving Sci-Fi genres in the process.I am excited the entire series due to the lively ambience combo Ryotas and Gamotan and I enjoy the rollercoaster. I like the theme song and the soundtrack as well, it is not boring by any means. I found Occultic Nine pretty similar with Durarara in a lot of ways with ADDITIONAL SPEED and MIND BENDING SCI-FI. don\'t know what is screenwriting, in short it is the dialogue.

Mind you, it took LA 10 episodes before LA FINALLY knew where Occultic;Nine would be good or bad and when the plot fragments finally blended together into a cohesive narrative.For what Occultic;Nine has for ""science"" as this is a part of the ; Science Adventure visual novel series, what the science themes are ""Nikola Tesla\'s experiments"", nonetheless what it also has are Japanese horror stories, fortune telling, precog, a clandestine...organization, seeing the ""devil"", detective work through pschyometry, mass suicides...you can already tell what the problem is right?...THERE\'S JUST TOO MANY IDEAS all jumbled up with one another. At least Chaos;Head had one theme, about delusions, Steins;Gate had time travel, Robotics;Notes had robots. Occultic;Nine feels like it wanted EVERYTHING to do with occult and nothing about it at the same time.Occultic;Nine\'s characters are at best have inconsistent character development for when the plot demands it, such as Yuuta Gamon voiced by Yuki Kaji an occultic blogger, Ryouka Narusawa voiced by Ayane Sakura his assistant, Touko Sumikaze, a journalist to an occult magazine and Ririka Nishizono voiced by Mamiko Noto a doujinshi author that makes future predictions. Occultic;Nine however isn\'t exactly character-focused as the major plotlines and the occult drives these character forward into finding out just what the hell is going on. The only other character that actually seemed to get proper character development were Aria and Kiryuu Kurenanino voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro and Kishou Taniyama respectively as well as  Miyuu Aikawa voiced by Hitomi Yoshida a clairvoyant and in finding her friend Chizu Kawabata voiced by Maria Naganawa, but once their development comes to pass, Aria and Miyuu gets hardly gets mentioned again and Miyuu\'s arc blends in with the the main gang afterwards. Shun Moritsuka voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara and Asuna Kisaki voiced by Satomi Akesaka, both detectives, along with Sarai Hashigami voiced by Kaito Ishikawa a son of a scientist and Touko Sumikaze really relays crucial information to the main gang as their function. Again the plot moves the characters forward, not the other way round (though ONE character becomes the exception later on). LA\'s favourite character would just go to Touko Sumikaze voiced by Shizuka Ito only because she seemed one of the more level-headed characters and probably remembered her for her catchphrase ""Ascension!"", second would easily go to Ryouka Narusawa, NO not because of her *ahem* ""defining feature"", but for voice actor Ayane Sakura and later events that focus on her and the impact she has to the plot in greater detail.Ok, so Occultic;Nine pacing is at best what would happen if you merged SHAFTian animation with Durarara!!\'s plot pacing with how it to tie all the characters together, at times Occultic;Nine will throw us a bone with expositional episodes, the problem is your suspense of disbelief if you can actually handle this. LA kinda did through trying to tie all the plot lines together and how it concerns the characters involved, but some of plot twists are hard to grasp or believe, the main one for LA being the clandestine organization and their plan which both becomes cliche and confusing. But for such a fast paced anime for fast speaking expositional characters, LA can see WHY it was soo fast paced at the very least, there were LOTS of material for the audience to grasp onto and see how the ""fragments"" would fit in through it, if it didn\'t, the 12 episode runtime wouldn\'t just be enough. Sure the fragmented nature of the anime makes it even worse and extremely confusing what\'s going on, but once the plot twists resolves and blends how the plot is ""back on track"", makes the fast pacing more or less compensation for that.On speaking of plot twists, the plot twists felt like it had an impact on the viewer, not so much the characters themselves (Yuuta and Miyuu excluded), as once they realize the plot twists themselves, it just like a normal thing to them and they don\'t budge or react as much kinda dampening the effect of revealing the plot twist when the character reactions are just like ""meh"". The only leeway LA can guess is that the main cast has dabbled in the occultic thus it IS just a normal thing to them, but then the characters who are more level-headed grounded characters didn\'t freak out during their revelations, instead the character who are more crazy does. GAAAA...either way something LA had taken notice to.The animation by A1-Pictures, again it felt like SHAFTian animation but with differing character designs across the board along with differing styles to match it at the same time, the animation wasn\'t annoying for the most part as it did bring in the cohesiveness of what was going on and really reigned in the occultic atmosphere it needed with it\'s grunge black colorings and bolded and light-toned character designs to make things even more crazy to say the least. If anything the animation was pretty decent overall and it\'s fast pacing added to the animation frantic stylings too, the animation by A1-Pictures was very good all things considered.The voice acting really needed to be in game and it\'s one of the better aspects LA saw in Occultic;Nine, reason being because of all the expositional info dumping through ALL characters, the entire cast essentially speedread their lines along with their emotional impact to boot, this voice cast DID AMAZING because of it. If LA would hone in on one voice actor, it would go to Ayane Sakura, let\'s just say SHE HAD RANGE and still kept the frantic pacing of the anime pretty much for LA, LA\'s favourite voice actor in Occultic;Nine. But overall, excellent voice casting to fit it\'s style it needed to bring out.The ending really did feel like it reigned in it\'s themes (after LA tried to analyze the ending for 20 minutes after the final episode anyways) though it finally narrowed down all the themes it had down into one BIG goal that Yuuta and Ryouka had to pull off, but this BIG GOAL was what reigned in the cohesive narrative together albeit a few loose ends never told to us by the end of it and left in a both good climax but anti-climax afterwards due to how it ""just ended"" with no proper epilogue to see what the hell happened to the rest of the characters be it minor or not. It was a climax because of all the attention to the BIG goal and how to get there and let it be accomplished, the anti-climax happened straight after the conclusion of the BIG goal. LA didn\'t know how to feel about it....satisfied?...but wanted more?...is probably the best way to say it.Occultic;Nine, is most definitely an anime you NEED to watch more than 4 episodes before casting your vote in as to what you think about it, all due it\'s fragmented storytelling along with it\'s many many MANY plot twists that goes along with it makes it a rather hard anime to pin down whether it was good or not. Hell as LA said it took LA 10 out of the 12 episodes before LA could tell and from LA\'s perspective, Occultic;Nine is a decent anime overall for LA, having the plot twists handy to get you re-invested towards what the hell is going on and thinking about the suspension of disbelief ""theories"" and either accepting it or not and sure many people might get heavily disappointed or annoyed by it\'s frantic pacing, lacking character development and the more obvious response of ""what the f- is going on?"", but seriously, LA will say this, if your gonna watch Occultic;Nine, it\'s definitely one of those animes that you need to keep your investments in check as the reward in staying and not passing judgement to an anime soo quickly, might bring great satisfying rewards later on and that was what LA got, not so much from the ending as it still left questions after it\'s resolution but the rest of them makes for an interesting anime nonetheless. Not the best from the Science Adventure series LA has seen, but an interesting confusingly fragmented as all hell narrative with a crazy cast of character in an even crazier ""take it or leave it"" suspension of disbelief and some decent production values to go along with it. organization, seeing the ""devil"", detective work through pschyometry, mass suicides...you can already tell what the problem is right?...THERE\'S JUST TOO MANY IDEAS all jumbled up with one another. At least Chaos;Head had one theme, about delusions, Steins;Gate had time travel, Robotics;Notes had robots. Occultic;Nine feels like it wanted EVERYTHING to do with occult and nothing about it at the same time.Occultic;Nine\'s characters are at best have inconsistent character development for when the plot demands it, such as Yuuta Gamon voiced by Yuki Kaji an occultic blogger, Ryouka Narusawa voiced by Ayane Sakura his assistant, Touko Sumikaze, a journalist to an occult magazine and Ririka Nishizono voiced by Mamiko Noto a doujinshi author that makes future predictions.

Shun Moritsuka voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara and Asuna Kisaki voiced by Satomi Akesaka, both detectives, along with Sarai Hashigami voiced by Kaito Ishikawa a son of a scientist and Touko Sumikaze really relays crucial information to the main gang as their function. Again the plot moves the characters forward, not the other way round (though ONE character becomes the exception later on). LA\'s favourite character would just go to Touko Sumikaze voiced by Shizuka Ito only because she seemed one of the more level-headed characters and probably remembered her for her catchphrase ""Ascension!"", second would easily go to Ryouka Narusawa, NO not because of her *ahem* ""defining feature"", but for voice actor Ayane Sakura and later events that focus on her and the impact she has to the plot in greater detail.Ok, so Occultic;Nine pacing is at best what would happen if you merged SHAFTian animation with Durarara!!\'s plot pacing with how it to tie all the characters together, at times Occultic;Nine will throw us a bone with expositional episodes, the problem is your suspense of disbelief if you can actually handle this. LA kinda did through trying to tie all the plot lines together and how it concerns the characters involved, but some of plot twists are hard to grasp or believe, the main one for LA being the clandestine organization and their plan which both becomes cliche and confusing. But for such a fast paced anime for fast speaking expositional characters, LA can see WHY it was soo fast paced at the very least, there were LOTS of material for the audience to grasp onto and see how the ""fragments"" would fit in through it, if it didn\'t, the 12 episode runtime wouldn\'t just be enough. Sure the fragmented nature of the anime makes it even worse and extremely confusing what\'s going on, but once the plot twists resolves and blends how the plot is ""back on track"", makes the fast pacing more or less compensation for that.On speaking of plot twists, the plot twists felt like it had an impact on the viewer, not so much the characters themselves (Yuuta and Miyuu excluded), as once they realize the plot twists themselves, it just like a normal thing to them and they don\'t budge or react as much kinda dampening the effect of revealing the plot twist when the character reactions are just like ""meh"". The only leeway LA can guess is that the main cast has dabbled in the occultic thus it IS just a normal thing to them, but then the characters who are more level-headed grounded characters didn\'t freak out during their revelations, instead the character who are more crazy does. GAAAA...either way something LA had taken notice to.The animation by A1-Pictures, again it felt like SHAFTian animation but with differing character designs across the board along with differing styles to match it at the same time, the animation wasn\'t annoying for the most part as it did bring in the cohesiveness of what was going on and really reigned in the occultic atmosphere it needed with it\'s grunge black colorings and bolded and light-toned character designs to make things even more crazy to say the least. If anything the animation was pretty decent overall and it\'s fast pacing added to the animation frantic stylings too, the animation by A1-Pictures was very good all things considered.The voice acting really needed to be in game and it\'s one of the better aspects LA saw in Occultic;Nine, reason being because of all the expositional info dumping through ALL characters, the entire cast essentially speedread their lines along with their emotional impact to boot, this voice cast DID AMAZING because of it. If LA would hone in on one voice actor, it would go to Ayane Sakura, let\'s just say SHE HAD RANGE and still kept the frantic pacing of the anime pretty much for LA, LA\'s favourite voice actor in Occultic;Nine. But overall, excellent voice casting to fit it\'s style it needed to bring out.The ending really did feel like it reigned in it\'s themes (after LA tried to analyze the ending for 20 minutes after the final episode anyways) though it finally narrowed down all the themes it had down into one BIG goal that Yuuta and Ryouka had to pull off, but this BIG GOAL was what reigned in the cohesive narrative together albeit a few loose ends never told to us by the end of it and left in a both good climax but anti-climax afterwards due to how it ""just ended"" with no proper epilogue to see what the hell happened to the rest of the characters be it minor or not. It was a climax because of all the attention to the BIG goal and how to get there and let it be accomplished, the anti-climax happened straight after the conclusion of the BIG goal. LA didn\'t know how to feel about it....satisfied?...but wanted more?...is probably the best way to say it.Occultic;Nine, is most definitely an anime you NEED to watch more than 4 episodes before casting your vote in as to what you think about it, all due it\'s fragmented storytelling along with it\'s many many MANY plot twists that goes along with it makes it a rather hard anime to pin down whether it was good or not. Hell as LA said it took LA 10 out of the 12 episodes before LA could tell and from LA\'s perspective, Occultic;Nine is a decent anime overall for LA, having the plot twists handy to get you re-invested towards what the hell is going on and thinking about the suspension of disbelief ""theories"" and either accepting it or not and sure many people might get heavily disappointed or annoyed by it\'s frantic pacing, lacking character development and the more obvious response of ""what the f- is going on?"", but seriously, LA will say this, if your gonna watch Occultic;Nine, it\'s definitely one of those animes that you need to keep your investments in check as the reward in staying and not passing judgement to an anime soo quickly, might bring great satisfying rewards later on and that was what LA got, not so much from the ending as it still left questions after it\'s resolution but the rest of them makes for an interesting anime nonetheless. Not the best from the Science Adventure series LA has seen, but an interesting confusingly fragmented as all hell narrative with a crazy cast of character in an even crazier ""take it or leave it"" suspension of disbelief and some decent production values to go along with it.', 'Honestly, for all the people saying this show is a nightmare, you\'re clearly wrong.

It's a really interesting style and there are a lot of interesting shots.The characters were also well done and developed, though the way they designed Ryouka's character is rather... questionable. The rest of the characters all look great though.The story is by far the most interesting part of the show. It's a mystery with a bit of a thriller-aspect to it (like the SciAdv series by the same author), and I personally found it very engaging. I would say that the pacing...is slightly off in some parts; the last episode in particular had way too much going on in it.For me though, the greatest issue I had with this entire show was the speed of the dialogue. I'm sure if I was fluent in Japanese, this show would be a point higher for me, but since I'm not, the speed at which they talk sometimes leaves you having to rewind, pause, and then read the subtitles again.

I\'m watching the first few minutes of the first episode (which is the episode that should capture my interest blah blah blah) but what i saw was an overly large pair of watermelon boobs bouncing around and around, its not that i don\'t love fan services but i did not considered even to the slightest that i would be shown boobs for the first episode and because of that i immediately dropped the series and scored it 1.After that i\'ve watched several anime and whenever i searched for next anime to watch i am always seeing this anime.

Maybe the upcoming game. *shrugs* deus ex machina *cough*----------The premise is really good and captivating, but pacing was way too fast. Every episode messes with your mind, making you scream obscenities as if it'll help you make more sense of it. And then they info dump you because you were asking the wrong question, ya dummy.Music and songs are great. Love the opening (that Steins;Gate opening band man) and ending songs.Character development felt rushed because of how the story was paced, and half of the casts are underdeveloped it seems. But they grow on you regardless. Or maybe I'm just too obsessed with the mystery that I don't really care.----------Overall it's a fun watch, quite enjoyable, but it left me wanting for more with how it ended.

Maybe the upcoming game. *shrugs*"", ""Occultic nine...i asked my self why this anime had this name,but till the last episodes you don't get the meaning behind that name,is it a bad thing? No of course not.However Occultic nine didn't impress me that much and now i will tell you why.The story is centered around events that have as first topic the occult and paranormal.Our protagonist Gamon Yuuta tries to make profit out of those events by running a blog on the internet,where oftenly he makes fun of those facts.He appears as a classic nerd and aside of his partner Ryouka Narusawa,he doesn't really have friends,he spends most of the time...inside a cafè called Blue Moon,ran by a strange man called Kouhei Izumi.But one day Yuuta will get caught inside a nasty situation,and from that point the whole story will start.That's pretty much the initial plot without any spoiler.Now let's talk on how the story will develop without any spoiler,i will explain it in a 'technically' way.First of all the first episodes are very fast paced and i had a really terrible time to keep track of what's going on,till a point where i thought to just drop the anime.But i'm glad i didn't,i saw some people giving this anime a 2 or a 10,and i think that's wrong.There's a lot of good things in this anime as much as bad things,however now back to the story.The start felt very rushed and until the half of the anime you don't really get the idea of where the story is going,it's filled with a lot of mystery and i wanted to see what's really behind it,but i ended up getting a little disappointed on that,because i had a lot of answers but most of them weren't answered,the story has some really INTERESTING plot twists and it really surprised me how things turned out,and the best episodes are where this plot twists happen.I am confident that i'm a really smart person and i didn't see that coming,even if i noticed something was off.But after that everything takes another turn of events and becomes a little clichè,and loses all those points it acquired with the previous twist. But aside of that i think the story is well thought and if i happen to find the novel i will certainly read it.Yes i didn't read the novel.There are some Steins gate references which made me think that it's in the same univerve and there's a connection somehow between the two series.I am a big fan of Steins gate so that's another positive point from me.Also i'm a big fan of horror and this anime even if not labelled as,it has definetly some traits and moments of horror,which are like the strawberry on top of the cake.Let's talk about the staff.The characters are what i liked the most,they aren't that much ''all round'' and they feel like they're the usual clichè group characters:The hero,the one who doesn't believe anything,the calm one,the busty  girl,the creepy girl and super creepy girl,and the charismatic one,and the cute one.Now this is where i felt splitted in two halfs,the characters are good and interesting but they're not used very well,let me explain what i mean:There are some characters that appear too much and others that need more screen time,and no don't tell me that it's because they're secondary characters.If you look the character page for this anime,you'll see that those i mean now are all main characters,not supporting,not secondary,but main.And by clinching what i said before there's a lot of mystery surrounding these characters,but most of the answers you will have about them,won't get answered.Just like the characters,there are some things that are explained too very well and other things that aren't explained at all.About the sound;The sound effects are very good and well placed but the soundtracks and music sometimes felt out of place.About the graphic;Animations are somewhat decent,the characters sometimes look weird but i think they're meant to look that wayOther things:Something that i didn't mention is the show is all about occult but in the end it loses all that fog of occult it has and drops down to some sort of sci-fi,it's not a problem but the gap between those two things doesn't feel really well separated.Conclusions:The anime despite what others might say it's enjoyable,but the beginning sadly is really awful,too fast paced and confusing,but it will pay off in the end. If you like mystery,sci-fi with a slice of horror and detective story. This is your anime,but don't get too caught because you might end up disappointed by the lack of explanations.Pro and Cons+Nice story with a great plot twist+Very nice cast...+Good sound effects+A nice slice of horror and mystery-Too short-...but not used very well-Awful beginning-Last episode isn't that great along with ending inside a cafè called Blue Moon,ran by a strange man called Kouhei Izumi.But one day Yuuta will get caught inside a nasty situation,and from that point the whole story will start.That's pretty much the initial plot without any spoiler.Now let's talk on how the story will develop without any spoiler,i will explain it in a 'technically' way.First of all the first episodes are very fast paced and i had a really terrible time to keep track of what's going on,till a point where i thought to just drop the anime.But i'm glad i didn't,i saw some people giving this anime a 2 or a 10,and i think that's wrong.There's a lot of good things in this anime as much as bad things,however now back to the story.The start felt very rushed and until the half of the anime you don't really get the idea of where the story is going,it's filled with a lot of mystery and i wanted to see what's really behind it,but i ended up getting a little disappointed on that,because i had a lot of answers but most of them weren't answered,the story has some really INTERESTING plot twists and it really surprised me how things turned out,and the best episodes are where this plot twists happen.I am confident that i'm a really smart person and i didn't see that coming,even if i noticed something was off.But after that everything takes another turn of events and becomes a little clichè,and loses all those points it acquired with the previous twist.

Unfortunately, while Occultic;Nine was able to keep me interested since episode one, it wasn't good enough to keep watching weekly and I fell behind a great deal. Having recently finished it, I'm glad that I took the time to return and watch it. It's not something to be heralded as one of the greatest anime and personally I didn't even feel as if it's something I'll be recommending to other people, but I did thoroughly enjoy parts of it. There were a lot of things I had...a problem with, but at the very least, the parts I enjoyed were enough to keep me going until I finished it.To get it out of the way at the beginning, I harbor a personal bias towards the art style that Occultic;Nine and other similar anime use. The overly dark tone of colors is one thing that I can get over, the the various points of view that are used to view the characters and especially the fish eyed effect that is used sometimes is just not something that I can get over. The anime isn't being shot with a camera, the different points of view aren't necessary and are really brought in when they're not need; e.g. when the cast is sitting in Blue Moon talking to each other and you as the audience is placed on the other side of the room, seeing nothing but them in a corner of the screen. The shading used for their noses, or lack thereof, was also something I didn't really appreciate, but at that point I guess I'm just being nit picky towards the artist's (or artists') art style. Other than the issues I've stated, the rest of the art throughout the series isn't something I had a problem with. It was consistent throughout it and fairly smooth. Brownie points for the important scenes being both well lit and lacking of ridiculous points of view.As far as the sounds go within the series, I don't have anything special to say about it. I'm not really the type of person to pay attention to the opening and ending songs, nor do I pay special attention to the music used within each individual episodes, so if it does stand out to me, I make sure to say something about it. In essence, the sound to the anime were fairly average.While some might love the variations in characters that came together in this show, I will not be one of those people. Individually the characters weren't special in much of any way and when they came together as a group, didn't offer anything to each other to get attached to any of them. The reason I watched Occultic;Nine was not for the characters, as I felt that their significance was simply to act out the story in the same way a hammer drives a nail. Sarai was fairly hard to swallow. Usually he was brusque, but was able to flip a switch at a moments notice to a different personality setting. Miyuu and Moritsuka were the easiest characters to like. Miyuu didn't give much of an opportunity to hate her either, to be fair, but she wasn't normal and nice. Moritsuka talked way too much, but at the same time, he was just interesting. The biggest problem I had with the characters was with Gamotan himself, our main character. He was whiney, but in the next scene he'd be confident, and he really had a hard time having his own personality, instead settling down to be all of them. He did his job as the main character, but it wasn't enjoyable to watch him make the journey from episode one to episode twelve.If there's any reason to watch this series, it's solely contained within the story itself. The events within the Occultic;Time world would take place without real connection to the main characters and they would be forced to play catch up. Over time it felt less as if the characters mattered, and more like they were just the group that got lucky enough to be the ones we'd be forced to watch. As I said above, the characters were more of a tool to act out the story. Every time you'd believe the characters were catching up and making progress, another event would be revealed that set them back and sent you reeling. The vast scale of the events kept me watching and the thought process of the people behind these events kept me interested. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the overall story. Each individual event was important and interesting, but the story as a whole didn't make much of an impact and the ending was lackluster to say the least.Overall, Occultic;Nine isn't something that I'll really every recommend to anyone unless I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel of the genre. The points of view were not enjoyable, the characters were annoying or plain at best, and the plot in its entirety wasn't that entertaining. Watching the show is pretty much just done to see it all play out step-by-step, which is what made it interesting at all.TL;DR: If you don't have anything else for the genre, watch it.

Otherwise, don't bother."", '*Reposting after original review was taken down*Ok I\'ll do everyone a favour and say that if you are a slow reader or if you don\'t like fast paced shows, DO NOT WATCH OCCULTIC;NINE. THIS SHOW DOES NOT GIVE A DAMN WHETHER YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH WHAT\'S HAPPENING.*ahem*If I were to describe Occultic;Nine in one word, it would be ""convoluted"". And don\'t get me wrong, for me that\'s not really a bad thing. It\'s just that there are so many things going on that it is VERY easy to get confused while watching it, the lightning fast pacing didn\'t help either. While this threw off...a lot of people on it’s first episode, making them drop the show, it actually intrigued me with it’s complex storytelling and mystery aspect.Story:As I said before, O;9 is convoluted in terms of storytelling and that’s basically because of the fact that the story (especially in the first half of the show) keeps introducing plot point after plot point after plot point. This makes the show seems really mysterious and makes you want to know what happens next and how all these things being introduced are connected with each other buuuuut the downside to this is that it leaves the story very messy and it leaves very little time for the show to explain the mysteries set up in previous episodes. Like I\'m pretty sure that the main mysteries and plot points were only started being cleared up/explained in episode 8-9 and forward, leaving only 3 episodes or so to conclude everything. AND IT BARELY SUCCEEDS by rushing everything into those last few episodes. This brings me to my next major problem with the show, the pacing.I think Occultic;Nine has the most inconsistence pacing of any show I\'ve watched. One episode it\'s extremely fast, next it\'s continuing at a more bearable but still fast speed, then it returns to it\'s original extreme speed, then it starts to slow down to a ""normal"" speed over a few episodes and eventually just doesn\'t care anymore and becomes like 5x times faster than it was at the start (ok that might be an exaggeration but you get what I mean). The plot\'s already difficult to understand by itself but O;9\'s fast pacing just brings a whole level of difficulty. You\'ll more often than not find yourself having to pausing and rewinding some episodes to re-read some lines of dialogue or exposition you missed or just couldn\'t understand.You could just tell that the staff behind the show knew that they couldn\'t possibly fit the entire story properly into 12 episodes, so they decided to just cram in as much as they could into certain episodes.But despite how much I criticised the introduction of many plot points and the pacing, I still have give props to the story for exploring the occult from a scientific perspective. The sci-fi aspect was definitely well written and for the most part believable and was certainly quite interesting. There were some aspects of the sci-fi element that weren\'t explained well enough but I understand the show was tight with screen time so the staff couldn\'t but as long as you have a basic understanding of the scientific mechanics in this show, you\'ll probably won\'t mind.6.5-7/10, for the story i guess, but would\'ve given an 8/10 for the actual plot if I looked past the pacing.Art and Sound:The overall aesthetic of the show is gorgeous, to say the least. I actually would’ve never expected this type of art style from A-1 Pictures, maybe from SHAFT but never A-1. I loved the weird camera angles, lighting effects, character designs (except for the walking breasts) and especially the backgrounds. The artwork is colourful, imaginative and can be very disturbing when it needs to be. My only main complaints would be the messy line art, which isn’t really that noticeable anyways and the way the character’s noses are drawn.As for the sound, it’s pretty good. The voice acting isn’t really anything special, most of the voice actors fit their characters, except Ryotas’ voice, I just find it really annoying for some reason. And can I just applaud some of the voice actor’s for being able to talk so fast, like goddamn.The opening song is amazing as expected of Kanako Itou &lt;3 and the ending song is great as well. The background music is less notable. There are some instances where the BGM does not match the mood with what\'s happening on screen, for example there might be an upbeat rock track playing over an emotional or messed up scene *coughcoughepisode1&amp;12coughcough*. But there\'s also other times where the BGM and sound effects really excels in matching and adding to the atmosphere of a scene *coughcoughepisode9*. The show\'s quite polarising with the effectiveness of the sound.8.5/10 for the art7-ish/10 for the soundCharacters:As many of you would’ve figured out just from the title, Occultic;NINE, features NINE protagonists, each with their own unique design and personalities. O;N’s cast personalities is like a spectrum ranging from the abnormally hyperactive to the enigmatically creepy, you’re probably gonna hate some and love some.My main issue with the characters are that some of them just fail to make a presence in the show and are extremely forgettable because they don\'t get enough screen time and unfortunately that was the case for Kusakabe, Aria and Ririka (and that one albino kid lol). Yeah, they look interesting and all that and probably have more to them than just being creepy and mysterious but the show doesn\'t ever explore that other side to them enough to ever make you care about or remember them. They were relevant for like 2 or 3 things for the plot and then were just complete brushed aside. Again, this was the consequence of trying to fit a story that could easily cover 20+ episodes into 12 episodes instead, something had to be sacrificed.As for the main group of MCs (Gamon, Ryouka, Sarai, Miyuu and Touko), they all received at least decent development so I had some emotional attachment to them but sometimes their interactions can be so hyper and high-strung it might make them annoying to watch instead.6/10 for CharactersOverall:basically a tl;dr-Occultic;Nine is a show with pretty visuals, a mysterious atmosphere and an interesting plot that leaves you wanting to know what happens next every episode but the show\'s abnormal pacing and it\'s 1-cour airing time ultimately leads to it being very rushed in certain episodes. Combine the pacing with rapid-fire dialogue and some exposition dumps and you\'ll be left with a very hard-to-follow show. Also as a result of the pacing, the show has to sacrifice precious screen time, that could\'ve been used for developing characters or explaining certain sci-fi mechanics, so that it could just barely fit the entirety of the plot into 12 episodes. (but honestly it\'s a feat itself that A-1 could even fit everything).O;9 is a very hit or miss show but if you do decide to watch it, then I recommend watching up to episode 3 before deciding to continue or drop.Overall score: 7.2/10Anyways thanks for reading this review and hope it wasn\'t too painful to read lol.Peace out! a lot of people on it’s first episode, making them drop the show, it actually intrigued me with it’s complex storytelling and mystery aspect.Story:As I said before, O;9 is convoluted in terms of storytelling and that’s basically because of the fact that the story (especially in the first half of the show) keeps introducing plot point after plot point after plot point.

Spoilers ahead!)The semicolon gets a bad rap.Most day-to-day people never use them in today’s world of simplified, text-driven messages. They also look a little funky. (I mean, let’s be honest, a period on top of a comma? Get out of here.) Even Kurt Vonnegut, the beloved and creative author of stories such as Cat’s Cradle, is quoted as saying (with hyperbole and slightly out of context), “All they do is show you’ve been to college.”He later goes on to say about his rule of never using them that “Rules only take us so far, even good...ones.” With this thought in mind, I’ll provide the rule that I was taught which made me into a semicolon expert: Semicolons connect equal grammatical units. To go even simpler, think of the semicolon as an equals sign. That’s it. So long as one remembers this rule, the semicolon should be yet another tool in thy writer’s arsenal.I like semicolons; they’re very fun to use. I don’t like Occultic;Nine; its semicolon doesn’t do it for me.STORYOccultic;Nine follows Gamon, a NEET, blog-running high-school teenager who wants to gain money through trouncing the ghostly and the magical. His “minion,” Ryo-tas, dances whimsically nearby. And, when a mysterious murder drags him and others into a series of strange events, his life becomes an unexpectedly, otherworldly predicament.Although “becomes” may be the wrong phrase. “Careens towards” is more fitting since the anime makes it its mission to go full-throttle from the get-go.The first episode blazes past the audience so quickly, it makes them wonder if they actually saw anything at all. It crams characters and events and premises and concepts and more characters and ideas and content and even more characters into a single episode. About as much as it could conceivably handle in twenty-some minutes. While it arguably leaves a negative first impression since proper pacing has essentially been stomped into the ground, the onslaught of information does pique one’s interest.But that’s just the start, for the anime doesn’t. Slow. Down.The remaining episodes do not reach the breakneck speed of the opener, but they follow the same negative charge. Explanations on pseudoscience throw jargon together. Connections between events flail about with flimsy relevance. Plot points refuse to rest long enough to earn their appreciation.The most abrasive example is the characters and their conversations. They don’t speak so fast that it’s impossible to follow along with what they are saying, but they talk just fast enough to make their delivery and responses seem unnatural. Listen to the men of the Society of Eight Gods of Fortune cult. Either their lines are recorded on a tape recorder and slightly sped up or they are all robots with inhuman reactions. Their talks, especially when the blue-suit man gets involved, don’t wait for anybody.Not to say that a speedy presentation is inherently bad. It’s not. But, in Occultic;Nine’s case, the speed not only adds an extra layer of unnecessary confusion but also fails to serve a higher purpose. That is, it’s fast for the sake of being fast and not much else.One can argue that the overly quick presentation does, in fact, hold a thematic purpose. Gamon and the others become astral bodies. As is explained, their ghostly forms exist in a realm where time moves at an increased rate (one day equals one minute to be precise). Sadly, this quickness not only (obviously) exists within the first episode but also in every episode – including those when they were still alive. Plus, there’s that Fortune cult that houses not ghosts but rich dudes. In other words, the anime was unnecessarily quick regardless of the context, rendering this argument moot.Looking at the content more closely, Occultic;Nine is essentially a twelve-episode exposition dump. It has the occasional tooth pull here or evil-café-owner skirmish there, but the show prioritizes the characters explaining their situation and what to do next at almost every turn. Even during the albino child’s coercion of Myuu, which should be a tense scene, the show falls back on him talking and talking and talking before a scuffle finally breaks out.The albino child’s conflict also brings to light yet another problem for Occultic;Nine: bogus plotlines. Him and his kotoribakos? He sits in jail, and his boxes continue to rot. The female-doujin author? She draws a bunch intermittently throughout the season, but, in the end, she literally vanishes without doing anything. Gamon “losing” the golden tooth-key? Just materialize it out of nothingness.Many events also tread into “just so happens” territory. Nikola Tesla “just so happens” to have an illegitimate daughter. Kiryuu, Aria’s “devil,” needed surgery to save his brain, and it “just so happens” that Aria’s brother died the same day. Kisaki, a female police officer with psychometry who shows up after half the season is over, “just so happens” to enter a taxi whose driver is friends with the former proprietor of the café where the gang all hang out.Again, to be fair, maybe that’s the point. That, like the occult, the audience must accept certain happenings as less magical and more coincidental. Unfortunately for Occultic;Nine, the show itself is not a ghostly figure. Rather, it’s a real anime with real writing and real story beats that have real problems in their narrative construction.Occultic;Nine does introduce the concept of living. I.e., whether the physical body or the spiritual entity constitutes a state of self. However, it doesn’t exactly challenge the idea. For its less about this philosophical pondering and more about the properties of scandium.The anime does end on a surprisingly bittersweet, possibly dark note, and it even alludes to there being more to this story than lets on thanks to an after-credits scene. But, having reached the finale and finally stopping, the show still finishes in last place despite how fast it moved.ANIMATIONOccultic;Nine’s obsession with speed turns into obsession of a different kind with its art and its animation. Unlike the quick presentation and the abundant exposition, though, its obsession with style stands as a positive.The anime’s actual animation remains consistent in quality, but its higher claim to fame comes in its artistry. For its backgrounds and locales, the show adopts an interesting look centered on overly realistic depictions. A café filled with mood lighting, extra tables, and a full-service bar. An office space packed with messy desks and doodads. The radio station and its technology.The anime evidently goes out of its way to make the setting much more real in its delivery. Its character designs do the same. Granted, Ryo-tas’s comically large, mountain-sized breasts and some of their half-drawn circle noses argue that, no, their designs move away from realism.But their subtle details mixed with their plainness keep them grounded. Shun’s overcoat uses a striped pattern. Touko wears glasses, she puts her hair in a ponytail while separating her bangs, and her clothes’ collar has this ornate design with an added ribbon. Aria wears a fur-lined red shawl with a brown blouse underneath, and her wooden platform shoes and leg tights are likewise colored red and brown, one color for each side.Occultic;Nine also employs other oddities for their designs. A lot of extra creases in their clothes and contours for their faces add differing degrees of shadow that make their looks both pop and emit more of that realism.The most interesting oddity, though, is the line work. While not scribbled, the outlines for the characters can sometimes be (using a cliché in a literal sense) rough around the edges. It’s only slightly, but these lines can have a noticeable jaggedness, a lack of rigidity in their formation. This aesthetic once again adds to the realism since the roughness helps them to mix with the hyper-realistic background art.This drive for realism lends itself well to the anime’s main motif. In other words, while the characters are unsure of what’s actually happened and what’s in fact make-believe, Occultic;Nine paints itself as realistic as possible while still maintaining its own style.Yet the anime’s strongest visual element has yet to be brought up. Arguably, it’s the show’s best trait period. This trait? Cinematic flair.Just as Occultic;Nine obsesses over its backgrounds and design details, it also obsesses over how many different techniques it can incorporate throughout its run. For instance, it loves to play with the angle of its shots. From crooked to birds-eye, from looking up to completely sideways, the anime constantly flips around its camera to its liking.That’s easy, though. Indeed, the anime goes much further with its techniques. Take episode ten. As Ryo-tas reveals her identity to Gamon, her head gets huge, taking up the whole left side of the screen as Gamon remains regularly sized on the right, imposing a sense of intimidation. Or take episode six. As Shun questions Aria at her residence, the camera spins and spins until Shun chooses to spook the audience after moving a lot closer towards the screen on the final rotation.One of the coolest moves, though, comes from episode nine. Myuu receives a message from the friend who she thought died, so she rushes to the location. Once there, a secret tunnel opens, and she heads down it. At this point, the anime takes on a first-person perspective. Myuu steadily moves down the hallway as she (and the audience) look around at the green, concrete walls, the creepy lighting illuminating her path. (Her heavy breathing and the spooky sounds up the scariness.)There’s still an all-important question that needs answering: Why? Why does Occultic;Nine go overboard with its cinematic techniques? Yes, they are no doubt interesting, but what purpose does angling the shot or spinning the camera serve in this instance?It all comes from the content of the show itself. Namely, the gross amount of exposition. With the characters doing nothing but holding conversations, the anime is inherently forced to use excessive cinematic flair to mask the dullness permeating their talks.This flair certainly impresses, but, at times, it can be distracting. All the flipping and the perspectives and the orientations nearly detract from the story as the show places more and more focus on the presentation and less and less focus on what’s actually being presented.Thus, like the overall physical-versus-spiritual motif, the anime enters a paradox. The distracting cinematic direction gets in the way of the boring exposition, but the boring exposition requires the distracting cinematic direction.Granted, this distraction is a welcome one since the content is often in dire straits. Plus, given that the anime at least goes this route, does all that it can to make its visuals as engaging an experience as possible, it deserves praise first and foremost.CHARACTERSOccultic;Nine involves roughly seven main players from the 256 Incident: Sarai, Touko, Aria, Kisaki, Shun, Gamon, and Ryo-tas. Unfortunately, the anime’s penchant for speed negatively affects the importance and the impact of its characters.For example, Sarai is the son of Professor Hashigami. Genetically, it makes sense that he’s a smart kid. But that’s it. That’s most of his character. He happens to have esoteric knowledge which he uses at nearly every convenient moment. From solving the secret codes attached to the victim’s names to explaining the warping of time between the physical and spiritual realms, he exists within the show not as a vital actor but rather as a crux that the story needed. Lest it proceed nowhere.Touko is arguably worse. Where Sarai at least contributes his smarts, she contributes almost nothing. The anime doesn’t go into her background, and she sits about, occasionally chiming in to remind the audience of her presence. In essence, she could be removed from Occultic;Nine altogether without affecting the story to any noticeable extent.Aria receives a lot of attention early on. Indeed, half of episode two dedicates itself to showcasing her backstory. The bullying and creepiness she endured, and the older brother who supported her wholeheartedly. Most importantly, it also highlights her psychosis in how she, unbeknownst to her, lived with her deceased sibling’s corpse for an entire year.As the season moves forward, however, the audience sees less and less of Aria as she becomes increasingly irrelevant. While Gamon and the others discuss what’s really going on, Aria sits in her dark room, mumbling about her brother and failing to have a stake in the narrative. Come the end, she doesn’t get shot by the ray gun, meaning she remains a spirit with her “brother,” but it only reinforces the notion that she is inconsequential to the story.Aria went through a lot of trauma in the past, and Myuu goes through a lot herself in the present. She becomes incredibly depressed after learning that the evil albino kid murdered her good friend. Her conflict, though, doesn’t have the emotional weight needed since the relationship with said friend was given as a quick set of scenes involving head pats, blurry pictures, and birds.Kisaki arrives rather late into the season (officially in episode seven) as Shun’s replacement. She’s technically not as important of a character as the others, but Occultic;Nine fumbles with her as well. She receives one meager flashback that lasts no more than several seconds, showcasing the ridicule from those around her and highlighting the reason why she has feelings for Shun in the first place (since he was apparently the only one to be kind to her).For Shun himself, he likewise doesn’t have much going for him. Again, he’s not as important as someone like Gamon or Ryo-tas, so it’s not necessary to give him a grand character arc or a dramatic backstory. Indeed, he’s one of the only characters who is adequately balanced in terms of importance and impact in that he actively takes part in seeking out clues and piecing this puzzle together while avoiding unnecessary attempts to flesh him out.As for Gamon and Ryo-tas, they don’t have the right execution befitting their characters.Gamon is a self-proclaimed anti-social blogger who simply wants to make money. He gets roped into all these events, succumbing to fits of paranoia, fear, and confusion. He tries to make sense of the situation, but, the more he learns, the more he falls back into those three feelings – again and again.Consequently, Gamon, despite his main-protagonist moniker, floats along for most of the season, lamenting the position he never asked for let alone wanted. As such, he’s not a very interesting character, and the audience cannot even call him the lens with which they view this world since many of the other characters manage to unveil more than he ever did or could.He at least has a redeeming moment near the end of the season. The cast want to go back to being alive, but they also need to foil the Fortune cult’s plans. Gamon volunteers to risk his (physical) life, opting to perform the final act and saving the others in the process. That is, he overcomes his paranoia and fear and confusion through the bravest feat imaginable.Ryo-tas is, in comparison, weirdly hyper all the time. She also carries a curious gun that seems like it comes right out of an old-timey alien movie. Alongside hints that she is perhaps hiding something, the audience questions this façade she appears to be putting on. Indeed, the anime later reveals who she really is: “My true identity is the astral body possessing Ryoka Narusawa’s body, Aveline Narusawa Tesla.”This reveal isn’t super game-changing since there wasn’t much to build up to it on a narrative level. Even afterwards, it doesn’t make much of a difference. She also does a whole lot of nothing throughout the season besides impersonating Ryoka. To her credit, she at least guided Gamon by also pretending to be someone named Zoko, the voice from Gamon’s hand radio. So, she wasn’t as worthless as some of the other characters.Between the lot, a possible throughput on fathers exists. Gamon’s backstory involves his father, Sarai’s father’s death starts the whole debacle, Myuu pleads to her father when called out on her fortune-telling powers, and Ryo-tas’s father is the famous Nikola Tesla whose theory forms the basis for the supernatural occurrences.Unfortunately, the anime not only doesn’t have this throughput for all its major characters (Touko, Aria, Kisaki, and Shun have nothing specifically about fathers) but also doesn’t try to explore this connection further. Gamon’s radio and his childhood revolve around his father, but it’s never a pivotal character trait. Sarai somewhat comes to terms with his father’s choices, but a clear resolution does not come about. Myuu never mentions her father again. And Ryo-tas (i.e., Aveline) isn’t given any flashbacks with Nikola.Thus far, the characters of Occultic;Nine have been overwhelmingly subpar. That’s not wholly their fault, for they are at the mercy of the story. Since the plot requires so much extra information and involves a lot of content without much substance, they lack the attention and therefore strength that they arguably deserve.Despite these woes, the anime at least gives them all a higher role to serve.Sarai voices dissent. He continually tries to view their situation from a logical standpoint rather than outright accepting that their predicament derives from otherworldly sources.Touko is the normal one of the group. She’s not the smartypants, the black-magic girl, the fortune teller, the psychometry user, the detective, the otaku, or the seventy-year-old astral spirit. She normalizes the group given how quirky the rest tend to be.Aria represents the accepter of their situation. Where the others wish to come back to life, she’s perfectly content with remaining on the spiritual side. An ending she receives since Gamon (presumably) never shot her with the special ray gun.Myuu gets the unfortunate position of “it can happen to anybody.” Someone as kind and as famous as her, with foresight powers too, receives the same treatment as the others.Kisaki’s convenient psychic ability enables her to follow the trail left by the others as they themselves try to fix their predicament.Shun acts as the revealer. When the audience wonders about certain events or directions, he manages to find the info through his investigation skills.Gamon demonstrates how most regular people would react if placed in the same spot. Yanking teeth, getting attacked by a gargoyle demon, seeing one’s own dead body. His emotions may make him a nonexistent player for most of the tale, but they are justified.Ryo-tas distracts the audience from the truth (through her strange behavior), provides a connection (however feeble) to the Fortune-cult plotline, and guides the rest of the cast along (but really mostly Gamon).This character writing is arguably common, maybe even expected, for a show aiming at mixing together a large cast. But, given how the characters are meager at best and forgetful at worst, their personalized roles within the story at large earns them all a stronger sense of place within Occultic;Nine. A much-needed writing buff that keeps them from the depths of complete character catastrophe.SOUNDDespite how loud the characters tend to be, the voice actors and actresses performing those roles nail them. Yuki Kaji as Gamon screams and cries without shame. Ayane Sakura as Ryo-tas speaks with a high-pitched voice as she ribbits, and she switches into peeved speech when giving orders (under disguise) to Gamon himself. And Kenjirou Tsuda as Kouhei Izumi, the café owner and the unknown villain, uses an effeminate voice that fits the flamboyant murderer quite well. (An extra shout-out goes to Shizuka Itou as Touko for her “Ascension…” reaction.)Listening to the opening track and the ending track, they come out about even.For the ED, its tone has this hopeful yet melancholic sound that it blends together through strong singing, background vocals, and a charged techno foundation. The instrumentals and the beat itself are a bit uninspired, and the English lyrics don’t always hit their mark (especially when they conveniently skip the number eight in their count). But its ability to sync up with the preview visuals, to give them a better sense of urgency, made for a small treat at the end of each episode.For the OP, it gets at some spookiness as it starts with ominous echoes and a set of background vocalists all its own. The middle section is filled with cool guitar chords and a steady drum beat, but they aren’t as powerful as the main vocalist and the off-kilter feeling. Its abrupt stop also gives it an edge since it fits the spooky approach.Neither the ED nor the OP stand out as very strong pieces, and the same goes for the rest of the music. It does have a lot of variety, though. Playful and jazzy. Energized and guitar-laden. Moderately paced and plucked. Violin and claps. Techno and more techno. Nothing major, but, just as the art aims for visual variety through its different techniques, the OST aims for musical mixing through its different pieces. Although these tracks lack the finesse that the techniques bring with ease.ENJOYMENTI was liking the anime’s dark atmosphere early on. The murder of Sarai’s father and Aria’s twisted lifestyle made for quite the grim setup. And the death of all the characters and the demented blood boxes (kotoribakos) shaded the atmosphere with even more darkness.Yet these shadows couldn’t stop me from constantly shaking my head.The characters are annoying. Gamon never stops yelling and being overly obnoxious in all that he does. Ryo-tas isn’t being cute but instead aggravating in her ditzy behavior. Sarai refuses to accept all that’s happening around him despite personally witnessing numerous pieces of evidence. Myuu walks herself into the most obvious trap possible. Aria and Touko just sit around.Shun is perhaps the only character I tolerate. He at least tries to have fun and brings some spark to the anime that isn’t bent on being annoying. But he wasn’t always around, and he was semi-infallible (infallibility being a trait I absolutely loathe). So, he wasn’t that welcomed, either.I also wasn’t a fan of much of the story itself. The 256 Incident didn’t make for involved drama. The whole mutual recognition plot convenience was very lame. The albino-kid plotline was pointless. Their conversations were generally dull, uneventful, or both. The Fortune cult was so disjointed from everything else, it didn’t make for a compelling conflict.The things that I do like in the anime – Kisaki’s “screenings” of the thoughts she reads, the actual (loose) science backing the plot – are sadly quashed by the immense amount of annoying, boring, or otherwise grating material that this show so regularly offers.Occultic;Nine has visuals that deserve praise and music that passes. Unfortunately, the core of this tale contains more problems than its title can count. The narrative strings together as this wobbly, worthless mess. The characters, inevitably pulled along, don’t have much impact beyond their singular roles. And the anime simply does almost nothing of interest for its entire run. The show drowns; it doesn’t resurface.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, an overabundance of speed, exposition, and convenience leave the narrative gasping for breath when it eventually crosses the finish lineAnimation: Great, overly realistic background art, subtle stylistic choices for the character designs, and a wide array of cinematic techniques make for an engaging visual experienceCharacters: Bad, Gamon, Ryo-tas, and the other members of this large cast lack importance and impact throughout this tale, but they at least have particular roles to serveSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay OST, and good VA performancesEnjoyment: Terrible, too annoying and too uneventfulFinal Score: 3/10 ones.” With this thought in mind, I’ll provide the rule that I was taught which made me into a semicolon expert: Semicolons connect equal grammatical units. To go even simpler, think of the semicolon as an equals sign. That’s it. So long as one remembers this rule, the semicolon should be yet another tool in thy writer’s arsenal.I like semicolons; they’re very fun to use.

While not scribbled, the outlines for the characters can sometimes be (using a cliché in a literal sense) rough around the edges. It’s only slightly, but these lines can have a noticeable jaggedness, a lack of rigidity in their formation. This aesthetic once again adds to the realism since the roughness helps them to mix with the hyper-realistic background art.This drive for realism lends itself well to the anime’s main motif. In other words, while the characters are unsure of what’s actually happened and what’s in fact make-believe, Occultic;Nine paints itself as realistic as possible while still maintaining its own style.Yet the anime’s strongest visual element has yet to be brought up. Arguably, it’s the show’s best trait period. This trait? Cinematic flair.Just as Occultic;Nine obsesses over its backgrounds and design details, it also obsesses over how many different techniques it can incorporate throughout its run. For instance, it loves to play with the angle of its shots. From crooked to birds-eye, from looking up to completely sideways, the anime constantly flips around its camera to its liking.That’s easy, though. Indeed, the anime goes much further with its techniques. Take episode ten. As Ryo-tas reveals her identity to Gamon, her head gets huge, taking up the whole left side of the screen as Gamon remains regularly sized on the right, imposing a sense of intimidation. Or take episode six. As Shun questions Aria at her residence, the camera spins and spins until Shun chooses to spook the audience after moving a lot closer towards the screen on the final rotation.One of the coolest moves, though, comes from episode nine. Myuu receives a message from the friend who she thought died, so she rushes to the location. Once there, a secret tunnel opens, and she heads down it. At this point, the anime takes on a first-person perspective. Myuu steadily moves down the hallway as she (and the audience) look around at the green, concrete walls, the creepy lighting illuminating her path. (Her heavy breathing and the spooky sounds up the scariness.)There’s still an all-important question that needs answering: Why? Why does Occultic;Nine go overboard with its cinematic techniques? Yes, they are no doubt interesting, but what purpose does angling the shot or spinning the camera serve in this instance?It all comes from the content of the show itself. Namely, the gross amount of exposition. With the characters doing nothing but holding conversations, the anime is inherently forced to use excessive cinematic flair to mask the dullness permeating their talks.This flair certainly impresses, but, at times, it can be distracting. All the flipping and the perspectives and the orientations nearly detract from the story as the show places more and more focus on the presentation and less and less focus on what’s actually being presented.Thus, like the overall physical-versus-spiritual motif, the anime enters a paradox. The distracting cinematic direction gets in the way of the boring exposition, but the boring exposition requires the distracting cinematic direction.Granted, this distraction is a welcome one since the content is often in dire straits. Plus, given that the anime at least goes this route, does all that it can to make its visuals as engaging an experience as possible, it deserves praise first and foremost.CHARACTERSOccultic;Nine involves roughly seven main players from the 256 Incident: Sarai, Touko, Aria, Kisaki, Shun, Gamon, and Ryo-tas. Unfortunately, the anime’s penchant for speed negatively affects the importance and the impact of its characters.For example, Sarai is the son of Professor Hashigami. Genetically, it makes sense that he’s a smart kid. But that’s it. That’s most of his character. He happens to have esoteric knowledge which he uses at nearly every convenient moment. From solving the secret codes attached to the victim’s names to explaining the warping of time between the physical and spiritual realms, he exists within the show not as a vital actor but rather as a crux that the story needed. Lest it proceed nowhere.Touko is arguably worse. Where Sarai at least contributes his smarts, she contributes almost nothing. The anime doesn’t go into her background, and she sits about, occasionally chiming in to remind the audience of her presence. In essence, she could be removed from Occultic;Nine altogether without affecting the story to any noticeable extent.Aria receives a lot of attention early on. Indeed, half of episode two dedicates itself to showcasing her backstory. The bullying and creepiness she endured, and the older brother who supported her wholeheartedly. Most importantly, it also highlights her psychosis in how she, unbeknownst to her, lived with her deceased sibling’s corpse for an entire year.As the season moves forward, however, the audience sees less and less of Aria as she becomes increasingly irrelevant. While Gamon and the others discuss what’s really going on, Aria sits in her dark room, mumbling about her brother and failing to have a stake in the narrative. Come the end, she doesn’t get shot by the ray gun, meaning she remains a spirit with her “brother,” but it only reinforces the notion that she is inconsequential to the story.Aria went through a lot of trauma in the past, and Myuu goes through a lot herself in the present. She becomes incredibly depressed after learning that the evil albino kid murdered her good friend. Her conflict, though, doesn’t have the emotional weight needed since the relationship with said friend was given as a quick set of scenes involving head pats, blurry pictures, and birds.Kisaki arrives rather late into the season (officially in episode seven) as Shun’s replacement. She’s technically not as important of a character as the others, but Occultic;Nine fumbles with her as well. She receives one meager flashback that lasts no more than several seconds, showcasing the ridicule from those around her and highlighting the reason why she has feelings for Shun in the first place (since he was apparently the only one to be kind to her).For Shun himself, he likewise doesn’t have much going for him. Again, he’s not as important as someone like Gamon or Ryo-tas, so it’s not necessary to give him a grand character arc or a dramatic backstory. Indeed, he’s one of the only characters who is adequately balanced in terms of importance and impact in that he actively takes part in seeking out clues and piecing this puzzle together while avoiding unnecessary attempts to flesh him out.As for Gamon and Ryo-tas, they don’t have the right execution befitting their characters.Gamon is a self-proclaimed anti-social blogger who simply wants to make money. He gets roped into all these events, succumbing to fits of paranoia, fear, and confusion. He tries to make sense of the situation, but, the more he learns, the more he falls back into those three feelings – again and again.Consequently, Gamon, despite his main-protagonist moniker, floats along for most of the season, lamenting the position he never asked for let alone wanted. As such, he’s not a very interesting character, and the audience cannot even call him the lens with which they view this world since many of the other characters manage to unveil more than he ever did or could.He at least has a redeeming moment near the end of the season. The cast want to go back to being alive, but they also need to foil the Fortune cult’s plans. Gamon volunteers to risk his (physical) life, opting to perform the final act and saving the others in the process. That is, he overcomes his paranoia and fear and confusion through the bravest feat imaginable.Ryo-tas is, in comparison, weirdly hyper all the time. She also carries a curious gun that seems like it comes right out of an old-timey alien movie. Alongside hints that she is perhaps hiding something, the audience questions this façade she appears to be putting on. Indeed, the anime later reveals who she really is: “My true identity is the astral body possessing Ryoka Narusawa’s body, Aveline Narusawa Tesla.”This reveal isn’t super game-changing since there wasn’t much to build up to it on a narrative level. Even afterwards, it doesn’t make much of a difference. She also does a whole lot of nothing throughout the season besides impersonating Ryoka. To her credit, she at least guided Gamon by also pretending to be someone named Zoko, the voice from Gamon’s hand radio. So, she wasn’t as worthless as some of the other characters.Between the lot, a possible throughput on fathers exists. Gamon’s backstory involves his father, Sarai’s father’s death starts the whole debacle, Myuu pleads to her father when called out on her fortune-telling powers, and Ryo-tas’s father is the famous Nikola Tesla whose theory forms the basis for the supernatural occurrences.Unfortunately, the anime not only doesn’t have this throughput for all its major characters (Touko, Aria, Kisaki, and Shun have nothing specifically about fathers) but also doesn’t try to explore this connection further. Gamon’s radio and his childhood revolve around his father, but it’s never a pivotal character trait. Sarai somewhat comes to terms with his father’s choices, but a clear resolution does not come about. Myuu never mentions her father again. And Ryo-tas (i.e., Aveline) isn’t given any flashbacks with Nikola.Thus far, the characters of Occultic;Nine have been overwhelmingly subpar. That’s not wholly their fault, for they are at the mercy of the story. Since the plot requires so much extra information and involves a lot of content without much substance, they lack the attention and therefore strength that they arguably deserve.Despite these woes, the anime at least gives them all a higher role to serve.Sarai voices dissent. He continually tries to view their situation from a logical standpoint rather than outright accepting that their predicament derives from otherworldly sources.Touko is the normal one of the group. She’s not the smartypants, the black-magic girl, the fortune teller, the psychometry user, the detective, the otaku, or the seventy-year-old astral spirit. She normalizes the group given how quirky the rest tend to be.Aria represents the accepter of their situation. Where the others wish to come back to life, she’s perfectly content with remaining on the spiritual side. An ending she receives since Gamon (presumably) never shot her with the special ray gun.Myuu gets the unfortunate position of “it can happen to anybody.” Someone as kind and as famous as her, with foresight powers too, receives the same treatment as the others.Kisaki’s convenient psychic ability enables her to follow the trail left by the others as they themselves try to fix their predicament.Shun acts as the revealer. When the audience wonders about certain events or directions, he manages to find the info through his investigation skills.Gamon demonstrates how most regular people would react if placed in the same spot. Yanking teeth, getting attacked by a gargoyle demon, seeing one’s own dead body. His emotions may make him a nonexistent player for most of the tale, but they are justified.Ryo-tas distracts the audience from the truth (through her strange behavior), provides a connection (however feeble) to the Fortune-cult plotline, and guides the rest of the cast along (but really mostly Gamon).This character writing is arguably common, maybe even expected, for a show aiming at mixing together a large cast. But, given how the characters are meager at best and forgetful at worst, their personalized roles within the story at large earns them all a stronger sense of place within Occultic;Nine. A much-needed writing buff that keeps them from the depths of complete character catastrophe.SOUNDDespite how loud the characters tend to be, the voice actors and actresses performing those roles nail them. Yuki Kaji as Gamon screams and cries without shame. Ayane Sakura as Ryo-tas speaks with a high-pitched voice as she ribbits, and she switches into peeved speech when giving orders (under disguise) to Gamon himself. And Kenjirou Tsuda as Kouhei Izumi, the café owner and the unknown villain, uses an effeminate voice that fits the flamboyant murderer quite well. (An extra shout-out goes to Shizuka Itou as Touko for her “Ascension…” reaction.)Listening to the opening track and the ending track, they come out about even.For the ED, its tone has this hopeful yet melancholic sound that it blends together through strong singing, background vocals, and a charged techno foundation. The instrumentals and the beat itself are a bit uninspired, and the English lyrics don’t always hit their mark (especially when they conveniently skip the number eight in their count). But its ability to sync up with the preview visuals, to give them a better sense of urgency, made for a small treat at the end of each episode.For the OP, it gets at some spookiness as it starts with ominous echoes and a set of background vocalists all its own. The middle section is filled with cool guitar chords and a steady drum beat, but they aren’t as powerful as the main vocalist and the off-kilter feeling. Its abrupt stop also gives it an edge since it fits the spooky approach.Neither the ED nor the OP stand out as very strong pieces, and the same goes for the rest of the music. It does have a lot of variety, though. Playful and jazzy. Energized and guitar-laden. Moderately paced and plucked. Violin and claps. Techno and more techno. Nothing major, but, just as the art aims for visual variety through its different techniques, the OST aims for musical mixing through its different pieces. Although these tracks lack the finesse that the techniques bring with ease.ENJOYMENTI was liking the anime’s dark atmosphere early on. The murder of Sarai’s father and Aria’s twisted lifestyle made for quite the grim setup. And the death of all the characters and the demented blood boxes (kotoribakos) shaded the atmosphere with even more darkness.Yet these shadows couldn’t stop me from constantly shaking my head.The characters are annoying. Gamon never stops yelling and being overly obnoxious in all that he does. Ryo-tas isn’t being cute but instead aggravating in her ditzy behavior. Sarai refuses to accept all that’s happening around him despite personally witnessing numerous pieces of evidence. Myuu walks herself into the most obvious trap possible. Aria and Touko just sit around.Shun is perhaps the only character I tolerate. He at least tries to have fun and brings some spark to the anime that isn’t bent on being annoying. But he wasn’t always around, and he was semi-infallible (infallibility being a trait I absolutely loathe). So, he wasn’t that welcomed, either.I also wasn’t a fan of much of the story itself. The 256 Incident didn’t make for involved drama. The whole mutual recognition plot convenience was very lame. The albino-kid plotline was pointless. Their conversations were generally dull, uneventful, or both. The Fortune cult was so disjointed from everything else, it didn’t make for a compelling conflict.The things that I do like in the anime – Kisaki’s “screenings” of the thoughts she reads, the actual (loose) science backing the plot – are sadly quashed by the immense amount of annoying, boring, or otherwise grating material that this show so regularly offers.Occultic;Nine has visuals that deserve praise and music that passes. Unfortunately, the core of this tale contains more problems than its title can count. The narrative strings together as this wobbly, worthless mess. The characters, inevitably pulled along, don’t have much impact beyond their singular roles. And the anime simply does almost nothing of interest for its entire run. The show drowns; it doesn’t resurface.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, an overabundance of speed, exposition, and convenience leave the narrative gasping for breath when it eventually crosses the finish lineAnimation: Great, overly realistic background art, subtle stylistic choices for the character designs, and a wide array of cinematic techniques make for an engaging visual experienceCharacters: Bad, Gamon, Ryo-tas, and the other members of this large cast lack importance and impact throughout this tale, but they at least have particular roles to serveSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay OST, and good VA performancesEnjoyment: Terrible, too annoying and too uneventfulFinal Score: 3/10', ""Occultic;Nine had all the ingredients to make a fantastic show; but instead, it became a recipe for disaster.The biggest problem with Occultic;Nine is how it is presented. The plot and the art are setup perfectly to suite a dark and eerie paranormal fiction theme but it's almost as if the writers thought they were working on a sliceoflife/comedy.Any scene that is supposed to send chills down the viewers spine doesn't. Having every character talk at x1.5 speed with no pauses leaves little to no room for the audience to feel emotions towards someone dying in the background.It seems they were worried the anime would...be too scary so they made the main character a NEET whose lines consists purely of comic relief and a supporting character whose breasts are more exaggerated in size than any character this year.If you plan on watching the show for its mysterious and intriguing story telling then let me stop you there. They start it with a shaky paranormal foundation and then it all falls to shit with an ending full of asspulls.I can't say I regret watching Occultic;Ninebut I am however underwhelmed and disappointed. be too scary so they made the main character a NEET whose lines consists purely of comic relief and a supporting character whose breasts are more exaggerated in size than any character this year.If you plan on watching the show for its mysterious and intriguing story telling then let me stop you there.

It got to a point in the show where I had no idea what was happening and around episode 11 i understood what was going on with these nine people until the very end of episode 12 that had the same problem I had with Plastic Memories.There was this one clip at that very end that made me scratch my head even more. The story is the weakest link of the anime by far since it entangles so many stories into one and rushes each other one to wrap up the main one.There was this whole problem with the first episode squeezes an entire light novel into the first episode, which was weird since the only thing that happens in the show is just character introduction and that\'s about it.The show was made by A1 Pictures who oddly has a track record of controversial love/hate shows in the past years, but bad story or not , A1 Pictures really can animate nicely if they want too, and this is one show that they really put effort into. It\'s not like Fairy Tail where they straight up butcher the animation, the animation is well done and there are some times where it seems rotoscoped.Overall the animation is nice, the style is also nice to look at, I like how the main character doesn\'t have the cliche spikey hair and i like they\'re use of colors to distinguish characters and objects from the background.Another thing worth note is the stunning view of cinematography and lighting to build tension in scenes. There are times when the camera would just flip to the side and at times it would look disorienting though.The opening and ending are both well animated and nice to listen too, but the actual soundtrack is different. It may have been me but it felt like the soundtrack never changes. The techno electronic beat fits with the mystery aspect of the show, but it never seems to switch tone shifts and always sounds the same.To address the elephant in the room, by the end of the series, I still don\'t understand why Ryotas\' cleavage is so huge. It sounds silly but those things are way too humongous to take seriously, if they were trying to be seductive with the character it really didn\'t work so why they would make her chest size so comically huge?The main character is not a bland character, but he can be a bit of a crybaby, the girl with glasses says ""ascension"" a lot for some reason, the detective is annoying , that fortune teller girl should\'ve told more fortunes, the guy with glasses is so smart that it makes me jealous, that illustrator girl is good at drawing and that crazy girl with that demon dude needed more screen time.(Im not good with names).What i\'m trying to say is that they deserved a bit more screen time to completely wrap up their story before that crazy twist happened and changed everything. There is even this one girl who doesn\'t show up until the half of the show is over.Occultic;Nine would have been better if it was longer and didn\'t try to make everything happen at the speed of light.I like the style of the show and the opening and ending was a treat to hear and I kept up with the fast paced dialogue, but the larger problems are hard to address without spoiling the plot twist at the halfway mark. but to summarize quickly, the show should have been longer and fully flush out each character and the story surrounding it.Overall-7If you want everything explained, get ready to be disappointed. also for the audience.

Relax, the characters agree with you.I will try to sump up this anime as briefly as i can. Occultic simply fails to be good, ending in the ""ok"" anime section. As the semicolon suggest, Occultic;Nine is a animation that share some similarities with Nitroplus works such as Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head, yet, it has a huge problem when it comes to narrative. The Story in the first look reseamble the Durarara!! formula, a city, a loot of characters, and they\'re interaction with the initial mystery, however, the story (mainly after the 7th episode) falls off pretty hard, being pushed by this...chaotic fast-phase storytelling, which sounds original, but is simply confusing and pretty much unnecessary in the first place. There\'s a lot of stormshit theory, and the texts, dialogues and conversations are too quick, and i mean, damn quick, like, sound speed (i\'m joking here, but is fast). Some terms are completely ""what?"" like the ""Ascension"" quotes, and the final part, after the mystery solved, is pretty much rushed and withouth the right impact (AKA no climax here). The ending itself is kinda of satisfatory, but the journey until there, is pretty much a mess.I don\'t really hate the characters, but i don\'t like them (with one exception). I mean, the main character has that classics impotency moments, but it turns out irrelevant, since he\'s already all right after 10 minutes, and, to be honest, he\'s pretty boring. Some characters like the detective Moritsuka are pretty cool to watch, and in this specific case, Moritsuka is the only character that really suits well in the fast narrative of the plot, and is convincent when it comes to be one step ahead in information terms. Besides these ""ok"" characters, the other ones like Aria, Ririka or the Kotoribako boy are underused, and i really see potential in them. Actually, Ririka doesn\'t have a conclusion as a character (for some reason), and that tells you a lot about the whole plot in general.The animation is definily the best part of Occultic. The A-1 Pictures Studio always do a good job when it comes to do standard quality animes, and here they make their name once more. The soundtrack is a little bit discreet, but is actually good, the art is fine (and pretty original) and the voices are good, well choosed and performed. The anatomy of ""Ryotasu"" is something to discuss about, but the overall animation is pretty good, and i personally liked. It\'s nothing amazing by any means, but it does right.Occultic;Nine is not really an amazing intelligent anime with the likes of Steins;Gate, but is a fine watchable experience, Especially if you\'re looking for supernatural (or sci-fi) experiences in japanese animation. It has some flaws (more than qualities tho), but is not really bad or awful, and it may be enjoyable for you. chaotic fast-phase storytelling, which sounds original, but is simply confusing and pretty much unnecessary in the first place.

I liked how the direction of this anime was going but my personal opinion is that it was heading a fast pace for people to really catch up and understand what is going on.The story has been given portrayal towards Steins;Gate. While those small gimmicks where there, it some-how felt different. But the story was with a lot of twist, there was sudden shift in direction and plot twist were frequent but with fast pace of the plot, it was really hard to enjoy the anime....Even the ending that is, ep12 felt like it hurried up too fast, with no proper direction or explanation.But overall this anime is worth giving a shot, some might enjoy it cause of the story, while some might because of Ryo-tas ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

As someone who loved Steins;Gate, this anime caught my attention a few months before it was released and it fulfilled my expectations quite well. Overall, it's not the best anime ever but, it's a good anime for general enjoyment to mystery and sci-fi lovers like myself.Occultic;Nine has some great points to its show. Its plot and story, for the most part, is great. The idea of occult and supernatural things happening with a more sinister plot behind it was fantastic. The opening and the ending songs were excellent and the art was great as...well. However, do beware when watching, as there are a few plot holes in the story and plot.POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Occultic;Nine's development of the plot and the story could have been done much better. It was like Steins;Gate, in that the first few episodes was very confusing for the first time viewers. I, myself, rewatched episodes to make sure I didn't miss a thing. The story took more shape near the end when Tesla's daughter was inserted and everything tied together. I feel like if Occultic;Nine had another 12 episodes to work with, it would have been able to compete with its sister stories.The same goes for the characters of Occultic;Nine. Out of the nine characters, we really only see the background of Gamon and a slight bit of Aria and Ryoka. I think left a bit of plot holes within the storyline of Occultic;Nine, as a lot of the background information is not relayed to the viewers. Like I said previously, more episodes would have most likely fixed these issues. I would have loved it if Occultic;Nine had a filler episode of some of the characters' background stories before moving on with the plot.Last tidbit: Did you notice that there was a Christmas tree in the opening, even though there was no Christmas episode? Some say its because it aired its final episode Christmas Eve. The things you find when looking for content to watch... well.

Good pacing, in combination with the other attributes of a series, is crucial to my overall investment in said series. Take The Tatami Galaxy for example; exposition seems to fly by at first, but the viewer is often provided oases of slower-paced, thoughtful dialogue to take refuge in and reflect upon what they\'ve been shown or told. Another example of good pacing is Aria; the series proceeds at a consistently relaxed...(read: kinda slow) pace, but this leisurely feel works in tandem with the series\' soothing visuals and atmosphere to create a sense of peace and revitalization within the viewer. On the other hand, bad pacing can make a series hard to keep up with if it goes by too quickly or bore you out of your mind if it *really* takes its time to get where it\'s going. Occultic;Nine (abbreviated O;N from now on) falls into the former category, and therein lies my main issue with the series - it largely operates on one speed, and that\'s breakneck. In short, O;N lacks dynamic pacing, and this can negatively effect all of the aforementioned categories by which a series is judged.O;N takes place in Musashino, Japan, where our nine (yes... nine) protagonists share a fascination with the occult or the science by which occult phenomena can supposedly be explained. Mysterious happenings start to occur in the city, and upon further investigation, the morbid truths surrounding these happenings begin to reveal themselves. This premise is interesting enough, but the rapid-fire manner in which the story is presented can often be vexing. Episodes skip from scene to scene and character to character without much warning, and the exposition dialogue can be quite difficult to follow if you aren\'t pausing once every few seconds to read the subtitles. Because of this scattered method of storytelling, you can discern that O;N is attempting to present itself like a set of puzzle pieces to be thoroughly examined and carefully put together, but instead of laying said pieces out on a table so you can get a good look at them, they\'re just kind of thrown past you, allowing you a fleeting glimpse of what they look like before they\'re halfway across the room. O;N would have done well to center its focus on one scenario at a time, allowing viewers to soak things in rather than be doomed to mutter a sheepish ""I kinda get it"" before moving on in the story. Watch the first episode for a great example of what I\'m talking about.The characters of O;N range from likable (Gamon, Moritsuka) to annoying (Ryo-tas) to forgettable (Sumikaze), but all suffer from the same problem that characters in similarly-paced series often do - you never really feel like you\'ve gotten to know them. Gamon is the main protagonist of the series and thus receives the most attention, and we as viewers become comfortable with his spastic otaku personality; however, he never really seems to undergo much overall development as a person other than that, well, he knows more about what\'s going on as the story progresses and reacts in the way that you would expect a spastic otaku to react - with bombastic emotion. Ririka Nishizono, an artistic seer of sorts, is also a protagonist of the series, but we hardly ever see her, and as such almost no time is spent discussing who she is or how she feels about the events unfolding around her. When characters are presented in this way, as catalysts to events with little attention devoted to their personalities and backgrounds, they begin to feel like walking plot devices rather than human beings, and we can never really relate to them or find a reason to care about what happens to them. I will say that the dialogue between certain characters, especially when Moritsuka or Gamon is involved, is often clever and entertaining, one of the few things that kept me watching the show. The antagonists are a very generic bunch with very generic motives, and get around ten minutes of screentime total, which is pretty unusual and not a very good directorial choice if you want the viewer to root against them - personally, I couldn\'t care about them considering how little development they were given.In terms of art, O;N is presented fairly well - you can tell the artists and animators involved are dedicated to their craft, there\'s few to no blindingly-obvious hiccups in animation quality, and the art does a good job of capturing the dark, brooding atmosphere the series is attempting to convey. O;N\'s sound is nothing to write home about - the voice actors play their parts well, but the music neither helps nor harms the series much, not getting in the way but not bringing much emotion to the table either.My overall impression of O;N is that it\'s a 24-episode series attempting to tell its story in 12 episodes, which is generally a recipe for disaster. Dialogue moves too fast, there\'s too much information and exposition crammed into too little space, and none of the characters ever seem to develop much, at least when compared to most other 12-episode series. The story, setting, and characters feel incomplete overall - not because the ending was horrifically unsatisfactory or anything like that, but because it feels like a bunch of details that would have fleshed everything out weren\'t included. Sure, we get a bunch of technobabble about how some of the occult phenomena in the series work, but little in the form of development to get us attached to anything that\'s happening or the people it\'s happening to.I want to make it clear that, unlike lost-cause shows that were doomed to fail from the start due to inherently flawed characters or stories, O;N had the potential to be interesting if it wasn\'t so tightly-packed. Rather than being able to immerse yourself in this series, you can only watch it go by at sonic speed, a blur of colors, sound and light, and imagine what it might be like if it just fucking stood still for a second.

You get Occultic;NineThis show had a lot going for it. The plot that was presented to us was intriguing enough to get people to watch the pilot and even the pilot presented a plot that got people interested. The problem? Rushed decisions.The story of ""Occultic;Nine"" follows a group of people that are being forced to live some misterious events, while sparking a debate about whether the occultic is a thing or not. These people were all by one way or another linked to the subject and so they...all have their own opinnion on the matterAnd when so, when everything starts to go down, they all have different reactions and approches to the matter.This would have been fun to watch if the producers handled the topic a little diferently.To me, the show felt rushed. I understand making a full-25-ish-anime show is way more expensive than making a 12 episode one. But this show was really hurt by it. ""Occultic;Nine"" has a plot that required a deeper analysis, it\'s a show that wants to be a psychological mistery but doesn\'t have the time to do so. And so most of the questions the show asks are left unanswered or barely touched, and some more episodes could have fixed that.This show also suffers from another problem: the pace. It started out really slow, presenting the characters and the overall mistery, making the pilot almost hurtfull to watch, only to transition to a really fast paced story, trying to accomplish too much in each episode. The characters talk WAY to fast for the conversations to be easily understandable, which can get really annoying when they\'re explaning the really hard parts of the plot. I can only imagine this was the attempt to fit the entire plot in 12 episodes, which they DID manege to accomplish, but not in a very good way.Being reduced to 12 episode also represents another problem: Character development. Since the main cast is, well, a CAST, the shows tries to develop way too many stories at the same time. Result? None of them really has that much development. You could argue the real main characters, Gamotan and Ryotas get some and I would see your point, but in a show where the idea is to have around 8 main characters, some of them are bound to be left out. Add to that the fact that you only have 12 episodes to deliever these stories AND the main plot and you\'ll get almost no character background and progression.However, I can\'t hate this show. The mistery IS interesting and I maneged to put up with the fast pace and dialogue.The opening and ending songs and visuals are really good! The ending is also kind of sweet, which while not answering too MANY of the questions you might had, will cover your heart and mind and put them at ease. Until they announce season 2. (Which I hope they will.Let\'s hope they do a better job with it)""Occultic;Nine"" is a show with a very good plot and it could have been one of the shows of the season if the producers had done a better job working on it. Since they didn\'t, it falls short and becomes a show of the ""It could have been great"" list. It\'s a real shame. I do recommend you giving it a try if you like the occultic things though. If you can get through the first episode and still want to watch the second one, you\'ll be fine. You probably won\'t love it, but I doubt you\'ll hate it either.

I almost dropped this anime after the 1st episode because of how ""all over the place"" it was. But after discovering that they squeezed an entire volume+ into the one episode, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. In fact, it actually became significantly better right from the 2nd episode on.The mystery just kept getting thicker with each episode, the...supernatural phenomenon presented added an ominous feeling to the show, and the scientific principles surrounding said phenomenon kept me intrigued to learn the truths behind this mystery.Now as for the bad, like many others (basically everyone on this page lol), the pacing was pretty bunz to say the least. The show being a 12 ep season did not do the story justice, and the rapid dialogue didn\'t help it either. There were many times where I was genuinely lost in the story because I had no idea what was going on, and at first, I thought the reason for the fast-paced talking was to make the characters come off as more intelligent than they really were (cuz we all know when you spout facts out really quickly, you\'re basically a genius). It wasn\'t until towards the end that I realized that the production team was going balls deep to try and fit in all this plot and development into the few episodes that they had...This is by far the biggest complaint for many viewers, but for me, it honestly did not bother that much. The whole reason for this review is to give credit where credit is due.This anime had great character design, art, atmosphere, and sound. I appreciated all these elements despite having to deal with a ""rushed"" story. I completely see why people are disappointed. A lot of questions were left unanswered, our main character didn\'t get the happy ending some of us were expecting (especially after seeing how convenient the final episode was laying it out to be), and the potential for an incredible mystery was somewhat lost in order to speed up the story.For me, I really enjoyed this anime to the end. I personally didn\'t find the final episode to be confusing at all. Instead, I thought it to be one of the easiest episodes to understand, and a perfect way to tie any major plot points that confused me. Sure the pace could have been much better with more episodes, but sometimes those things may be out of your control, and perhaps they have some sort of plan in mind if they were able to continue this story.Overall I give this an 8/10. Many see this anime as a big let down, but I want to see it as an anime with the potential to provide one amazing story. It has its flaws, but I feel they\'re already stepping in the right direction. supernatural phenomenon presented added an ominous feeling to the show, and the scientific principles surrounding said phenomenon kept me intrigued to learn the truths behind this mystery.Now as for the bad, like many others (basically everyone on this page lol), the pacing was pretty bunz to say the least.

I actually regret watching this.This anime looks as if someone tried to mix together durarara and stein\'s gate, but couldn\'t capture the spirit of either anime, and in the end failed miserably.The main problem with this anime is that it is a non-stop information dump. Everybody talks at machinegun speed without ever having a break. There\'s barely any chance for voice actors to display emotion, and not enough time to let importance of some scenes to sink in. The plot device is fairly convoluted, the problem is that when you get past ridiulous explanation speed, and put the pieces together, the whole thing is...a shallow tehnobabble with a few big names thrown in. Which effectively makes the whole thing disappointing. Add into the mix cheap plot devices made to ""shock"" the viewer, and you get an extremely shallow experience.Detailed breakdown:Story:Quite bad. The anime tries to follow durarara\'s way of storytelling, where perspectives switch often, and you eventually piece together the story from the scattered incidents presented from different perspective, but this time it doesn\'t really work. There\'s a very complicated ""reason"" behind the events of the show, however, when you piece the plot together (around 8..10 episode), it turns out to be a shallowly written technobabble with few big names thrown in, which is a huge disappointment. As I said, characters talk all the time, non stop, and there\'s barely a moment in the anime when someone isn\'t explaining something. This ruins the storytelling, because there\'s barely any time for voice actors to even take a breath, not to mention to expositions of some scenes, or letting some dramatic moment sink in. The story on occasion tries to throw shocking events at the viewer, but they fall flat and on occasion are completely unexplained (there\'s at least one gruesome scene that happens for no reason whatsoever).Art:Art is alright or on good side. It is lower detailed, but fluid modern anime style, similr to, for example, durarara. Meaning that the face is outlined with just a few lines, but not with so few details where it gets oversimplified (like in Mahouka). Animation is alright, when it happens, but there are a lot of talking scenes, it may be underutilized slightly. Some characters look nice visually, and there was at least one genuinely good looking scene.Charters:Due to high speed of everyone talking, a lot of them barely have any window to display any personality at all. Protagonist (Yuta Gamon) has two nice moments, but everybody else despite few hints at their personality, resemble carton cutouts. Ryo-tas is genuinely annoying - I mean ""silly child like characters"" can be entertaining, but coupled with her massive, erm, ""assets"" in breast department she starts reminding me of Eiken characters. If that was their idea of what fanservice should be it clearly didn\'t work well.Enjoyment:I feel like I wasted my time on this. Pacing is way too fast, and the story/puzzle behind the anime was a let down.Overall:I think the best idea would be to skip this.

Using the occult as its core, the characters would be all influenced or connected to different situations, ""powers/abilities"" and a super case that as we know in the Science Adventures Series, we need the spice of some mega-control corporation behind the case.Each character have his/her own past, with great memories and influences, some of them, or maybe, most of them, get forgotten at certain point as is needed or not, and only use character alone, but the reason is simple, to forge a story that can finish the more complete as possible.The BGMs, sounds, and voices are very delightful, you won\'t get boring, or at least your ears.

Using the occult as its core, the characters would be all influenced or connected to different situations, ""powers/abilities"" and a super case that as we know in the Science Adventures Series, we need the spice of some mega-control corporation behind the case.Each character have his/her own past, with great memories and influences, some of them, or maybe, most of them, get forgotten at certain point as is needed or not, and only use character alone, but the reason is simple, to forge a story that can finish the more complete as possible.The BGMs, sounds, and voices are very delightful, you won\'t get boring, or at least your ears.

Mystery fans may get some enjoyment out of it, but it will be just as likely to be annoying and frustrating.Occultic;Nine is an interesting little mystery story that is unfortunately dragged down by horrendous characters and a pretentious, grating style that intrudes on nearly every scene.  Among the 9 title characters, only about 3 of them are tolerable (the black magic girl, the fortune teller and the journalist).  The main character Yuta, Ryotas, and the detective are about as aggressively off-putting as you can make characters that are ostensibly supposed to be likeable.  It was a chore at...times to keep up with this series because I disliked the characters and was not invested in their struggles.The real detriment to this series though is in this awful attempt at making the show quirky by dramatically speeding up the dialogue and using a very distinctive visual style.  The dialogue will make your head spin and there is so much exposition delivered at lightning speed that it\'s virtually impossible to retain all the information they throw at you.  To make matters worse, the complex plot involving time travel and spirit realms and things of that sort really needs clarity when it\'s delivering lore to the viewer and the speed-talking makes it difficult to follow once things ramp up in the last few episodes.  They absolutely went for style over substance here, and not in a way that makes the series more enjoyable to watch.That being said, the central mystery was engaging and I definitely did not see the midseries plot twist coming.  I think this could have been a good series with some tweaks to the characters and a director that would just make a normal series instead of trying to show off how stylistically unique they can be.  There are a few things I would criticize here as well though.  I thought the pacing could have been better, as it was a slow burn most of the time but then the ending was rushed and confusing.  There are a few dead ends where you get to the end of the series and look back and you\'re like ""why exactly did we spend all this time on this side story when it didn\'t mean anything in the end?""  The entire story of Chi and the kotoribako is like that.  Lastly, the series tracks which day it is on a regular basis and it\'s unclear why until the very last episode.  Some sort of signal to the audience as to why it\'s important to keep track of that, amidst all the other things you need to keep track of, would have been much appreciated.Overall, it\'s a good story let down by bad characters and some unfortunate directorial choices.  A few tweaks could have made this a fun mystery series, but sadly you can\'t wish away the flaws and I can\'t recommend it even for mystery lovers given how much I disliked the characters.  One final thing to note is that the OP is quite good and worth checking out even without watching the series. times to keep up with this series because I disliked the characters and was not invested in their struggles.The real detriment to this series though is in this awful attempt at making the show quirky by dramatically speeding up the dialogue and using a very distinctive visual style.

However after some time and looking back on them they seem to understand a bit more and quality is discovered as seen by the anime\'s rising score after it\'s original decline at the end of last year.If I can sum up this whole anime is that I fucking LOVED it. The entire time I was watching this anime I was either entertained or intrigued. And I dunno know about you guys but when I enjoy something while a great story is unfolding is a perfect...blend for something worthy of my 10/10.In terms of characteristics, the anime sets up some of the cast in the first episode as rather generic archetypes with the same personality traits you\'ve seen millions of times especially our main two leads. However, it\'s how the anime progressed its story and characters is what made them memorable in my eyes.  Each character has some form of dilemma and intrigue to them giving us a taste of what they would be like outside of their respective story, in fact the first episode doesn\'t really have some sort of huge *Shit hits the fan* type of event until the last few moments so we can all see what these characters do prior to the events taking place. You see Gamon blogging on his site and hanging out at his usual joint getting the same thing as pointed out by Kouhei the owner who is just fed up with these kids always using his place. You also see Narusawa\'s relationship to Yuuta in this episode being rather playful and being his ""minion"". Other characters are also set up quite nicely such as Touko and her group of journalists who want to nail a massive story for the paper.  Other characters are set up using a more mysterious and fascinating way to make us want to know more about them and just how they fit in with the story, like Moritsuka and Ririka being shrouded in mystery and their motives are unclear which gives the viewer a sense of discovery when they are revealed, rewarding them for paying attention. Later they all get their own dilemma\'s explored and allows them to grow towards each other on a personal level instead of them being total strangers to one another as they started at the beginning.The Animation done by A-1 Pictures is masterfully done, with constantly moving sequences and helps along the pacing go a bit faster while catching the attention of viewers who need to watch closer. The shots also complement the show with the sense of urgency in some scenes really helped by the cinematography done by Kyohei Ishiguro who has done other A-1 greats in the past like Your lie in April. This anime surely looks amazing and sounds just as great with great sound design and soundtrack, may I also point out that this show had one of my favorite OP\'s of 2016, sung by Kanako Itou and her voice blended with the opening animation makes for an amazing sight.I could go on about this show all day folks, I\'ve only talked about episode 1 of this review and I can still go on and on but for now, let\'s give the big ole final verdict for Occultic;Nine is a 10.BTW this was my first review so why not start on one of my favorite Animes of all time. blend for something worthy of my 10/10.In terms of characteristics, the anime sets up some of the cast in the first episode as rather generic archetypes with the same personality traits you\'ve seen millions of times especially our main two leads.

The pacing is so off-kilter. They try to cram so much exposition into a small amount of time. I haven't read the source material but I have to imagine the pacing is better. It had an interesting premise but with no follow-through. Perhaps if it had 24 episodes it could of been better. One positive about the show is the art. The character design is a plus Gamon's design is great. I feel like big-tit chick Ryouka is sort of bad but...I think that is what they were going for. Sort of a grotesque parody of anime chicks. The pacing just left little room for character development. I would like to know their motivations rather than just a bland character description. Overall, it was just a struggle to get through. Quite frustrating. I think maybe if the characters would've had better pacing and exploration into their psyche. The story would have had been better. 5/10. I think that is what they were going for.

However, the any problems/flaws really stood out like a sore thumb. The Tesla explanation for everything was taken way to far to the point were it was not believable any more. Random characters were suddenly gifted superpowers out of...the blue and magical solutions suddenly turned up when everyone needed help which turned this into a fantasy/magic genre for me. I wish they put more effort into tricking the audience by blurring reality and fantasy. It was a cop out to present solutions out of thin air than put more psychological development behind them.

Not enough chilling psychological thriller; they went the cutesy route *sigh*."", 'With the legacy of Steins;Gate behind it and a multitude of very polarized reviews, I fully expected Occultic;Nine to be one of those extremely metaphorical anime with a unique, nontraditional narrative that a lot of people just don\'t ""get.""I\'m fully aware of how pretentious that sounds, but not enjoying those anime isn\'t a bad thing in my opinion, it\'s just a different method of storytelling that works for some and doesn\'t work for others. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is not one of those. What Occultic;Nine lacks in genuine symbolism and unique storytelling, it attempts to make up for with implausible pseudosciences, plot contrivances, unnecessary (and subsequently...abandoned) plot threads, and what may possibly be the most abhorrent pacing and plot decisions I\'ve seen in an anime in a very long time.-Story: 4/10It starts out good enough, with an interesting cast and genuinely intriguing mysteries. Though the pacing starts out as bad as it ends, I actually initially found myself drawn to the breakneck conversation speed and scene-to-scene transitions. It meant that every second of this anime was important, and there would be virtually no filler or fluff content. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine actually managed to teach just how important filler content can be, even in a 12-episode anime.It really wouldn\'t be wrong to classify this anime as only one, really long exposition dump. Even in important action scenes, there\'s nonstop explanation coupled with the distracting visuals. The longer the anime runs for, the weaker and weaker the actual plot becomes. Whereas Steins;Gate devoted a large portion of its runtime to making its science at the very least plausible within the unique constraints of its universe, Occultic;Nine quite literally gave the impression of making things up as it went along. The premise seems to promise a unique, ambiguous debate between the scientific and the occult, but in reality the show is more or less ""made up science with a few  unimportant urban legends thrown in for good measure.""Subplots seem to come and the disappear as quickly as they were launched into the show.  Though the anime does attempt to explain the driving forces behind the main plot, it still leaves an offensive amount of unanswered questions and unresolved character plots. Also, in the midst of its ""explanation"", several points of the plot hinge on what can only be called contrivances. Contrivances that go far beyond Deus Ex Machina and enter the territory of ""the writers honestly had no idea how to fix this mess so they just made the solution appear out of thin air.""All in all, the terribly paced and inconsistent storyline culminated in an ultimately unsatisfying ending that didn\'t leave me wanting more, and instead just made me relieved it was finally over. I wasn\'t left with a desire to learn more about the characters or the world of Occultic;Nine, I was instead left frustrated and annoyed at the lack of basic storytelling integrity present all throughout this anime.-Art: 6/10Though the animation and character designs are nice enough, there\'s often a complete disconnection between what\'s happening visually, and what\'s being said. Normally, you\'d expect dialogue to frame a scene and interesting visuals used to make an otherwise boring-but-necessary conversation fun to watch, but Occultic;Nine fails in all aspects, quite miserably I may add. Exposition dumps are accessorized with awkward, disjointed camera angles and extremely forced perspective that makes the rapid expositioning even more difficult to listen to. The further you get into the show, the more its predictable and amateur visuals blend together and the easier it gets to completely tune out, which given the sheer amount of exposition present in any given scene, is not a good thing.-Sound: 7/10Probably my highest point of compliment, which is... sad. The opening and ending are nice enough as standalone songs and the OST does a fine job of creating the right atmosphere throughout the anime. Unfortunately, though, no tracks particularly stood out as breakout or iconic works. Good, but ultimately forgettable.-Character: 4/10This is probably where the anime falls short the most. Right away the anime introduces us to not only the main cast, but several minor characters as well.  The rapidfire pacing is what makes it possible to fully introduce so many characters at once,  but despite the information overload, only a handful of these characters actually end up being necessary. Major characters start out with important subplots that lead nowhere, and minor characters are given last-minute evolutions to major players in the events of the story. Altogether though, there is virtually no character development. The show ends with virtually the same cast it began with. This is due largely to so many characters getting very little screentime, with several of the \'major\' characters getting maybe 3-5 scenes of important dialogue in the entire anime. The cast is largely held together by a few inconsequential character traits with little to no depth, which is rather unfortunate given their admittedly very interesting designs.-Enjoyment: 4/10If you\'re a longtime fan of anime, then you should know that sometimes even a bad storyline and bad characters aren\'t always dealbreakers. Despite everything, sometimes a show just has a certain spark, an appeal that makes it enjoyable even though by all means it shouldn\'t be. I was desperately looking for that piece of Occultic;Nine throughout its entire run. I really wanted to like it. I really wanted it to be a good anime. But, unfortunately (I\'ve certainly used that word a lot), it almost totally lacked enjoyability for me. It isn\'t even good in a ""so bad its good"" kind of way.

Normally I don't really like the Sci-Fi genre, but I didn't feel weighed down with this show like I normally would.  The application of science to fantasy elements was balanced and important, but none of the main characters are the scientists trying to do so. Instead, they find themselves in a predicament that pushes them to try to understand what's happening and why.As...mentioned previously, the pacing of this show was a little unique. In the first few episodes I wasn't greatly enjoying it as many elements felt a little rushed. The show doesn't only follow around one main character, but jumps back and forth between them. Coupled with the pacing, this made the show a little hard to settle into at first. However, once you get past the first episode or two I felt like the pacing really suited itself to the story and the multiple perspectives added more interest overall.As far as the plot goes, I think it's a lot more interesting than the summary makes it seem. When I first read the summary for this show I thought it was going to be something very different. The show is technically about a group of kids who run a blog trying to disprove the occult, but it's so much more than that. The show has one major incident dealing with the occult that the characters find themselves caught up in. As it goes on, pretty much all of the lesser incidents tie together and connect all of the elements of the story. The plot flows together, despite some apparent plot holes and issues.I did have a number of issues with this show that normally would have warranted a lower score, but I enjoyed it so much despite those flaws. mentioned previously, the pacing of this show was a little unique.

Making a highly science fiction show (more over-the-top than the sci-fi Steins;Gate) with a somewhat hard to grasp plot AND the bombardment of characters introduced in the first episode that is on par with Durarara!! only 12 episodes long seems very unfair. Had this been 24 episodes long, this anime would\'ve easily been a 10 for me.Story:The story of Occultic;Nine seems very good on pen and paper, however, the execution was extremely poor due to incredibly fast pacing as well as trying to fit...a vast amount of characters. The theories of ""ghosts"" are quite unique and interesting, and is able to make the audience (certainly me at least), be able to nod in agreement at whatever madness is ensuing. But the problem of 12 episodes reveals itself again, with some highly over-the-top supernatural phenomenons that are barely explained happening on screen (VERY PREVALENT IN THE FINALE).Art:What caught my eye in this anime was the animation. It looked very pleasing to me, especially the art style and the background colours. Albeit, the quick camera angle changes can get annoying, but the anime was try to not make the explanations and theories boring by giving the viewers an ""easy on the eye"" artwork. Personally, this anime has one of the best eye-candy animation I\'ve ever seen.Sound:The soundtrack as well VA and SFX in general are great. Absolutely no complaints except for the fast-pace of speaking. Music and SFX always fits the tension and atmosphere of the environment, and really enhances your sense and focus of what\'s happening.Character:One of it\'s biggest weaknesses so far is the characters. 12 episodes is nowhere near enough to fit in all of the characters involvement, story and development in this anime. Some characters were outright done dirty and had barely enough screen time  for their purpose in the anime. This made some characters\' roles feel very minuscule in the overall plot of the anime.Enjoyment:I enjoyed it. I really did. No matter how many negative reviews I\'ve seen for it, I\'ve always felt that this anime is good. I\'m not sure if I\'m too generous and my standards are too low, but I really. Enjoyed. This.

No matter how many negative reviews I\'ve seen for it, I\'ve always felt that this anime is good. I\'m not sure if I\'m too generous and my standards are too low, but I really. Enjoyed. This. Anime.Pros:- Animation and Art are eye-candy.- Plot is very fun to explore.- Music is good.- Fun twist.Cons:- Extremely fast pacing.- Too condensed (12 episodes).- Not enough character build/exploration.- Minor unexplained concept/scientific issues.El Psy Congroo.', ""I think occultic Nine has a bad score because the first episode was a bit boring and everybody droped it after the first episode. But for me Ocultic Nine deserves a better rating because :-Occultic nine is a mixt of two incredibles anime Steins Gate and Bakemonogatari (it has the vibe of a shaft anime and is written by the creator of steins gate)-the characters are well thought out. They were all likeable especelly the inspector although some of them lack developpement due to the anime being only 12 episodes long).-I love the opening and the ending is pretty good. The osts were kinda forgettable...but they suit their purpose.-The art is outstanding, didn't expect A1 picture to do something this good.-The story is really good. The ending is quite disappointing tho, with more time they could have managed to do something better.-I enjoyed this anime a lot despite it's flaws, I definitly recommend this anime. but they suit their purpose.-The art is outstanding, didn't expect A1 picture to do something this good.-The story is really good.

So the story does. Creepy, mysterious, and relatively interesting.But the dialogues were too fast and long,and sometimes you couldn't keep up with the script, plus it was extremely exhausting.I think that it would be better if there were some more episodes, letting the story unravel in a slower and more understandable way.I didn't find any character memorable.The thing that annoyed me most tho,*****you don't just add huge boobs to any short slim girl. It's incredibly antiaesthetic.****I don't know if you find it irritating in general, but this time I...just couldn't watch this.The way she was moving, was making me nauseated.And there can be absolutely no clothes that could fit her. just couldn't watch this.The way she was moving, was making me nauseated.And there can be absolutely no clothes that could fit her."", 'Why Myanimelist, why? Why is Occultic Nine so undervalued? I want to know how this marvelous and innovative anime is so undervalued.  I want to know when A1-pictures turned into Shaft as well.At the beginnig I was very disguted with this Autumn season, I absolutely hated all animes of it (with the exception of a few amount of it) , until now. Bye stupid and fantastic boys that travel to another world for doing...what always it is hoped that they would do, nothing, and many other things that it does\'t worth to talk about. Bye stupid animes with idols and musical animes with lolis...this...time is time to talk about Occultic Nine.I have to say that this anime is a surprise, not only by the quality of its art but as well by the story and how I enjoyed it. The art is very alike to Shaft\'s animes, the presentations with words, the way of telling us what is happening on ours tvs etc. Simply outstanding, marvelous.The story is very interesting, a marvelous thriller that make you want to know more and more about it and with a huge ammount of hidden details (thing that I particularly love). I put a 9 on it because this anime is pretty short and may be you need more than 3 or 4 times for understanding all the plot.The sound isn\'t bad, but could be more impressive, with the exception of the openning and the ending, i can\'t remember any song in particular and in my opinion they could have put more effort on it.  8 is a good mark.The characters, well, in this i found many mistakes and many good things. Mistakes: only the stupid fanservice, what the fuck are these tits¿¿¡¡¡ They were\'nt normal...Good things: I like very much the variety of characters, the most of them aren\'t cliches and have a very good personality. The kind of development of the characters is pretty nice too, It remembered me to Durarara with not only a main character, in fact I think it would be more than 5 or 6, thing that i want to thanks for, because the ""main character"" isn\'t very interesting XD.Characters: 8/10.In conclusion, if you like an anime that be different to the others, this is your anime, terrifyly well drawn and with a outstanding animation, an interesting plot and more things that you will discover with the pass of the time watching it.I hope this review have not very much mistakes because english isn\'t my main lenguage.

I can not find a way to describe this series without giving a little brief about me.Who am I? I am the guy who does not skip openings and endings. The guy that watches anime in the bus, normally one at a time. The guy with more than 1200 paper volumes of manga on the shelf. I give a score of 10 not when...I find a series to be perfect, but for when it really captivates me.I will try to display information without the loops and frills people use to entertain. I\'m here to inform and prove a point. Lets get to it then.The story is fast paced, especially the first episode. Forget the light novel, the fast pace is part of the story. I see a lot of people complaining about that. If you survive the first episode and it\'s + -11 characters, you\'ll see that story flows and you get what\'s going on, even if you do not understand completely all the scientific stuff. I think what really divides the final opinion watchers have is if they can take the stream of information or not. Well, I survived 3 games of Xenosaga, so this is nothing for me.Occultic; Nine is not a supernatural anime, it\'s Sci-Fi. It tries to give explanations that really make sense, instead of counting that we simply believe in it. It\'s not that all is scientifically accurate, it\'s just not like ""the big guy is green and his pants stretch, deal with it"". I give the series credit for making me think in a scientific manner.Yes, Ryo-tas breasts are impossibly huge. But hey, it\'s an anime, and I respect the creator for the ""I\'ll do whatever I want"" factor. I do not see you complaining about the twin maids with pink and blue hair always wearing fetish clothing.The art is awesome, the opening and ending songs are marvelous, especially the ending (I still have it playing in my head as I write). The mistery and plot twists make for a great story from start to end.In the end, as I said in the beginning, what really counts for me is that the story captivated me, and I would even recomend it to my friends that do not watch anime.

Not because this show is terrible, in fact it does a lot of things very well...but that the story and in particular the climax felt both rushed and at the same time labored at the same time labored with jargon filled 'explanation' kind of spoiled what was an extremely promising anime.First the good. The opening and ending songs are fire, really catchy. Some of the plot twists and cliffhangers are also excellently done and really keep you on the edge of your seat. Character wise also seems promising at first,...albeit with your standard otaku protagonist, and their interactions are pretty good.However...this has shades of Chaos Head's anime about it. Chaos Head had a similar theme and similar good points but this show also mirrors it with a less than satisfying ending. Here the jargon thrown in to explain everything sounds pretty nonsensical and goes on a while, the ideas behind some of the huge end twists like time travel feel like plot convenience and are hard to follow and it also suffers from OP plot convenience at the final fight scenes too. Which is frustrating...because for around 8/9 episodes this was up there among my favorite anime but in the end it just about scrapes an 8 in my books...and I could see why some people would give it a seven.Still worth a watch though as long as you don't expect too much from the ending.

I am not a genius and I am not into physics, but the fact that I have at some point heard of these theories and predictions made the show's idea easy to digest and more enjoyable. The show creators tried to be creative with their direction with the unpredictable camera angels and positions, lighting, and the art style in general. Yet what it lacked the most was a decent pacing that gave everything time to settle and be understood.Since the first episode, the...viewer is forced to interact and introduced to so much information and characters that it feels like we are in a race or something. Even the character's dialogue goes insanely fast that I had to stop multiple times in order to read and understand what's going on.Then the series takes things slowly for about 2 episodes then it turns insane again. It's a pattern that keeps repeating itself over and over again. I was able to accept it and get over it, but it's understandable that many can't and find it annoying and hard to follow.Personally, what I loved the most was that it was a mix of mystery, sci-fi, and paranormal activities that ended up (mostly) making sense and that it was still grounded into reality. However, we didn't get all the answers to all the mysteries and questions raised and it's a shame in my opinion given how little a 12 episodes was for such a LN that has a lot to explore with many characters as well. Yet the story is interesting enough to hold one's attention and forces you to use your mind and think other than waiting to be told the answers for free. It was basically like a puzzle mixed with a prediction game which was fun yet sadly rushed.Characters: 7The characters I must say that they were really essential to the plot and with time we get to understand were the show's name is driven from. Even though, they were not that special. The story behind most of the characters is decent and so are their actions, but they are not that unique nor were they explored further in order to reach their full potential. As well for us to feel connected to them to care about them. I think the characters were mostly stereotypical one's, yet they were able to fit the plot perfectly.The series contains a lot of characters, which was tiring at first getting introduced to most of them at the same time (again rushed). Not all the characters had real understandable motives to commit what they had done whether they were good or bad. So we don't end up with much character development in my opinion.Art: 9The art was the most impressive thing about this show. I mean it was what hooked me to continue giving it a try because of how beautiful it was. It was very creative, detailed, with great color pallets and character designs that fit the characters perfectly well.I wish we had more animes that take this art approach as it's so wonderful.VA / Music: 7The ED song was what made me watch it tbh. I freaking love it as well as the OP. However, there were no other memorable ost or soundtracks that I took notice of.The VA for Gamon was the best out of them all in my opinion. Yet all the other main characters did a good job as well, so not much to be said about it.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed this series, even though it took me a whole week to finish it lol.

Noblesse,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41345/Noblesse,"[""So, coming from someone whose read the webtoon…. LOOK HOW THEY MASSACRED MY BOY. Okay, so there are multiple problems with this crunchyroll webtoon collaboration. The first problem, is that this starts in the 2ND SEASON of the story. So your going to be completely lost if you start with this series, unless you saw the OVA episode from 4 years ago. Which, frankly, is a fucking disaster as they jammed a whole season’s worth of content into a single 30 minute episode. I have no clue why they didn’t start fresh, that’s just really bad marketing. The only reason I would think why they...would start in the second season is that that is when the majority of main characters are introduced, but that is honestly a really bad reason to skip so much story content. If Tower of God was a good adaption, God of High School fun but rushed, then Noblesse is devoid of any and all structure or backstory.I have to say, if this is your first introduction into the series, I am so sorry. I would try to summarize what the show is about… but 3 episodes actually doesn’t explain anything about what’s happening. Nothing does, and looking at this show without the context of the webtoon, it just comes across as a slow paced shonen with weird pacing. In the words of a god: My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. Peak it if you’ve already read the source material and want to see them move, but otherwise, as much as it pains me to say it, if you haven’t read Noblesse, then I wouldn’t blame you for skipping this entry.I'm just in a constant state of shock with how badly they botched it, how could they start a series in its 2nd season with an offensively rushed 30 minute OVA from 4 years ago as the official 1st season source for all your information? You for sure would be lost if you just started watching this show without any context. And as it progresses, even if you just think of it as a second season, your still going to be disappointed with the lacking animation, glossed over story, and terrible handling of its characters when it comes to building the relationships with each other.In conclusion, this adapts a second season of a webtoon that would greatly benefit from a proper adaptation of its first season, and non-webtoon readers would be completely lost while watching. Art is lacking, story isn't structured well, and everything suffers. would start in the second season is that that is when the majority of main characters are introduced, but that is honestly a really bad reason to skip so much story content.

Nothing spectacular, but nothing awful either.Like most things in life, Noblesse has some pros and cons. I’ll start with the bad. Noblesse, the anime, is probably the walking definition of mediocre. The series sets up a lot of cool and interesting mysteries and plot points, but the execution feels lacklustre and leaves much to be desired. The first 4-5 episodes were really good and then I felt it was downhill from there. The final third of the show had some cool fights and nice moments between the characters, but that’s about it.Now that I’ve got the...bad out of the way, Noblesse does have some good things going for it. For one, it’s by far the best adapted webtoon anime of the year. GoH and ToG suffered from tremendous pacing issues, but Noblesse did a really good job of bringing the manhwa to life. The comedy is decent, the fights are really well animated and the world is interesting. I do appreciate the fact that the story is very character driven and not just another battle shonen style set up like GoH and ToG. Dialogue and the relationship between characters are huge here.My gripe with the story mainly comes from the second half of the show. There’s a key moment with one of the main characters that marks a turning point in the anime, and it seems like once this character faded, so did my interest. The “Lord” arc that takes up the final 4-5 episodes had potential to be really good, but the “antagonist’s” motivations were so weak and shallow to me that it was hard to take it seriously. The final episode was handled pretty well which probably saved its score for me, though.Despite it’s flaws, I did enjoy Noblesse quite a bit and think it had a lot of potential. I do recognise the fact we only saw a few chapters out of a massive work. The whole concept of vampire nobles, mysticism and human genetic engineering is cool. I just wish the story had been a bit better down the stretch. Noblesse gets 7 cups of tea out of 10. bad out of the way, Noblesse does have some good things going for it.

Dialogue and the relationship between characters are huge here.My gripe with the story mainly comes from the second half of the show. There’s a key moment with one of the main characters that marks a turning point in the anime, and it seems like once this character faded, so did my interest. The “Lord” arc that takes up the final 4-5 episodes had potential to be really good, but the “antagonist’s” motivations were so weak and shallow to me that it was hard to take it seriously. The final episode was handled pretty well which probably saved its score for me, though.Despite it’s flaws, I did enjoy Noblesse quite a bit and think it had a lot of potential. I do recognise the fact we only saw a few chapters out of a massive work. The whole concept of vampire nobles, mysticism and human genetic engineering is cool. I just wish the story had been a bit better down the stretch. Noblesse gets 7 cups of tea out of 10.', 'MILD SPOILERS AHEADWebToon Anime only ever made sense in hindsight. Back when ""Tower of God"" was airing I expressed my excitement for what could have been a landmark turning point for both the WebToon and anime markets. I stand by everything I said, and there are undoubtedly good results achieved with this venture. A quick search on Google Trends would reveal that interest in WebToons and Manhwa skyrocketed with the release of ToG. If the goal was to create commercially successful products that brought WebToons mainstream prevalence, the production committees at Crunchyroll certainly succeeded. But despite the corporate success, it\'s difficult to view this partnership...without some degree of cynicism; the flagship adaptations themselves have left a weak first impression. At best, they were middling half-measures that somewhat managed to hint at greater things to come; at worst, they did disgraceful disservice to the source material being promoted. And that brings us to where we are today. ToG was a flawed, but promising, adaptation that oozed with potential. But ""God of High School"" was all style with no substance, and today\'s case study, ""Noblesse,"" possesses neither. At the very least the sheer lunacy of GoHS was capable at provoking a vitriolic response from me. But soulless unambition confines this husk of a show to an arguably worse fate - indifference. Here\'s how. This review contains mild spoilers, but skip ahead to my Tl;Dr if you\'re short on time.Noblesse is built around a powerful entity living amongst men. After an 820-year slumber, the mysterious Raizel awakens, à la Rip Van Winkle. He is a member of the Nobles, a secluded race charged with protecting mankind from afar. Finding himself far from home, Raizel decides to live a peaceful life in modern-day South Korea. The show is split into two arcs, both of which are concerned with factions alerted to his ""Awakening."" His incredible abilities are rarely put on display, instead serving as the impetus for power struggles and internal politics. These conflicts and Raizel\'s new way of life are what the show utilises to explore certain ideas. But before we take that deep dive, there is something that needs to be addressed. For those of you who don\'t know, Noblesse the Anime does not share the same chronological beginning as the original webcomic. A 2016 prequel, titled ""Noblesse: Awakening,"" is the canonical start of our story, and the anime decided to continue where that OVA left off. Personally I didn\'t see a need to catch that prequel, given that the anime was never advertised as a follow-up. Way I see it, the existence of the source material or other adaptations doesn\'t absolve this individual instalment of meeting fundamental story objectives. My beliefs aside, I\'m not one to tell you whether the OVA is necessary viewing or not, but I believe there is merit in making observations off the anime alone. And the show does attempt to make the best out of its 13 episodes, isolating a specific time period in order to deliver a narrative and thematic context one could understand as an entry point into the franchise. It\'s all just not very good.The anime\'s message carries noble intentions, but lacks meaning. Noblesse emphasizes the importance of setting aside our differences. All of us may come from various backgrounds, or possess unique traits. But no single member of mankind holds greater value than any other individual, nor is anyone entitled to unjustly take that value from someone else for personal gain. You and I are different, but you and I are the same, and should be treated as such. Throughout the series, there\'s this healthy lifestyle being promoted, showing how wonderful it is to live in peace and harmony with those around us. This is contrasted with the true enemy of Noblesse: systemically-corrupt organizations which represent dehumanization at its ugliest extreme. Be it greedy, soulless monsters or authority figures driven to irrationality, the antagonists of Noblesse abuse their powers at the expense of others. It\'s up to our boy Raizel and his crew to stand up for the little guy and maintain the balance. It\'s a solid message, and one that is certainly welcome in our politically-charged landscape. Let\'s not draw lines in the sand or discriminate, but go the distance to understand and love others instead. Let\'s join forces against systemic oppression, let\'s band together against the evils threatening to break us. The Noblesse OP sums up this idea through an emotionally-stirring refrain: ""So why does everybody hurt each other?"" These sweet sentiments sound an awful lot like propaganda, but there\'s no need to worry about things getting too preachy. Because while being thematically framed as propaganda, Noblesse undermines its own points by not saying much of anything at all.Now, I\'m going to be demonstrating how this series is lacking in the execution of its intended message. The following three points covered here aren\'t necessary to every story of this nature. Rather, they\'re here to highlight how the thematic storytelling fails to be convincing. Firstly, let\'s address Raizel and others of his kind. Noblesse implies countless differences between Nobles and humans, but doesn\'t give much for the audience to work with. For a show featuring Nobles for a significant chunk of the runtime, we sure know next-to-nothing about them, aside from their incredible powers and boomer mannerisms. Why is their society so secluded from the outside world? Why are they supposedly incompatible with the humans they once protected? How does their society, ideologies and way of life differ from ours? Are there negative repercussions should our worlds collide? I\'d like to think there are answers to these fascinating questions, but I just can\'t find them within this adaptation. The difference matters to the message, showing that anybody can see eye-to-eye and seek common ground. But there is no context, and as a result there\'s no real conflict between either party, rendering any commentary on this subject meaningless. Granted, it may not be fair to look from this perspective; even though the script seems like it would tackle this topic, neither of the show\'s two arcs really attempt to address this issue. So let\'s go ahead and talk about those instead; specifically, how they fail to portray moral ambiguity. Good and Evil are two ends of a spectrum, with the show\'s cast clumped together on either end. Bad people are capable of doing good things, and they can\'t simply abandon their flawed nature at the drop of a hat. But very rarely does the show burden itself with positioning our characters in the middle; there is no moral grey area. Noblesse chooses to play these concepts as straight as possible, watering-down the conversation to its most basic principles. For example, take the villains from the Union, some of whom are cold-blooded murderers who ingest pills that turn them into literal monsters, horrifyingly disfigured and dehumanized. There\'s no doubt in everyone\'s mind that Raizel would obliterate such cruel killers without a second thought. But the very moment one of the antagonists reveals some sign of humanity, their lives are immediately spared, and they suddenly become capable of doing no wrong. These moral questions are made to be as simple as possible, offering no substance in stating the obvious. What happens if you\'re on the bad end of the spectrum, and are finding it hard to work towards that harmonious middle ground? Well, Noblesse just throws up its hands in the air and adds nothing else to the subject. Those reformed characters from the Union are magically OK with their new social standings and doing good deeds, because that\'s how rehabilitation and life works, apparently. The third example I\'d like to point out is the show\'s assessment of what unity means. Raizel and his growing group of besties enjoy a quaint suburban life, but rarely do we see them make connections with normal human folk. Within Raizel\'s household, peeps from various backgrounds do interact with each other. But there\'s no real attempt at understanding each other, nor is there an apparent need to. There\'s no difficulty faced, nor adjustments made, nor compromises agreed upon. Similar to my first point, there is no conflict, and it\'s hard to care. Everyone\'s just happy chilling at home and at their workplace, instantly bonding without putting in any effort. Two teenage students who had grown acquainted with Raizel\'s crew almost served as the human core of the group, only to unceremoniously disappear entirely from the narrative, because Noblesse decided that it was a good time to throw in exposition about random in-world politics. Closest we get to mutual understanding between different groups of people is one line of exposition, which I believe embodies a lot of the issues I have with Noblesse\'s thematic half-measures. Raizel\'s butler, Frankenstein, clues one of the main characters in on a brief history of Nobles and humans, back in Episode 2. In describing the relationship between both races, Frankie claimed that humans were weak and solely dependent on the Nobles to survive. Now that Raizel has opened his horizons to see human life up-close, he clearly knows that hypothesis isn\'t true and realises how his native society\'s misconceptions are false. But that\'s just it, there was never any intention to convince the audience otherwise. Of course humans are not helpless, how could they be anything but? Noblesse prides itself in making digestible, weak arguments, expecting a pat on the back and thunderous applause. It hints at a greater conversation, but drains all nuance from it, to the point where most potential meaning is lost. I must apologize if you felt that you didn\'t really gain anything from this long-ass paragraph, because I know that feeling too. It\'s the experience I had with this show; Noblesse is ultimately a show about nothing.Critiquing Noblesse for what it attempts to do is marginally more interesting than what it actually is. A vast majority of Noblesse comes across as… a school-based SOL. That\'s right, this story is played straight to be a slice-of-life. This cast of powerful idiots are either commuting to school or playing House at Raizel\'s. Bursts of serious exposition regarding investigations or politics are often quickly interrupted by long stretches of repetitive comedy sketches. Cutting out all the times Raizel and his bros get called ""hot"" by every minor girl in the high school cohort would end up halving the season\'s episode count. Episode 7, the all-time low for the series, sees one of Raizel\'s fellow Noble getting crushed on by a student, followed by Raizel\'s chummy friends playing a basketball match. What makes these unfunny skits all the more annoying are the copy/pasted cast of characters. People might find Noblesse\'s non-personalities entertaining, and I\'d be inclined to agree if everyone wasn\'t a carbon copy of one another. Noblesse\'s crew of genetically-superior expository devices are the literary equivalent of ""Hey Man, Can I Copy Your Homework?"" Eccentricity is fun in small doses, but cramming in this cast of stock characters sucks any life or chemistry to be had in the group dynamic. This means that scenes play out exactly the same, because all of the characters in them are exactly the same. The VAs soft-spoken, stoic delivery makes this issue worse, as half the damn characters sound painfully indistinguishable from one another. Every good guy\'s vocal inflection is equally polite and devoid of all personality. It has been annoying to hear a huge chunk of the cast members talking like they\'re all auditioning for roles in a fujoshi-bait butler anime. Of course, I mean no offence to those who find pleasure in those sorts of things; if those BL shows are to your fancy, you could do far better than this bland bunch of refugees in a PTSD halfway house. You could also settle for more in the visuals department; Production I.G. phoned in their work with all the brilliant aesthetic of a 2010s Man of Action cartoon. Lighting is fine, but backgrounds and character designs leave much to be desired. The show goes as far as to reskin their characters\' supernatural abilities as much as possible, and the same goes for the repetitive backdrops of drab city skylines and stiff forests. The soundtrack is unmemorable, but I quite liked the opening and ending songs. The fact that the ED\'s K-Pop manages to be the best part of half of these anime episodes is pretty damning of the show\'s quality.Tl;Dr:""The most destructive criticism is indifference."" E.W. Howe. I\'d like to think I\'ve done my best to find something worth caring about in this show, but it appears that Noblesse seems less interested in its own story than I am. The series\' subtext is watered-down to merely stating the obvious, with holes distracting from any positive takeaways. It\'s a pandering script that fails to pander effectively, and an action show that feels like it barely has any to deliver. Noblesse is at times not a show with supernatural combat, but a stiff, unfunny SOL that\'s one sexual awakening away from turning into BL. Visuals are unappealing, music is unmemorable. Noblesse makes mistakes in almost every regard, but it\'s no trainwreck. And that\'s a damn shame, because at least it\'s fun to see things go off-the-rails with trashy shows. Instead, all I\'m left with after Noblesse, is sheer indifference. 3/10~***STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):- Out of the 12 eps we got (let\'s be honest, Ep 7 was a fkin OVA,) I only had a good time with one, Ep 8. Up till that point we barely had any info about who the Nobles are or where they were from, so the visit to Lukedonia was a refreshing change of scenery. We also had Young Frankenstein, who was the only fun character in the show…- …Until he wasn\'t. The episode immediately following saw the novelty of the flashback wear off, and the show\'s only strong character along with it. YF all but disappeared between episodes, and all we were left with was boring ol\' Frankie. I was disconnected from the rest of the episode, because the arc made zero sense! How does the Big Bad Bully of Lukedonia go from declaring his lifelong hatred for Nobles in one episode, to subservient servitude with zero complaints under a member of said Nobles? And what\'s more confusing is that the Blood Pact thing only happened at the end of Ep 9, which still leaves the question of what happened to YF during this time unanswered. This scene could have been a massive moment for the series, as Raizel and YF set aside their differences with their union. But again, the show just expects us to shut up and accept what\'s offered.- So remember how the Union hacker and the schoolboy hacker had this ""Aneki"" relationship, only for it to disappear with the memory wipe and never addressed again? God, this show was such a waste of time.- Rael really got his ass confined for 10 years over getting rejected. Fs in chat maybe, Idc.- Crunchyroll, Sony, Whomever I Need to Talk to: Please give your WebToon adaptations more episodes. Each of them needed more time to tell compelling stories, and all three fell short of that. Well, maybe more eps wouldn\'t have saved this script, but still.- BEST GIRL: No one really deserves this award, but I\'ll offer it to Young Frankenstein for being such a badass chad. Genuinely fun on-screen presence. Plus he\'s practically shipped with Raizel for life, and he definitely wears the pants in that relationship. YF, FTW.***And we\'re through with this show, good riddance. Really wasn\'t looking forward to covering this mess. I guess you can call me a WebToon completionist from now on, here\'s hoping I finally find more nice things to say about the state of these subpar adaptations. If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews for seasons past and present.

Have a Happy New Year, peace~', 'It\'s not uncommon for an anime to drift away from the adapted material. Sometimes it\'s good, sometimes very bad.When Crunchyroll announced the anime adaptations of 3 major webtoons — Tower of God, The God of High School and Noblesse, I was pretty thrilled. It was desire fulfilled of watching webtoons being animated. After watching numerous manga turning into anime, it was time to enjoy something new. But alas, it didn\'t work out well. So far, all the adaptations coproduced by Crunchyroll have been utter garbage. They\'ve done everything they can to promote themselves even if it hurdles the story or makes it less enjoyable....And Noblesse has been a victim of this.The very first OVA of Noblesse — Noblesse: Awakening, animated by Production I.G. is mesmerizing. Even though there were some minor details removed and the story was changed, it was amazing. Every single moment of that OVA was worth watching. I was really impressed with I.G. and was hoping they\'d do great with this anime too. Alas, I was mistaken.This adaptation of Noblesse is nothing more than to give hatred to webtoons in general. None of the adapted webtoons gave a sense of ""hype"" nor ""promote"" the webtoons. Here are some of the major faults in Noblesse anime:1. The anime started from the point where the OVA (Noblesse: Awakening) ended.They didn\'t bother to give some highlights of what happened before. Majority of the audience were clueless about the scenario and had to do a little bit of research before continuing. But not all of them were to energetic for it, as they simply dropped it and rated it 1 and moved on. Just shows how awful the direction of the first episode was.2. The anime changed the location from South Korea to Japan.Now this is something that sticks out for me. Why change the location entirely just because it\'s being animated in Japan? Personally, this felt like they\'re either trying to claim that Noblesse is a Japanese story or have a superior mentality that anything animated in Japan will have the details of Japan only. Which in my opinion, is a very bad move. Not only did they change the location, but also changed the names of the characters from Korean to Japanese. This also happened with Tower of God where Bam\'s name was changed to Yoru to accommodate a Japanese name. But that too was a bad idea.The idea of changing something entirely to a native perspective by discrediting the official name is disrespectful. It\'s like Japanese mangaka creating a new Batman story, but instead of naming Batman as Bruce Wayne, they name him Wozaru Koto. Did that make any sense? Nope. So, in general, I found this pretty bad and it made me enjoy the story less.3. The plot was changed as per the studio\'s need to adapt only certain things to fill in 13 episodes.It\'s not a new thing for the anime to be different than the adapted material. But to literally change everything? That\'s a no bueno. As far as I can see, they butchered major parts of the story. When the poster was revealed for the anime, Raskreia was also included in there. Which pretty much made me confirm that the anime was adapting everything till the end of Lukedonia. As a person who read the entire webtoon of Noblesse, I knew it was going to be horsecrap. The anime robbed us of key moments such as thrills, excitement, and the joy of learning something new in the story by skipping most of the things.4. The characters are weird, weak and too emotional.After watching Episode 13, I couldn\'t help but facepalm. They made Raskreia out of all characters to be a normal girl with feelings. No, that\'s not the Raskreia we know. In the webtoon, Raskreia doesn\'t know it\'s Cadis who has infiltrated in Lukedonia until he steps in the tomb room. She does have the idea that Cadis was a traitor, but doesn\'t know his whereabouts for centuries. She\'s mostly shown as a proud character who can take her own decisions without hesitation. Though she does take a few bad decisions. And for the love of god, she doesn\'t grovel like a girl who has just been dumped by her crush. So far, all I saw was how they belittled the anime that it\'s not even funny to laugh at.5. Character DesignsAlmost 50% of the characters shown in the anime have a weak design as compared to the webtoon. Raizel\'s entire body is weak, with his hair being totally different; Seira\'s face and hair are different; Gejutel\'s beard is different; etc. In short, their main plan to make the anime bad worked.6. Voice ActorsNow, I don\'t really want to be picky in terms of voices, but I need to state it. The studio didn\'t do a good job hiring appropriate voice actors. In my opinion, it felt as if they just chose whoever signed up for it. When reading the webtoon, I always read Regis\' lines in the voice of Toshiro from Bleach, since it resembles him a bit. But here, the impact wasn\'t the same, but it wasn\'t that bad either. And Karias\' voice was very different. That I didn\'t like.In the end, I\'d like to say that this was a very adaptation of the webtoon. Crunchyroll did a very bad job in promoting it. Though they got what they wanted — Publicity. If you\'re wondering to watch the anime of Noblesse, I suggest you stop right away. You\'ll miss out on a lot of things and won\'t get the joy of reading the original story. That is all. And Noblesse has been a victim of this.The very first OVA of Noblesse — Noblesse: Awakening, animated by Production I.G. is mesmerizing. Even though there were some minor details removed and the story was changed, it was amazing. Every single moment of that OVA was worth watching. I was really impressed with I.G. and was hoping they\'d do great with this anime too. Alas, I was mistaken.This adaptation of Noblesse is nothing more than to give hatred to webtoons in general. None of the adapted webtoons gave a sense of ""hype"" nor ""promote"" the webtoons. Here are some of the major faults in Noblesse anime:1. The anime started from the point where the OVA (Noblesse: Awakening) ended.They didn\'t bother to give some highlights of what happened before. Majority of the audience were clueless about the scenario and had to do a little bit of research before continuing. But not all of them were to energetic for it, as they simply dropped it and rated it 1 and moved on. Just shows how awful the direction of the first episode was.2. The anime changed the location from South Korea to Japan.Now this is something that sticks out for me. Why change the location entirely just because it\'s being animated in Japan? Personally, this felt like they\'re either trying to claim that Noblesse is a Japanese story or have a superior mentality that anything animated in Japan will have the details of Japan only. Which in my opinion, is a very bad move. Not only did they change the location, but also changed the names of the characters from Korean to Japanese. This also happened with Tower of God where Bam\'s name was changed to Yoru to accommodate a Japanese name. But that too was a bad idea.The idea of changing something entirely to a native perspective by discrediting the official name is disrespectful. It\'s like Japanese mangaka creating a new Batman story, but instead of naming Batman as Bruce Wayne, they name him Wozaru Koto. Did that make any sense? Nope. So, in general, I found this pretty bad and it made me enjoy the story less.3. The plot was changed as per the studio\'s need to adapt only certain things to fill in 13 episodes.It\'s not a new thing for the anime to be different than the adapted material. But to literally change everything? That\'s a no bueno. As far as I can see, they butchered major parts of the story. When the poster was revealed for the anime, Raskreia was also included in there. Which pretty much made me confirm that the anime was adapting everything till the end of Lukedonia. As a person who read the entire webtoon of Noblesse, I knew it was going to be horsecrap. The anime robbed us of key moments such as thrills, excitement, and the joy of learning something new in the story by skipping most of the things.4.

That is all.', ""Before I start the review, I do want to say that this is from the first four episodes. So take it as you can. But let me explain my thoughts on Noblesse so far.It's...OK at best so far, it's certainly a much slower pacing than GOH that is for sure, but wouldn't call it a bad show, more something I bet as it goes along, will spawn into a much higher rating then I am giving it currently. I am enjoying it, but wouldn't say it's a top 5 of the season at all.The story...It's hard to describe really, since the plot moves at...such a slow pace, while it gives you time to learn and accept all that is happening, the slow moving can be a little off putting to some. So far we know that there is a secret organization finally making their move in order for world conquest, using modified humans to do such, and need to eliminate a few that would be in the way of such, while our main MC whom hardly speaks at all, tries to learn about modern life through school. Along with a colourful cast of characters around him to boot.The characters so far are actually pretty fun. The MC is a laugh with how he doesn't talk at all, While someone like Han is a really great character that you can respect for who he is, and his strong sense of goodness. It's good stuff there. Some may look bland also, but there are a fair few that do carry the show in a better light.As for the art? It's good, they really did a good job when it comes to making sure each scene is either bright, or dark and grim to fit the mood. Much like the sounds of the show in general.Should you watch? I'd say yes, while it might not look like much at first going, but I'm sure as it continues, it'll grow into something even better. such a slow pace, while it gives you time to learn and accept all that is happening, the slow moving can be a little off putting to some.

It had style, it had development, it was a really good read. So imagine my disappointment when I got THIS instead of a good adaptation. And here I am, telling you why you should just go and read the original and not waste your time here.Story. The source story can hardly be called sophisticated or deep, but it was descent. But in adaptation there are a few problems, and the first one starts even before the anime itself: the first arc of web manga...is an OVA so this ""first season"" of anime already starts after some events and you have to go and watch it. Second problem: lots of things got thrown out. I am ok with throwing out jokes, maybe some details, but in that case even some of the characters were thrown out entirely. While I could agree that they were not major characters in the story, still not seing them here feels rather sad. Apart from characters, way too many detailes got tossed under the buss, that added a lot into the world, and now said world looks like a blanket with lots of small holes - not great. But for some reason, some absolutely discardable moments were kept, and that created a third big problem - pacing, cause the plot either rushes like a madman, or suddenly stops like a stubborn mule. This all made me, the watcher, really confused, even though I am one of those who actually knew the plot beforehand.Art - simple, way too simple. I understand that animating is hard, but when web comic has better fights and special effects - why did you even bother to adapt such a hard thing for you to make? Just grab another slice of life where you can manage without a single effect or bright colour.Sound - uninsipiring and boring. Plain and generic.Character - as I said earliers, lots of things got cut. What is even more insulting - lots of things were not showed properly, like some character moments lacked tension, some lacked emotion. To be honest, I think that even for someone who has no clue about the original, characters will come off as boring and plain. For people who read the source - it is simply insulting.Enjoyment - fast skipping forward and going to re-read the source. Waste of time, waste of efford, waste of potential.Overall - don\'t bother, just read the original, it is really good. is an OVA so this ""first season"" of anime already starts after some events and you have to go and watch it.

Is it because the fan-girls? or Is it because of the theme? cool and badass MC?The answer is yes and no. It is yours to judge.For a long time fan such as myself, was it...worth the wait? The answer is surely yes. Noblesse is one of the most memorable series for me because of the uniqueness of their characters. And the story? You will know it later why it's so intriguing for a vampire-supernatural theme.Okay. now let's focus on the anime---------------------------------------------------------The story was set clear that it points out the after-story of Noblesse:Awakening. Let's just say the prequel is so essential to the part of the story. And it's a MUST to watch. You must be a fool if you didn't watch it first.So how's the change between the 4 years gap of production?I'd say this has been the better than all ToG and GoH adaptationsThe episodes so far had a decent pace for a shonen-genre, and the prequel already filled the empty gap between the introduction of the characters, so far it's very decently paced even though they did cut some stuff which is for me unnecessary stuffs (like they changed the setting to nippon instead of korea and cutting Yuna entirely), the good thing is the humor element included in the anime so far has been really really on point. You'd be surprised how funny Frankenstein's reaction is.Rai's design in the anime also looks cleaner and more suitable with his character, with his eye is the signature expression from him.The animation looks a standard fantastic Production IG's level, & the sound was absolutely flawless, love how it resonance the vampires medieval times. My favorite part is the logo. The logo looks dope especially after they used it as a transitional scene, that's something they need to use every now and then. It gives a strong vampire vibes too.At last, Noblesse so far is absolutely a banger, and it keeps getting better until the true action will come up, and it makes me want to higher up my expectation. But I still won't.Let's just hope they keep it good this way.NOTICE: I may change the review & score depends on how every episodes will gonna be. worth the wait? The answer is surely yes.

Not much actions, but solid art + lovely characters.Story is very much like 1/3 Bleach + 1/3 Overlord + 1/3 One punch man. Interestingly, MC doesn't get much attention while other side characters get more scenes. Many people complain about the phase, but from ep5, it started to burn fiercely.In sum:Qualities of art, characters, animation are definitely top notchs....About sound, it is decent. Especially I love op and ed songs.Story is typical shonen manga, but very unique. It is getting better and better, so at the end, I am sure this show will be one of the top anime in this season. Even now, it is a lot highly rated by people in Japan. It is probably about cultural preferences between Eastern (value more about story building up + need more time for emotional attachments for characters) vs Western (immediate action + cool visual animation).

Look, I only saw 4 episodes, which is only 1/3 of the season or whatever, and who knows? Maybe the next 8 episodes are masterpieces. But no matter, I still couldn\'t enjoy this as much I wanted to. I really wanted to enjoy this, but I couldn\'t. Noblesse has loads of love on the webtoon, but this? This only let us know Webtoons as anime doesn\'t go well. What they most suffered from was a rushed pacing as they only could work with 13...episodes. I think Crunchyroll was the reason for that so they\'re the blame, otherwise they\'re okay. I thought Tower of God was fine, but disliked God of Highschool. They both were so rushed that it ruined the series and left a bitter taste after seeing the series. And yet, Noblesse isn\'t rushed?Noblesse has over 9 on webtoon. Obviously you can\'t compare that with the anime, but it\'s still pretty damn hard to see why. Noblesse is incredibly slow which is weird as hell unless they\'re adapting 1 episode per... episode? But seriously this is weird and just ridiculous.Story 3/10Like I said before, Noblesse suffered from an incredibly slow story. You\'d probably get news about Noblesse\'s announcement from Internet Explorer faster than Noblesse\'s story. That\'s weird as hell. I expected to get the story immediately after the past 2 webtoon anime, but it wasn\'t. Isn\'t there so much content to use? Don\'t you only have 13 episodes? Seriously? And I\'m gonna be honest and say I\'d rather have a confusing, but speedy anime rather than a non-progressive plot. Even though I didn\'t like GOH I still kinda enjoyed it because at least we saw something.Not only is the pacing horrendous, but the actual story is just... bad...I mean look at the premise of Noblesse:""Raizel wakes up after a 820 year slumber...""Mmhmm...""...and enrolls into a high school.""Never mind...Seriously, doesn\'t that seem lame as hell? However the noble thing got me intrigued and so I started watching, but I expected a lackluster story. And I was still disappointed. Yes the plot isn\'t any better. And the main reason is because literally nothing happens. As well as the pacing that makes snails seem FTL, all it seems like is some weird slice-of-life with superpowers. Noblesse is supposed to be some action-battle story and yet we see none of that. Isn\'t there some bad guys you need to get rid of? Why am I stuck seeing some moron worry if his friend is gay? Really? Is this what you want to do? But hey, you do you. The slice-of-life itself isn\'t really that entertaining either. It\'s just stuff that made me question whatever the hell I just saw. I have seen 1hr and 20min of content and nothing? Come on.And the fact that there\'s barely any plot makes me have qeustions. Like for example, how the hell was Raizel asleep for 820  years to begin with? Who are these random bad guys? Why did these people sleep for 820 years too? Or are they? But that is a stupid point of me to make anyway since there\'s no way I should expect that to be answered to 4 episodes, but at least the curiosity of this show is more entertaining than the plot of this.Art: 7/10The art actually looks decent though. It\'s definitely a good style that gives a nice serious seinen vibe. It looks great to look at and the background art isn\'t bad either. The animation is okay, but there\'s not much action to show it off at all. There\'s no reason why you would be disappointed with the art so you won\'t go ""Ewwww"" at all (yet) so that\'s fine. Although that guy whose friends with the red haired dude? The one with the longish hair? It\'s nothing new, but I was confused at this guy\'s gender because of the way he was depicted. It was confusing, but just a head\'s up, he\'s a guy (maybe)Sound 6/10Not much to say? OST isn\'t bad, but not memorable. OP is okay but the start sounded like some weirdo trying to hold in a sneeze while crying and choking at his tears. Or trying to hold in a laugh because it\'s so easy it laugh when you are in moments when you shouldn\'t. Other that that it is okay. Ending was okay too.Character 3/10Raizel is some calm guy. Others are the exact same, just one is more angry. The red-haired guy is good, but he can be irritating. There really isn\'t much depth to the characters nor any ambition or... anything else. The bad guys are just random guys. Why does every girl need to go ""OMG THAT GUY IS SO HOT11!!!11!!""? Why can\'t the red-haired guy mind his own business? Don\'t dms people in someone else\'s account. The characters are just bland with nothing to them. They really aren\'t entertaining and it\'s hard to look forward to them coming on screen. There\'s nothing to say about them because they\'re that boring. Wait, there\'s some obsession with ramen! That\'s all I know about them.

The action scenes are awesome and there is humor sparkled around plus the character relationships are !!!!What I like about it is how mysterious it isYou're thrown in the middle of things so you're taken on a journey to get to know what happened as well as witnessing...the current events. I mean up until the 10th episode and we still don't really know the true identity of the characters.

I mean up until the 10th episode and we still don't really know the true identity of the characters.

I was laughing so hard each episode. If, however, you don't find this show funny, then it'll immediately drop to a 2/10 or worse. This show is a train-wreck dumpster fire that my brain just interpreted as satire of yaoi-shojou-vampire anime regardless if it is or not.If you don't take it seriously and laugh at all the dumb sh*t that happens, you're in for a fun time. If you don't see what's on screen as funny, you're going to be miserable. There is no in between, and I'm just happy I ended up in the former category.9/10 can't...wait for the next season! wait for the next season!"", 'Here we are now with the third and final part of Crunchyroll’s trilogy of Manhwa/Webtoon adaptations, Noblesse. The final pillar to put Webtoon adaptations on the map. While there is no doubt they\'ve certainly captured people’s attention, their quality unfortunately cannot match their popularity and have been disappointments from a narrative standpoint. So I was hoping that Noblesse was able to end this trilogy on a high note but unfortunately, it ended with a silent thud to the ground.Sit back, relax and sparkle in the sunshine to wow all of the girls as I present to you the anime review for Noblesse. Let’s begin.Story: 3/10Living...in isolation from humanity exists a group of powerful beings known as Nobles who exist to act as guardians for humanity. However, there is a one particular Noble who acts as the protector of said Nobles. The title for this task is called, Noblesse. This Noble is named Raizel, who has awakened from his 820-year slumber. With the help of his servant, Frankenstein, he enrols at a high school to keep himself hidden and learn more about the human world. However, when a secret organisation housing modified humans called Union and the Nobles start learning about his awakening, Raizel must use his immense powers to protect himself and those around him.Now I had the problem when starting out of not watching the Noblesse ONA titled, “Noblesse: Awakening,” beforehand. Which would have been handy after watching episode one. But anyways, onto the rest of the story, which is honestly really boring and rather incosistent. I say this because the show doesn’t seem to decide whether or not it wants to be a high school centric series or a supernatural action series. And yet both are really boring to watch because it feels like there is just no stakes nor proper growth as well as being very slow to begin with. There is no sense of tension nor drama as people after Raizel close in. There is some drama, don’t get me wrong, but it just isn’t impactful in a way to get my attention. This is mainly due to the characters not being all that engaging with meh personalities and a little bit of Raizel and Frankenstein being a little bit overpowered to make the situation less tense. Things just kind of happen with lacklustre build up to it to make the antagonists of this series a little more menacing and come across as threats that only Raizel and Frankenstein can deal with. Instead, the narrative makes them look like pushovers.But my biggest gripe is how the narrative can make the characters both important and unimportant at the same time. For example, Raizel is obviously the central character who the whole situation with Noblesse is based around. Yet he always feels like a background character and only takes centre stage when the situation needs it. He never feels like the significant character the show hypes him up to be so when he does take centre stage, it doesn’t invoke a, “Oh you’re f**ked now,” moment that this show clearly wants to portray it as. Same goes for other characters like Raizel’s school friends like Shin-Woo Han or Ik-Han Woo who act as the central figureheads for Raizel learning more about humainity.Characters: 3/10What can you say about Raizel? Like seriously, what can you say about him? The guy has no personality to speak of and doesn’t really talk much. He doesn’t invoke a sense of emotion and mainly sits in the background letting the other characters talk. I wouldn’t necessarily mind that if HE WAS NOT THE CENTRAL MAIN CHARACTER. Considering that the majority of things happen are because of his awakening, you would think that he would take a more front row seat. But he doesn’t and he doesn’t really change while living in human society so there is no sense of picking up some human habits. Well, besides his one quirk for loving Ramen. Whereas another character like the Noble, Regis, shows some kind of growth living with humans. But not Raizel, so it was really hard to get invested into a guy who doesn’t show a lick of emotion.Now, one of my main criticisms with this show is the cast’s chemistry with one another because they don’t really have chemistry with one another. It does come across as forced most of the time as their personalities don’t bounce off one another to create some nice character moments. They’re kind of just cardboard cutouts at times talking to each other while trying to convey some emotion. The one exception I would say though is the relationship between Regis and former member of Union, M-21. They at least have chemistry with one another due to their distaste for one another slowly turning into one of trust throughout the show. It’s probably one of the good points from this show and helped make Regis and M-21 more enjoyable characters to watch compared to the rest of the cast.The rest of the cast don’t share this factor with one another. Raizel’s human friends, Shin and Han, don’t gel with Raizel or the rest of the cast and act as more comic relief characters. They do get character moments of their own but they just fall by the wayside and their significance drops in the second half where they could have been pretty useful adding that innocent human element in there. Frankenstein, Raizel’s personal assistant, is alright I guess and does have an intriguing backstory about how he and Raizel first met. But that’s just it, he’s alright. Seira, another Noble, is kind of like Raizel as she has a lack of personality but with a bit more flare to it and is more upfront about things. Now, to reiterate, the characters themselves (besides Raizel) are okay but they just don’t have a sense of chemistry with one another.The antagonists are, like a said earlier, pretty much pushovers and aren’t really interesting to get me to hate them. The Union members that hunt down Raizel are a bit comical honestly and come across as a wacky Batman villains, but with none of the charm. The Nobles are more black and white but there “conflict” when it comes to their opinion on Raizel comes across really hollow because there personalities come across as really boring and don’t come across as threatening like they should be.Animation: 7/10The animation is the usual Production I.G. affair. Which means it does look very polished. Their is definitely a clean look to the show which does help with some of the character designs like Raizel. But that polished look does make the action rock solid, the background art look nice and I’m a particular fan of animation effects used to demonstrate the power of some characters like Frankenstein. Again, it does have that polished look to make the animation not a concern and one of the more positive points about the show. The character designs though are a bit on the generic side and it is very clear with their designs what kind of personality they have. It may help differentiate each other but it does make them look uninspired. On a side note, does Shin remind you that he looks like a red headed version of Ichigo from Bleach?Sound: 8/10Looking back at the ost for this review, I was surprised at how varied it was. The ost uses a variety of instruments for both it’s atmospheric, downtime and action scenes. It doesn’t use them at the same time but uses them for it’s own separate piece to make it stand out from the others and it kind of works. It doesn’t blend into one another but rather makes them stand out in their own way. My favourite ones is whenever they use an electric guitar to make the action more ferocious.In terms of the opening, I’ve been slowly warming up to it as the show went on and has become one of my favourites this season. ""BREAKING DAWN"" by Jae Joong is a very visually solid and sounding opening that does take a bit to get into the groove of it but when it clicks is when I think it becomes an enjoyable opening. It is mainly carried by Jae Joong’s singing as the visuals themselves are nothing to write home about but the song and vocal performance just make it feel better to watch and they do match with the pace of the song. So overall, good opening that does take a bit to get into.The ending, ""Etoile"" by OH MY GIRL, is alright. It uses real life props panning to the right with a gothic feel to it. It’s is pretty cool and it has a variety of props. So it is a unique opening that I did watch not every episode but every now and then.ConclusionNoblesse is a show that is fundamentally okay and does have a couple of positive things to it but ultimately, I was just really bored watching it. The narrative and the characters just didn’t do enough to get me invested into the narrative. My main issue is Raizel himself. I honestly think that he would have worked better as a character who was with alongside the main protagonist (while still being a main character) rather than being the main protagonist himself, because he just doesn’t work as that main protagonist and brings the whole show down honestly. It’s not that I don’t hate Noblesse as there is nothing really to hate. It’s just a meh show with some good production values and does not excel at anything really; which to be the third part of the Manhwa adaption trilogy, is not something I really wanted to say by the end.My Personal Enjoyment: 2/10Overall score: 4.6/10 Recommendation: Don’t BotherTo wrap this review up, I just want to say how I feel about this Crunchyroll, Webtoon experiment.This whole experiment has been one of the more defining aspects of anime 2020. But the question is, has it been a success? Well from viewing standpoint, it definitely has caught people’s attention and it has been some of the most widely viewed anime this year. But from a critical standpoint, these shows have not lived up to the hype. Now I like Tower of God, but as time goes on and we still haven’t had the announcement of season 2 yet, the more sour I’m on this series because the narrative is clearly unfinished and is left on an unsatisfying note. It needs a season 2 BADLY. The God of High School is still MAPPA’s best work from an animation standpoint but the rushed story and dry characters left The God of High School as this year’s most disappointing anime. Noblesse is a very meh series with good production values but a very weak MC that brings down the whole narrative.It has become what I feared it would be and what half of anime are these days. Glorified advertisement for the source material. Unless we do get sequels, this is what they are ultimately going to be regarded as, especially Tower of God. Like is said, calling this a success or failure depends on how you are looking at this experiment. Attention wise, yes. Critically wise, no. I certainly don’t think this has been a successful venture because I mainly watch anime and if I think the anime aren’t particularly good, then getting barely 1 out of 3 right isn’t what I call a success. Tower of God was the attention grabber, The God of High School was the crowd displeaser and Noblesse was the silent thud on the ground that nobody cared about. in isolation from humanity exists a group of powerful beings known as Nobles who exist to act as guardians for humanity. However, there is a one particular Noble who acts as the protector of said Nobles. The title for this task is called, Noblesse. This Noble is named Raizel, who has awakened from his 820-year slumber.

After watching the OVA and the first four episodes, it was clear that I was too much hyped. Everything seems to be cliche in this anime.The characters: you have the main one, a quiet and powerful Noble, which compensates for his lack of dialogue and his incredible strength with comical situations to fill the void (with ramen or vacuum cleaner for example). Then a nice delinquent with bleached hair and his little geek friend (with a generic voice that I can't stand) or...Regis, a tsundere, who argue all the time with M-21. The villains are a bunch of walking cliche too.Yes. This is only the beginning of the story but how can I be excited about the next episode when everything is predictable? Still, the first few minutes of the first episode were catchy with a lively and pleasant pace but the presentation of the characters then takes too much space on the story and slows down the plot. Many of the scenes are repetitive, slow, and not very interesting.

Those interesting factors/ deep plot that the author has taken time to create.. isn't present. As with the other two adaptions this year... my money is on  the fact they cut a lot of content. All 3 Manhwa adaptions have suffered from cut content/ poor pacing and rushing. It shows... the plot feels thin, characters feel static, art is poor, focus shifts too much and it doesn't spend enough time building anything.This anime is ok ... Its mediocre I cant call it bad or good its neither  ... every episode - I just felt underwhelmed  and frustrated because I could see the potential they skipped or didn't spent enough time on.  The few fights we do get should have been more.It suffers with very slow pacing. The opening episode could have been more thrilling... if they had just changed pacing. We open with a lone survivor in a jungle at night...pacing could of been slowed to really build up the moment he was hunted down. Really build it up to show the Union group of more. Show of talents, build their characters right of the bat. Instead it was rushed to jump ahead.The rest of the episode is spent on a very cliche setting in school. Showing us swooning girls over any male character... not even delving into aspects that could make the school setting entertaining to watch. School anime isn't my usual preference.... but this anime just makes it boring... the school doesn't feel lively/real the rest of the class often serves as stills... they are nameless.. I cant even recall if they have a teacher haha.Yuu and Manabu were given the main focus for a bit and the anime did an ok job developing them both. But then they shelved them to rush ahead.My biggest problem with the anime is the characters... Fair play the anime wants to do a slow reveal on the mains. But everything comes across as flat...Characters don't feel deep or well written... they feel 2 dimensional.The anime hasn't taken time to develop characters bar the basics. They did a fair job at developing M-21... and slowly the relationships between some of the characters ... but it was done in a snail paced manner. And then rushed ahead when they were doing the character building. M-21's character is full of potential to be interesting... a created human who has to find a meaning for his life now he has been dis guarded by the union who made him. Plenty of room to bring in a philosophical angle. And really push what it means to be human.The main character is very reserved and this can be fine, but you dont see him do anything until episode 5... He may as well not be in the anime up until then because the character is drained of anything that makes him interesting. We spend more time following from Yuus point of view in some episodes that it felt like he was more the main.The group who serve as antagonists for the first half of the season are watered down and rushed. The members they want to be evil...are just simple evil bad for the sake of it. Shark likes killing people because.  Hammer is gluttony from FMA. He clearly has a well written backstory with powers and a really interesting weapon.. but we see him wiped out so fast it doesn't matter. There is a point where he breaks logic and manifests characters out of thin air. Which I blame cut content on.The anime really wants to build Krantz up to be our big bad for the first half .... but it fails to hit the mark. By the time we hit a face off with Raz and him .,..which is over in about a minute.  Krantz barely has screen time. So when it came down to the fight between yes two characters who had barely any screen time... it wasn't impactful. I don't hate Krantz enough to care ... and Raz has barely been present that I don't actively cheer him on or worry about his safety.The art in the Manhwa is stunning... the anime... not so much ... theres a lot of times where things look blurred... the animation is not great. Some of the screenshots from the fights look awful. Which really is a shame because when I was debating watching it initally the art was something I was tricked by. Where Tower of Gods Manhwa art was improved in its adaption... this is the sad opposite where that beautiful art is demoted. You simply have to type in Frankenstein or Raziel and see the beautiful art work for them to understand.Things have started to get interesting and some world building and plot is being developed but ... its episode 8 .... its a little to late. There are 4 episodes left to come to some form of ending.There are many better school animes/ slice of lifes/ action based animes out there to watch. Who do a much better job on all fronts. I really think if you want to give Noblesse a shot... just pick up the Manhwa. plot meanders... when something cool or important does actually happen...its over so quickly...  Note I love slice of life... so even if we give it a pass for being a quite arc that is light on action... it still fails as a slice of life, because it doesn't focus in on things long enough.The plot itself is something I can understand why the Manhwa  is one of the giants... You have humans/ A race of Nobles who have some pretty unique powers/ weapons and very interesting clan systems. These guys have long life spans.

I hoped there would be more considering of how people hyped up the show to be. However, the show had really good characters and the story was written nicely in my opinion.And in the fight scenes that occurred, they were choreographed very well and i enjoyed the show a lot.I was confused by the first episode because there wasn't any back story and the show just started but I searched online...and found that i had to watch a prequel that aired in 2016 and after i watched that I understood what was going on.So before you watch the main show make sure to watch the prequel first.I would recommend people to watch this and I'd give it a 7/10 and found that i had to watch a prequel that aired in 2016 and after i watched that I understood what was going on.So before you watch the main show make sure to watch the prequel first.I would recommend people to watch this and I'd give it a 7/10"", ""So, let me just first say it's super annoying to see someone review a show 4 episodes in.  Just don't review it if you're not going to give it a proper chance.  Second, it's even more annoying when they talk about it being slow during the four first episodes then a few sentences later gripe at how too much was skipped.   I mean for real?Now that I have that out of the way let me just clarify a few things...  First of all, don't start with this season - this is not where the story begins.  There is a...Noblesse OVA that should have been listed as episode 1 or 0 or something.  To no fault of the series itself, but Crunchyroll rather they split this up, so for someone that missed that OVA it could be quite confusing going into this.  If you watch the OVA however, you should be fine, as yes all is not revealed in the first 3 or so episodes so you may not understand everything, but that's ok.  Let it tell the story and it will reveal more as it goes along, it's part of story-telling after all.Secondly, I'll just note that I watched the OVA years ago and LOVED it.  I'm sure to someone who had already finished the webtoon they may have felt too much was left out, but for someone that had never even heard of the series, I fell in love with the series and that OVA is the only reason I went and read the webtoon at all, so no I can't say the OVA is bad at all.  I think it's great.Having said that I do feel like the art and fluidity (in the animation) of this season is not on par with the OVA.  I thought the OVA was beautifully animated.  Seeing someone walk was more natural and well, the characters just looked better too. Not sure why they gave Rai a haircut in the series either as he was perfect in the OVA.  I do think they could improve in this area, and should use the OVA as a reference of how to do it right.Now, just note this series is an action series with some drama and humor mixed in.  And once you are accustomed to the series, it's actually nicely done and becomes funnier.  I will also admit the first few episodes will feel slow, they are just getting you accustomed to the characters and things that are currently ongoing.  I'm now around 11episodes in and every one of the last several episodes has been fantastic, as we are now past the intros and all the setup and are getting into the thick of the story, and it's really good.I can assure you this series is extremely action packed and has some amazing characters, an interesting storyline and some beyond epic battles.  Like with most good things, just be patient with it though.  Let it tell the story and help familiarize you with characters because then the events that happen around them later will be that much more meaningful and exciting for you.Seeing the animation that came out for God of High School and Jujutsu Kaisen, I can't say this is the best anime of the season....but I can say if you  give it time I definitely think you'll find it quite enjoyable, as it's a unique spin on the typical vampire story and the characters you'll meet are well worth the ride!

They removed main characters, top moments of the series, terrible pacing and just butchering the sauce material including the stupid idea to carry on from the ova as they could have made a well paced season but having it finish after the they fight DA-5 if they had adapted it correctly it would have been an even more epic fight and a great way to finish the season and have a tease with Dr Aris for the start of next season. Instead they are cutting out entire arcs to get to...the Lukdonia content. Read the webtoon but skip the anime. the Lukdonia content. Read the webtoon but skip the anime.', ""Having read the webtoon ages ago and only remembering certain key points of it, I decided to dive in despite reading all about the pacing issues or how bad this show was. Ironically, it ended up being a hell of a lot better than other webtoon shows that aired recently. I'm looking at you, The God of High School and made me feel nostalgic for the day when I read the manhwa.The thing about Noblesse is that you have to watch the OVA first because that provides you a view into the overall situation and a good starting point for the story. I don't...have much to say about either the OP or ED, but Rai is exactly how I pictured he would be. Elegant, charming, soft spoken etc... He's the kind of character that you want to be the MC. Just his presence there radiates badass and really dials things up a notch. Once you add in Frankenstein, you already have a golden pair. You honestly can't hate this duo especially when you get feed more information about who they are, their motivations and how things came to be.The pacing is also pretty fair, but they could also speed things up a notch. There is a lot of information out there considering the manhwa is over 400 chapters at least (only read so much of it) and a faster pace wouldn't hurt much so long as they keep the major scenes which to my limited knowledge, they have. Information dissemination has been pretty great so far and it feels like the story has been shaping up nicely.The animation seems pretty alright and doesn't detract from the experience either from my perspective. The only thing that the story will suffer from later on is being a bit repetitive, but this was also a webtoon that was released a long time ago and would've benefited greatly from airing in past years. Still, if you like great MCs, fantastic fight scenes, and are ok with a bit of repetitiveness as an interesting story opens up, then Noblesse is for you! have much to say about either the OP or ED, but Rai is exactly how I pictured he would be.

Unfortunately, the nature of this problem is pervasive, and it keeps any other part of the anime from being redeeming.Story (3/10) and Characters (2/10): I\'ve been informed by people who read the Webtoon that this adaptation is of Season 2. While I did watch the OVA that summarized Season 1, it did almost nothing to set up the story or any of the characters in any meaningful way. The main cast, the relationships between whom seem to drive...a lot of the story, end up as boring planks of wood that carry no weight whatsoever behind their actions. The protagonist, Raizel, is the plankiest of them all. Ten episodes into what is supposed to be the second season of the story there is still no reason to be invested in him as a character, and that is an inexcusable flaw. His existence only makes sense if you don\'t think too much about it, and his decisions seem to be made with zero forethought or reasoning other than seeking to prove that he is ""kind."" His relationships with human characters are supposed to drive all of his actions and provide meaning to his otherwise boring existence, but such relationships were not set up properly by a first season and so he is entirely pointless as a character. The only member of the main cast that shows any promise is M-21, and even then he suffers from the same problems of not being properly introduced by a first season.Art (6/10) and Sound (5/10): Actual fights look decent. The animation is strange and awkward most of the time, and it\'s clear that most of the budget was saved for instances where Raizel uses his power. While it does look great, making everything else suffer for it is a questionable decision. The sound is a non-factor, as most sound effects are stock-standard and none of the VAs stand out. The show\'s opening isn\'t anything special either, and I skip it every time.I\'ve enjoyed Noblesse the least of any of the three Webtoon adaptations we\'ve gotten thus far, because while GoH\'s pacing and development was similarly horrid, its fights were immaculate and there were elements of hype to speak of. This goes to show that Tower of God did not signify the beginning of a new era, since it so far has been the only adaptation done well enough to capture my attention completely.Enjoyment: 3/10Overall: 4/10 a lot of the story, end up as boring planks of wood that carry no weight whatsoever behind their actions.

I'm sure people who haven't read the manhwa (Korean version of manga) you may be tired of the people who have crying about it not living up to, or missing large parts of the original story.Well I wont discuss the missing story, that has been covered by others, plus I don't think its all too bad. However my reason for giving this anime adaptation such a low score is the very poor way it showed the fundamental events which it did include. This was especially apparent in the final few episodes. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!The final few episodes covered the event...which was meant to show Raskreia receiving some much needed guidance (even though she is not aware in the beginning) from Gejutel and then Raizel himself. This whole event was wrecked by the anime which means that one of the first defining moments in the Noblesse story was wrecked. The Gejutel's 'tough love' from the manhwa was turned into a simple 'I failed to educate you' let-down of a speech. Rai's iconic blood field back and forth with Raskreia was turned into a bulls**t lackluster fight scene between him, the Lord and the elders. Rai then almost faints (WTF!!!) he bleeds from the eyes and mouth which tugs at our heart strings but my boy stands strong and doesn't faint!!!! And then the previous Lord explaining why we made the offer he did to Raizel (not gonna say what as I'm really trying to be as spoiler light as I can) so that Raskreia can understand her fathers true wish for her, where the f*** was that whole scene?! poof gone. This also has the unfortunate effect of making the characters involved feel much shallower, crybaby Raskreia now, great. There were many other scenes I could pick apart in much the same way (like the Frankenstein and Rajak fight and appearance in the sanctuary) but I'll leave it. What I've written should hopefully be enough to explain my viewpoint.So to those who haven't read the Manhwa and have enjoyed your introduction into the Noblesse world through this anime, if you enjoyed it then thats fantastic, truly. I would say that if you ever get the chance to read even just the sanctuary scene in the manhwa, you should! It will give you a much better look at the Rai/Previous Lord/Raskreia dynamic. Even if your not a big manhwa reader, if your loving this story, you owe it to yourself to at least read up this scene as it should have been. which was meant to show Raskreia receiving some much needed guidance (even though she is not aware in the beginning) from Gejutel and then Raizel himself.

For an anime only watcher the series was quite good. I read the WEBTOON and I thought the anime was fine. The story was a bit fast paced and some parts were cut but I don’t some of them were relevant while other could have been squeezed in. Too many saying there isn’t content for season 2 clearly are anime only watchers because there is a lot more stuff and a season is definitely possible but considering somethings turned out that’s up in the air....I personally really enjoyed it. It was like a refresher now I’m going to go reread the WEBTOON. It’s really my favorite I enjoyed all of the characters and I think you should personally just watch it yourself.

In order to protect him, his servant Frankenstein enrolls him in Ye-Ran High School, where he is the principle.However, a powerful organization by the name of The Union is also looking for Raizel and is sending modified humans to hunt for Raizel and his friends.The following is obvious, amazing animated fights between Raizel and his friends with the Union members.But, for a lot of people the story is also about Raizel interaction with Human society. All his life, Raizel was carrying a heavy burden which is...the role of the Noblesse, which made him a loner. But this all changed once Raizel discovers the human society through high school life. Raizel even started making human friends, playing video games, eating new kind of food...  For the first time of his life he is enjoying his life.These 13 episodes are easily enjoyable and full of funny entertaining scenes.BTW the Opening will eventually grow on you.(SPOILERS AHEAD)For people who read the manhwa, this season is about the encounter with DA-5 and the noble arc. It didn't cover all the details. There are also some major events which weren't included (for example the fight with the nobles who belong to the Union)...

I really don't get why people complain about this show so much.It is already a given that the manhwa or manga wouldn't be exactly the same with the anime adaptation. Nevertheless, Noblesse was still an enjoyable anime series. The only obvious problems were Raizel's introduction, how the anime didn't start at the beginning, and the pacing. However, as I was watching the show, the hype and enjoyment for this series was undeniable. I really didn't see any major problems and thoroughly enjoyed the anime.

Production I.G really do a good job for this.But I\'m just kinda disappointed because...at first, I really expect it will be something like long-running adaptation that get hundreds of episodes or, at least 24 episodes with more stable-paced story? bc the original Story, I mean, the plot of the Webtoon manhwa was lit epic.But well..it\'s turn out...being another ""ssssummarised"" anime from the original story (if u know what I mean lol XD) bc they really skipped many parts.

This review is based on the condition that you have read the Webtoon and it is written right after the first episode released thus i will only go over these facts.As a long time Webtoon, Manga and Manwa reader i was very excited to see Noblesse as an Anime. But when i watched the first episode i was dumbstruck. While similar Webtoon Projects like Tower of God or God of Highschool were adapted well as an anime (that said Tower of God was just perfect but GoH was a bit lacking), Noblesse is nothing but a huge letdown to fans and especially newcomers. The...reason is simple: Poor Planning.The Anime adaptation of Noblesse doesn\'t simply start at the beginning of the Webtoon and tells a well thought out story, on the contrary it starts at the third arc of the Webtoon. The reason is that a few years ago a Noblesse OVA called ""Noblesse: Awakening"" was released in which almost 100 chapters were summarized in 30 minutes. As a standalone OVA this wouldn\'t have been that much of a problem even though it has a lot of major plotholes. The fans (myself included) didn\'t care because at least we had some nice Vampire action on screen. But for some God forsaken reason someone thought it would be a good idea to use this OVA as a basis for the new Anime. Just image if the anime of Naruto wouldn\'t exist and it would instantly start with Shippuden. That would be terrible you say? Well yeah because it is. It is extremly difficult to find enjoyment in this random compliation of Scenes of the OVA if you didn\'t already read the Webtoon.Leaving all of this aside, what does the first episode actully give the audience? Half of the episode is used to establish the characters (which is very difficult to follow as a newcomer because we get random flashbacks of things we should already know) and the other half is used for completely unnececery new Scenes that weren\'t in the Webtoon just to show that one of the Side Characters (Shin-Woo is a complete sidecharacter past the first 2 arcs) is actually not as cool and skilled in martial arts as in the Webtoon because here he gets his ass kicked by a random muscular dude (please note that in the Webtoon he beat up 4 special Agent trainees just like that) because of some random Missunderstanding.To summarize the first episode of Noblesse was a complete letdown and made me angry beyond believe because i simply don\'t know why so many anime studios decide to not use a well established story and just create their own garbage of a story just because they can. We have seen this happen so many times already (Tokyo Ghoul Rout A etc.) and i really hoped it wouldn\'t happen to Noblesse. We\'ll see if the future Episode get better but I actually doubt it, but if it actually happens I\'ll make sure to update my review. reason is simple: Poor Planning.The Anime adaptation of Noblesse doesn\'t simply start at the beginning of the Webtoon and tells a well thought out story, on the contrary it starts at the third arc of the Webtoon.

They...woke up one day and said lets cut 2 of the characters with the mostdialogue;-Even the things they did not skip are rushed like Frankenstein’s backstory for example;-The animation feels stiff, this is the same studio who did Shingeki no Kyojin, kuroko no basketand  Haikyuu, a lot of people including myself were expecting much more.About the positive points the comedy is the only saving grace that keeps the quality it had in the Manhwa but that alone can not create a miracle and save the adaptation and of course some of the comedy scenes were also removed because why not they are already cutting out everything else. woke up one day and said lets cut 2 of the characters with the mostdialogue;-Even the things they did not skip are rushed like Frankenstein’s backstory for example;-The animation feels stiff, this is the same studio who did Shingeki no Kyojin, kuroko no basketand  Haikyuu, a lot of people including myself were expecting much more.About the positive points the comedy is the only saving grace that keeps the quality it had in the Manhwa but that alone can not create a miracle and save the adaptation and of course some of the comedy scenes were also removed because why not they are already cutting out everything else.', ""I dropped the anime in the 3rd episode.

I expected some chapters to be omitted in anime, but didn't expect this much of omittment to happen in the first episode already. The first three episodes cover and skip too many chapters for me to be enjoyable.

I know the OVA did it first, but it still feels like a needless change and after GoH left everything in that regard the same as the original, so it just felt petty to me considering they are adapting a Korean series.With that out of the way I can focus on...the many other failings of this adaptation. As others have pointed out, the Noblesse anime starts out in the second season, with only an abridged 30 minute OVA of the first season to help viewers meet the characters and setting, which most people also probably don't even know exists, so basically the viewers are basically given nothing to go on and are thrown in the middle of the story. The first season could have provided a fun introduction to the characters while also explaining the characters motivations and backstories, but for some reason it was decided that less is more until eventually there was barely anything left.That being said, the characters and story from this arc have been adapted pretty faithfully and even with zero knowledge of them, newcomers to the series can still get a decent idea of what each character is like and the story is simple enough that they can at least follow the plot. However, the actual substance is severely lacking: lazy animation and art quality really made it tough for me to enjoy what few action sequences there were, and even though other adaptations of Korean manhwa like Tower of God and God of Highschool had their issues, they usually compensated with their art style or fluid animation, but Noblesse sadly gets none of these and comes across as being low budget.Overall, as a fan of the original, this adaptation missed every box I wanted, and if anyone is interested in the series after watching it, I would recommend just reading the comic instead. the many other failings of this adaptation.

I admit that some scenes were empty, awkward, anticlimatic, with lots of room for improvement... but let's be real, it wasn't bad, at least in my humble opinion.I don't know the budget, deadlines and other constraints behind the production of these series, but adapting 545 chapters (even if 1 chapter isn't worth half an episode), 7 seasons with a total of 25 arcs... that's a lot....So simply imagine adapting 2 seasons, OF COURSE they had to skip things.What was good: Character design and development are ok, the story and progression are ok (for sm1 who already read the real thing), the voice acting was good, the drama/emotional side was ok, Rai was good (didn't expect much but I like him), as well as other characters such as Gejutel, Regis, Seira, Shin-Woo and some other characters overall are what I expected. To sum up, the core elements are good.What was bad: sound effects and situational music, animations (room for improvement), epic fights are short, less epic scenes but more drama, the scenes follow one another quickly without giving more depths due to the rush, and more importantly....FRANKY! JUST WHY?? Where did that psychopath bad@ss go! He became vanilla without much flavour left lmao!... and by the way, Noblesse/Nobles =/= Vampires for god's sake.That's all.

It was disturbing to watch this adaptation after being happy about and waiting for it for a long time. This was a total garbage adaptation and many parts of the story modified by the creators which makes this worse.Why make character's sound like that? Dint the creators have an imagination as to how these characters would sound?Also what do i say about Raizel's hair. I mean whyyyyyy!? I suggest reading the original webtoon instead of watching this horrible horrible anime. Disappointed in crunchyroll. Please don't spoil more webtoons for us. "", ""Noblesse is a classic case of Business over Quality.It's nothing but a disappointment, the webtoon itself may not be anything revolutionary, but it's all right, quite an enjoyable read.However, the same cannot be said about this anime, it has a few enjoyable instances but they are overshadowed by the awful directing and cringe dialogue. The characters feel superficial, and any trace of depth is a forgone dream.Honestly, I was looking forward to this anime considering how much it had been hyped up.> Noblesse's gonna be the best Webtoon Adaption> Its gonna be way better than Tog or Tgoh....No, it was all lies.It had always been about money, which is to be expected considering how Crunchyroll and the current Production IG were involved in the production of this anime.Tower of god was better than this.The god of high school deserves praise for the visuals and animation at the very least.But Noblesse doesn't have anything going for it.It reeks of mediocrity.

Not everyone has the same taste but I think it's worth watching.  Perhaps it's not as outstanding as the rather two webtoon adaptations, but I think overall is better. God of highschool had amazing animation but there was no plot to it. It was like visiting an art museum: beautiful but boring. And the tower of god is very subjective. Personally, I didn't like the animation and the character design at all, and I wasn't invested in the story.So...yeah. Give Noblesse a try, it's...worth it. worth it."", 'First of all, the major mistake here was the fact that you HAVE to see the ONA Movie from 2016 to understand what is happening. This is so f*cked up, that you can\'t bring new public to your anime, you\'re happy with your centered audience. But let\'s go in partsStory: Not talking about the fact that the story of the anime cuts MANY things of the manhwa (just like they did to Tower of God and GoH, but in these particular cases, the cut was necessary to give good rhythm and pace to the anime, since the webtoon are too slow), Noblesse has a problem...itself about where the story should go in this season and what would be the major plot, since that we have a protagonist without much information.

Many of you might point out slow pacing, but I is quite enjoyable compared to rushed GoHS adaption.Let me tell you why.Story :You have to watch an OVA to watch Noblesse. If you watched that ova, then you can get starting of episode 1. Story is slow burning, but they almost didn't cut out best parts out of Manhwa. I have already read about 400+ chapters of manhwa and believe me adaption is very much on par with manhwa....Art :Out of three big manhwa, GoHS has beautiful art. But for me Noblesse's art is more complete than others. Character design is also very good. Especially Rai, beautifully done.Characters :I am truly amazed by production IG's dedication to build up character interactions. They did absolutely brilliant job to build up M-21 as a solid character. Since, M-21 as well as Tao, Takio is side characters, yet beautifully done; you can easily guess they are going to invest more on Frankenstein and Rai.If you want to know how those characters are, almost all of them are likeable. They have some cute waifu also. So, no complain from me.Sound :OP/Ed or background music isn't extraordinary, but they fits in with the anime.Enjoyment :There is a lot of build up in the beginning, but you can easily guess Noblesse is always going to be more action oriented than story telling. Yet first couple of episodes, then have done good job with the story, now I can easily guess more and more actions are coming.Even though there aren't lots of actions yet (Ep 04), Noblesse is still enjoyable for its art and very much on spot comedic moments.Rating :Episode 01 : 7Episode 02 : 7Episode 03 : 7Episode 08 : 8Overall : 7/10, (till episode 04)... and I know score will rise.

So as a neutral I have to say this anime is just average. If you are looking for something to fill some time or a weekend then it's not a bad watch to binge, but it's not something I would recommend for someone looking for a good story.The positives for me were the art style it looks pretty great for the most part, and I really enjoyed some of the fight scenes. I personally felt a lift of energy when I watched a character power up.There however is a multitude of cons. To begin,...the pacing is absolutely horrific. There is like three arcs essentially for the season, none of them really feel satisfied at the end.Also The main character has maybe 20 total lines for six episodes before he finally speaks multiple words or does any form of battle. it's nice to finally see him when he does show his true powers (which are tremendous, the character is so OP). however I had no real form of connection with him because he doesn't really do anything for half the season.  So as the story continues and finally focuses on him it's too late and it's already almost over so I don't understand the motivations for anyone or even if I do, they're weak at best.There was too much focus on his surrounding cast and that kind of took away from it. While frankenstein, M-21, and the others provide a decent background cast in and of itself, in terms of the overall story that's trying to be told they contribute very little. And the human elements were almost unneeded as they don't even appear for the last four or five episodes really.Again, this is coming from an Anime watcher first, I will now read the manhwa and see what I missed. I'm also sure that it'll explain the plot holes, or address the pacing issues. However that doesn't excuse the show for its faults. I've already is again if you're looking for a show to kill time, this is not a bad watch. Just do not go in expecting anime of the season material the pacing is absolutely horrific.

Im not a fan of the trope of a overly handsome and perfect guy everyone simps over, but for this film im willing to look past it. The pacing feels alright, though a bit fast. Every character has something interesting and unique about them, creating a diverse team of main characters (eventhough most concepts used in this series are recycled from other generic ideas of a fantasy world mixed with modernity). The characters overall, dont exactly feel human and its hard to sympathize/empathize with some them and that may...be just because of the pacing-they had alot of stuff to put into a small amount of episodes. Some characters you meet in the first few episodes seem to get forgotten over time-leaving me to wonder if theyll ever become relevant again. Thats what I think anyway. That being said, I do rewatch this show at least once every year. I love the characters as well as animation. Unfortunately, I doubt theyll continue this series via anime anytime soon, and its better to find the webtoon for it. be just because of the pacing-they had alot of stuff to put into a small amount of episodes.

Webtoon can be hit and miss for me, and I don\'t spend a lot of time checking things out on there.

It keeps you engaged throughout and doesn\'t have any huge holes in it as far as I can tell (so far). There seems to be a lot more needed to finish out the story so I...can\'t say for certain if it will end up being 4 stars throughout. I\'ll check back in after a bit and revise.Update: This is a really fun twist on a nobility theme. It is labeled as a ""dark fantasy"" and it mashes together some dark themes but overall it is really lighthearted. I don\'t know much about it, but I honestly think it presents as a shojo in a lot of ways. I think they could have developed some plot points and personalities, and gotten deeper into the ""dark"" bits of the theme but overall it was really well done.

The colors in each scene are extremely harmonious and clear.Because each episode is only about 30 minutes long, it may not be possible to clearly and fully show many of the characters' actions, leading to a long delay.In short, I really enjoyed these 13 episodes and always look forward to the next developments that will be aired.

We managed to get flash backs which tied loose ends together and once everything was summed up, it turned out to be a binge watch for me. Visually the action scenes looked amazing and without saying too much characters...showcasing their abilities did not disappoint.

As many has pointed out, it does not start as the webtoon. It plops down many chapters into the webtoon and might be confusing for many viewers as you don't get a proper introduction of many characters.

I didn't care much for how they changed the ending, and a lot of character developments were ignored in favour of letting the story progress forward faster which (imoho)...took away chances for laughter.However the art is great and it flows very smoothly.

So, I will round up to a 7 for now.First point: watch the OVA - Noblesse: Awakening as this covers the start of the Noblesse Manwha. This anime series starts in chapter 2.The beginning of the Manwha is very slow with very little happening for the first 100 chapters. In truth, it was in need of severe editing and cutting, which the anime has done well. It has removed unnecessary scenes and characters that add nothing to the main story, and instead just...end up slowing down the pace of the Manwha. The anime has considerably increased the pace of the story, but it is still quite slow for the first five episodes. The sixth sees a considerable increase in pace.To explain how slow the Manwha is. Likely what is episode 6 now would not have even been in this series. When you watch it, you will understand if we didn't get to episode 6, the story would have no real progression at all.Overall, with the OVA, the story is understandable. There are few things that might not make sense at this time, but expect explanations to appear very soon for certain aspects. A lot of the explanations are not given at the start of the story.There is some misunderstanding about the main character. Even though the story is about Raizel, a lot of it is not told from his point of view. Instead, most of it is told from the characters that are surrounding him. This is why you do not see Raizel as much as you are possibly expecting.The art is different from the usual anime you see. It has its own character and the action is not as over the top up to this point but has the scope to grow. A lot of anime make the mistake of showing incredible power at the beginning and leave no real room to make them look any stronger in the future. It a mistake which has not been copied here.The characters still have a lot of room for development, but up to this point, two of the main characters are still secretive about their role in the story.I would wait until the 12/13 episodes are released as I think this series will be better watched in a single/two sittings than waiting week after week. end up slowing down the pace of the Manwha.

It a mistake which has not been copied here.The characters still have a lot of room for development, but up to this point, two of the main characters are still secretive about their role in the story.I would wait until the 12/13 episodes are released as I think this series will be better watched in a single/two sittings than waiting week after week."", 'If there\'s one thing we learned from Tower of God and God of High School it\'s that webtoons just aren\'t meant to be adapted to anime. When Noblesse came around, I think a lot of people just gave it a low score because they had been conditioned by the previously-mentioned two to dislike webtoons adaptations. I think that this one was surprisingly good though.The story of Noblesse is actually really tight. It\'s very consistent, the world is well-built, the pacing is solid and some of the lore is really interesting. The art is really good (I mean, these are the people who animated AoT what...did you expect?) and the OP and ED aren\'t too shabby. The characters are decent and it was just an overall fun watch.I do, of course, have some things I dislike though. The story makes a big shift in focus about halfway through which isn\'t perfectly executed. The art lacks that unique style to give it a little bit of kick, and the soundtrack isn\'t particularly special. Like, two of the characters just stopped doing anything halfway through the series which was weird since they were kind of the first characters you\'re introduced to. Also, it\'s a bit slow at the beginning so I got kind of bored (I ended up sacrificing this one for FmA :P).Overall it\'s good show though. Fun characters, cool story, lots of good stuff. I don\'t know if I would recommend it just since it\'s not exactly ""worthwhile"", but if you really don\'t have any other good anime to watch, this isn\'t a bad choice.Signing off,-Kallocarina did you expect?) and the OP and ED aren\'t too shabby.

Compared the 3 of them, i would say TOG got better story and plot, GOH was better in term of fight choreography but the pacing was soo awful. Noblesse for me was heartwarming without homo lol. I really interested in the characters, and 1 thing i can complement was their comedy. Their humor senses were original and enjoyable. the MC has a straight face but when he tried to act funny, he succeed to make me laugh. The power system also quite unique. Overall, it's a really...cool and worth a shot to watch. TOG was good but i hate some of the characters. i can quite say that this anime was a 'balance' between the good TOG and awful GOH. cool and worth a shot to watch.

It's the 1st time I'm writing a review, but I had to write a review for this one.First, let me say it's not a hate review against non-japanese story. I watched Tower of God and enjoyed it, and I was really hyped about this one. On the contrary it's a hate review against the very bad adaptation of a very good story. In this anime, the problem isn't the story, but the shit job of CrunchyrollFor people who haven't read the webtoon, this anime is just average, still enjoyable but not amazing. The real problem I have...is that Crunchyroll decided to do whatever they wanted and changed the story. As a result, some important characters are completely different from how they should be. Some scenes were added in a bad way, and some good parts were skipped. The last straw was the final episode, which should have been epic if they just completely followed the webtoon, but they butchered it.So if you have read the webtoon, I highly recommend not to watch this one. is that Crunchyroll decided to do whatever they wanted and changed the story.

The animation is pretty standard, looking the same as the animation in the whole show, so is voice acting but yet, I don’t really know why this was placed as an OVA promo.

Keroro,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21671/Keroro,"[""Keroro is once again back on the TV-screen, but this time in a new, flash animated format. And as expected, this is a big disappointment...The episodes are basicly the same as in the first series. Out of the 14 episodes I have seen, eight of them were featured in the original series. The only difference is the inclusion of an extremely boring character. The mentioned character's personality is a kind-hearted copy of Tamama, with the ability to copy other characters. His name is... Keroro... just as the main character.The music is bad, really bad. The intro theme is probably fine, and there is no...ending theme, but the BGM is very forgettable. I can't even remember one single track I liked while watching this. This is a huge contrast to the original series.As for the parodys/refferences, there is absolutely none. They have been stripped out. The running time is three minutes as well, which results in a shortened version of the manga chapter it is made after.There are also a huge amount of panty shots, but they're usually so fast paced, you will have to pause the video to see it. There are fanservice scenes of the females as well, but at least they don't zoom in on anything. So why do I give it a 5, despite my ranting? Because:- There are episodes based on the 21th volume of the manga, which wasn't released when the show still aired.- Everyone has their original voices (besides Fuyuki, due to his voice actors death)- While childish, they have a huge amount of scenes only otakus would appreciate, which shows they're still caring for the manga demographic.- More KeroroIf you are a fan of the original series, watch this and make your own judgement.

The announcement of this anime was monumental in the small surviving fanbase, and everyone was sure it would be a beautiful remake, with only a few people like myself having niggling doubts.Unfortunately, upon it's release, it was obvious that even with the doubts we had, we had very much over-estimated this anime.For one, it is...a flash anime, and a very lazy one at that. More than half of the movement is poor tweening, and the actual drawings themselves are like very poor tracings of Yoshizaki's amazing style, the Keronians having misshapen heads and the humans having varying continuity with the way they are drawn.The length of the anime is unacceptable, each episode being three minutes long. Hetalia had more time than that, and it was based on a four panel comic series, which was why the five minute episodes actually worked. An episode of Keroro cannot physically fit into a three minute time slot (around two minutes if you exclude the intro song and the outro jingle) without major cuts of detail, which makes it feel unfinished and hard to understand, even as a long time fan. In the most recent episode as of this review, when New Keroro was introduced, this was only further proven to me, as I have currently not read that far into the manga, and watching the episode gave me absolutely no information or depth into any of the new characters. Each episode is a frustrating and forgettable experience in this way.Characters are introduced too quickly and have little to no dialogue thanks to the short time span. The episode that introduced the other four members of the Keroro platoon and Angol Mois was essentially a very fast slide show, with no context or detail. Dororo, Kururu and Tamama didn't even get proper lines in this episode, and Giroro and Mois had a grand total of one line each, which is a real shame as the voice actors remain the same from the last series (excluding Fuyuki's previous voice actress, Tomoko Kawakami, who sadly died of breast cancer in 2011). They had to even alter how the story went down, as there wasn't enough time to introduce Dororo's partner Koyuki, which was painfully obvious and cringe-worthy.They had one brilliant idea for this anime, and that was to make physical models of the back drops, which would probably look good if they weren't always blurred, which to me makes it seem like a lazy attempt to animate even less than they already do, and also makes the mediocre character art work stand out even more. The models would be on my small list of things they did right if it wasn't for the blurring, so you can't even truly appreciate it without concentrating anyway.The only real redeeming factors of this anime are the voice acting, which I believe has been superb since the first episode of the first anime way back in 2004, the intro music, which is very catchy and is performed beautifully by Mayumi Gojo, and the new colour schemes and style that has been implemented. Unfortunately, it is very hard to enjoy these small mercies when the show is too short for any real amount of voice acting to be heard and has a drawing style is so bad that the colours are the only thing that can even vaguely salvage them.Over all, as a die hard fan of the Keroro franchise, I can only say that this reboot is inexcusably abysmal, and does not do the franchise one lick of justice. I will continue to watch, in hopes that the episodes will some how improve or come to an interesting conclusion, but right now as it stands, I think this reboot can only be described as botched and a huge let down. If you are new to the Keroro franchise, don't bother watching this show, as you will have as much information when you leave as when you started. you will probably also be more bored than when you started. I can only barely recommend it to fellow die hard Keroro fans, if only because it's the one scrap of Keroro content we can get our hands on now that everything else has been canceled or is on hiatus. 2/10. a flash anime, and a very lazy one at that.

The character development and plot is slimmed down to bones and overall its dialogue is cut and paste from the manga without much of its proper comedic timing.But I don\'t think this is what this version is trying to do, not really anyway. ""Keroro"" feels like an infomercial for later volumes of the manga. From what I can gather, Keroro and his platoon remain popular characters for children in Japan, so...they don\'t really need to be retold the origin story. But some of them might want to see the latest characters fleshed out with sound and color - and that\'s where this show comes in.New Keroro, Tomosu, Black Star and Kaneami are the latest additions to the manga (vol. 23 onward) and really are the biggest attraction to this new adaptation like \'em or not. The new cast members play their parts well, I\'m especially impressed with Aoi Yuki\'s performance as New Keroro, who is cute and perky and really makes his equally adorable design really pop.

But as a long time fan of the franchise with no where else to go for new content, sometimes I need to be reminded of why I love these goofy characters in the first place.

Samurai Deeper Kyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/419/Samurai_Deeper_Kyou,"[""Samurai Deeper Kyo has an unique and bizarre take on edo history, and the battles between samurai. The story has its twists, but when you think that the 'last boss' is defeated, more villians pop up. At first sight, the anime seemed like a fun hilarious anime with kyoushi junior, however when the &quot;demon eyed kyo&quot; takes over the anime starts in a much more serious tone, which prevails till the end.The story centers around &quot;demon eyed kyo&quot;, who has his soul entrapped in somebody else's body, so basically, he goes around defeating villians to get his body back. However, kyo is known as the...man who killed a thousand men, the demon eyed kyo - reminds me of Kenshin and Battosai.

It's not bad, but not great either. Villians are very unique and have their own style and looks, very well done in the characters. man who killed a thousand men, the demon eyed kyo - reminds me of Kenshin and Battosai.

Now that we have that out of the way, what did I think of it? It SUCKED! I really forced myself through it and actually considered dropping it. Why did I dislike this anime? Well, that's the purpose of this review.The story for this anime starts off rather solid albeit a bit cliched. With it's fugitive goofball setup it felt reminiscent of Kenshin and Trigun. I was actually rather enjoying watching the humorous...character interactions and fun setup. Then about halfway through, something happened. The show decided to stop being fun and started being repetitive. And when I say repetitive, I mean REPETITIVE.I mean seriously, when the lead character is about to reach his objective after fighting through several of the antagonist's lackeys, the writer slaps the viewer in the face and makes the antagonist move the objective to another destination, causing the lead character to have to go through the same bloody process as before. This happens roughly 3 times throughout the entire 26 episode show. It's just our protagonist fighting off supernatural henchmen to reach his goal over and over again. And when he battles against a powerful enemy he just uses his plot armor, I mean, special attack to defeat them in one blow after all else fails. We also see the same bloody stock footage for said attack used every time it happens. Fortunately this is accompanied by a badass guitar riff which I rather liked. Then after the show stops being repetitive it decides to get downright frustrating by throwing in all this exposition at you at once to the point where it becomes information overload. And don't get me started on the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I'm just going to say it is possibly the most ridiculous conclusion to any anime I have witnessed.As for the characters, they were all pretty bland. They were often just archetypes prevalent in the shounen genre. We do get the backgrounds of some of the characters but little to no development.Finally I shall say something good about this show. The artwork was pretty impressive. However the same cannot be said about the animation. It is very limited and amusingly quaint. Watching a long distance shot of a character running is one of the most unintentionally amusing things I have ever seen.As for the soundtrack it was actually very good. The aforementioned badass guitar riffs really stand out and the opening is actually amazing. Seriously, go look it up.The best analogy I can come up with for my enjoyment of the show is that it's a tire rolling downhill. Starts off pretty high but gets lower and lower until it reaches the bottom. character interactions and fun setup. Then about halfway through, something happened.

This happens roughly 3 times throughout the entire 26 episode show. It's just our protagonist fighting off supernatural henchmen to reach his goal over and over again. And when he battles against a powerful enemy he just uses his plot armor, I mean, special attack to defeat them in one blow after all else fails. We also see the same bloody stock footage for said attack used every time it happens. Fortunately this is accompanied by a badass guitar riff which I rather liked. Then after the show stops being repetitive it decides to get downright frustrating by throwing in all this exposition at you at once to the point where it becomes information overload. And don't get me started on the ending. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I'm just going to say it is possibly the most ridiculous conclusion to any anime I have witnessed.As for the characters, they were all pretty bland. They were often just archetypes prevalent in the shounen genre. We do get the backgrounds of some of the characters but little to no development.Finally I shall say something good about this show. The artwork was pretty impressive. However the same cannot be said about the animation. It is very limited and amusingly quaint. Watching a long distance shot of a character running is one of the most unintentionally amusing things I have ever seen.As for the soundtrack it was actually very good. The aforementioned badass guitar riffs really stand out and the opening is actually amazing. Seriously, go look it up.The best analogy I can come up with for my enjoyment of the show is that it's a tire rolling downhill. Starts off pretty high but gets lower and lower until it reaches the bottom."", ""Samurai Deeper Kyo was one of the first anime I saw (after The Guyver and Perfect Blue – an interesting selection). It is the tale of the ‘strongest samurai alive’, a bloodthirsty monster called Demon Eyes Kyo, also known as the Slayer of 1000 Men, and his search for the only thing in the world that is important to him.For the first few episodes, Samurai Deeper Kyo seems quite formulaic. Kyo establishes himself as a badass who can crush all opposition while sneering disdainfully, and combat consists largely of exchanges of flashy-looking quasi-magic power attacks. So far, so shounen. There are some un-shounen elements...even at this early stage, though – if you’re paying attention. I didn’t notice until maybe my third or fourth viewing just how short the battles tend to be. This could easily be seen as a bad thing – one or two explosive techniques from each combatant and it’s all over. But having sat through (and enjoyed, mostly) every episode of Bleach to date, I’d contend that this brevity of conflict could also be seen as efficiency. There are no episode-long power-up sequences here, or even episode-long fights. Even the best shounen tends to have unrealistic bursts of dialogue in the middle of combat and foes who wait patiently while the hero recites the name of his attack, and that’s certainly true of Samurai Deeper Kyo, but unlike so many other series the fights here get to the point. Sadly, they’re also somewhat more stationary than people raised on Bleach or Samurai Champloo might be accustomed to; there is an over-reliance on speed lines, and a lot of the bog-standard non-superpowered sword swings look clumsy and artificial.Like many other shounen series, Samurai Deeper Kyo leans towards being an ensemble piece, with an ever-expanding core group of characters who trail after the hero, or cross his path repeatedly in a variety of ways. Unlike some series, though, most of these characters are quite distinct and likeable as people. Few of them are particularly nuanced (with the notable exception of Yukimura Sanada, at least to this viewer), but they rarely blend together as some characters in this genre can tend to. As you might expect, most of the central characters have something to hide, or something to discover, or an unclear agenda – and while I doubt any of the revelations will make you gasp in abject shock, they’re not always easy to foresee.One of the strongest points of the series, for me, is the fluid nature of alliances and good/evil – something I have a fondness for in other series too, such as Gilgamesh. While shounen as a genre frequently has enemies becoming friends and the like, lamentably few actually keep you wondering just who is really the enemy. Like the proverbial onion, Samurai Deeper Kyo sheds layers of intrigue, each time shaking an assumption you thought was concrete. Similarly, the series employs the well-established technique of 'threatening the badass' – that is, if Kyo seems to be an unstoppable killing machine in the early episodes, it’s only to impress upon us the seriousness of later travails that actually challenge him.On the music front, Samurai Deeper Kyo really surprises me with its quality, though I didn’t notice at first. Some of the recurring themes really jump out at the viewer, such as ‘Awakening’ (the music that usually accompanies Kyo’s trademark Mizuchi technique), but many are quite subtle and atmospheric. I thought for a while that Kyo’s music was indelicate, almost garish, consisting of just one or two brash tunes, but when I listened to the soundtrack album I realised to my surprise that I recognised every one of the thirty tracks, and most of them were incidental themes, accompanying flashbacks or moments of tension. Curiously, much of the music, when listened to away from the visuals of the series, puts me in mind of console RPGs; some make me think Final Fantasy, others Zelda, and one even reminds me of an old NES game called Battle of Olympus. That’s not to say that the sound quality is shrill or the composition is lacking, simply that some of the tracks are more soaring or more grand than I would have expected. A particular highlight for me is ‘Begin’, an upbeat, airy, faux-string composition used for some action scenes.Overall, then, I’d recommend Samurai Deeper Kyo to anime fans who enjoy action/fighting series wherein the plot isn’t exclusively a vehicle for the fights, the characters are simple but likeable, and there are enough surprises to keep things from getting boring. If you can overlook the sometimes stilted combat animation and are willing to be patient with the monster-of-the-week nature of the first few episodes, you might find Samurai Deeper Kyo a more rewarding watch than you expect. even at this early stage, though – if you’re paying attention.

The manga speaks well of it's greatness as the manga did span 38 volumes. But these key points stop it from being great, I will address them by category and then the positives and negatives.Story - The whole edo period storylines have been done numerously in the past but just because their are...a lot of them does not make them bad, but does leave a familiar taste in your mouth after watching it as like you've seen something similar to this before. I like how they add names from History but I've seen it too much before and it would be nice if all the names were original, but overall the story does not have enough enticement to keep you watching and it gets a bit boring toward the end with typical fight scenes and a ending to be expected from what you've seen throughout the anime.Art - Art is good for the time of release, but nothing too special.Sound - The soundtrack is fine, a lot of music I've heard before, but there's nothing wrong with that and the Opening fits the anime well.Characters - There is a lot of character development which isn't a bad thing but if you do too much it does become tedious, I like Demon Eyes Kyo but I wish he kept the same attitude throughout the anime and did not turn into a typical Bad Guy turning to Good Guy scenario, I've seen that too much before and I wish he stayed a bad guy, it would have made the story much more interesting.Enjoyment - I did not enjoy this anime much, did not have enough content to keep me going even though I got through the anime.

There\'s just really nothing special about them. I feel no connection to them whatsoever. If any of them died in the story, I wouldn\'t feel the slightest bit sad. They\'re so... empty.

Like with many...anime I have watched it was a shame to see it come to an end. anime I have watched it was a shame to see it come to an end.', 'When we are talking about action anime, one of the biggest factors that we must consider would be how entertaining the fights would be. For the most part, a good action anime would have engaging battle scenes that would keep its viewers hooked.Which is where Samurai Deeper Kyou failed miserably, for the most part, the ""animation"" is totally absent. I would go as far as state that this show is merely a colored picture slide show of the manga. Often times, battles would be settled through a series of panned and zoomed images, or reused animations, most evidently when Kyou unleashes his ultimate attack almost...every time to secure his victory.The next thing we need to factor in would be the abilities the characters have to make a good action anime. Samurai Deeper Kyou has more magical elements than swordfights, with both sides battling it out more like wizards than samurais. Ice magic, fire magic, wind magic, mind-controlling magic, you name it, most likely Samurai Deeper Kyou has it.However, this myriad of powerful abilities, sad to say, are mostly exclusive to the villains. Most of the time, we would witness our poorly ensembled cast of supporting characters totally outfought by the enemy, this trend becoming more and more apparent as the plot progresses. Heck, even Kyou is often outmatched and hardly being able to keep up with his opponents during the latter half.Which brings me to my next point. At the beginning, we are introduced to Demon Eyes Kyou, the thousand-man slayer. However, none of his actions in the show did much justice to hold up to his name. His personality is inconsistent, his merciless intent to murder is only showed when he\'s slaying minions, and when facing his comrades, he would become a softie and as merciful as Buddha himself. Perhaps I\'ve been expecting too much from him, but sometimes witnessing his merciful actions really got into me, as I felt like they didn\'t fit his character, at all.Next, we elaborate on the supporting characters which I briefly went through earlier, introducing them as being incompetent and often outfought by the enemy. This is truly frustrating to see that most of the time you would see them standing on the sidelines and leaving Kyou to do most of the fighting. Even after receiving their respective power upgrades, they are still pretty much useless in a fight (I am looking at you, Benitora). The only character that can be excluded from falling into this dreadful category would be Yukimura, at least he served more purpose to the story, and held himself rather well.The antagonists, my goodness, they expand faster than a mitochondrion could multiply itself. We keep getting new and sadly, irrelevant opponents which are often removed from the picture in around 2-20 minutes of their screen time. Some of them are even forcibly written to somehow be connected with our main characters, which are mostly asspulls and a desperate attempt to make said villain more ""memorable"", which at most times, totally forgettable. The formula for them would be: 1) make first appearance, 2) reveal themselves to know somebody from far back, 3) some flashback scenes occur to prove that this is the truth, 4) they would fight against ""somebody"" due to some grudge mentioned in the flashback, 5) obviously, the good guy wins, or the bad guy wins but spares the good guy so they can live to fight another day.The big boss himself? Well there are several of them, more like ""big boss 1"", ""big boss 2"", ""big boss 3"" and so on. Their motives totally cliched to most shounen plots - to destroy the world, to cover the world with Sword Demons, to change history, etc etc. Hardly interesting.The background arts are fine, although we do not have much opportunity to marvel in their beauty as their time are pretty much very brief on screen. The character designs are mostly poor, with a number of good ones such as Kyou\'s original body and Migeira. Then we have very questionable designs, such as one of the latter female minions who awkwardly shares a very similar design to Pokemon\'s Nurse Joy. This is set in the 17th century, come on.Finally, some genuine praise for this anime - the soundtrack. Most of them are awesome guitar riffs which play very appropriately in battles. As for the more slower tracks for the emotional scenes, this show has them covered. Voice acting is pretty much so-so, I still can\'t find myself swallowing that sissy voice of Yukimura, though.All in all, Samurai Deeper Kyou is a very poor excuse to consider itself an action anime, heck, its story and characters are not even good enough to keep me interested, as I dragged myself through the show agonizingly. every time to secure his victory.The next thing we need to factor in would be the abilities the characters have to make a good action anime.

It started out a lot like Kenshin and I couldn't get past that for the first couple episodes. Once I did, I had some fun with it.. but then the story became unbelievable angsty and took a real unexpected turn. After that, I had to force myself to finish it just...to see what happened/because I am a completionist.If you like historical anime then I would definitely give this anime a shot. It has good music, and the characters are good.My rating would have been lower honestly, but what makes this anime absolutely AMAZING is the outtakes.. Holy cr@p the outtakes are absolutely HILARIOUS and definitely worth watching. to see what happened/because I am a completionist.If you like historical anime then I would definitely give this anime a shot.

Rosario to Vampire Capu2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4214/Rosario_to_Vampire_Capu2,"['""A series with splendid animation and soundtrack but poor storyline.""Many many things have happened in the first season which was loosely based on the manga original, so logically we are expecting the storyline of Capu2 to continue from where season one left off. In fact, many many things do happen in Rosario + Vampire Capu2. They include the very exciting and daring (in the sense that they are pissing off the fans) censored fan service, more censored fan service, and still more annoying censored fan service. In terms of actual Rosario + Vampire story coverage, Capu2 literally got close to none with a few minor...exceptions.Story:Similar to the previous season, Capu2 is also considered episodic (each episode is one mini standalone story). The ""monster of the week"" which received numerous criticism also returned though this time most of the ""monsters"" do not have much of an evil intention thus making most battles seem even more ridiculous (pointless) than before.Unlike the first season which still semi followed the story from the manga, Capu2 is almost purely fillers as evident in episode 6. To wrap it up, Gonzo pretty much taken out all the actions in the story and replaced them with censored fan service (how can it be called fan service if they are censored with a bear?). Obviously fillers unrelated to the actual story tend to make fans unhappy, but from another perspective it can be rather refreshing at times because even manga readers wouldn\'t know what might come next!Animation:Upon watching this anime, perhaps the first thing you\'ll notice is the supreme animation quality. Whether you are new to this series, or a fan from the manga original, the artwork in the anime is without a doubt impressive. It should be added that the animation quality throughout the series is very consistent, which certainly means a lot for a show intended for fan servicing.Sound:When compared to the first season, the OP and ED are certainly at the same level in terms of quality, thanks to our beloved Nana. It is plain evident that the OP and ED clips no longer relates to the story (unlike season 1\'s OP and ED which give hints to certain aspects of the plot), which is actually a good thing for this season since the production crew never had any intention of following the story anyhow. So a good OP and ED that matches their theme (ie. fanservice) would do the trick.Give Nana Mizuki tons and tons of credit for her amazing job well done for performing the OP and ED as well as being the CV for Moka. As stated in my Rosario + Vampire review, Nana has an amazing ability to sing thus allowing her to win the “Best Musical Performance” award in the first Seiyu Awards.Character:I was quite surprised when writing this review that there were hardly any character development in this season. Not only are the characters\' hidden abilities STILL have yet to be included in the anime, but nothing really changed from the first season\'s ending (as expected from a filler series). Season one definitely did a better job in this department.Enjoyment + Final Thought:The heavy censorship really made the show very not enjoyable for me. If you want to watch the series uncensored, you\'ll have to wait for the DVD release. Overall, Rosario + Vampire Capu2 served its purpose as a filler and ""fanservice"" series.  Having strong animation quality and great sound track makes up for the lack of story and pretty poor character developments. I recommend this series for people who like good quality animation but if you want story development, you\'ll be best to skip this.*Note* The review is based on the broadcast episodes (ie.

Well, there was a storyline for the first and last two episodes of this anime, and then 9 episodes of filler. 9 EPISODES OF FILLER IN A 13 EPISODE ANIME. Is this anime so inconsistent that it can't even stick to the plot for over two consecutive episodes?!

Some new developments that were quite interesting. Mostly mumbo jumbo.Overall: (5/10)"", 'I\'d like to set record straight and give you an honest review. The series, as a whole, first and second season are based, rather LIGHTLY, on the Manga of the same name. Keep that in mind.Rosario+Vampire is a show that FEEDS off of fan service, harem stereotypes, and it\'s own unique sense of humor within it\'s story. Don\'t expect anything more than that. Take this anime as it is and you have a pretty decent show to watch and pass the time by.Story: 6The story isn\'t like the manga. Not even anime adaptations are anything like the ""book"" it seems. Rosario+Vampire\'s story is chopped up...into pieces for the most part, and each episode is it\'s own slice of life for Tsukune and the gang. Repetition...often. Less than the first season though. Only in the last few episodes does a real epic story that runs smoothly begin to come together. Lots of fan service, lots of laughs because of how the harem is put together etc. don\'t expect much more and enjoy it for what it is.Art: 8Gonzo, as usual has done a fantastic job animating the show. It\'s very smooth, and nice to look at (no I\'m not talking about the fan service). I\'ve seen better, but Gonzo does a good job at keeping it consistently decent.Sound: 8Like I said, Harem, Ecchi, whatever you want to call it, the soundtrack to this show fits it very well. The ever now famous ""Churu Churu Paya Paya,"" is a masterpiece score for some scenes in this anime, along with other songs that really pull the show together and make it\'s comedy valid. Add that up with amazing OP and ED songs for BOTH seasons by Nana Mizuki, and you have yourself a good anime soundtrack.Character:6You have Tsukune, the wimpy lead with a huge heart, you have your moe in Moka, you have your...Tsundere?...I suppose in Inner Moka. Kurumu is your typical flirt, Mizore is the all out stalker, Yukari is your loli, add in some adult themes and BAM generic anime harem right? WRONG. Though I rate it low for extreme lack of character development, the characters take on their own personas for the anime. BECAUSE it\'s set in a unique monster environment, each character has certain special traits about them. Given they are emphasized more on in the manga, but the anime at least gives you the basics. I can\'t say I\'ve seen many other ecchis with a Vampire, Succubus, Snow-Woman, and Witchling all after one guy. Tsukune however stands out among the bunch, though he seems like a below average student with good intentions, there\'s more to him. He genuinely cares for the others, all as friends, and wants to be able to protect them. This is shown frequently in the series that though he is powerless, he\'s willing to fight, no matter what the cost. Which does lead to some interesting situations.Enjoyment: 9I laughed...I laughed. It IS enjoyable for what it is. A harem anime with your typical stereotypes played on well, with your BIG twist of them being monsters, and Tsukune being human. Decent bit of action to sate that hunger, and watching Tsukune progress ever so slightly as a character was cool. Don\'t come expecting anything more than laughs, fan service, and a few decent romantic/admirable scenes.Overall: 7Good anime. Not the best, not terrible. They advertised as an ecchi, they sold an ecchi to the public. You view it as anything else and you\'ll hate it....but then that\'d be your own fault. If you need to pass some time by, and you like the genre, give it a look.

One of the best harem animes in a while, here\'s hoping for a 3rd season with more story and character development than we\'ve seen!', 'Well, so it’s come down to this… “Rosario + Vampire” is an anime show directed by Takayuki Inagaki about, uh, well, gratuitous panty shots and full-blown harem mayhem. The story is straight-forward enough to actually make sense too: Tsukune Aono is your typical high school protagonist who plays the nice guy role way too well. One day, while heading to his mysterious new high school in the middle of what appears to be a dead forest/graveyard, he is run over on a bicycle by Moka Akashiya, a classmate of his. Immediately, these two seem to hit it off, until Tsukune discovers that Moka is actually...a vampire and the high school he’s attending consists of nightmarish monsters. Eventually, Tsukune is forced to keep his human identity a secret for fear of his own life, while also attracting the attention of a group of girls all lining up to have sex with him, typical of your harem/ecchi show.I just want to make this known: “Rosario + Vampire” is a terrible show. In fact, so terrible that I actually found myself really enjoying it at times. There seems to be a very basic formula to each episode too: Tsukune, being the dumbass he is, manages to get involved in some life-threatening conflict with a dangerous student or teacher, and Moka is forced to change into her “badass” vampire form to save the day while the narrator, being a bat with the most annoying voice in anime history, inexplicably totals up the running time each battle took… for reasons I have yet to know… It’s formulaic, yes, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t have a ton of fun with it. There’s a cheesy undertone throughout that makes it oddly entertaining, and while the nudity is flaunted around this show like clothing is illegal, it adds a kind of quirky vibe to the characters themselves. I shouldn’t go too into detail with the other characters apart from our two protagonists because, well, they’re cardboard cut-outs from other harem anime and are too uninspired to really give a damn.However, “Rosario + Vampire” has a secret power: it is so facepalm-worthy, that at a point, your brain adjusts to the crude, dry humor and eventually you find yourself laughing a lot. The comedy in this show is hilarious when it wants to be, especially an episode when Tsukune is followed home by the stalking group of girls over summer break, and is introduced to their mother, who witnesses them in *ahem* compromising situations that leads her to believe her son is a sex fiend. It’s actually one of the funniest episodes I’ve watched since that exam episode in “Angel Beats!”. I feel like I shouldn’t dismiss the strengths of the show either, because the last few episodes of the first season are legitimately great, as well as a bulk of episodes in the second season.As much as I enjoyed most of it, there’s just also too much wrong with “Rosario + Vampire” to fully recommend it. While it does have it’s fair share of comedic genius and suspenseful moments, these are too rare in the show to really call it a saving grace. The chemistry between the “so inoffensive, it hurts” Tsukune and “Lucy from Elfen Lied 2.0” Moka is actually pretty good too, and provides an ongoing gag that never gets tired. But overall, it’s decent fun at best. If you just want to take a break from a serious anime, switch off your brain and let this soak in. Otherwise, watch “Love Hina” if you want great harem… a vampire and the high school he’s attending consists of nightmarish monsters.

There was still a bunch of meaningless fanserve (which I am all for) and it was still a harem which almost guarantees that nothing of deep import will happen.Once again, the story follows tsukune; a complete pussy who seems to attract all the women, and moka the vampire whos into him. Also there the succubus, ice woman, witch, and this season brings us a brand new vampire. The new vampire is moka's sister kokua, and she is the first female character not to...join tsukune's entourage... FINALLY!Also brought back from the original show is the stand alone episodes with a few conjoining at the end, but as ive said before this is how the manga was too so I will forgive it. However, while i'm on the topic of of the story; many people will expect a continuation from where the last season left off in the manga. This is not the case, in fact very little has anything to do with the manga itself at this point and now it is just a continuation of the first season instead of the manga.Now they are even tossing in filler episodes, I dont see why when they have so much manga to work with but whatever, I can and have forgiven them for some of the episodes that were really good, but some of the episodes in capu 2 just suck terribly so be on the watch for that. Another thing is that tsukune still doesn't use his vampire powers to open a can of whoop-ass on anybody this season either, so that kinda disapointed me.As before, the fights can be measured in a matter of seconds, and it would almost make more sense to cut em entirely but, what do I know. Also, in capu 2 you are about as likely to find the characters having a friggin sing-off than anything else, so hopefully you can get past the lameness of these situations or you will not survive this show.Once again the art is great just like the 1st season, and the characters are still a dynamic bunch, even if they havnt changed at all since season one. There was also a pretty good soundtrack for this show. I enjoyed watching capu 2 as a fan of the original manga and the 1st season, but maybe it can be said that you will enjoy this more if youve never read the manga... maybe.

But I also moved it up because of its ability to improve on developing the characters while still maintaining what was working in the first season.While I admit, the repetitive pining the female protagonists partake in over Tsukune started getting a little annoying, it was still entertaining enough for me to not really care all that much.On top of this, reviewers pointed out how plot development was lacking and...limited to the first episode and last 2 episodes, but I felt the season was entertaining enough to again over look what was missing. But to expand on the plot development, it did start to actually get really interesting which led to another fault - it ended here!

Okay now in the last 2-3 eps of both seasons, its like they finally decide they want to be serious and have...a storyline.....and for once they decide \'Hey, maybe we will let Aono do one cool thing before we revert him back to his damsel in distress useless self\'.Now dont misunderstand, if they were going for this comedy without a plotline then its fine....But the fact they try to introduce something serious in the last moments of both seasons, makes me frustrated as too why I watched the first 9 useless episodes....Soooo yeah this is a pretty fresh review so I guess in contains some resentment over the forever repeating plotline of this show...But there u have it...""Rosario + Vampire"" in a nutshell.(Over Rating a 7, cause im giving it the benefit of the doubt, as possibly the fact that its a comedy excuses it from have a varied plotline in each episode -.- ) a storyline.....and for once they decide \'Hey, maybe we will let Aono do one cool thing before we revert him back to his damsel in distress useless self\'.Now dont misunderstand, if they were going for this comedy without a plotline then its fine....But the fact they try to introduce something serious in the last moments of both seasons, makes me frustrated as too why I watched the first 9 useless episodes....Soooo yeah this is a pretty fresh review so I guess in contains some resentment over the forever repeating plotline of this show...But there u have it...""Rosario + Vampire"" in a nutshell.(Over Rating a 7, cause im giving it the benefit of the doubt, as possibly the fact that its a comedy excuses it from have a varied plotline in each episode -.- )', 'Story?

Season 1 of R+V was so bad, I had to consume alcohol to finish watching it. It was just a mess of a harem anime.It seems however, that the creators of Season 2 agreed with me, and decided to create a second season to parody the first. Parodying your own series with your own series, a very bold move.The series kept the harem in a form of stasis, with catfights erupting here and there even though the main guy is clearly into the vampire chick above and beyond the other girls. The...characters were dumb, and fought, and the story was all over the place but it seemed like every character in it, when they weren't at the center of the episode, knew just how bad this show was and expressed the sentiment.

It started to move from a silly parody into hitting at the heart of all harem animes.Both Real Moka and The Succubus Kurumu actually came across as being genuinely hurt by Tsukune's feigned indecisiveness. Real Moka tried to maintain the relationship and attraction between her and Tsukune, but it just wasn't good enough for him because she wasn't the ditz. The character did seem genuinely sad as he just runs off leaving her to stand alone.Additionally, in the final two episodes,  Kurumu lays it all out there as to why she likes him and how she's been with him from the start.

A break up of Tsukune's harem, and the character split from episode 11 (you'll know when you see it) would have done wonders.

Please don\'t hesitate to tell me *So just by reading this review, im pretty sure that you have watched Rosario+Vampire 1 already, for obvious reasons. Therefore, you probably know a brief idea about the anime already. So im just gonna get started on what i like/dislike about this anime.I have to say that the storyline of this anime is better than the first one however when i think about it.. it is kinda the same. Being a "" inner-moka fan"" i definitely liked this one better...than the first season because there are more scenes of the inner moka,and i also got to know more about her in this season. It was also really interesting and entertaining meeting new characters such as the girls parents and family. Also how these girls resemble their parents is just fun to watch, especially when they get into fights and all that.Moving on to the Art, if u have watched the 1st season you will know that the art is amazing. The characters are all well drawn and the artist ( or whoever you call them) uses amazing colors in the anime which draws your attention and gives you a ""WOW"" feeling. For example when it is snowing.. the colors that they use is so amazing. It makes me want to be there and see it in real life ( i dont know if its weird to say this, its a magical feeling).My favorite thing about this anime, is the soundtrack. Nana Mizuki has done such an awesome job with the song she sang.. i just love it! The director puts in songs at the right moment, not just randomly which is good. Anyway all the songs in this anime is just catchy and i ll promise you that you will find yourself downloading the soundtrack when u first listen to it.The Characters are interesting, and im just kinda disappointed that they didnt show more of Kururumu or the others girls. And in my opinion the outer moka is sometimes to annoying. Some scenes that annoy the crap out of me it when Tsukune and Moka just have those random scenes where they stare at each other. And i also feel that some characters should have more scenes then some but alwells. Another thing that annoys me is when Moka\'s rosario gets taken off her and there\'s always this guy explaining what happens to moka when it gets taken off her. I understand why they would tell the audiences for the first time seeing and so, but telling us what was happening to her everytime Tsukune took the rosario off her whenever there was a fighting scene? was just too much.In the end, i give it a 7/10 it wasn\'t a masterpiece however it wasn\'t bad. I just felt that they rushed the ending.. and they they shouldve made the storyline abit longer and give audiences some more intense fighting scenes ( but i have to say that fighting scenes in the first season is much more better than the 2nd season). So lets hope that they\'ll make another season that will be much better!! than the first season because there are more scenes of the inner moka,and i also got to know more about her in this season.

As far as the story line is concerned, I found the concept unique and it was an enjoyable series to watch. The story line is taken lightly and not as serious as Death Note or Code Geass, but overall it has its perks. The synopsis of Rosario + Vampire is that Tsukune Aono has failed to get into High School but due to a mix-up is sent off to a school for monsters. He there meets a girl named Moka Akashiya and they quickly become friends. Despite his...newly found friendship, he still has to worry about the ""no humans"" policy that would lead to an execution if he were ever caught. The art in this series is spectacular and honestly one of the bests out there. When compared to other series, this one takes the win for best art next to High School DxD in my opinion. It is a laughable series that is enjoyable to watch. It may not be for everyone seeing how it is still an ecchi. This series, however, has light sexual messages, which for some people is great. For the others (perverts), there is not much to see so maybe stick to DxD. Even though this series does not have the best story line, I still enjoyed it and recommend it. newly found friendship, he still has to worry about the ""no humans"" policy that would lead to an execution if he were ever caught.

The newspaper club members are returning for their second year. What follows is a season which builds on the core characters as well as the progression of Tsukune and Moka's relationship. The story varies which each episode, much like the first season, while having a main arc (the main arc in the first season was more to do with Tsukune attending a high school for monsters and introducing characters, while this season focuses more on those characters as well as Tsukune and Moka).

Sound is rarely bad in anime in my opinion (unless it is a particuraly bad dub, which Rosario to Vampire Capu2 thankfully isn't)Characters (9) The main cast from the original are joined by a few newcomers, all of which are good characters that fit into the world. Certain episodes focus more on certain characters, and it is in these episodes that the show really shines for me. The fleshing out of characters and the simple fact that the spotlight is not constantly on Moka (something I didn't really like from the first season) is refreshing and adds a certain endearing quality to the season. The only part that lets this category down is the bits where the series reverts to the formula of simply having all the female Newspaper Club members fight over Tsukune.Overall (8) Overall, this series is really good. For fans of the first season, Capu2 simply builds on the foundation, bringing new ideas and new scenarios.

She is just wonderful. She has a goal and pursues it ruthlessly and hilariously.Unfortunately like the first season, there's some glaring problems.  There's a real annoying episode that's composed entirely of short segments (less than three minute) that go no place and touch on prior events but not well. There is also that profoundly annoying problem from the first season, where inner Moka is continuously saving everyone, and it's taken as something everyone else is entitled to.

This one had a bit more fan-service than the first series, but, in my opinion, was not really bothersome. I also noticed that there seems to be some more character development with Inner Moka as well, which, even tho this season was slightly lacking than the first, made it better to watch. Overall, I gave this one an 8/10 as well, tho it did lack a little than the first, but in the end, it was still pretty good and as always, it was a fun ride to watch ^_^. ', ""This is a direct sequel to the first season, and is very similar in many ways. However, overall I'd have to say that for the most part it's a good amount better. The loop is often the same, in that there's some sort of issue, they're all in trouble, Tsukune removes the Rosario, Moka defeats said trouble, and they all move on. However, instead of focusing on Tsukune for the most part as was usually the case in the first season, here the focus is generally on other characters. The build up also feels like it matters a lot more than the conclusion with the...final scene of Moka destroying enemies being not as important, even occurring in the background at times, and when it was the focus it felt like it deserved to be. This allows to show off the other characters a lot more, and though there wasn't that much in the way of character or relationship development for the most part, what was there felt pretty solid, and furthermore it adds more variety and prevents the show from getting repetitive, which combined with the fact that the show is primarily focused on comedy and being amusing over the actual plot, it works quite well. This is the case for most of the show, and hence I think most of the season is a pretty solid improvement over the first season.This falls apart however at the end, where things get pretty epic, but things also get kind of strange. The finale for this season finally has Tsukune taking a more proactive and impactful role in the plot, and finally actually getting into a real fight. However, his motivation for doing so felt completely off, in that he simply felt selfish. That combined with the fact that most of the show had him seem pretty clearly going for Moka, but the ending has him being indecisive at the end, makes him being the villain of the episode actually feel right in a way, but that in itself doesn't feel right either. One of the main reasons it felt strange was that it further developed inner Moka, and showed she had range to her personality, wanting to belong and such, but it also gave a reason for her being sealed in the first place that was pretty dumb. Hence, it felt difficult to be completely all right with Tsukune simply sealing her away again for the other Moka, especially as inner Moka was there first, and really it doesn't seem any more justifiable than what Kokoa wanted. Hence, I feel very conflicted about the entire relationship. This was an area that I think the show should have probably avoided entirely, because though they probably didn't intend the viewer to think that much about it, they got pretty close to it, and it really doesn't fit the tone of the show at all. Hence, it was an incredibly strange note to end on. I will admit though that the song and accompanying footage at the end was pretty great.The soundtrack I quite liked just like the previous season. The OP was really good and the ED was good. There was a lot of insert song usage as before, but as before usage was only decent. The art, designs, and style were good as before. The animation was improved and was mostly pretty good, with this time not having as many noticeable cheap shots. The action got a bit better but still wasn't worth much.

Censorship is strong, which really reduces all of the injected fanservice. The fanservice art is also quite ""half-assed"". If you watch this anime, you need to look for the value in how adorable their romance is. This series contains tons of relationship and character development disguised as fillers. A common critic of this series states that the story is poor but a lot of it is actually relationship content and exploration of the characters. However, I think they could have done this while placing emphasis on a more...meaningful plot. This anime also overly sexualizes a child which is in poor taste for me.All that aside, Rosario really shines in some areas. The music fits the mood of the series perfectly and it\'s quite adorable when the characters have musical performances where they sing songs about their love. The romance that developed is very cute and compelling. There are multiple moments that will have you rolling over laughing as well.

If it did, I am sure it'd be rated a bit or even a lot higher than 6.9. It strays off from the manga for most of the season, and the panty shots are too much. I know each female girl, save for Yukari, have nice rears, but I was very much hoping that the series covered more of the manga, since things get very serious in...Season 2 of the manga, where they learn of Fairy Tale and fight the members of it and show more members of Moka's family.Art style is beautiful, and the animation is about a B+. In regards to story and pacing, I feel S1 did a good job, however, I felt it should have had more than 13 episodes for both seasons to cover more of the manga. Had it been made in somewhere between 2012-now, the anime would have more to cover. The studio, Gonzo, made the anime, and they worked on Gantz, Basilisk, Kaze no Stigma. They even helped make the music video for “Breaking the Habit” by Linkin Park. Did they not have a large enough budget for a 24-25 episode season for R+V?Fights weren't very long, but that's to be expected when facing Moka Akashiya's Inner form, though I wouldn't mind them being a bit longer.

Manga readers very likely hated it though if you know what to expect with the MC that never happens.I rated the first season lower than this second season because in my opinion this season seems to accept itself for what it is. A comedy ecchi with some action and story.The comedy was leagues better than the first and felt more wacky like it should have been rather than having serious action scenes with jokes in them that the first season had. This season takes a more fun approach while rarely trying to push those dark serious...moments it is very much more or so drama free even the ending is pretty lax and comedic.The OP is rather different, but I loved it. Has a groovy tune and is plain fun to watch every time.Overall, it wasn't mind blowing as it doesn't really stray away from the comedic episodic formula in a way until the end and even then it is still light hearted in a sense. This really is a series you shouldn't take seriously when watching, it is a turn your brain off and enjoy. If you want to actually enjoy the pretty good story it offers, people will suggest skipping the anime all together and read the manga. moments it is very much more or so drama free even the ending is pretty lax and comedic.The OP is rather different, but I loved it.

This anime and the first season are both absolute trash. They're horrible adaptations of an apparently good manga that I haven't read, but I plan to in the future. Rosario + Vampire season 1 was your basic harem mess and season 2 isn't much different other than the fact the ending is a massive cockblock and it's a lot more enjoyable. But why am I clowning on it this hard while I am giving it an 8/10? Yeah see this is the funny part.I genuinely believe this anime is hot garbage, but it doesn't change the fact that it's...the fun kind of hot garbage. This anime sucks, but it's so damn entertaining in every way. Season 1 was fun too but I feel season 2 actually improved on a lot of the problems I had with season 1.The biggest problem I have with this anime is the horrible opening and the stupid gag with Moka's younger sister. Well there's also the episode where the token loli is self-conscious about her looks and decided it'd be a good idea to transform from the power of some weird lady. That episode was dumb.Anyway I literally don't know where I'm going with this review anymore I barely review on this site.

Spoiler alert!StoryThe adventures of the Newspaper Club continue in this new season, as Tsukune and his friends attempt to navigate school life while fighting any supernatural threat that comes their way. Meanwhile, Tsukune also tries to advance his relationship with Moka (the pink-haired Moka, that is), while the other girls still attempt to gain his affections.Honestly, I don't know why does this show still try to have a harem aspect, since it's become clear that Tsukune wants Moka (the...pink-haired Moka, anyway), and the other girls still think they have a chance with him; and apparently, at the end of the season, it turns out that he has developed feelings for the silver-haired Moka, as well, even though they have barely shared any scenes together.In terms of action and comedy, this show is good, but when it comes to storyline and relationship progressions, then it could have been better. (6/10)CharactersTsukune continues to be one of the blandest and most boring protagonist in the harem genre. Seriously, even Shido Itsuka (Date A Live) and Issei Hyoudou (Highschool DxD) have more personality than him. Fortunately, his blandness is balanaced by the supporting cast. The pink-haired Moka is a sweet ray of sunshine that constantly tries to maintain peace in Tsukune's life and the parts of Kurumu, Yukari, Mizore and Ruby are well-developed and appreciated.I think the silver-haired Moka could have been so much better, though. Even after 2 seasons, she still feels less like a character and more like a plot device with dialogue. Sure, this season tries to give her some character development, but it's only in a few scenes and it's promptly forgotten afterwards. She barely has any scenes with Tsukune and the show tries to make us believe that she has fallen in love with Tsukune, as well, which comes off as a half-assed and lame excuse to keep the harem aspect going.

From the horrible, to the absolutely incredible. This, being one of the very first anime I have ever watched during my viewing of anime as a whole, still holds some value in certain areas.Rosario to Vampire 2. This anime is what happens if you take Iruma-kun, and add some ecchi on the side. That\'s it. But, in all seriousness, if I even want to compare this to Iruma-kun, I\'d have to say that Iruma-kun does things much more...generic, than this anime? Though, I do have a slight bias toward the characters...in this anime, as opposed to Iruma-kun.In any case, what this anime does wrong is in it\'s plot-devices. Each episode has the same-exact, cookie cutter outlook, that it\'s no wonder people dislike this anime. In short, something *bad* happens, Tsukune is bombarded by boobs/ass the entire time as things go wrong, and then by the end, Moka kicks the ""bad"" person\'s ass. So, in other words, if you hate repetitious plot-devices, that tend to become a cliché in themselves, then you should not be watching this series at all.Other than that, the reason I enjoy this so much is that it\'s one of those anime that I can kinda turn my brain off, and just enjoy what I\'m viewing, without having to think too hard about anything. Sometimes, it\'s nice to sit back and view an anime that has cliché characters, doing cliché things, specially if you adore them (yes, most of the characters are very cliché, but in their own way, are special and unique).So, why the 8/10 then? Well, even though the story is kinda...not really there, & the art/sound are 100% dated in 2021, the characters are what bring this anime\'s enjoyment up a notch for me.

So I\'ll basically just cut and paste my first season review here:""Honestly I wasn\'t thrilled with this series as an anime. I did enjoy the Manga.It felt like they spent 1/4 of each episode doing a transformation scene, that was usually done between frames of the manga.  They dumbed down a lot of the character interaction for laughs, removed the stakes and treated the watchers as idiots.The score was good to start with but so repetitive it got annoying.  Especially for that said transformation scene....They could have done it once in full, then done a 5 second snippet to suggest what happened and used that screen time to do something meaningful.""The little sister character introduction was really just taking the same problems a step further.  Everything getting played for laughs with no seriousness.  This resulted in two dimensional characters, which meant even when the stakes were raised we didn\'t care.

Here is what I mean.To begin with let’s discuss the positives.The animation and soundtrack?Absolutely top-notch. I must say that they are just amazing, they did a great job with those. The visuals are just beautiful and the music matches the atmosphere. Nana Mizuki\'s performances, in the opening and ending themes and as the voice of Moka, are just great! It\'s no surprise she took that ""Best Musical Performance"" home.However, it is at this point that matters become a bit tricky.The storyline? Yeah, it is...a little bit boring. I really wanted to see the story progressing from where the first season ended, but what we got were filler episodes. And not to mention the “monster of the week” thing. It seemed as if they were trying too hard to put some action without actually progressing the plot.And to address the plot itself, the characters in this season are terribly underdeveloped. Dude, this is Season 2! I was excited to know the characters better but that did not happen. Another thing is that they haven\'t uncovered some of the abilities of those characters which seems a waste of a potential.In summary, both the animation and music are of superior quality, but the doldrum storyline and characterization dampen the second season of Rosario + Vampire. Let\'s hope that if there\'s a Season 3, they will improve their game in these areas. a little bit boring.

Because believe me, if there are people ""around"" you who doesn\'t know what you\'re watching, you might as well be watching hentai (in their mind, at least).Story: 8/10The story\'s very straight-forward; Kanna just turned 16 and is asked by her older sister to work as a Voice Actress in...her company. Sounds fun, right? I mean, who wouldn\'t like to voice their own character in an anime or visual novel? Unfortunately, it turns out that her sister\'s company produces eroge, meaning she\'ll be an erotic voice actress... And for a virgin (I use the term loosely) like Kanna, hilarity ensures. I found the story fresh and funny, though with some reused elements (common schoolgirl who\'s life changes once she comes of age; can\'t be helped).Art: 9/10The art is what you\'d expect in a 2010 anime, nothing looked old or outdated. The movement of the characters and the scenes are smooth and crisp, so you can tell the quality of the production value. They also applied censoring in a humorous way, think Seitokai Yakuindomo-style (the mose recent anime with this style that I can remember).Sound: 10/10The sole reason why I rated the sound value of this OVA a 10 is because it will induce nosebleeds, trust me on this. Or it may lower blood pressure for some people. The Voice Actresses voicing these Voice Actresses (try saying that 10 times over) delivered what I consider an experience rather than a performance (tell me when I\'m exaggerating...). If you\'re careful, or have a really good ear, you\'ll also detect a little censoring on some ero-words.Character: 8/10Kanna is/was your typical schoolgirl with her life changed once she turned 16, with a sister that\'s so composed it\'s almost a crime.

This is an extremely short anime so I'll keep the review length appropriate. The show is about voice acting in lewd productions and as such, its performances certainly have expectations to live up to.Koe De Oshigoto blows those expectation out of the fucking water. To the point I really can't imagine the voice actors keeping a straight face delivering the lines that they do unless they were utterly focused on distressing you.This series will violate your mind, your innocence and somehow leave you exploding with...laughter start to finish.Bring friends.The ones you want to lose. laughter start to finish.Bring friends.The ones you want to lose."", ""This.Is.Awesome.It's also pretty perverted.

And you have to admit, you're pretty curious about what actually goes on behind the scenes of those eroge you're playing. What do the voice actors look like? Do they get embarrassed? It's all pretty intriguing stuff.And at least for this first episode, the animators catch...the interest of the audience very well. It's a new crew; Studio Gokumi. And I have to say they're quite promising, based on their performance of Koe de Oshigoto.

To tell it in brief Kanna is a regular high school girl who knows a bit about erotic things and is curious to know more but shy to take any action.Enjoyment (10/10)To sum it all up this is a 'must watch' which will take you to roller coaster ride of laughter and fun. is IT is a story about Aoyagi Kanna, a 16-year-old girl who was asked to become an erotic game voice actress on her 16th birthday by her elder sister at her company and she isn't able to refuse though too shy due to first time.

No slow start here, this short OVA series starts off with a bang and shows no signs of slowing down as it delivers a complete story over two episodes and keeps you wanting more.Even though KoeGoto isn't a hentai series, I'm going to review it as one since it's better than most hentai I've seen over the past decade.StoryThis is what really ties the show together, there's no other way to really justify a non-H series that features schoolgirls reading hentai dialogue, having vivid sexual fantasies, or on-screen orgasms....While not an award-winning plotline, it does its job of keeping the setting coherent. It's also not a very commonly seen storyline, especially in non-H media, and considering the subject matter, it'll be a long time until we see another like it. The only downside is how little of the source material was adapted, and as a result viewers are missing out on a lot of plot development, especially concerning her friends, Kotori and Hazuki.ArtNothing really special about the art. It's very clean and crisp, but simplistic. You're not getting the same detail as a P.A. Works anime but I'd put the quality at late 2000's Kyoani. Now what KoeGoto brings to the table is in its sex scenes. While brief, they hit the bases, delivering you juicy, raunchy action with only nipples and genitalia censored. But that's what your imagination is for, right?SoundThere's not much to say about the soundtrack, nothing special here either, and you hardly notice it anyways since you're busier paying attention to the dialogue. The voice acting however is superb, especially during the recording sessions where it's virtually indistinguishable from hentai dialogue. Downsides include not actually being able to hear more of Hazuki's Kansai H-dialogue readings.CharactersThe characters are lovable but somewhat plain. However it's very easy to get attached to them, and that sort of emotional investment ultimately leads to higher returns when they end up voicing the H-scenarios. Kanna is cute when she tries her best even when what she's doing is really embarrassing. It's difficult to hate any of the characters, even the annoying and perverted Shige who's not ashamed to announce that he gets off to highschool girls.Definitely check this out if you're interested in cute girls doing lewd things, but don't want to be stuck with the stigma of watching actual hentai; if you've never watched ecchi or hentai before and want something as a gateway; or even if you're an avid hentai connoisseur, Koe de Oshigoto has much to offer viewers of any level and experience.

Kanna doesn\'t want to become a voice actress at first, but after she thinks about all of the things that her sister did for her when she was growing up, she finally agrees, figuring that she owes her older sister.

If your idea of a ""good time"" is hanging out with your friends and...making jokes about things I\'m probably not aloud to say on this site (things that are so bad that in order to actually hear them, you have to watch the uncensored version), then you would love this show.This is is a short one (that isn\'t what she said) but that is the end of the [not so] asshole report.

I am a bit biased because it's the adaptation of the very first manga I ever read, but watching the anime for the first time 3 years later it really is THAT good. It's a very lighthearted ecchi comedy about a very innocent character that, in a suggestive environment such as eroge production, develops her own lewd side. You will feel embarassed, you will have trouble holding back laughs and you will enjoy genuinely erotic scenes,The art honestly blew my mind, didn't expect this quality from a small studio adapting a minor ecchi manga, and the voice actors (very important given the plot)...simply nailed it. Opening and ending are good, but the images also seem to suggest the anime being planned to cover the whole story of the manga, instead of stopping with just two episodes. It really is a shame such a work wasn't continued. simply nailed it.
