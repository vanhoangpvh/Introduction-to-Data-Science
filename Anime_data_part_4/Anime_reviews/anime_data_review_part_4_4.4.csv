Wo Jia Da Shixiong You Dian Kaopu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50400/Wo_Jia_Da_Shixiong_You_Dian_Kaopu,"[""I personally loved this season. Ngl, I cried like five times...I didn't completely understand some things at first but figured it out as I went. I started watching mostly for the character interactions would definitely recommend if you have a lot of time to kill.Now for the actual review:-First of all the animation. I believe my standards for animation aren't too high tbh but for those who do have high standards, you might feel it's just okay. Most of the fight scenes were interesting, pretty cool and well animated and I love the cute artstyle this donghua has.The plot twists were crazy. Like wow. This...anime managed to keep us on our toes till the very end.This season had a lot more depth compared to the previous two. Every season gets more serious than the last and while the first one was pretty lighthearted, this one was the most serious, they did add some silliness in there every once in a while though and I feel that at bringing all this together, the creators of this donghua did an excellent job!So yes, if you watched and liked the first two seasons of this donghua I would definitely recommend watching this third season as well (I might be a little biased but) it was awesome. anime managed to keep us on our toes till the very end.This season had a lot more depth compared to the previous two.

UQ Holder! Mahou Sensei Negima! 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33478/UQ_Holder_Mahou_Sensei_Negima_2,"['As much as I’d like to enjoy a return trip back to the Negima universe, I can’t help but wonder why this anime even exists. Watching Uq Holder is like reading an incomplete book, one that has unsalvageable mistakes. It’s as if the producers gathered together at the last minute to procrastinate this like a school project. Don’t me wrong though. This show would have a lot of potential if the staff and directors actually had an elaborate plan. Unfortunately, it ended being broken in ways that can’t be repaired.I’ll address this early so anime only viewers won’t shake their heads in disappointment and regret...losing their valuable time. As a manga reader, Uq Holder is crammed into a 12-episode show that can’t hold itself together. Beyond the rushing, many details are left unexplored and we hardly get character development in the proper places. It also doesn’t help out that the show sells itself as a sequel. Some characters from the original anime make cameos while introducing new ones and ideas. The term “Uq Holder” is a central focus in this anime. Essentially, it’s an organization made up of outcasts that are non-humans and immortals. The show attempts to get new viewers into a comfortable position with exposition. What ends up happening is an unimpressive story that leaves unfavorable impressions.Honestly, there isn’t really an elephant in the room. With a quick glimpse of the key visual, it shouldn’t be surprising at what viewers should expect already. Anyone familiar with the Negima universe will likely recognize some of the character. For new viewers, this will probably evoke a thought at what a potential conflict the show will bring. To add insult to the injury, the principle character cast isn’t well developed. Touta Kono is a good example. He is the main male protagonist and honestly a guy that’s too carefree. Being optimistic and energetic isn’t an issue in itself but the show makes him look behave like a kid at almost any chance it gets. It doesn’t help that he often speaks his mind and is too dense to certain situations. Touta’s relationship with others become an important part of this show especially with Yukihime, a vampire and leader of the Uq Holder. Indeed, their relationship seems to be unique among this show that they are very close as friends, comrades, or perhaps something even more. Unfortunately, this show doesn’t develop them more than they should have. It’s pretty much a slap in the face for fans of the manga and general audience as a whole.Beyond these two, there are also some other characters that get noticeable attention. Kuromaru Tokisaka is a character that I have mixed opinions on. First of all, the anime makes it clear that Kuromaru seems insecure about his gender. It becomes a recurring joke that gets old fast. Next, I can’t help but find Kuromaru and Touta’s relationship to be lacking. The two gets along well and seems similar in personality. However, there’s really not much beyond that. It doesn’t really exceed expectations or leave memorable impressions. There’s even an episode that puts the two together on a date but nothing really develops from it. This applies to other characters in the show where their role is minimized but instead puts Touta in the spotlight. It tries to get him over but fails on multiple levels. For instance, Kirie’s interactions with him feels like a bickering between young siblings. Karin also treats him with distaste that makes Touta look like a fool. Shinobu Yuuki (the maid) and Touta seems to have one of the only normal interactions in this anime but it only goes far as that. Nothing ever really stands out beyond their small talk. Additionally, I can’t proclaim the antagonists to be interesting either. Their motivations aren’t too clear and most of them are generic to the bone. One of them even has a perverted personality that makes crude jokes towards women. There’s a sense of mystery that is meekly explored about them although by story adaptation standards, it’s really more of a misshapen product. So in retrospect, I can’t really say this show has an impressive character cast at all. Too bad really.Now I do have to admit, watching this show hit me with a dose of nostalgia. The original Negima manga was popular during its run and while the anime adaptation quality was subpar, it still had its moments. Uq Holder tries to remind us of those moments through the flashbacks and storytelling. Negi and his students make cameos in some way or form. Honestly, watching those segments were worth it despite the inconsistency with storytelling. The comedy of Uq Holder is also what people can describe as sexy and fun. It shouldn’t take long for viewers to recognize that the creator of this anime really want us to be get sucked into his ideas. However, that can really end up being a mess with and at its worst, a terrible executed joke.Adapted by JC Staff, this anime’s visual quality turned out to be what I had expected. It gives off a very shounen feel with its action and choreography. It does go beyond the usual punches and kicks as it adds blood and even violence. Some of the battle scenes goes over the top with even body horror elements. Fan service is very evident throughout the show with clothes torn off and eye-catchy angles. Character designs are consistently adapted with the mature appearance Yukihime and feminine look of Kuromaru. To say the least, JC Staff did its job but not one that you can talk about them for years to come in regards to this anime.I can’t say much for the soundtrack except that it seems to work on certain levels. The OP and ED theme features montages of the main characters although is saturated with fan service. Character voice seems to work on most respects although listening to Touta talk can be quite annoying at times. On the other hand, I do appreciate how this show maintains a good balance of battle OST. When it gets serious, it maintains that mood.After watching UQ Holder, I can’t say this is recommendable unless you’re absolutely curious about the adaptation or wanted to be hit with some nostalgia. It’s one of those shows practically screaming “read the manga!” The humor gets old fast and despite the nostalgia it can bring, it still ends up being very underwhelming. Ultimately, this anime turned out to be a poorly executed plan. When you put all the broken pieces together, it still ends up being broken. losing their valuable time.

He took the worst two worst combined genres being Ecchi and Harem and manages to them good. Ken Akamatsu has known its attention to detail to developing its characters from main to even side characters. His works still intrigue me to this day thanks to his manga series being well written, well-paced, engaging, funny, and enjoyable to read.For me Ken Akamatsu is a legendary mangaka.However Ken Akamatsu works gets an anime Adaptation thing doesn’t quite as well. In fact, his works don’t really translate well into anime. For example, the Love Hina manga...is a solid romcom manga with great comedy that is actually funny, solid romance, likable characters that get developed and does a great job exploring the theme of love and achievement. However, the director for the anime decided to take everything that made the manga good and turned it into a bottom of the barrel, poor animated, unfunny, and cringe-worthy romcom anime that has no at all.Another example of this is Negima which not as bad as the Love Hina it’s still pretty lacklustre adaption overall. The first Negima anime done by Xebec was is a decent show on its own that has good and emotional moments however when you start comparing it to the manga you will soon find out it’s a terrible Adaptation as it skips a lot of chapters as well character’s not even having the right colour to the censored fanservice. As for Shaft Negima the only one that I actually liked are the ovas because not only it’s followed the manga perfectly it was still a great watch for both the manga readers and newcomers. Expect for the Negima Final Movie which was shit. As for the Negima!? TV series is fine but also pretty boring due to the series being reduced to a comedy gag filler show after a certain set of episodes and it got boring fast. Now I personally don’t mind filler as along its done right as well being entertaining to watch but Negima and Love Hina filler are not even that good at all.Now we got UQ Holder. Ken Akamatsu latest anime adaptation.Is this anime any for newcomers for the Negima franchise?Is this a good adaptation of the manga?Or it’s just a forgettable shounen series.We will soon find out the answer.Story.The story in UQ holder is set 80 years after the events of Negima. It follows a young boy named Tota Konoe who is the grandson of Negi Springfield, aspires to leave his village and life live in the city of Shin-Tokyo which has a tower structure rising into space. When he gets mortally wounded by a bounty hunter coming after guardian. He soon discovers that he has been made into an immortal vampire by Yukihime, who is actually a 700-year-old vampire mage Evangeline A.K. McDowell. From there Totua picks up another boy named Kuromaru for the journey and they go to a place outside Shin-Tokyo where Yukihime leads a secret society of immortals called UQ Holder. From there Touta embarks on a unique adventure.UQ Holder is a fun mess. Am not saying the story is bad or anything, in fact, the story is kinda good overall that has a lot of good things in it which I don't want to spoil. However, the problem I have with the story is the show likes to skip quite a lot of chapters from the manga. If you fan of the manga you will not like this show as its skips some important chapters such as the Santa/Sayoko Arc. Another problem that I have with is that its some of the arcs are rushed especially in the tournament arc in episode 10 where the pacing of the show goes way too fast and because of that the tournament arc ended up being really rushed and kinda leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied.I will give UQ Holder Anime Adaptation this. The story itself was left unchanged from its manga counterpart which is shocking because the Negima anime didn't even bother adapting the rest of the manga halfway through.Overall while the story UQ Holder had a lot good things in but ultimately gets crippled by skipping certain important chapters of the manga as well as having rushed pacing and because of that the story of UQ Holder as slightly above average at best.6/10Characters.The characters in UQ Holder were pretty enjoyable but they could have been a lot better and had a bit more character developmentFirst, we have Touta. I personally liked his as a character. Yes if you compare to Negi from the Negima series he is quite a typical but he has a lot of charm in terms of his personality. I also really like his character interactions towards other characters like Yukihime, Kuroumaru and even Negi himself.Kuromaru is an interesting character. This character battle style is very similar to another Negima character that we all Negima fans love Setsuna as they both use the Shinmei-Ryu sword technique. One of the things that I liked about this character is the whole Yatagarasu as all the members from the Yatagarasu are genderless before they turn 16 where after that they can choose to be a male or female. Another thing that I liked about Kuromaru is his/her character interactions with the cast and there are usually great because at this point Kuromaru and rest of the characters in this are confused about the Kuromaru's actual gender.As for Evangeline or Yukihime. She’s still the loveable and badass character that we all love from the Negima series.The rest of the characters are not memorable due to them having lack of screen time.As for characters from the Negima series they are the same likable characters that we all love however they could have treated some of the Negima characters a lot better like for example Asuna who a great loyal partner for Negi is now being reduced to a Deus ex Machina type of character. I won’t tell what episode it happens but watching that episode made me quite sad because I really liked Asuna in the manga.Overall the characters are enjoyable and likable but they could have been a lot better than they actually are.7/10Visuals.Compare to Love Hina and Negima the visuals are a big step up for the most part.The character designs were good and faithful to its manga counterpart. The actual animation is smooth and surprisingly consistent. The fights, for the most part, are well animated as well having a lot of tension. As for censorship unlike the Negima anime the show gives a big fuck you to censorship because of the show, for the most part, pull no punches when it comes to the fanservice and blood. Not bad J.C StaffThe only flaw with the visuals is one sometimes characters go a bit off model and the whole censorship when certain characters is just cringe-worthy but to be honest I rather have than a fucking extreme shot of Asuna panties that has a bear in the middle of the very first episode of Negima Xebec version.Besides those flaws for the visuals, the show is pretty great visually.8/10Sound.The soundtrack is nothing special, to be honest. Yes, it has some good tracks but the most part it’s pretty forgetful.The opening Happy Material is a great opening and I think it’s the best version of the song even surpassing the original Happy Material from the original Negima series which was already great, to begin with.The ending theme Steady Go it’s a nice catchy song that fits well with the show.As for right now, UQ Holder doesn’t have a dub but I hope it gets one soon.I love to see Laura Bailey voicing Evangeline again because she did a masterful job at voicing Evangeline.7/10Final Thoughts.I liked UQ Holder for what it is. Yes, it has its problems such as skipping certain chapters of the manga to a certain character’s being underdeveloped but compare to other Ken Adaptions from the past it does a fairly alright job of adapting the manga as well be a pretty enjoyable show on its own right.If you looking for an enjoyable shounen series that I recommend UQ Holder to anyone however if you are a Negima/UQ holder fan such as myself who read the manga then I advise approaching this show with caution.Final Score 6.5/10 is a solid romcom manga with great comedy that is actually funny, solid romance, likable characters that get developed and does a great job exploring the theme of love and achievement. However, the director for the anime decided to take everything that made the manga good and turned it into a bottom of the barrel, poor animated, unfunny, and cringe-worthy romcom anime that has no at all.Another example of this is Negima which not as bad as the Love Hina it’s still pretty lacklustre adaption overall.

Does it hold up?...or will the high level of nostalgia disappoint us?For LA, the Negima series is in a weird place for LA in terms of nostalgia all things considered. One is that the original Studio DEEN adaptation gives LA fond memories of this series but was definitely an adaptation with it\'s faults and typical harem cliches that hasn\'t aged well. The SHAFT version was LA\'s favorite over the years by having a more shounen-esque mystery feel to it...but having the typical SHAFTism that would have put people off. LA DID NOT read the manga but heard time and again from LA\'s friend that it went into a crazy shounen feel that even the SHAFT version didn\'t even get into. Thus LA was quite in a predicament when going into this spinoff completely blind.And now we have this anime spinoff with an entirely new cast of characters, with old ones returning and it being a fully fledged out shounen series.For a start, LA\'s first impression of UQ Holder was rather meh, going through the cliches of the shounen field from the hot-blooded main character who\'s a nice guy but dense as hell character trying to surpass his teacher Yukihime (or Evangeline just using a transformation magic looking like an adult but whatever...) while trying to get out of his hillbilly of a village town he lives in. His goal is to make it to the top of the tower in.....a far off city. Yeah typical stuff, but its not until the halfway mark when all hell breaks loose from plot twists every episode afterwards to nostalgic throwbacks that ACTUALLY factor into this plot, new harem characters enter the picture and it going full shounen on us WITH UNCENSORED BLOOD!!!!!!!.The entire character cast is very vast to say the least what with new and old characters coming in. So who are the most important characters in all this?...our main protagonist Touta Konoe voiced by Yuka Takakura, Yukihime/Evangeline voiced by Yuki Matsuoka, Negi Springfield is in this too of course who\'s reprised by Rina Satou and Fate voiced by Akira Ishida are the forerunners of this anime. Kirie Sakurame voiced by Ai Kayano, Kuroumaru Tokisaki voiced by Yuuki Hirose, Shinobu Yuuki voiced by Sayaka Harada, Mizore Yukihiro voiced by Akari Kito and Karin Isht Orte voiced by Yui Ogura (Favourite character by the way) are all in the harem and they have some sort of screentime and battles over this anime. The only harem members that didn\'t exactly have enough time are Shinobu for not having ANY battle prowess thus they kinda get shafted and Mizore for just entering the anime too late enough though she\'s battle ready but isn\'t as powerful as the core cast already are. As for the nostalgia cameos, it\'s too be expected the original series cast gets a cameo and some form of presences in the plot also yeah Mizore YUKIHIRO reminds you of someone?...yeah Ayaka Yukihiro voiced by Junko Minagawa gets an episode as well if only because of Mizore...a moving of the torch as you could say. LA\'s favourite cameo would probably be Asuna...because it was ASUNA like come on.LA thinks one of the only problems besides that LA hadn\'t read the source material as well as the original source material was that the pacing is very quick, yeah not ""all over the place"", UQ Holder! has a pacing it\'s just very quick trying to cram in enough exposition, characters and action scenes in one episode as much as possible and yes this impacts the finale but again...this anime is trying to cram in an ongoing manga source material into 12 episodes.....this was GONNA HAPPEN.In terms of animation by JC Staff, the animation is pretty consistent, from the amazingly brutal battles to the updated and newer characters and ecchiness typical of the Negima series. All LA will say about the animation is that LA really liked the animation all round and it didn\'t flake on shortcutting at times and didn\'t annoy LA in many ways. All round the animation especially the supernatural shounen battles were the highlights in terms of animation.The voice acting on the other hand was pretty great all round. From Yuka Takakura crossdressing voices living up to the tradition that Rina Satou did in the original and doing a great job at it, to Yuuki Hirose voicing eerily similar to Nana Mizuki in her typical badass role and yeah a Yui Ogura performance LA can get behind who\'s voicing a kuudere badass. As for the nostalgia cameos, well it\'s to be expected that the majority of the voice cast reprises their roles...well cept the ones that...uhhhh can\'t because reasons. Just reasons. Either way, LA really loved this voice cast, from new and old and even some very well done newbies. Ohh LA forgot but LA thought that Sayaka Harada as Shinobu was voiced by Ayana Takatatsu all this time before LA found out it was Sayaka...MAN Sayaka has range!.So right back to the question LA put at the start of this review. Does this spinoff anime hold up by itself?...well LA thinks this question needs to be rephrased. Does this spinoff HELPS to it\'s original source material while being it\'s own thing. Well to that LA says yes. This spinoff helped to be like it\'s original source material as well as growing it\'s world building as well as TRY to bring in new characters to be important to the plot to which LA feels that Ken Akamatsu obviously planned with this spinoff to how intrinsically linked Touta and Evangeline is to Negi Springfield.Sure this spinoff has problems like the aforementioned pacing issues this anime has but even then LA could defend it by it being an ongoing manga so it was to be expected as well as the problem of a core cast of new characters with powerful battle prowess taking themselves to the forefront with the lesser battle prowess characters being left in the dust and the nostalgic cameos though they are important to the plot, but only by a few scenes unfortunately and of course being an audience member who didn\'t read the original source material as well as THIS source material and going completely blind had it\'s own problems, but even with all this, LA did like this spinoff for being it\'s own thing while paying homage to the original series AND being completely shounen helped as well.Nostalgia is something we want to have to go back to those good old times, but even then we can\'t have it back 100% as a full experience in the form of a new spinoff, prequel, sequel or whatnot. But having a spinoff learned from it\'s mistakes from it\'s MANY adaptations it had is a good step up but that same spinoff bringing in it\'s own mistakes is for LA...a given.UQ Holder!: Mahou Sensei Negima! 2 is a decent to great spinoff even with it\'s strengths and weaknesses. What else can LA say?..Ohh wait how about...""Kimi ni todoketai HAPPY READY GO!"" but having the typical SHAFTism that would have put people off. LA DID NOT read the manga but heard time and again from LA\'s friend that it went into a crazy shounen feel that even the SHAFT version didn\'t even get into. Thus LA was quite in a predicament when going into this spinoff completely blind.And now we have this anime spinoff with an entirely new cast of characters, with old ones returning and it being a fully fledged out shounen series.For a start, LA\'s first impression of UQ Holder was rather meh, going through the cliches of the shounen field from the hot-blooded main character who\'s a nice guy but dense as hell character trying to surpass his teacher Yukihime (or Evangeline just using a transformation magic looking like an adult but whatever...) while trying to get out of his hillbilly of a village town he lives in. His goal is to make it to the top of the tower in.....a far off city. Yeah typical stuff, but its not until the halfway mark when all hell breaks loose from plot twists every episode afterwards to nostalgic throwbacks that ACTUALLY factor into this plot, new harem characters enter the picture and it going full shounen on us WITH UNCENSORED BLOOD!!!!!!!.The entire character cast is very vast to say the least what with new and old characters coming in. So who are the most important characters in all this?...our main protagonist Touta Konoe voiced by Yuka Takakura, Yukihime/Evangeline voiced by Yuki Matsuoka, Negi Springfield is in this too of course who\'s reprised by Rina Satou and Fate voiced by Akira Ishida are the forerunners of this anime. Kirie Sakurame voiced by Ai Kayano, Kuroumaru Tokisaki voiced by Yuuki Hirose, Shinobu Yuuki voiced by Sayaka Harada, Mizore Yukihiro voiced by Akari Kito and Karin Isht Orte voiced by Yui Ogura (Favourite character by the way) are all in the harem and they have some sort of screentime and battles over this anime. The only harem members that didn\'t exactly have enough time are Shinobu for not having ANY battle prowess thus they kinda get shafted and Mizore for just entering the anime too late enough though she\'s battle ready but isn\'t as powerful as the core cast already are. As for the nostalgia cameos, it\'s too be expected the original series cast gets a cameo and some form of presences in the plot also yeah Mizore YUKIHIRO reminds you of someone?...yeah Ayaka Yukihiro voiced by Junko Minagawa gets an episode as well if only because of Mizore...a moving of the torch as you could say.

If you're wondering whether or not the sequel is worth watching, i'll be blunt. It is and it isn't. Don't worry, no spoilers, However I will explain why.First the reasons to watch it;A.) The plot follows as it should and sticks to the manga.B.) The characters don't change so much that you don't recognize them.C.) The character development is just like the original, but a bit more violent....D.) You get to further immerse yourself into the story with beautiful animations.Now the reasons not to watch it;A.) There is huge time skips that will leave you feeling lost, aka 30-100 chapters skipped.B.) If you're hoping to see a lot of previous characters, you will be a bit disappointed.C.) Lots of throw-away characters that you'll probably never see again.D.) At the rate the anime is going, you'll be left wondering what happened, 12 episodes is NOT enough for this much material.And that's a small sum to take into account on why you should or shouldn't watch this anime. The rest i'll leave for you to decide. Enjoy or Don't enjoy, the choice is always yours. D.)

Enjoy or Don't enjoy, the choice is always yours."", ""Being a fan of Ken Akamatsu's work (Love Hina, Negima series (this included)), I was even more happy to see it getting anime adaptations, but sadly with every passing adaptation, it always fails to make what the manga source material great, and then during the conversion to anime, it balls out at the very last minute, and this is another example here with UQ Holder, cramming 140+ chapters into 12 episodes (which clearly ISN'T enough).Story:Set 80 years after the events in Negima!, Touta Konoe (grandson of Negi Springfield) has Yukihime (or the legendary magician Evangeline A.K. McDowell who's a vampire as you wanna call it)...as his guardian, and when his life is risked by a bounty hunter, gets to know her true identity and is introduced to the secret society kniown as UQ Holder, a society made up of people with supernatural powers.Being a manga reader, somehow J.C.Staff assumed that asking people to watch the anime in itself is more of a travesty, because the Santa arc (which takes up at least 20 chapters of the manga) is COMPLETELY missing, and I have no idea why this anime even got a green light in the 1st place. Sure, Negima fans can even complain that the adaptations done earlier was worse, but thankfully this isn't (at least) the worst yet.Characters:Touta Konoe is your run-of-the-mill shounen, with his strong points being aggressive at what he does. Maybe not the best of the main UQ Holder crew, but his interactions with the others are what makes him stand out amongst the heavy action.Kuromaru is an interesting one, because it states that his/her kind are genderless, and when they pass their 16th birthday they get to choose the gender to their liking (and of course if you watch UQ Holder you know the ship feels). Her battle style is of the Shinmei-ryu sword technique (similar to Setsuna), and like Touta, also creates a fun and distracting (in a good way) interaction with the others as well.As for Yukihime, she's the Evangeline Negima fans know and love, just with her alias and establishment of UQ Holder. Nothing more to say on that.For the others (the rest of the UQ Holder crew: Karin, Kirie etc.), they are not given enough time to showcase themselves on the big screen (although supplementary), but that doesn't mean they get their moments, and still strikes off really well.All in all, the character development is one point where this show truly excels at, and wished it could be better if they stringed out longer than 12 episodes allowed.Art/Animation:Yes, you're probably thinking why J.C.Staff gimped on some of the visuals. And yes, things are sure to look more modern (and updated from the previous works), and while the art looked cheap, the animation was on-point consistent (well, most of the time) and gets the job done.To be honest, I've expected J.C.Staff to input more budget knowing that the manga already had a great story to build up to with the action that's held very well, but knowing that paltry 12 episodes isn't gonna cut the slightest of the manga, I just hoped for the best and it delivers somehow, and it's satisfactory for the most part.Sound:The OST is also fairly good as well. Both the OP and ED are energizing to hear (with a happy heart, of course) and can't really fault the BGM here. It's a work well done, but also at the same time, nothing special.I feel like this anime will STILL divide 2 camps of people's thoughts:1) Anime only, as in watching the show purely without knowing what's going on, with the 3-episdode rule making the basis for the show.2) Anime + source material (be it LN, VN, Manga), as in knowing the source material beforehand, and expecting more to come out of the anime adaptation, and comparing both materials to knowing which is better.As for myself, I really still feel like UQ Holder, as a manga it's great, but the anime adaptation barely touches the iceberg, and even with the OVAs coming out next year (which bases off the different arcs in the manga), it feels incomplete at its finest. Yes, I do like what I have watched, and give it a fair bit of respect, but really, RIP Ken Akamatsu for another bad unjustified adaptation. Like in the premlinary Episode 4 count, do watch if you're a diehard fan or Negima, otherwise, go and read the manga if you want more of the storyline. as his guardian, and when his life is risked by a bounty hunter, gets to know her true identity and is introduced to the secret society kniown as UQ Holder, a society made up of people with supernatural powers.Being a manga reader, somehow J.C.Staff assumed that asking people to watch the anime in itself is more of a travesty, because the Santa arc (which takes up at least 20 chapters of the manga) is COMPLETELY missing, and I have no idea why this anime even got a green light in the 1st place.

McDowell, now known as Yukihime, essentially adopts. While originally living in the Japanese countryside, various circumstances occur that result in Yukihime having to make Touta immortal. Furthermore, it turns out that Yukihime is actually the leader of what is essentially a union for immortals known as UQ Holder, who own and operate out of a hot spring known as Senkyoukan. Thus, Touta too begins working there while getting...used to his new abilities and making friends with the other immortals. However, the past quickly catches up to Touta and it turns out there are a lot of important and powerful people interested in him.UQ Holder is the sequel to Negima, Ken Akumetsu’s previous manga series which had somewhat of a difficult history, especially in terms of it’s anime adaptations. The anime for UQ Holder makes that it is a Negima sequel quite clear in that it literally includes “Mahou Sensei Negima! 2” in the title. The manga however does not. I haven’t yet read the UQ Holder manga, so I originally thought that this was just a marketing stunt and that the anime production committee wanted to leverage the Negima brand for marketing. I was incorrect however.This isn’t just a loose sequel set in the same, but a sequel that very heavily draws on the plot and characters of it’s predecessor. This isn’t really apparent in the first half where you’re not missing too much if you haven’t read Negima. However, I’m willing to go as far as saying the second half will make essentially no sense if you haven’t read Negima all the way through, and thus reading Negima is absolutely a prerequisite before watching UQ Holder. I would also like to emphasize the ‘reading’ aspect in the previous sentence, because watching the anime adaptations for Negima definitely isn’t enough.UQ Holder is pretty similar to Negima, but overall it’s much closer to the final arcs after they’ve gone to the Magic World than it is to the earlier arcs in Japan. Overall, it’s much more serious and plot oriented, and ultimately I don’t think that’s for the best right off the bat. I think Negima was amazing for how it was both a good light hearted character focused ecchi/harem series and a good serious plot focused battle manga. UQ Holder feels like it’s also trying to do both, but it’s not really able to do either quite well.The light hearted character focused ecchi/harem aspect is especially weak. It doesn’t really flesh out any of the main characters other than Touta, and there really isn’t the level of ecchi you would expect with there being nothing like Negi’s sneeze gimmick. The OVAs, which are a sequel to the main anime actually handle the ecchi/harem aspect really well so I’m very much looking forward to how things progress in in this regard in the manga. But that doesn’t diminish my disappointment in the main anime.I also found Touta’s relationship with Yukihime strange. I don’t have a problem with it in and of itself, but the way the writing seems to be emphasizing her also loving Negi and Nagi just makes things awkward. Rather than taking it seriously and further convoluting things with what seems to be some sort of time travel, I feel it would have been better to just gloss over things.As for the plot focused and battle focused aspect, it does well to an extent, but I kind of feel like it started falling apart completely towards the end of the season. The biggest reason is that it seems to be drawing way too much from Negima. Touta’s abilities are very heavily rooted in his connections to elements from Negima. Though he gets an original weapon and it seems like that’ll be the core of his ability set, it completely takes a back seat and isn’t developed at all. The plot is fine when it’s focused on UQ Holder and it’s members, but once it starts focusing on Touta and his past it starts getting really convoluted. The final battle was just absurd. It felt like it was just trying to hit as many Negima related beats as it could. I admit the nostalgia did get me emotional, especially the part with Happy Material playing, but I will admit I have very little idea what was actually going on half the time. Overall, I found it completely nonsensical but I did enjoy it.The art and animation are solid enough. The only thing that stood out was that the CG monsters were terrible, though they had very low presence. The OP has pretty good visuals, and uses a new version of Happy Material, an iconic Negima OP song. The EDs of the OVAs also use new versions of Negima EDs, though the visuals were essentially recaps of the episode which I thought was kind of weak. The visuals on the main anime ED is also pretty solid and the song I think is pretty solid too. As far as I know it doesn’t use an old Negima ED though, so I kind of think they should have just for consistency’s sake. used to his new abilities and making friends with the other immortals.

However, when the anime is start aired until the end, it\'s nothing but highly disappointed me so much even more than the first two Negima anime series does.Story: 3/10At the beginning of the story, same as the manga does but with some mirror changes. It\'s started at a boy named Konoe Touta who live in a village along with Yukihime, along with his friends always challenge Yukihime in order able to leave the village and make their...dreams comes true. They are always having fun and thinking how to defeat Yukihime all the time, until a male teacher come to teaching Touta\'s friends the magic spells and tells Touta to give a ring to Yukihime, the ring are used to forbidden the ring wielder to use any magic spells. In the second day, Touta\'s friends attack Yukihime with using magic, a few minutes later that teacher attacked Touta\'s friends and tried to kill Yukihime. Yukihime\'s true name is revealed to be Evangeline A.K McDowell, who is a Vampire from the prequel series Negima!, the ame teacher is also revealed to be a Immortal Hunter and want to kill Yukihime for granting a lot of moneys. When Touta seen Yukihime and his friends in danger, he tried to stop that Immortal Hunter but Touta is killed by him, and later Touta is revived as a Vampire by drinking Yukihime\'s bloods and successful defeated the Immortal Hunter. To avoid an another Immortal Hunter to attack again, Touta and Yukihime is forced to leave the village, Touta is thinking of he can finally go to the tower, to following a mysterious man\'s request. As such, Touta and Yukihime has started their journey.The story is still followed the manga faithfully until EP3 where the story plots almost gotten changed and it\'s so much different than the manga does, and the scriptwriter keep changing the story plots thought EP12. The Anime skipped a lot of stuffs that\'s actually important in the manga, and rushed the whole story plots which caused a lot of confusing when they showed/mentioned somethings that the anime didn\'t even shows up or being mentioned.Art & Animation: 4/10I don\'t know but the art in this anime are look odd and it seem like J.C Staff tried to followed the Negima OVAs\' art but they failed to do so. Sometimes the art (Especially animation) are so bad and it\'s laughable sometimes, it\'s seem like J.C Staff either don\'t have enough budgets to make the animations decent or they didn\'t even put their effort to did the arts.Sound: 7/10It\'s good to see Haneoka Kei returned to did the music for Negima/UQH franchise again, thought his music isn\'t that memorable than his music in Negima!? and the Negima OVAs does, but I still somewhat enjoy the music a bit. As for the characters voices, I like them and it\'s actually fit the characters\' personality. Except of Touta, who is like a typical hot-blooded main male protagonist of Shounen action manga are voiced by a Female voice actor. In my opinion, Touta being voiced by a Female VA is feel so out of place and unfitting due to his hot blood personality and he didn\'t have any childish personality like Son Goku from Dragon Ball series, Luffy from One Piece series and Naruto from Naruto series does. Thought as the anime progress, Touta\'s voice isn\'t so annoyed and I start get to used his voice a bit, but my opinion on Touta\'s voice still haven\'t change in the end.Character: 2/10There\'s a lot of good characters in this series, but due to the anime being skipped and rushed too many plots we didn\'t seen the characters get developed thought the end of the anime. Even so, we still did see how other character like Kuromaru (The female look a-like ""boy"") and Shinobu (The maid girl) get a bit character as the anime progress, but mostly on their feeling toward Touta.Enjoyment: 3/10If you never read the manga before you may enjoy this. But for me who is the manga reader, I can\'t enjoy the anime so much due to the rushed plots and a lot of plots changes here. Sometimes the plots changes is so ridiculous that I can\'t even holding my anger to watching this.Overall: 2/10The only reason why I give 2/10 instead of 1/10 are because the first two episodes are accurate to the original manga and there\'s a few moments in this anime that I actually enjoyed. Overall I don\'t recommend anyone to watch this but recommend to read the manga instead, but of course you can choose to watch this anime if you want and this review didn\'t bother you that much. dreams comes true. They are always having fun and thinking how to defeat Yukihime all the time, until a male teacher come to teaching Touta\'s friends the magic spells and tells Touta to give a ring to Yukihime, the ring are used to forbidden the ring wielder to use any magic spells. In the second day, Touta\'s friends attack Yukihime with using magic, a few minutes later that teacher attacked Touta\'s friends and tried to kill Yukihime. Yukihime\'s true name is revealed to be Evangeline A.K McDowell, who is a Vampire from the prequel series Negima!, the ame teacher is also revealed to be a Immortal Hunter and want to kill Yukihime for granting a lot of moneys. When Touta seen Yukihime and his friends in danger, he tried to stop that Immortal Hunter but Touta is killed by him, and later Touta is revived as a Vampire by drinking Yukihime\'s bloods and successful defeated the Immortal Hunter. To avoid an another Immortal Hunter to attack again, Touta and Yukihime is forced to leave the village, Touta is thinking of he can finally go to the tower, to following a mysterious man\'s request. As such, Touta and Yukihime has started their journey.The story is still followed the manga faithfully until EP3 where the story plots almost gotten changed and it\'s so much different than the manga does, and the scriptwriter keep changing the story plots thought EP12. The Anime skipped a lot of stuffs that\'s actually important in the manga, and rushed the whole story plots which caused a lot of confusing when they showed/mentioned somethings that the anime didn\'t even shows up or being mentioned.Art & Animation: 4/10I don\'t know but the art in this anime are look odd and it seem like J.C Staff tried to followed the Negima OVAs\' art but they failed to do so. Sometimes the art (Especially animation) are so bad and it\'s laughable sometimes, it\'s seem like J.C Staff either don\'t have enough budgets to make the animations decent or they didn\'t even put their effort to did the arts.Sound: 7/10It\'s good to see Haneoka Kei returned to did the music for Negima/UQH franchise again, thought his music isn\'t that memorable than his music in Negima!? and the Negima OVAs does, but I still somewhat enjoy the music a bit. As for the characters voices, I like them and it\'s actually fit the characters\' personality. Except of Touta, who is like a typical hot-blooded main male protagonist of Shounen action manga are voiced by a Female voice actor. In my opinion, Touta being voiced by a Female VA is feel so out of place and unfitting due to his hot blood personality and he didn\'t have any childish personality like Son Goku from Dragon Ball series, Luffy from One Piece series and Naruto from Naruto series does. Thought as the anime progress, Touta\'s voice isn\'t so annoyed and I start get to used his voice a bit, but my opinion on Touta\'s voice still haven\'t change in the end.Character: 2/10There\'s a lot of good characters in this series, but due to the anime being skipped and rushed too many plots we didn\'t seen the characters get developed thought the end of the anime.

If it wasn't for the fact that I love the manga I would gladly rate this anime 2/10, because taking the old Negima opening and making the new characters sing over it ain't enough for me to appreciate an anime adaptation that is beyond atrocity.

It should also be noted that there are many things that require knowledge about the previous work, Negima, which I recommend for you guys to read the manga as the...anime never really went far especially with the Magical World arc.The story starts out with our main protagonist, Touta Konoe and his friends attacking their teacher and Touta’s guardian, Yukihime (Evangeline A.K. McDowell). Their dream is to get out of the village and go to capital and reach the top of the space elevator. However Yukihime is a mage and isn’t so easily defeated. A crisis that develops leads to Touta finding out about his curse of immortality that was given to him by Yukihime and eventually he and Yukihime leaves the village and make their way to the capital where he can make new friends.On their way there, Touta meets an immortal immortal hunter, Kuroumaru, who later becomes his best friend. While the three of them travel they eventually come into contact with Yukihime’s organization UQ Holder. UQ Holder is an organization of immortals that help the world much like a guild and they also operate an inn. This is the how Touta Konoe’s everyday life begins, one filled with romantic comedy as the staff and even guests eventually develops feelings for him, even his best bro. But not everything is sunshines and rainbows as Touta’s past is trying to capture him and he must uncover the truth as well as his connection to his grandfather who is the greatest mage, Negi Springfield.The problem here is that J.C.Staff is trying to cram so much material (over 100 chapters worth) into just 12 episodes. So much doesn’t make sense that I kept asking myself stuff like “why this character is showing up so early” or “wasn’t there an arc or 2 before this scene happens?”, the result being that it is an obvious mess and destroys something that could’ve been nothing less than epic. If the studio had been given a chance to do a 2-cour (24 or 25 episodes) of this adaptation then it would’ve been undoubtedly much better than what has been presented to us. It also doesn’t help that they completely erased one arc that introduced us to a really strong character and another male in this Touta-centric anime, they also omitted the training arc where pretty much all the kids get ridiculously strong because they were taught by none other than Evangeline’s master. The training arc was somewhat shown in the OVA but it focused more on Eva and Touta’s relationship which was really sweet but the climax was omitted to my dismay. Also for those who haven’t read the manga you guys should watch the OVA after the anime because of the last line in the anime for it to make more sense.The art was decent enough and the action scenes were quite fluid but they lacked the punch that could be found in the manga. It also doesn’t help that some of the more intense fights were cut out due to time constraints. I was also incredibly pissed they never once showed Yukihime using her Magia Erebia form to fight which makes one of the best fights in the whole series when she used it against Fate. Being a romcom anime as well there are many fanservice scenes but I question the censorship using Kamo, while it was cute and unique first time watchers will wonder who the creature is.I can’t really say much about the soundtrack but the battle music was quite good and manages to sound right when the mood gets heavy or dramatic but it wasn’t exactly memorable in my opinion. The voices were alright but Touta’s was annoying or didn’t sound right at first but I eventually got used to it. The opening and ending had some fanservice and it was too cheery in my opinion, they could’ve just went for some Fairy Tail like songs and it would’ve been much better although that’s just my opinion.In the end UQ Holder! had so much going for it but definitely is only subpar at best. A truly epic series despite all the fanservice and slapstick comedy was again afflicted by Ken Akamatsu’s (the creator) curse of having bad adaptations of his works. But despite all the negatives, the few positives helped alleviate my impression of the series. It was so nostalgic to see Negi and the class of 3-A all over again especially Asuna. It reminded me so much of the Negima manga that it makes me want to read it all over again. Also Kuroumaru’s case of his/her feelings for Touta retains the same amount of hilarity as it did in the manga.  I also had fun watching Evangeline but that could just be my bias as she is my favorite character in the Negima universe. In a way it is also unique to see a romcom for immortals.If you want to get the full experience of UQ Holder! then I wholeheartedly recommend that you read the Negima manga if you haven’t yet as its 2 major arcs are some of the best if not the best I have ever seen in any medium, then after that you can read the UQ Holder! manga which I will do so soon because the anime just doesn’t do it the justice and exposure it deserves.P.S.

They skipped out on parts that WILL come later in the anime if it is continued. But they should have followed the same order as the manga so that the viewers would have understood more and felt more towards the characters and story. They also just completely got rid of a character that may or may not come later, but they were still an important part of the whole story! To anyone who wants a good story you should read the manga and forget all about this anime!It you had not read the manga and just...watched the anime it would have been a lot better! But even as an anime they skipped a lot of character development and backstory that would have made the anime a lot better. They rushed the story and everything else way too much. If they continue the anime i guarantee that it will still be lackluster. But if they decided to continue it they really have to slow down the speed of story and give better character and background development if they want it to feel meaningful.Sorry if my thoughts are allover the place and such, i don't write reviews ever and i just suck at writing.

It's the most braindead mind-numbing fanfiction around. A five-year old took a whole bunch of fanfiction tropes and threw them in a blender. We have space aliens, martial arts werewolves, vampires, holy maidens, elevators into space, blind samurai, and everything else you can think of. The whole pantry...went into this boiling pot.

Everyone is immortal (literally) and there is no tension or stakes. The MC has an obnoxious girl voice that's better for a 5 year old than a 14 year old.

Are you willing to sit through what this show thinks is a ""story"" and a ""harem"" to get to them? Then you should watch this. People who like serious stories alongside action have much better options.Long version:I didn\'t have many expectations for this anime, going in. I knew there would be story elements and references to the first Negima! series that would go over my head, since I have not seen it, nor have I read the original manga. However the title\'s branding as ""UQ Holder"", as well as the strength of the first episode,...drew me in. So that\'s my perspective- if you\'re an OG Negima fan you may want to read someone else\'s review.Let\'s start with the sound design. This, I feel, epitomizes the show. The SFX do their job, with only some of the more powerful spells used later in the show sticking out to me as memorable. The music too, chugs along with the show, dutifully getting intense during fights, hopeful when the characters reach some important revelation, yada yada yada. It\'s... just good enough. It manages to step over the bar, but it\'s nothing to praise either.The art is amazing though. This anime is simply gorgeous to look at, and it doesn\'t feel like there are many cheap tricks to avoid animating things, either. There is an action scene every episode, and although it isn\'t always a fight, it keeps the early episodes from feeling like exposition dumps. However, the story itself is a major let down.It was so disappointing to watch a somewhat unique story trainwreck into a convoluted, rushed mess. Frankly, the UQ Holder (think Immortal Magic Justice League) part of the plot is swept under the rug so quickly, it seems to exist solely to justify the graphic torture we watch the characters undergo. Having a plot that includes ""all of the main characters are immortal"" is a great way to play the balancing game of ""Serious Philosophical Ideas"" and ""Dumb Anime Bullshit,"" because it takes the tension off, so it\'s more believable when characters are joking around in one scene, and fighting seriously in the next. But no, it starts sloping down when the show just tosses ""deep"" questions out (such as, ""Is it worth it for an immortal person to make friends with a mortal, knowing that they will one day die and be left alone?"") and just straight up forget about them.It then takes a complete nosedive when the main plot inevitably becomes ""main character is going to be absorbed by the bad guy! Oh no!"", which not only makes the story feel generic, it turns that unique plot point and just makes it an excuse for what is basically torture porn. The characters all suffer big time, and I found it unsettling, even having just watched Texhnolyze before watching this show. Again, this could\'ve been an outlet for philosophical expression, but it just feels distasteful, even if I didn\'t like the characters, either.The characters are another low point. There are seriously about 300 characters who give their full names out, and about ten of them show up more than once.  Of those, four of them are on harem duty, fulfilling their cookie cutter tropes and little else. The rest are barely developed, having one cool fight scene apiece, and otherwise they rotate out for expositional dialogue.But I still found it in me to finish this anime, and you will too, enjoying yourself somewhat if you are a ACTION/FIGHT SCENE JUNKIE. I kept watching because the fights are among the best I have ever seen in an anime, and I could just switch my brain off during the rest.It\'s pretty brain dead anyway.Individual scores:Story: 0/2Art: 2/2Sound: 1/2Characters: 0/2Enjoyment (FIGHT SCENE JUNKIES): 2/2Overall score: 5/10 drew me in.

You also will really need toThe story suffers from continuous absurdity and not in a good way. The essence of the story revolves around two things, magical martial arts fights between beings that are immortal and can\'t be defeated, and a frustrated harem setup with an already decided conclusion that\'s being teased by fiat.The characters get decent backstorys if...not a lot of growth or change. They do get powered up but it\'s in a way that would make isekai protagonists using their cheat abilities go ""Man that\'s ridiculous"" , or once again from Negi ""This is all absurd"".  Well for the most part. There\'s more than a few ""Now I am the master moments"". Unfortunately they come far too quickly.Tota as a character, is in many way the worst you will ever see in an anime. As his backstory is fleshed out he becomes less and less believable. What\'s worse he\'s a constant Talker. He\'s a blabbermouth and it\'s constant constant constant blather.The music isn\'t as good as in Negima but it\'s far better deployed, It enhances and complements the scenes instead of overwhelming them.Overall, if you are familiar with the manga, or have Mahou Sensei it\'s watchable. It\'s a hell of a lot more pleasant than say trying to read UQ holder which is up to a 150 or chapters and is one of those manga running on the idea of, as long as people are reading the story, I will complicate things to infinity and beyond. not a lot of growth or change. They do get powered up but it\'s in a way that would make isekai protagonists using their cheat abilities go ""Man that\'s ridiculous"" , or once again from Negi ""This is all absurd"".  Well for the most part. There\'s more than a few ""Now I am the master moments"". Unfortunately they come far too quickly.Tota as a character, is in many way the worst you will ever see in an anime. As his backstory is fleshed out he becomes less and less believable. What\'s worse he\'s a constant Talker. He\'s a blabbermouth and it\'s constant constant constant blather.The music isn\'t as good as in Negima but it\'s far better deployed, It enhances and complements the scenes instead of overwhelming them.Overall, if you are familiar with the manga, or have Mahou Sensei it\'s watchable.

And it came true.Overall:Story: Actually followed the manga for more than half a season so I'll give them credit for that. Of course it's understandable that pacing becomes an issue with all adaptations, but studios need to realize, following the real plot properly and ending off with a cliffhanger is much better than twisting stories to suit your production timeline and ending with a cheesy plot that just screams dues ex machina at the end.Voice acting was good in...a sense that it just hits you with nostalgia. Some casts though, really need to improve on their acting. That and the script flow between each character isn't very smooth, I'm not sure if they managed to get all the voice actors to voice scenes together or they recorded them individually depending on schedule. But to me it doesn't feel like all the characters were present when they recorded. Conversations are a bit disjointed.Animation-wise, it's barely passable for a series with so much battles. J.C. Staff has obviously not put in as much money as they did for Index series. Ultra low frame-rates, simplistic drawings for attacks. If it was a doujin circle I'd give it an A+, but for an established studio, this is a D- in my book.RIP Ken Akamatsu. Seems like you're never going to get any decent adaptations ever. Now the only hope of redeeming the Negima series is to pass it over to Ufotable with a blank cheque. J.C. Staff better have an epic Index installment considering they cut corners with all their side projects. a sense that it just hits you with nostalgia.

That said, you don't really need to have seen negima to feel the connection the returning characters have with each other.What jumped out at me most was the first episode of this series. If the rest of the season had been like episode one, this would have been an all time favorite for me.  I think the story notches down a bit after episode 1, but I still found it very enjoyable.  Some of...the reviews from manga readers point to the cramming of a bunch of chapters into one corre season, and I can kind of see that.If they could have made a season based solely on Touta's connection to Evangeline, it would be an all time favorite for me.Now, I guess I should go watch Negima. the reviews from manga readers point to the cramming of a bunch of chapters into one corre season, and I can kind of see that.If they could have made a season based solely on Touta's connection to Evangeline, it would be an all time favorite for me.Now, I guess I should go watch Negima."", 'For me it was a good anime, I could have a sequel because I think I had the potential for it.Although this harem was a bit annoying and I think it spoiled anime, but I really liked the part of him wanting to marry eva and not be like most of the harem anime that the protagonist does not choose anyone........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................For me it was a good anime, I could have a sequel because I think I had the potential for it.Although this harem was a bit annoying and I think it spoiled anime, but I really liked the part of him wanting to marry eva...and not be like most of the harem anime that the protagonist does not choose anyone and not be like most of the harem anime that the protagonist does not choose anyone', 'I do not know why this anime has a 7+ rating considering the main character won\'t react in any rational way.

One episode story will go to past and back, another episode will be of some lunch making, third episode will introduce more characters and another super-villain then very next episode it would be a love story.

But on the good side, the characters are very well designed 😝... But on a serious note, most of the time when those kinda scenes do happen, you ll probably be pretty engrossed in the story and would give little mind to the obscenity happening.. but, there...are times where it feels as though it\'s forced though, and it seems borderline fanservice, but nothing unmanageable.NOW leaving the ecchi aside and talking about the rest of the stuff :The anime starts off in a very laid back manner and can quite easily turn you off in the very 1st few minutes ... And you will be left thinking why t he hell did start this.. BUT be rest assured, in the second half of the very first episode, you will quickly realise that this anime isn\'t what you thought it will be... Things get serious, there is cutting, slashing, people are being torn apart and blood and what not... From then on, the anime does a pretty decent job of unfolding events and story... And you are given an impression of a very solid story. You might even get an impression that this anime has a lot of potential. And you are probably right, the anime shows alot of potential.Unfortunately, things get a little rushed in the end and the story eventhough reaches a plateau, it never really reaches an ending. And you are left with kind of mixed feelings... the anime would probably be better off with 2 seasons is what I felt.. but they squeezed it in 12 eps and 3 ovas...Either way, its a really good one time watch, is what I would say. Action is good and plentiful.. some spectacular moments here and there.. and if u also like a some good ecchi on the side, what else can u ask for?AND ! Be sure to watch all the 3 ovas as well as they are basically sequels to the anime and take the story further...

I had watched UQ Holder as an independent show, and feel that it should be watched independently.While it is the same universe, it's not set using the same characters as Negima! I wouldn't say the anime itself was great, but I found it enjoyable. I have no basis to judge the entire story, as it is somewhat related to the Negima! story, but I still feel it should be judged as an anime that interacts with another...series, not a continuation of Negima!In comparison to the first look of both anime, I think I prefer UQ Holder! plot to Negima! Some of it comes down to release times, as Negima! does have worse animation as a result of its time, but I still feel UQ Holder! does a better job at interacting with characters. Compared to a teacher/school anime with dozens of students, I prefer following a person and a few comrades progress themselves in training.While I have neither Negima! or the manga to base this review on, I feel this anime is too heavily criticized based on a comparison to a manga or predecessor anime. While I agree that the anime was heavily rushed, I still think it was worth a watch, and is engaging enough to draw in new readers, instead of over relying on a 15 year old anime for continuity. series, not a continuation of Negima!In comparison to the first look of both anime, I think I prefer UQ Holder! plot to Negima!

It has the My Senpai Is Annoying skeleton structure of a tall man and a short woman working together but throws in a bit of Uzaki-chan Wants To Hang Out by giving the short woman massive honkers and making everything she says sound like an innuendo to her impressionable and secretly horny kouhai. That is where the joke begins and ends.Honestly, their relationship isn’t that interesting. There's no tension conflict or tension to drive them forward. It’s purely a show...where the viewer is supposed to self-insert themselves onto the wet blanket of a protagonist and think “Look at this small, adorable woman with big anime tittes. I wish I had a cute coworker with big tittes who would look after me, pat me on the head when I've done a good job, secretly she kind of wants to fuck me when she's alone and sometimes she makes cat noises.” It’s very vapid and not very engaging.The supporting cast, however, has a lot of personality. Chinatsu, the childhood friend of bland Protagonist-kouhai, is secretly an otaku outside of work and enjoys making cosplay and going to conventions, whilst their floor manager is… a strange man who enjoys watching other people's love lives flourish. They have fun interactions and a genuinely cute story going on in the background of the main couple.Coupled with bland art and animation, bland is the only word I can think of to describe My Tiny Senpai. It’s not bad, but it’s not particularly good either. There are enough work-life comedies about fully grown working adults baby-step their way into maybe confessing their feelings for each other and maybe showing some backbone.

Chiisai senpai is somewhat of a one trick pony. Its story is very simple, but it executes that one trick very well making for a fun viewing experience. It’s an endearing and charming workplace story that reminds us how love can be found when you least expect it.Contrary to how Twitter erupted when the first trailer for this dropped with “pedobait” allegations, because we all know pedophilia=anime girl short, this is a pure fluff watch that will set your heart ablaze with how sweet it can be..In Japanese society, the workplace can be brutal and unforgiving....Long hours, unpaid overtime and abuse from superiors. So it should come as no surprise that Katase Shiori’s concern and affection towards Takuma Shinozaki is such a welcome sight for the MC. Having someone that genuinely cares for you in this environment is a blessing, one that he does not take for granted. Of course, because anime MC logic, he’s totally oblivious to the not so subtle flirtatious manner in which Katase expresses herself.What really stands out in this one is the somewhat realistic nature in which the budding romance is handled. Falling in love in the workplace can really complicate things and has ethical and professional ramifications. I like how the show addresses that and it adds to the romantic tension. Some will find this a negative as they think there’s no point continuing a story if the characters aren’t together within a few episodes. However, obstacles like this only serve to enhance the story in my opinion, and it feels believable. Characters should feel trepidation about this type of thing.Although wholesome and cute, the show can be a bit repetitive at times. There’s also times where the progression feels painfully slow because of Shinozaki’s density. Obviously like most romance stories, this is played up because seeing the couple get together immediately wouldn’t be fun. But my goodness is the MC thick at times. Some of the gags also feel very high school-y despite this being a workplace story. This wasn’t a big turn off for me though, but still worth noting.The side characters are actually fun in this one and make up for any issues with Shinozaki. It takes a while for them to really get mixed into the story, but once they do you instantly fall in love with them. In fact, I honestly believe the manager, sister and childhood friend are the best parts of this show. Absolutely hilarious dynamic between the three that spices up the rather simple story.Project No.9 have gained a reputation for doing these cutesy style romances and they did another good job here. The art is bright and cheery, a total contrast to the reality of working in a Japanese office, but a welcome escape. Animation is about what you’d expect from a slice of life romance. Solid, but nothing to write home about.Overall, Chiisai senpai is a cute and fluffy workplace romance. It’s not innovative, but it works. It’s cute, has good characters, a realistic dilemma and some nice art. Those looking for a break from the near incessant stream of high school romance will find a solid watch here.Chisai Senpai gets 8 out of 10. Long hours, unpaid overtime and abuse from superiors.

The workplace setting is pointless because all the characters act like middle schoolers.I honestly can't find the words to review this anime because of how little content it has. The series always sticks to safe generic plot and never does *anything* original. You have seen this stuff in most classic (older) romcoms where the two main characters keep hesitating to take the next step. The plot never moves forward, and you can't distinguish between episode 1 and 10 because there's barely any progress.The dialogue, plot, characters, art and everything is just tropes copy-pasted from existing...works. The tropes of1. guy getting cold due to rain -> girl cooking for him2. gang going to swimming pool -> swimsuits fanservice3. girl eating one fking alcohol based chocolate -> acting super drunk4. going to hotsprings -> girl getting drunk and acting clingy..all of these have been done to death. Tropes are supposed to be used in your story. But here, there is literally nothing but tropes. what am i supposed to review? how do i differentiate this from other series? What did the author even do here? Just contribute something original ffs, to atleast leave your mark on your own series.CharactersMC is the generic nice guy with all the personality of a blank white A4 paper. super boring and sometimes annoying with his indecisiveness in progressing the romance track.FMC is just your average generic tiny waifu with humongous milkers. She is a teasing mature sempai sometimes, but also becomes a blushing stuttery mess, depending on what the plot demands. She also actively blocks any romantic progress from ever happening. She is basically there to pander to the male gaze.There are a few side characters who are (slightly) more fun to watch. Especially the boss. His ship with hayakawa is nice, but needed more development. There's another side ship, but it barely got started this season. I think these characters seem better, because of how garbage our main characters are.Overallif you are nostalgic for generic romcoms (or you are still new to anime and haven't watched the other romcom series), then this might be worth a watch. Otherwise, just skip this and get some sleep instead. Also checkout the sugar song (ED), which was the only nice thing about this series. works.

Also checkout the sugar song (ED), which was the only nice thing about this series."", '~ My Tiny Senpai is a textbook example of why drama requires motive and conflict to thrive, and what happens when they aren\'t there. The characters never have any explicit goals, and the resulting story feels aimless and monotonous.~ This is the most generic slice-of-life anime I\'ve ever seen. The protagonist is an unremarkable everyman, the female lead is lovable and buxom, and the two have clichéd romantic encounters where they start blabbing about how embarrassed they are over nothing. There is no thematic hook or selling point to this anime; what makes this show different from every other workplace anime?~ The character design is...completely flat. Outside of the tiny senpai herself, none of the characters have any striking visual features, existing only to populate the background.= Slice-of-life can have a reputation for being boring, but the point of the genre is to heighten the drama of everyday situations. Yet even by the metrics of slice-of-life anime, My Tiny Senpai is insufferably dull. It\'s an anime we\'ve seen before in shows like ""Wotakoi"" or ""My Senpai is Annoying,"" but without the character focus of the former or the comedic highs of the latter.

The trope of a little girl working in a office with relatively large bodied individuals. Take heed, for this is not your typical loli, the forbidden flavour you've been accustomed to snorting. This, well this is something what I'd like to call something a little more sophisticated, granted if I understood what the word sophisticated means. Unfortunately that is not to be expected to fly here under the judicious eyes of able bodied individuals overseeing what is to be had here, and who to censor. Well anyway...Plot: An office...worker of the female variety with a relatively short stature in terms of physical proportions cascades through the daily rigours of an employment. That in a nutshell is the plot, with a nice little peal of romance nonchalantly tossed over it. If you've seen the other one, yes, the one with the Green Hair, this should be right up your alley.Characters: The main draw here is obviously a petite body housing a modestly aged soul, but other varieties, such as the long limbed junior, the cheeky chief, the beautiful co worker, and so on are also available. To make a long story short if you know the other one, yes the Green Hair one, this should be true to your course.Animation: Nothing too shabby, nor anything to complain, just about how it is supposed to be.Music: Not much to talk about here as well.Enjoyment: There is enjoyment to be had here, though I'm not sure how much of it is to be had. For example, if you've experienced the other one, yes the Green Hair one... Okay, okay, let's not be uncivil. If you've seen My Senpai is Annoying, and enjoyed the living daylights out of it, theoretically this should be parking on your side of the road. worker of the female variety with a relatively short stature in terms of physical proportions cascades through the daily rigours of an employment.

I cannot fathom how they managed to continue.The art style is standard and nothing unique about it. The characters are uninteresting, the plot is rather simple at times and dull at others. Compared to Saint Cecilia anime, Saint Cecilia is more interesting.The words dull, boring, bland, uninteresting, torture, miserable, and lame all come to mind as I flick through the episodes.

"", '""When one trope starts, all else starts to follow."" - A random anime weebDo you remember a little show called Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi a.k.a My Senpai is Annoying? It aired back in Fall 2021, courtesy of Doga Kobo, and it was one of the popular shows in that season (that was dominated by Mushoku Tensei Season 1 Part 2 and Komi-san, to name a few), that was heavily influenced by Spring 2018\'s Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii a.k.a Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku, also another popular show from that season. And within the span of 5 years, we get yet another...iteration of the now-known adult-casted workplace themes and rom-com genre, in the vein of mangaka Saisou\'s Uchi no Kaisha no Chiisai Senpai no Hanashi a.k.a My Tiny Senpai. From what started out as a Doujin self-made work, it was expanded to become a manga series, and in my mind, this show can be summed up as such: swap the body and personalities of the MCs from Senpai ga Uzai and make the female MC an Uzaki-chan derivative.This is the alternate WotaKoi story of a worker and his Senpai mentor, Takuma Shinozaki and Shiori Katase, which from the outside, you would think that they\'re just casual office colleagues who do their workday in and day out. But being the Senpai character that Shiori is, she dotes on Shinozaki being her first mentee with her gorgeous, profoundly kind, loving, and diminutive womanly traits, hoping to both train him and make him feel relaxed. The work may be hard, but the relationship shared is just as professional as possible. The professionalism in that sense...is the usual kind of situation that you would expect from a rom-com about the daily operations in the office about the innocent young man and his buxom Senpai supervisor who engages in anything and everything that\'s noteworthy to the other colleagues in their department of Development Group 1. There is no doubt that the show wants us to see the growing relationship of Shinozaki and Shiori that will one day develop into a sizable romance. the hints are there, alright, along with its wishy-washyness of ""will they, won\'t they"".Both Shinozaki and Shiori are not the only colleagues sharing the same office space, as they\'re also accompanied by Shinozaki\'s childhood friend and co-worker, Chinatsu Hayakawa, and their department manager, Chihiro Akina. Once again, we do have the exact same situation/scenario as Senpai ga Uzai, that the odd ""couple"" of Hayakawa and Akina are basically the replication of Touko Sakura and Souta Kazama, only that both of their involvements towards both Shinozaki and Shiori are as clear as day, having romantic shticks of their very own. This is especially important because Hayakawa is into cosplay, and Akina...well, he\'s just the wingman who knows how to navigate office romance relationships well, despite the former having feelings for him. A relationship between the co-worker and her innocent, yet happy-go-lucky, and cunning manager? I would be down for that if it were true! But once again, just like Senpai ga Uzai, the side couple is more interesting than the main couple, and this show suffers from the same problem as the former, even though this is less pronounced here.At this point, I don\'t quite have expectations for Project No. 9\'s production; as long as it\'s serviceable, that\'s fine and all by me. And the OST is really good with Touya Kobayashi and YU-KA\'s very catchy OP and ED songs, so much so that you can\'t help but listen to the songs every episode. It was definitely the highlight for me.All in all, what mangaka Saisou had managed to procure with Uchi no Kaisha no Chiisai Senpai no Hanashi a.k.a My Tiny Senpai is decent at best, though it doesn\'t break the bank, especially having watched WotaKoi and Senpai ga Uzai (which this is the better ""Annoying Senpai"" show of the two). Even with how genuine that this shows commits to its premise with all the sweet and fluffy undertones, and while innocent, it\'s just very surface-based and can be bland at times.

The character development appears to be an afterthought, leaving viewers with little to invest in emotionally. As a result, the...supposedly endearing moments lack the depth needed to resonate with the audience.The central flaw in ""My Tiny Senpai"" lies in its failure to deliver on the romantic promise that is fundamental to the genre.

By no means, this show really deserve detailed reviews.

I didn't observed any negative in this department.Sound effects & dialogues are pretty good & feel quite natural (to...some extent). This is for English Dubbed verison strictly.The storyline is pretty generic, which is not a bad thing per se. Never expected any greatness from the show. Character Development was decent.

Now the thing which kinda motivated me to share my thoughts:The direction here was a little messed up. The pacing was a bit off. In some episodes, it felt a little too fast while in others it was sloppy. The content distribution for each episode wasn't equitable which is a must for a Slice of Life, RomCom Drama type show.This pacing affect another aspect of 5 criteria rating/review process - Enjoyment factor. This show was going pretty well in terms of enjoyment factor even with a generic story & slight messed up pacing & direction until the last episode.The last episode was a mess, especially the climax.

I just hard to enjoy the show with how stupid it's starting to feel.Spoilers: about half way through the season, the male MC is going to confess his feelings. The female MC totally expects he'll ask, and is getting...prepared for the big moment. But at lunch, her two coworkers (who have spent the entire series trying to hook the two MCs up) are just gossiping with her about how awful office romances are, and how you can get in trouble for having one. Clearly not the best conversation to have with someone you're trying to hook up at work.And so the female MC gets all nervous and decides it's best if things just stay the way they are, with them as just coworkers. So when the moment comes, she preemptively tells him how happy she is with their current relationship just coworkers. Great. He get the not-so-subtle hint to not say confess to her.Very next episode she's fantasizing about him liking her, hoping he feels the same, and that he'll make some sort of move on her.So yeah. the extreme lack of character consistency makes it hard to enjoy the typical awkward situations and playful banter that makes a good romcom anime. prepared for the big moment.

The adult ""loli"" with huge oppai made me concerned that I was about to witness some fanservice trash. I am happy to report that this is only partially the case. My Tiny Senpai tries to go down the cute and fluffy route. There is lot\'s of forced blushing and bashfulness from our resident loli, and lots of catgirl moments (is the mangaka a furry). On the other hand, each episode is fresh and lively, and ideas aren\'t really recycled which is another fear that I had coming in. I thought that their office would be the main...scene the majority of the time. The comedy might not hit all of the time, but I think that it was up my alley for the most part.Positives: I\'ll elaborate on comedy here. It writes it\'s jokes in a way that falls into common tropes, but actually satirizes/makes fun of those tropes. This can come in the form of misunderstandings and teasing primarily but it can go other ways as well. For me personally, I enjoyed the comedy a lot and when it was paired with the plot, it really elevated my enjoyment of the series. My next main positive is the plot. Each episode has a standalone conflict or event the characters are working on and it was always fresh and positive. From design competitions to cosplay events to working at daycares to more cliches, it was honestly a lot of fun. As I said earlier, I think that it was enjoyable, was it quality or groundbreaking, no not really. But it did a job that not every romcom can pull off.Negatives: It gets a little creepy. Right off the bat, Shiori Katase (female MC) and her character design gross me out. An adult woman in a child body with huge tits. It\'s a pretty disgusting kind of fanservice that is catering to some.... audience. I also think that the way she acts is off-putting. She is always doing this ""cutesy"" stuff that feels super unnatural and it goes against the grain of the episode. She doesn\'t act in a normal way that makes her likeable. I don\'t like them putting cat ears on her and having her blush super hard and play this mommy/older sister figure. Say whatever you want, DM me, argue, but I am absolutely 100% hellbent on the fact that this character is just shameless fanservice, and the series could have been much better off making her anything that isn\'t a loli who acts weird.In conclusion, My Tiny Senpai can get bland sometimes, and it gets creepy as well, in particular the character of the female lead. The character designs are disturbing as well (this is more subjective). Despite that, the plot is fresh and exciting, and the comedy is pretty funny and works well enough in tandem with one another that I can recommend this rom-com for you to at least give a shot. Final score: 7/10 scene the majority of the time. The comedy might not hit all of the time, but I think that it was up my alley for the most part.Positives: I\'ll elaborate on comedy here.

Final score: 7/10', 'The anime is at its strongest in the first couple of episodes when it focuses on the four main characters (Katase, Shinozaki, Akina, and Hayakawa). All of them are likeable and interesting (particularly Akina), and their interactions are wholesome and endearing. Instead of developing those relationships (much) further, however, the show starts adding new, less interesting characters around the midpoint and wastes a lot of time on them. By the end, the romantic plots remain underdeveloped.There was also a noticeable change in the use of fan service. While some viewers might be annoyed with it from the very start, it definitely becomes more prominent (some...might say obnoxious) as the anime continues.All in all, it could have been another (maybe even better) ""Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi (My senpai is annoying)"", but ended up as an okay show with much lost potential. might say obnoxious) as the anime continues.All in all, it could have been another (maybe even better) ""Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi (My senpai is annoying)"", but ended up as an okay show with much lost potential.', ""“My Tiny Senpai” is what happens when You want to write an adult romcom but have no idea how adults act.The show revolves around two idiots that have the personalities of teenagers despite being, supposedly, adults.

It\'s a slice-of-life style.

The story is totally worthless except for the last two 'episodes', it mainly only consists of fan-service and naturally story is totally irrelevant to fan service. As its a picture drama the art is naturally poor, and the number of pictures was even low compared to other picture drama's I have seen. Sound was just ok, though I think it reused most music from the main series. In the picture drama Louise and Saito are playing a theatre piece and...their characters are interesting to some extend and I in the last two 'episodes' there is something (at least I smiled for the first time) which is enjoyable to some extend, however due to the first few episodes which were pure fan service I went down from a 4-5/10 to a 3/10. Overall I think it's not worth watching, though it won't take a lot of time to watch either. their characters are interesting to some extend and I in the last two 'episodes' there is something (at least I smiled for the first time) which is enjoyable to some extend, however due to the first few episodes which were pure fan service I went down from a 4-5/10 to a 3/10.

If we're picking out moments from S3 then nah, but as a whole? I'd say this is better. Characters don't betray their personality like in S3 and ofc the other faults S3 has that my review pointed out but no need to mention that here as its not relevant to this review.You can (at the time of this review's date posted) find this on YouTube, if you're looking for the English Sub version you can find 6 out of 7.the last one not subbed you can...find with a CC turned on but the sub for the CC is crap. However if you like me have seen enough sub anime and know enough Japanese words then that + the CC and whats going on in the episode you can make out most or all of whats being said/happening. That said the other 6 that ARE subbed are out of order, it was annoying to have to play puzzle to find the right order, thankfully logic and common sense as well as the sub and start of the episode as well as the MAL synopsis here are what made it possible to find the correct order with little trouble. As a result i only saw 1 episode out of order.Ah, my apologies, let's get onto the review itself. Basically the art for these 7 eps in this picture drama is really nice and well done. The story is basically Saito, Louise and Siesta are doing a play. Why, where and for what purpose is never explained, sadly. Likewise I'm unable to say if this is even canon, as only one thing said during the performance they did indicates this may not be canon (Hint: Wedding) however at the same time nothing besides that says it isn't canon. If its mentioned in S4 then its canon, otherwise you can skip this but personally if you like this series or any of the 3 characters then i'd strongly recommend to NOT skip it. (disclaimer: Siesta doesn't get much screen time at all, so its really the other two)The first 3 episodes have Louise and Saito playing roles of the opposite of what they are in the anime. So, the proud stuck up aristocrat is now playing a maid. Mean while Saito is playing an Earl... sadly a cheating one who cheats on his wife but thats just part of the play and I swear this is based on an actual play as i swear I've seen/heard this story before, prolly in another anime or two...  anyway, the real question is, will Louise be able to finish the play and stay in character or will she lash out and go back to being herself?Episodes 4-7 put them in a role that's very close to their role in the anime, despite this it ends up going further than even the anime thus far has gone, so if S4 doesn't show serious growth/this then hey, this is a nice way to see what the two might be like in the future, sadly, i can actually see this happening as of the series' state thus far lol that said these short 7 episodes were really great, I'd really recommend checking them out, don't be scared of the other reviews with low scores. That said keep in mind it IS a picture drama so expect a few pics and most of it is just audio, those aren't so bad and certainly not here, especially if you like Saito and Louise!I rate Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo Picture Drama, a 7.0 out of 10.0, check it out :) find with a CC turned on but the sub for the CC is crap.

First, in third season there is no story at all. Second anime has terrible sound for 2009. Third there is almost no animation. U can see that they are put just 3 or 4 mouth animation...on characters and make them talk. That's bad. And last they put almost no effort to design of characters.

"Zone of the Enders: Dolores, I",https://myanimelist.net/anime/1249/Zone_of_the_Enders__Dolores_I,"[""Zone of the Enders: Dolores, i happens to be one of those unfortunate titles which get a bad rep for reasons which don't pertain to its actual quality. This is mainly due to fans of the (excellent) Zone of the Enders PS2 games who prefer the darker tone of the rest of the franchise as compared to the more upbeat and humorous Dolores, i. If the former is what you're looking for, then you'd rather be watching ZOE: Idolo, but by doing so, you would also miss out on one of the most delightful and unique mecha series ever conceived.Generally, mecha shows tend to fall...into two categories: Boisterous and outrageous (think: TTGL) or grim and serious (think: Gundam). Dolores, i is one of the few series which doesn't quite fit into either. It has the lightheartedness of a super robot show and the realism of a real robot show without the utter absurdity or relentless angst that usually accompany them.  In fact, Dolores, i subverts many of the typical cliches you would come to expect from a mecha show. There's no whiny teenage protagonist here; instead, you get James Links, a grizzled, middle-aged working class space trucker and the father of two fully grown working class children, who compose the rest of the main cast along with the the title character, Dolores. Dolores is the star of the show and may make or break the series for many people; she's a rosy pink mecha with the personality and naivete of a sheltered teenage girl, and yes, she talks. Her antics contribute to much of the humor of the show and her development as a character, while not particularly original (think: I, Robot) is still quaintly executed and ends up being surprisingly moving. This is bound to be too silly to some people, but it's a fresh idea in the series and is actually quite charming in practice.While Dolores is a great character on her own, the rest of the main cast is just as excellent and is undoubtedly one of the best things about this show.  The aforementioned James Links is a fresh of breath air, and is one of the most down to earth and sympathetic main characters I've ever seen in this genre. He's an everyman with a sense of humor, but also a man down on his luck, bordering on alcoholism and trying to keep the fracturing relationship between him and his children, Noel Links, an affable and tomboyish construction worker, and Leon Links, an image-conscious salaryman lacking self-assurance, intact, who blame him for their mother's death. His luck appears to get even worse when on a trucking job, he is framed for murder by space pirates attempting to steal his cargo. But when the cargo turns out to be an Orbital Frame (read: mecha) named Dolores, who holds a message for him coming from his long lost wife, Rachel, his goal in life shifts to finding the woman he presumed to be long dead, with his children going along with him being forced to by unfortunate circumstances. This journey takes them between all sorts of destinations in Earth and Mars, all while being chased as fugitives by police as well as a mysterious organization seeking to recapture Dolores and strengthening the bond between the main cast, whose internal struggles are relatable and whose growth as characters are soundly satisfying.The plot isn't a work of genius, but it serves well as a vehicle to move the characters from scenario to scenario and manages to reach a thrilling climax and conclusion. The show moves at a perfect pace, never staying on any scene for too long and achieving a perfect balance between comedy, action and drama. The show has a charming and genuinely funny sense of humor without becoming too childish or absurd. The action scenes are directed and choreographed well enough, but aren't particularly outstanding. They get the job done, but make no mistake, this is not the show to watch if you're looking for pure action. Don't expect sterling production values, either. The animation and soundtrack are just about average, meaning they're nothing worth noting, but they're also not bad enough to be distracting. The animation is acceptable and the soundtrack is used appropriately without being memorable. The art fares similarly; it's unimpressive, but the character designs are still attractive and the mech designs are eye-catchingly sleek.In conclusion, ZOE: Dolores, i is a fun, tongue-in-cheek mecha show with a heart and a sense of humor which isn't completely brain dead. It's a solid show from all angles and comes as an easy recommendation to anyone yearning for a good adventure romp. Very under appreciated series. into two categories: Boisterous and outrageous (think: TTGL) or grim and serious (think: Gundam).

The aforementioned James Links is a fresh of breath air, and is one of the most down to earth and sympathetic main characters I've ever seen in this genre. He's an everyman with a sense of humor, but also a man down on his luck, bordering on alcoholism and trying to keep the fracturing relationship between him and his children, Noel Links, an affable and tomboyish construction worker, and Leon Links, an image-conscious salaryman lacking self-assurance, intact, who blame him for their mother's death. His luck appears to get even worse when on a trucking job, he is framed for murder by space pirates attempting to steal his cargo. But when the cargo turns out to be an Orbital Frame (read: mecha) named Dolores, who holds a message for him coming from his long lost wife, Rachel, his goal in life shifts to finding the woman he presumed to be long dead, with his children going along with him being forced to by unfortunate circumstances. This journey takes them between all sorts of destinations in Earth and Mars, all while being chased as fugitives by police as well as a mysterious organization seeking to recapture Dolores and strengthening the bond between the main cast, whose internal struggles are relatable and whose growth as characters are soundly satisfying.The plot isn't a work of genius, but it serves well as a vehicle to move the characters from scenario to scenario and manages to reach a thrilling climax and conclusion. The show moves at a perfect pace, never staying on any scene for too long and achieving a perfect balance between comedy, action and drama. The show has a charming and genuinely funny sense of humor without becoming too childish or absurd. The action scenes are directed and choreographed well enough, but aren't particularly outstanding. They get the job done, but make no mistake, this is not the show to watch if you're looking for pure action. Don't expect sterling production values, either. The animation and soundtrack are just about average, meaning they're nothing worth noting, but they're also not bad enough to be distracting. The animation is acceptable and the soundtrack is used appropriately without being memorable. The art fares similarly; it's unimpressive, but the character designs are still attractive and the mech designs are eye-catchingly sleek.In conclusion, ZOE: Dolores, i is a fun, tongue-in-cheek mecha show with a heart and a sense of humor which isn't completely brain dead. It's a solid show from all angles and comes as an easy recommendation to anyone yearning for a good adventure romp. Very under appreciated series."", ""This anime really is a lost jewel in its genre.

It was a solid little series albeit with a few problems. So, how does the second OVA from Studio Junio hold up? Is it as good as the first, better or weaker? Let's take a look, My Dears, and find out. This is 3x3 Eyes Seima Densetsu.Story:Four years after the first OVA, Yakumo is wandering alone in search of the missing Pai. He finds her, but she doesn't seem to remember him and freaks out when he starts chasing after her, treating hi like he's some...strange pervert. After speaking with the elderly couple that she's been living with, Yakumo finds out that Pai lost her memories. After fighting a monster that tried to reseal them, he sets out for Tibet to find an old monk who knows how to release the seal on her memories. She goes with him, curious about what secrets her past holds.Let's start with the big problems with the OVA. The ending is a big one. They had a chance to have a really strong, bittersweet ending, but they screw it up at the very end and opt for something that would be better suited for a cheesy children's movie than a more dramatic series for adults. There's also still an issue with the romance elements being pretty weak and, given the amnesia and handling thereof, this OVA doesn't even ultimately do anything to advance the romance.There are plenty of good things about the OVA too. The overall story is actually really interesting with a legitimately good twist. The Hindu influence is still strong in the series and it's still used in an intriguing way.Characters:Only a few of the major characters from the first OVA return, Yakumo, Pai, and Benares. We get an all new supporting cast for this one. I will give the series credit, most of the supporting characters are fairly interesting and fleshed out. The exceptions being the old couple who took Pai in and her friends from school who are just generic. Yakumo's character develops pretty well. He's become a lot more capable of things besides just being a human shield. He still has his moments where he takes enough damage that he would die if he was a normal human, but he at least manages to give a good account of himself. On the downside, Pai is actively annoying in this one. When I talked about the first OVA I said that the only thing stopping her from being an annoying character was the Sanjiyan personality. In this series the Sanjiyan has about five minutes of screen time before the very end when she takes over to wrap things up.Art:Studio Junio puts a real effort into replicating the style that Toei Animation used for the first OVA. And it does hold up pretty well. I will give them the proper credit on that account. It is, however, not as strong as the first series.Sound:The voice work is still really good. Hayashibara Megumi, Tsujitani Kouji, and Ootsuka Akio all give strong performances as they did in the first OVA. Ohtsuka Houchu, Canna Nobutoshi & Saikachi Ryuuji all give good performances as well. The one weakness is that the bland side characters have kind of weak performances to go along with them. The music is still pretty spectacular with Wada Kaoru returning to work on it.Ho-yay:There really isn't any.Final Thoughts:3x3 Eyes Seima Densetsu is not as good as the first OVA. It has some strong moments and it does advance Yakumo's character but it also has some real writing problems, some weak secondary characters and performances. It's worth watching if you enjoyed the first OVA and it's still pretty decent in spite of those flaws. My final rating is a 6/10. Next week I'll look at Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie. strange pervert.

After a very long wait unfortunately I was pretty darn disappointed to the point I didn't want to re-watch the first OAV.  Since the manga was continuing and the OAV's were just there, it leaves yet another cliffhanger to which there is no end.

The first OVA was from 1991 and Seima Densetsu from 1995, and the series ran from 1987 to 2002, so this is far from complete and covers relatively early arcs of the manga. As a whole, this is a series with decent chemistry between the two leads, a generous animation budget, and an interesting twisting of Hinduism and occultism for the backstory and atmosphere.I can't help but wonder if I should blame this series for being the main purveyor of what I've come...to call Brock syndrome—named as such because Brock from Pokemon is probably the most famous character in Japanese anime to have this character trait. Brock syndrome is when the character walks around everywhere with his or her eyes closed, but seemingly they must be seeing through tiny almost-closed slits because they never bump into anything and ostensibly can see. Some characters NEVER open their eyes, but with others, they will open them during dramatic moments, as with Yakumo, the main character of 3x3 Eyes, and of course it's during the I luvs u UwU moments. It's a real eye-widening experience for the viewer, too, I guarantee you. My eyes widened when I saw Yakumo's eyes, and it's like a parent experiencing the joy of his or her baby speaking for the first time. Real precious moment.Both are a joy to behold for the art and animation, and, as noted above, these have quite the animation budget compared to a lot of other OVAs at the time. Most of the animation is reserved for fight scenes, but there's also a big helping of character acting. I'd say the 1991 OVA has a somewhat more limited animation style that never feels cheap, but exaggerates the movement and saves frames in an appealing manner, while the 1995 OVA is more fluid and has much richer movement with fewer creative budget saving cuts.While I think a lot of people prefer the first OVA, I'd rate it a little bit lower at 5/10, for it feels too rushed much of the time. It must consist of multiple quickly condensed arcs taken from the manga with most of the context and backstory stripped away. It's pretty much like one of those Hollywood blockbusters such as Spielberg's Indiana Jones in terms of construction and scope, only a lot messier. Seima Densetsu instead appears to take just one of those arcs and fleshes it out.There's actually time for an atmosphere to be constructed, and Yakumo has learned and experienced a lot in the interim between the two series, which makes for a lot of great fight scenes. A battle animated near the end is especially notable. The chemistry between the characters is better here, partly as a result of a smaller cast, and they manage to pack a surprising amount of emotion into the ending—almost, the problem is, they just had to pull their punches and sugarcoat it... to call Brock syndrome—named as such because Brock from Pokemon is probably the most famous character in Japanese anime to have this character trait.

Blade Runner: Black Out 2022,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36308/Blade_Runner__Black_Out_2022,"['With skies pitched black, darkness has fallen across the land. The only form of light coming from countless flames; always burning fiercely with no sign of dying down. Amid the blaze lies a man shrouded in shadows, traversing the fires unfazed, unmoved. In their hand lies a small round figure, otherwise unrecognizable from the sheer dimness of the scene. They move closer to the flames. It’s a man. He is still covered in shadows, but a red light can be seen from his left eye. Before anymore can be perceived, the scene cuts to a city, with the camera panning across the metropolis. The city:...Los Angeles, and despite the infinite amount of lights and vehicles in the area, it looks the opposite; dark and barren, almost lifeless.Blade Runner: Black Out 2022 is an animated short directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, as part of a three-short series detailing key events that take place between the original Blade Runner film, and the 2017 sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Black Out occurs three years after the first film, where the powerful Tyrell Corporation have manufactured and released ‘Series 8’ Replicants (androids), all purpose-built with a natural lifespan. However, the desire for autonomy rises amongst Replicants, leading to the Human Supremacy movement. Their aim: Find and kill these Replicants. Despite being artificial humans, the Replicants are the ones in danger and on the run, especially given that their identities are all registered for the public to find. The short specifically follows two Replicants, Iggy and Trixie, as they attempt to wipe out the registry. What entails is as action-packed and thoughtful as what you would expect from the Blade Runner franchise in a 15-minute short.The original Blade Runner is considered one of the most influential science-fiction films ever made, delving into the implications of technology on the environment and society through the guise of an action plot on the surface. In Black Out, these implications are prominent here through the sheer imagery alone; the city of Los Angeles coming off more like a corporation than a city of people; it has control over atmosphere, giving this general sense of omnipresence and paranoia whenever the city is shown. This, along with a near complete absence of natural life makes the setting look more like a wasteland despite the obvious advances in technology present. The humans in Los Angeles are also shown to have no sense of care or empathy for Replicants at all, further emphasizing how the Replicants appear more relatable and “human” than our own species. One of the humans working alongside Iggy and Trixie reflects on this, stating how humans are stupid and selfish creatures compared to Replicants.Identity is another prime theme feature in Black Out in regard to Replicants in general. In one of Iggy’s flashback, Replicants were shown to have been used as pawn soldiers to fight each other on opposing sides, identified through labels on the eye. Iggy intends to destroy this sense of purpose from his own identity by destroying the registry; the one thing that separates him from humans in the public eye. Trixie also wishes to be seen as a human, but in this short, she’s fighting her own little dilemma. She, like Pris from the original, were created purely for entertainment, highlighted here in the first scene Trixie appears in. This is further emphasized as her appearance then is strikingly similar to the doll she carries with her. It is not until later where she ditches the doll to fight alongside Iggy where she asserts herself as more than a lifeless toy. This defining moment could have used more time for better focus and overall progression, but it is a worthwhile attempt with a 15-minute duration. Her short exploration was to me, similar to Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell, a franchise inspired by the complex themes, visuals and unconventional plot of the original film.Perhaps the best part of Black Out is the production side; it looks incredible. Despite being animation, the short carries on the same unique visual style and neo-noir tone from the live-action, whilst also bearing similarities to other cyberpunk anime like Ergo Proxy. The blend of different animation styles works wonderfully here and never feels out of place. The fight scenes here were technically sound matched with incredibly fluid animation. Watanabe’s direction during the action scenes is also stellar, but then again this is the same guy who directed anime the likes of Cowboy Bebop and Terror in Resonance. The short also manages to pay homage to these two shows with some scenes as well. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, being a nice blend of Blade Runner’s eerie melodies and jazz-inspired themes from Bebop. Never stands out but compliments many scenes very well. The ending song, “Almost Human” is a great tune to end the short off with, further adding to the overall aesthetic along with nearly every other technical aspect. It is rare to find a show that able to depict a specific atmosphere and mood that both brings viewers out of their comfort zone, yet keeps them intrigued with what they’re watching, and Black Out is a great example of this.Blade Runner: Black Out 2022 exceeds expectations for what it is able to do in 15 minutes. There are some issues with the story and pacing, and I would have liked to see more in the way of characters despite adequate background knowledge was given on them, but at the end of the day those complaints should not stop you from watching this. I’m still amazed at how it manages to be so thoughtful and use symbolism reminiscent of the original film. And even if the thematic part of it does not interest you, the action scenes and overall presentation is worth seeing as well. As a fan of the franchise I am satisfied with this entry and look forward to how it relates to Blade Runner 2049. Los Angeles, and despite the infinite amount of lights and vehicles in the area, it looks the opposite; dark and barren, almost lifeless.Blade Runner: Black Out 2022 is an animated short directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, as part of a three-short series detailing key events that take place between the original Blade Runner film, and the 2017 sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Black Out occurs three years after the first film, where the powerful Tyrell Corporation have manufactured and released ‘Series 8’ Replicants (androids), all purpose-built with a natural lifespan. However, the desire for autonomy rises amongst Replicants, leading to the Human Supremacy movement. Their aim: Find and kill these Replicants. Despite being artificial humans, the Replicants are the ones in danger and on the run, especially given that their identities are all registered for the public to find. The short specifically follows two Replicants, Iggy and Trixie, as they attempt to wipe out the registry. What entails is as action-packed and thoughtful as what you would expect from the Blade Runner franchise in a 15-minute short.The original Blade Runner is considered one of the most influential science-fiction films ever made, delving into the implications of technology on the environment and society through the guise of an action plot on the surface. In Black Out, these implications are prominent here through the sheer imagery alone; the city of Los Angeles coming off more like a corporation than a city of people; it has control over atmosphere, giving this general sense of omnipresence and paranoia whenever the city is shown. This, along with a near complete absence of natural life makes the setting look more like a wasteland despite the obvious advances in technology present. The humans in Los Angeles are also shown to have no sense of care or empathy for Replicants at all, further emphasizing how the Replicants appear more relatable and “human” than our own species. One of the humans working alongside Iggy and Trixie reflects on this, stating how humans are stupid and selfish creatures compared to Replicants.Identity is another prime theme feature in Black Out in regard to Replicants in general. In one of Iggy’s flashback, Replicants were shown to have been used as pawn soldiers to fight each other on opposing sides, identified through labels on the eye. Iggy intends to destroy this sense of purpose from his own identity by destroying the registry; the one thing that separates him from humans in the public eye. Trixie also wishes to be seen as a human, but in this short, she’s fighting her own little dilemma. She, like Pris from the original, were created purely for entertainment, highlighted here in the first scene Trixie appears in. This is further emphasized as her appearance then is strikingly similar to the doll she carries with her. It is not until later where she ditches the doll to fight alongside Iggy where she asserts herself as more than a lifeless toy. This defining moment could have used more time for better focus and overall progression, but it is a worthwhile attempt with a 15-minute duration.

As a fan of the franchise I am satisfied with this entry and look forward to how it relates to Blade Runner 2049.', '(Spoiler-Free Review)The fact that this shoft anime film exists is somewhat of a small miricle.It all begins with Ridley Scott\'s 1982, cult classic sci-fi film, Blade Runner. A film derived loosely from Philip K. Dick\'s novel titled ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". It explores philosophical issues related to the over-arching theme of the impacts that technology has on society, i.e. designing robots (Replicants) that are visually the same as humans, and progressing them to a point where they themselves believe that they are human.And now, thirty-five years later, writor, editor and director Denis Villeneuve continues the saga not only with a sequel...to the original Blade Runner, but also three short films dedicated to the story that occurs between the original and the upcoming sequel (Blade Runner 2049).In the opening sequence of the Blade Runner: Black Out 2022, before the anime begins, Villeneuve says:""I decided to ask a couple of artists, that I respect, to create three short stories that dramatise some key events that occured after 2019, when the first \'Blade Runner\' takes place... I am honored that Watanabe, whose work I deeply admire, agreed to create this short anime for you.""----Now that you\'ve got some background of this whole situation, let\'s begin with the review.The anime itself is very short with a runtime of around fifteen minutes including the credits. I never thought I\'d be giving such a short piece, such a high rating. It is extremely difficult to convey a story in such a short time, but I believe that this team has pulled it off superbly!I believe that the two factors that contribute to the success of this anime are the art and sound. Fans of the original Blade Runner will be pleased to know that the dark and brooding atmosphere that the film is known for, is well \'Replicated\' (sorry, not sorry) in the anime. The environments are meticulously detailed; the sense of paranoia and suffocation from the elements in the background is ever present. The sheer lack of natural beauty and the looming presense of an entirely corporate society creates tension and emphasizes the environments themselves. The animation is shared between various styles which switch up at a moments notice. It is this genius ability to depict a certain mood with the style of art, that other anime really tend to lack. While other anime may find themselves stuck to one format or style of art/animation, Black Out is able to fluidly and flexibly change to match the mood the director is trying to evoke in the audience. Good examples of this technique can be found in shows such as FLCL and Mob Psycho 100. The animation is incredibly fluid in parts, almost mesmerizing (as expected of Watanabe\'s direction).I also want to appreciate that the title cards in between sequences use the same typeface and colors as those used in the original Blade Runner. It\'s a nice touch.Following this, the sound is utterly fantastic. Once again, fans of the original Blade Runner are going to be pleased. It is as if they have simply reprised the OST from the original for this anime, but obviously, it is much more than that. The background music reflects the dreamy and grimy-ethereal aethestic of the dystopian future in which the anime is set. There is a contrast between the hard-hitting and deep orchestral pieces (the opening piece in particular, which mirrors the opening to the original almost to a tee - not to mention the visuals), the fast-paced jazzy tunes one might associate with Cowboy Bebop and the futuristic electronic beats full of washed out sounds and synthesizers. Also, it would be a crime not to mention the powerful song that begins to play as the credits roll. ""Almost Human"", very aptly named. It\'s a fantastic way to close out the anime, and adds an extra layer of depth to the finale (once you\'ve seen it).In regards to story and character, I believe that they rely heavily on these points that I\'ve made about the art and sound. The show, technically, is character-driven, and the characters that have been presented are a trio, Iggy, Ren and the most important, Trixie. For the sake of a spoiler-free review, I can\'t really go into them, as this is such a short film that pretty much any information beyond their names could potentially spoil the show. To simplify, I think that the characters were well portrayed for the short amount of screentime they were allowed. Each character\'s background was given a small, yet efficient, look. Such efficiency was key in allowing the viewer to make a connection to the characters in such a short time - it also gives them purpose and feeling more than just plot devices. There is some very blatant Biblical symbolism towards the end, it works well with the scene and adds some extra depth to the action at the time - this form of symbolism is also found in the original film. There are several other one-shot background characters. Upon re-watching a few times, it is nice to see that the dialogue they are given actually does help establish setting in this world set three years after the original Blade Runner.Lastly, was my enjoyment. I was really hyped up for this anime and I think that my hype was well-founded. I enjoyed watching this anime and I enjoyed it the next three times over as well. It appears to be a perfect gateway for people who have not yet been introduced to anime, as it is set in the universe of one of the most recognizeable cult films in movie history.\'Blade Runner: Black Out 2022\' is a fantastic anime! Well worth a watch or two! My final verdict is an overall 9/10. My only gripe is that due to the length of the film, the true issues that come bundled with the Blade Runner universe weren\'t fully fleshed out (they were definitely addressed and explored, but certainly left something to be desired. I guess we\'ll get our fill when Blade Runner 2049 comes out). In some ways, it might be said that the length of this short was symbolic in the fact that life is fickle and fleeting - that in only 15 minutes, so much can change - and we are but transient members of society simply coming and going. In reality, if that\'s the only negative thing I have to say about the show, then I am very pleased. Although, I can imagine that a viewer who hasn\'t seen the original could be a little confused and likely a little dissatisfied with the result.Thank you for reading my review!

Blade Runner is a 1982 Hollywood science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott. Set in 2019 it depicts a dystopian Los Angeles under the influence of the Tyrell Corporation, who manufacture advanced human-like androids known as replicants. These androids were designed to work in the off-world colonies although a number have escaped back to earth illegally. Those that do so are hunted and ‘retired’ by a special police force known as blade runners.Blackout 2022 serves as a bridge between the original 1982 movie and the upcoming Blade...Runner 2049 movie, depicting a significant event that occurred during the time between the two movies, and sets up the premise for the latter. Following two replicants Blackout 2022 briefly depicts the challenges and discrimination that replicants face and the lengths they’re willing to go in order to save themselves. Due to its short running time the episode isn’t able to go into much characterization, but it does enough to inform the viewer about the world of Blade Runner and provide them an understanding of who replicants are and their interaction with humans.Directed by Shinichirou Watanabe, the episode is a visual treat! The animation for the characters is crisp, the action sequences are fluid and artistic, while the environments are well detailed, especially the final scene which depicts the famous symbolism of Los Angeles in the original film. Overall it perfectly replicates (yes I went there, deal with it) the dark gritty environment of the original film. The soundtrack complements the episode well with electronic ambient tracks that capture the eerie futuristic feel of dystopian Los Angeles.Overall Blackout 2022 is short and sweet as it does so much in such a small amount of time. Fans of the original film will appreciate how the episode respects and replicates the dystopian environment of Los Angeles, while those who haven’t seen the film will enjoy the brief world-building that the episode provides. Even if you’re not a fan of Blade Runner you should still watch this just for the beautiful visuals and soundtrack.

If you enjoyed his Matrix shorts I think you'll be able to enjoy this too cause they're done in a roughly similar style Blade Runner is brimming with good animation and stylish shots.As is, this is intended as one of the pieces that bridges the gap between original Blade Runner and 2049 and it gets the job done. You learn what Black Out is, what led to it, who did it and partly what effect it will have. On the side it also tells you about the right eye that makes it easy to tell...a replicant from a human and that they were used as cannon fodder for wars. Even though you don't need it at all to understand 2049 cause Denis Villeneuve is a great director who doesn't need to rely on side material to fix his shortcomings it's still a nice addition to the universe.While the visuals are great and plot is serviceable everything else in my opinion is mediocre to terrible. The characters, despite how little there is of them really annoyed me. This is in part due to how the anime shows replicants as if they are badass heroes who are willing to put their life on the line to set themselves free but I don't think it can get with that when it's a man made thing telling you how terrible humans are and causes something that will lead to a lot of innocent people suffering or dying just so that can erase information about replicants and potentially stop production for an indefinitely but not obviously not permanently. The action was beyond silly, I feel like the only idea behind it was to have one guy go around shooting the recognisable Blade Runner guns while the other one is doing acrobatics in the style of Pris albeit more exaggerated. There's no real coherence to it. The dude is just walking around killing helpless guards that offer zero resistance while the girl is just just doing dumb bullshit that looks look but there was so little effort put into making these scenes look believable that it took me out of the whole thing really hard. In one of the scenes she just starts flipping over a police car to go god knows where while surrounded by five cops and they let her do the acrobatics routine until surprise surprise everything starts to go in slo-motion and she gets shot once and dies. In general there are so many tasteless references or thematic and visual similarities in this that just feel like cheap fan service that it was getting rather annoying by the end.All in all if you like Blade Runner it's worth seeing this at least once, the animation can be nice to look at but don't expect it to actually be good, it doesn't even stand up to the other two shorts. a replicant from a human and that they were used as cannon fodder for wars.

The animation was flawless with a respectable artstyle and the music choices were amazing. We honestly didn't get to know much about the characters so I can't say much for them either.Overall an enjoyable short flim that was fine for the most part.

For starters are we to expect 2049 to be a real life production or anime or a mixture of the two? That is some confusion there. Also, has anyone aside from me seen I, Robot 2004 American movie staring Will Smith? Or, better yet any one of the terminator movies staring Arnold Schwarzenegger? Chances are you have seen one if not both. Point being plot wise they are the same. Sure, the back story is different but the purpose remains...the same. To serve mankind. To be a substitute for humans. A newer and more improved version. Or simply put human 2.0.Maybe i am wrong maybe this 2049 movie will be different. For i have not seen it. But does it hurt to have original thinking rather than piggy backing off another idea?Moving on... the introduction was nice. For not only did the audience get a brief explanation of the story-line but got to actually see the director and listen to his reasoning for this production. I find during a reach like this where a staff member tries to get into touch with its viewers is a great concept. For not only does it show some effort applied but allows you to view a little bit in their shoes.Conclusion was okay but could have been better. Yes, a subtle explanation with the eye illustrated where the main character planned to go but the cool guys don't look explosions bit is a bit overdone.ArtComputer generated. You will notice from time after time there will be brief moments where the art is different. In those few moments such as the desert scene are a nice touch. For they illustrate observation perspective. Like for example everything is not clear if you are looking at the world drunk. Also, the world is not easy to see if you are being pelted with bombs in a desert location. Sand would be kicking back at you. The ground would be rumbling. So, rather than keeping the same art it was kind of interesting to see how adaptive to creative techniques the artists could take to show the stresses of these moments.Overall: Yes, the plot is not original but the art is something worth seeing at certain moments. the same.

In 15 minutes this short is able to portray all the necessary information to link the two films, while also serving as a great companion to the other shorts created to bridge the Blade Runner series.

Gate Keepers,https://myanimelist.net/anime/127/Gate_Keepers,"['Truth be told, for the first times I&rsquo;ve watched it I wasn&rsquo;t able to fully appreciate it. I&rsquo;m glad I decided to re-watch Gate Keepers once again, because it&rsquo;s definitely worth it.The plot of Gate Keepers can be compared to old school anime, probably because the story is set in the 1960s. The only difference is that Gate Keepers has the feel of contemporary anime &ndash; it&rsquo;s set in the 60s, but it doesn&rsquo;t really seem like it is. It&rsquo;s really exciting and fun to watch. Some historical references were actually incorporated into the story, such as the moon landing, the world expo and maybe...even hippies.Another aspect I like about it is the comedy. I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t realize it was so funny, but that&rsquo;s probably because most of the comedy came from Reiko and Bancho &ndash; the 2 characters I USED to hate. All of the characters are actually very likable. My other favorites are Megane and Fei, because they&rsquo;re both so adorable. I still like Kaoru and Shun though (Shun&rsquo;s hot!)As expected of Gonzo, the animation is really impressive. I love the character design except for Reiko&rsquo;s because she seems different compared to the other characters. They all have beautifully drawn eyes though &ndash; I especially like how the eyes look when they use their gate powers. The CG wasn&rsquo;t as sophisticated and smooth as I want it to be, but it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. There were repeated scenes and usually I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a sign of laziness, but it&rsquo;s minimal.Some of my favorite seiyuus are actually in Gate Keepers. One of them is Takahiro Sakurai. I always seem to like his characters (especially Cloud Strife from Advent Children!). The other is Tomokazu Seki. I just think he&rsquo;s a really talented VA. Other seiyuus I want to note are Chinami Nishimura (Fei) and Etsuko Kozakura (Megane). They really made Fei and Megane really cute and adorable. I just love it when Fei goes &ldquo;Ayaya!&rdquo;.The music was great as well. Like the story, the music reminds me of old school anime as well (specially the mecha ones) except they&rsquo;re more updated. I really love how the opening theme was made &ndash; it really describes the plot so well. Sometimes you can catch the characters quoting some of the lyrics. The ending theme wasn&rsquo;t bad either. Yumi Matsuzawa did a great job in performing both songs.Just to finish this review, I&rsquo;m going to reaffirm my first point by saying Gate Keepers is definitely a must watch. I&rsquo;m going to try the OVA and see if it&rsquo;s as good as the series. even hippies.Another aspect I like about it is the comedy.

It makes me remind of old school anime', 'For buying all the DVD\'s on a whim since Rightstuf had seven volumes for only $2, I am genuinely surprised by how great this show is. I really enjoyed this a lot.As for the story it has comedic moments sprinkled throughout each episode and I feel like they generally mix very well with the situations at hand. There\'s also a decent amount of actually incredible scenes that look fantastic and have great sound design; I love the sound of when they open a gate to use their abilities and then scream ""GATE OPEN!"" and even though it\'s essentially the same thing every time it feels...different depending of what\'s going on and everything else and how the audio is mixed. It makes a lot of scenes feel really epic and I\'d rewind and watch the sequence again because it seemed so cool however it doesn\'t seem like it\'s trying too hard to be cool or anything like that (at least not to me) and I feel like that\'s why comes off really good and really kept me engaged with the show and wanting to continue watching.The art and animation is pretty consistent throughout the whole show and how good the CGI is really took me by surprise. There was only one episode with a purple CG helicopter that was super bad but other than they did a heck of a job considering this was from the year 2000.My favorite character was definitely Ikusawa, Ruriko or Rurippe as the nickname given to her by Ukiya, Shun which you will hear most of the time. Kawasumi, Ayako does a fantastic job voicing her and I love when she yells, perfect tone in comedic moments and intense moment and everything in-between. I also really liked Mei and how she\'d say ""Gate Open"" and her powers in Chinese most of the time. Reiko seemed to be a little too much of an air-head but she still seemed to get some good moments and she cares for everyone and not just Ukiya. Kaoru to me felt too pushy to assert herself onto her Senpai Ukiya but I didn\'t dislike her and she does get some great moments to shine throughout the series. I like how she transformers to use her powers by just whooshing off her normal clothes with her tracksuit underneath. The only character I didn\'t like so much was Megumi which is kinda backwards for me since I generally really like the quiet ones with glasses. The different tensions with her still had impacts on the story and wasn\'t meaningless even though she wasn\'t very nice or anything. Finally for our main character Ukiya, Shun I\'d say he\'s actually likable. He does share some typical traits that you\'d expect from a main character but there\'s also more to him. He also has a couple really good character arcs that he goes through and you get to see him struggle.If you happen to stumble across this show I highly recommend it, especially if you can still get the DVD\'s for super cheap like I was able to. As for re-watching, I definitely will eventually and I still have the sequel OVA series to watch too which I will watch next out of the countless DVD\'s and Blu-Rays that I have. I would\'ve liked to see an HD remaster with PCM audio if they did it correctly/still had the original master but I\'m not too concerned since the DVD\'s still scale nicely. I\'d say the average score for this show is an accurate assessment of how it\'s score should be but I just had such a blast watching this and it felt really refreshing.

Aldnoah.Zero Part 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/27655/AldnoahZero_Part_2,"['[THIS ENTIRE REVIEW WILL CONTAIN HEAVY SPOILERS FOR WHAT LITTLE PLOT THIS ANIME HAS]PLOT 1/10The ending of season 1 was quite unexpected. It was a great cliffhanger that made everyone speculate how the story would continue after 4 of the most pivotal characters of the show seemingly get killed. Disappointingly, nothing happens. None of them died. Welcome to my review of AldNoOne Dies Season 2. Did I mention that none of the main characters die? Season 1 ends on an unexpected and ominous note, only for none of them die. Seriously. The only thing that dies is the plot, and this review will be my...morbid attempt at describing the dead carcass that is ""the plot"" as I poke it with a stick.Basically, season 2 starts off with the princess stuck in a comatose state for a long period of time after Slaine forces Count Sassy-bum to keep her alive. Slaine becomes an angsty asshole and obtains a position of power within the Vers empire after murdering Count Sauce-bomb by 360 no-scoping him with timey wimey powers and succeeding him as count. Then he has where-the-fuck-did-she-come-from Princess Asseylum v2.0 marry him into royalty so he can unify the Vers empire and start a full scale war against earth for no clearly understandable or reasonable goal. From what I understand he does it to ""protect the princess"". Which makes absolutely no fucking sense because now that he is the fucking king of the fucking Vers Empire he already fucking has the needed political fucking power and support to fucking stop anyone else from fucking stealing his fucking girl. The fucking princess is already fucking fine, not to fucking mention everyone doesn\'t even fucking know that the fucking princess is actually in a fucking coma and that she is being fucking impersonated by her fucking sister. Meaning that any attempted assassination wouldn\'t fucking work because they would be fucking killing the fucking body double. YOU KNOW, LIKE IN THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF THE FUCKING SHOW ALL THE FUCKING WAY BACK IN SEASON FUCKING ONE, FOR EXAMPLE. JESUS TAP DANCING CHRIST. Not to mention war goes against EVERYTHING THE PRINCESS STANDS FOR. WHAT THE FUCK SLAINE, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU GET A GIRL TO LIKE YOU. YOU ABSOLUTE RETARD.I guess his actions can be rationalized a bit from the perspective of Slaine as the king of the Vers Empire, and not from the perspective of Slaine as the desperate, sex-starved virgin he is, since what he is doing could be seen as a political ploy to obtain more support amongst the other orbital knights and other members of nobility, who are unanimously pro-war. (Which he doesn\'t need.) And on top of that it will cause the Vers empire to become a better place free from an oppressive class system and widespread poverty among the working class that is caused by a lack of natural resources. (Which could be solved diplomatically through trading.) (Or stealing it without the genocide.) (Which would make him unanimously supported by the working class even if some of the nobles still don\'t like him, lessening the threat of their influence and cementing his legitimacy as king.) (Which again, doesn\'t matter because he already has all the political support he needs.) But really now... He doesn\'t care too much about any of that. He just in this for the PU$$Y. (SPOILER: HE DOESN\'T GET ANY)The real princess eventually wakes up, then plot hole after plot hole she finds out what Slaine is doing and manages to escape with Inaho\'s help. Princess Ass-pump marries some random dude named Count Cocaine and takes over rule of the Empire. Then Slaine gets wrecked. They use him as a scapegoat to blame the entire war on. The entirety of earth apparently completely forgives Princess Ass-plumber after her impostor shit talks everyone and their mother with obscene levels of hate and Aryan supremacy. Apparently decades of indoctrination, hatred, prejudice, racism, poverty, systematic classism, and human greed disappeared just like that. The war ends. Earth and Mars hold hands and circle jerk over each other in a new golden age of peace and prosperity. Happy happy fine and dandy. Wouldn\'t it be nice if actual conflicts in the real world could be solved so easily? Just blame every little problem on one person. Then kill him. Poof. Problems solved just like that. (Does this remind you of a certain other mecha anime? *cough cough*)""Let justice be done, though the heavens fall."" The motto of the show clearly represents Princess Asseylum\'s goal of peace no matter the cost. It really shows just how spoiled and unrealistic her standards are. Princess Ass-plum seriously used her love of birds as a valid reason to possibly jeopardize the long term unity and betterment of her entire empire. Don\'t get me wrong, war is bad. But a leader should realize when war is the best and most realistic option for her people. Good thing the shit writing this show has kicks in and everything somehow turns out alright anyways, no one suffers from the consequences of their actions except for Slaine.If you really simplify it. The entire plot of season 2 is basically a war caused by a mans quest to seduce a woman through the romantic gift of genocide; and predictably, hilariously, painfully, and stupidly enough- it completely backfires. He gets friend zoned and gets sent to prison for the rest of his life. She\'d rather enter an arranged marriage with a man she has never met before than be with you. How does that feel, you fucking cuck? Holy shit, someone give this a man a medal for the worst rejection in history.Seriously that\'s the entire plot. Yup. The end. Aren\'t you fucking glad you watched this show?ARTWORK 7/10The general art style is pretty good, and the characters are drawn very well with a distinctive style. One of the strongest points of this show is aesthetic originality, even though sometimes ""originality"" becomes synonymous with ""bad writing"", as in, it\'s original how bad the writing is. Martian kataphrakts are pretty cool looking, despite just how bad the CGI in this show is. Their designs are strange, exotic, and unique, but at the same time completely absurd. For some reason the orbital knights care more about making flashy and cool kataphrakts over actually effective weapons. You would think that a robot with access to seemingly unlimited energy would make use of all of the ridiculously overpowered technology they have, but every single kataphrakt has some gigantic weakness that is so obviously intentionally added. For some reason, a robot that has in indestructible force field has no weapons on it besides some over-sized fists, and despite the fact that it has an indestructible force field, it is covered in thick plates of armor that makes the thing look like the girl from Willy Wonka that turns into a giant blueberry. For some reason, a mech attacks by shooting hilariously ineffective, re-attachable, remote controlled ROCKET ARMS at the enemy when a while ago they showed this dude shooting rapid fire mega death lasers everywhere. It just simply makes no sense.That\'s how it works kids. If you aren\'t good enough at writing to make a character look brilliantly smart, just make all the bad guys so incompetently stupid the hero look better in contrast.SOUND 8/10The music was composed by none other than Hiroyuki Sawano, so as expected, it is quite good. Too bad they keep on replaying the same fucking song over and over again for every single god damn fight scene that you begin to hate the song. Good music is important, but making sure the music is used in a timely and appropriate manner is also important. This show succeeds in the former part, but fails in the latter.Here comes the juicy part. CHARACTER.2/10 Inaho: Absolutely no character development. Though it wouldn\'t be fair to expect character development from him. Inaho is literally God. Perfection personified into a Japanese school boy. He cannot further develop because he is already perfect. Getting shot in the head doesn\'t change that. He is still perfect. He is still an emotionless machine. The fact that he is now partially a cyborg doesn\'t help with that analogy either. He saves the day every single god damn time like he always does except now he does literally everything to the point where basically 60% of the entire show just focuses on circlejerking over how awesome he is. The writers made this man an autistic savant because they simply aren\'t smart enough to write an intelligent character well, and clearly even with that the job was still difficult for them. Because in season 2 they had to up the ante and make him even more overpowered than he already was so they can shoehorn more shitty excuses as to how he completely defeats the Vers Empire yet again by blessing him with some unreasonably overpowered god eye that can see everything. That dumb little eye can do literally anything. Like check out Inko\'s BMI for example. Inaho uses his eye to calculate Inko\'s weight so he can make fun of her. What the fuck dude? Asshole. And he knows he can get away with it since Inko wants his D for some reason. Why ya got to play a girl like that man? And to top it all off, the writers also gave him Aldnoah powers all willy-nilly to act as a convenient plot device to reactivate the Deucalion. How? Through oral transfer of royal blood and saliva. HAHA WHAT THE FUCK. In other words. This all powerful source of unlimited energy is pretty much some alien STD Ass-plump gave to Inaho.9/10 Inaho\'s robot eye: A new character. Yes. The eye has its own character. Yes. THE EYE GETS MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN INAHO HIMSELF. At first the eye is nothing but a tool, but then it starts taking over parts of Inaho\'s brain and becomes its own thinking entity. It even starts chatting up the princess while Inaho was unconscious. Look at that development. Oh yea. Such character. Inaho\'s eye x Asseylum is my OTP.1/10 Slaine: Is basically the only character that gets any ""development"", which means jack shit because he just continually makes the most retarded nonsensical decisions a sane individual wouldn\'t ever consider. Honestly, calling it ""character development"" is a little too generous in the first place since his character is completely off the charts inconsistent. He doesn\'t really do anything that can be considered normal human responses. His level of intelligence and decision making is all over the place. His goals incomprehensible, and the reason behind this is because the writers just continuously use him as a cheap plot device to add drama and conflict to the story instead of treating him like how a reasonable or sane human being would act. Inaho and Slaine are both foils to each other in this regard. Slaine advances the story by adding unnecessary conflict to it through irrational decision making. And Inaho advances the story by solving the stupid problems Slaine causes with his own stupidly written god-like abilities. In the end, Slaine fails horribly due to his ridiculous levels of incompetency. Then the writers pretentiously rip off Monster by making Slaine pull off some bullshit Johan Liebert crap.1/10 Princess Ass-lump: She doesn\'t change character either. Still this overly happy and naive dumb bimbo that can barely act like a responsible leader. She forces her childish idealistic views on everyone regardless of the effect it might have on her people. She tried to man up once and points a gun at Slaine and threatens him. Then he casually walks over and just takes the gun. AHAHA. Seriously. She is so worthless. Did I mention she likes birds? She likes birds. Apparently more than the possible long term prosperity of not only her Empire, but the entirety of humanity as well. Amazing judgment of importance there.4/10 Princess Ass-lump v2.0: Yea the second princess with the weird hair. I forgot her name. Where the fuck did she even come from? She just appears suddenly as a new character. Basically she pretends to be Asseylum and slanders earth with her space Nazi propaganda. She does it because she has some extremely creepy as fuck obsession with Slaine. She is just weird.10/10 Count Crouton or something. IDK it\'s hard to spell. Best character in the entire show. Absolute chad. Some new guy that shows up for like 10 minutes of screen time. Manages to NTR the princess away from Inaho and Slaine like immediately. What a badass.5/10 Harklight. Gets seduced by Slaine\'s bishounen powers. I forgot whether or not he dies trying to get senpai to notice him. I don\'t really care.5/10 Inko. Arguably the most likable girl in the show. Acts all cutesy and compassionate with Inaho and worries about him. Daww so cute amirite? Kind of I guess... Gets pushed away and assigned as Inaho\'s side bitch. She gets shot at 10 more times than any of the other characters but she always survives. Absolutely bullshit levels of plot armor. For some reason, every single kataphrakt instantly explodes into a million pieces of shitty pixelated CGI the moment it gets touched but nothing like that ever happens with Inko. But I guess they have to keep her alive as a romantic interest for Inaho, because it\'s not a true mech anime without poorly integrated love triangles am I right?4/10 Female Inaho. Yuki Kaizuka, the bastard love child prototype that made way for the masterpiece of perfection that is her brother Inaho Kaizuka. Knowing just how hopelessly inferior she is to her perfect brother she tries to mimic her brothers robot like persona by getting a robotic arm to assist her broken one. But fails miserably at acting utterly emotionless like her brother does. As well as being perfect in every way possible like him. Seriously Yuki its not that hard to be a completely flawless human being. Way to break character, you fucking poser. She acts all lovey dovey over Inaho but comes off a bit more bitchy and possessive than Inko does when she tries to stop him from saving the damn world out of fear for his safety. At least wanting your brother to live is a slightly better excuse than liking birds.All of the other characters basically get sidelined and don\'t do anything or have anything worthwhile to say about them. 0/10.ENJOYMENT 5/10The action was enjoyable enough. The only saving grace was the okay action. (And seeing Slaine\'s beautiful face marred with his salty tears at the end.) It follows a pretty cookie cutter formula of: Scary new Martian bad guy with fancy unique kataphrakt appears. It rains pain down, destroying a bunch of faceless Terran mooks, as well as miraculously damaging but never killing any of the minor characters that happen to be fighting. Then Inaho comes and saves the day with his tactical and scientific brilliance as his signature battle theme plays for the umpteenth time. Rinse and repeat. Some of the battles have some interesting strategies and events, but it\'s all methodically predictable. So if for some reason you are reading this review without even starting the show I wouldn\'t recommend this if you aren\'t a huge fan of action and mech anime.If you have already watched season 1, I wouldn\'t really recommend you to either continue or discontinue the show, that\'s up to whether or not you are one of those masochists that don\'t drop any shows they started.Well that concludes my review. Now if you excuse me I\'m going to see what kind of horrific yaoi fanfiction fujoshis are making between Inaho and Slaine. morbid attempt at describing the dead carcass that is ""the plot"" as I poke it with a stick.Basically, season 2 starts off with the princess stuck in a comatose state for a long period of time after Slaine forces Count Sassy-bum to keep her alive. Slaine becomes an angsty asshole and obtains a position of power within the Vers empire after murdering Count Sauce-bomb by 360 no-scoping him with timey wimey powers and succeeding him as count. Then he has where-the-fuck-did-she-come-from Princess Asseylum v2.0 marry him into royalty so he can unify the Vers empire and start a full scale war against earth for no clearly understandable or reasonable goal. From what I understand he does it to ""protect the princess"". Which makes absolutely no fucking sense because now that he is the fucking king of the fucking Vers Empire he already fucking has the needed political fucking power and support to fucking stop anyone else from fucking stealing his fucking girl. The fucking princess is already fucking fine, not to fucking mention everyone doesn\'t even fucking know that the fucking princess is actually in a fucking coma and that she is being fucking impersonated by her fucking sister. Meaning that any attempted assassination wouldn\'t fucking work because they would be fucking killing the fucking body double. YOU KNOW, LIKE IN THE VERY FIRST EPISODE OF THE FUCKING SHOW ALL THE FUCKING WAY BACK IN SEASON FUCKING ONE, FOR EXAMPLE. JESUS TAP DANCING CHRIST. Not to mention war goes against EVERYTHING THE PRINCESS STANDS FOR. WHAT THE FUCK SLAINE, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU GET A GIRL TO LIKE YOU. YOU ABSOLUTE RETARD.I guess his actions can be rationalized a bit from the perspective of Slaine as the king of the Vers Empire, and not from the perspective of Slaine as the desperate, sex-starved virgin he is, since what he is doing could be seen as a political ploy to obtain more support amongst the other orbital knights and other members of nobility, who are unanimously pro-war. (Which he doesn\'t need.) And on top of that it will cause the Vers empire to become a better place free from an oppressive class system and widespread poverty among the working class that is caused by a lack of natural resources. (Which could be solved diplomatically through trading.) (Or stealing it without the genocide.) (Which would make him unanimously supported by the working class even if some of the nobles still don\'t like him, lessening the threat of their influence and cementing his legitimacy as king.) (Which again, doesn\'t matter because he already has all the political support he needs.) But really now... He doesn\'t care too much about any of that. He just in this for the PU$$Y. (SPOILER: HE DOESN\'T GET ANY)The real princess eventually wakes up, then plot hole after plot hole she finds out what Slaine is doing and manages to escape with Inaho\'s help. Princess Ass-pump marries some random dude named Count Cocaine and takes over rule of the Empire. Then Slaine gets wrecked. They use him as a scapegoat to blame the entire war on. The entirety of earth apparently completely forgives Princess Ass-plumber after her impostor shit talks everyone and their mother with obscene levels of hate and Aryan supremacy. Apparently decades of indoctrination, hatred, prejudice, racism, poverty, systematic classism, and human greed disappeared just like that. The war ends. Earth and Mars hold hands and circle jerk over each other in a new golden age of peace and prosperity. Happy happy fine and dandy. Wouldn\'t it be nice if actual conflicts in the real world could be solved so easily? Just blame every little problem on one person. Then kill him. Poof. Problems solved just like that. (Does this remind you of a certain other mecha anime? *cough cough*)""Let justice be done, though the heavens fall."" The motto of the show clearly represents Princess Asseylum\'s goal of peace no matter the cost. It really shows just how spoiled and unrealistic her standards are. Princess Ass-plum seriously used her love of birds as a valid reason to possibly jeopardize the long term unity and betterment of her entire empire. Don\'t get me wrong, war is bad. But a leader should realize when war is the best and most realistic option for her people. Good thing the shit writing this show has kicks in and everything somehow turns out alright anyways, no one suffers from the consequences of their actions except for Slaine.If you really simplify it. The entire plot of season 2 is basically a war caused by a mans quest to seduce a woman through the romantic gift of genocide; and predictably, hilariously, painfully, and stupidly enough- it completely backfires. He gets friend zoned and gets sent to prison for the rest of his life. She\'d rather enter an arranged marriage with a man she has never met before than be with you. How does that feel, you fucking cuck? Holy shit, someone give this a man a medal for the worst rejection in history.Seriously that\'s the entire plot. Yup. The end. Aren\'t you fucking glad you watched this show?ARTWORK 7/10The general art style is pretty good, and the characters are drawn very well with a distinctive style. One of the strongest points of this show is aesthetic originality, even though sometimes ""originality"" becomes synonymous with ""bad writing"", as in, it\'s original how bad the writing is. Martian kataphrakts are pretty cool looking, despite just how bad the CGI in this show is. Their designs are strange, exotic, and unique, but at the same time completely absurd. For some reason the orbital knights care more about making flashy and cool kataphrakts over actually effective weapons. You would think that a robot with access to seemingly unlimited energy would make use of all of the ridiculously overpowered technology they have, but every single kataphrakt has some gigantic weakness that is so obviously intentionally added. For some reason, a robot that has in indestructible force field has no weapons on it besides some over-sized fists, and despite the fact that it has an indestructible force field, it is covered in thick plates of armor that makes the thing look like the girl from Willy Wonka that turns into a giant blueberry. For some reason, a mech attacks by shooting hilariously ineffective, re-attachable, remote controlled ROCKET ARMS at the enemy when a while ago they showed this dude shooting rapid fire mega death lasers everywhere. It just simply makes no sense.That\'s how it works kids. If you aren\'t good enough at writing to make a character look brilliantly smart, just make all the bad guys so incompetently stupid the hero look better in contrast.SOUND 8/10The music was composed by none other than Hiroyuki Sawano, so as expected, it is quite good. Too bad they keep on replaying the same fucking song over and over again for every single god damn fight scene that you begin to hate the song. Good music is important, but making sure the music is used in a timely and appropriate manner is also important. This show succeeds in the former part, but fails in the latter.Here comes the juicy part. CHARACTER.2/10 Inaho: Absolutely no character development. Though it wouldn\'t be fair to expect character development from him. Inaho is literally God. Perfection personified into a Japanese school boy. He cannot further develop because he is already perfect. Getting shot in the head doesn\'t change that. He is still perfect. He is still an emotionless machine. The fact that he is now partially a cyborg doesn\'t help with that analogy either. He saves the day every single god damn time like he always does except now he does literally everything to the point where basically 60% of the entire show just focuses on circlejerking over how awesome he is. The writers made this man an autistic savant because they simply aren\'t smart enough to write an intelligent character well, and clearly even with that the job was still difficult for them. Because in season 2 they had to up the ante and make him even more overpowered than he already was so they can shoehorn more shitty excuses as to how he completely defeats the Vers Empire yet again by blessing him with some unreasonably overpowered god eye that can see everything. That dumb little eye can do literally anything. Like check out Inko\'s BMI for example. Inaho uses his eye to calculate Inko\'s weight so he can make fun of her. What the fuck dude? Asshole. And he knows he can get away with it since Inko wants his D for some reason. Why ya got to play a girl like that man? And to top it all off, the writers also gave him Aldnoah powers all willy-nilly to act as a convenient plot device to reactivate the Deucalion. How? Through oral transfer of royal blood and saliva. HAHA WHAT THE FUCK. In other words. This all powerful source of unlimited energy is pretty much some alien STD Ass-plump gave to Inaho.9/10 Inaho\'s robot eye: A new character. Yes. The eye has its own character. Yes. THE EYE GETS MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN INAHO HIMSELF. At first the eye is nothing but a tool, but then it starts taking over parts of Inaho\'s brain and becomes its own thinking entity.

Inaho\'s eye x Asseylum is my OTP.1/10 Slaine: Is basically the only character that gets any ""development"", which means jack shit because he just continually makes the most retarded nonsensical decisions a sane individual wouldn\'t ever consider.

Now if you excuse me I\'m going to see what kind of horrific yaoi fanfiction fujoshis are making between Inaho and Slaine.', 'A mecha show like Aldnoah Zero isn’t without controversy. They say controversy creates attention, and honestly, it’s a bit of an understatement with this show. From the way the first season concluded, one could not help but wonder how they will craft the contents for the sequel. It should be no surprise that many viewers will wonder the fate of our main protagonists (such as Inaho and Asseylum), the state of the war, and what’s in stored for Slaine. However, what blasts off this season is nothing short but predictable cliché writing, a stack of weakly balanced characters, and in general a disappointment that doesn’t...seem to be able to correct itself from what season 1 got started on.Like the first season, the sequel begins directly from where the season 1’s events left off except with a time skip. Characters still look the same but some things have changed. Included with these include the absence of Asseylum on Earth. Then, there’s also Slaine who has now devoted himself entirely to the Martians. And in a state of war, Aldnoah Zero Season 2 seems to continuously shove down the audience’s throats of the personal struggles of certain characters. Don’t get me wrong though. I like how the show expresses its interest to show how our main characters’ lives are going in season 2. The problem I find is how it constantly recycles the same ideas over and over again. In general, it fails to ensnare a viewer’s interest with the frequent ideology clashes. Less emphasis is put on the development of our characters but instead showing them their roles with a lot of badly stitched tropes. Furthermore, season 2 seems to highlight on even more problems with plot holes and writing for certain supporting characters. Logic itself also makes the audience question sometimes if the show knows what it’s doing.For our main characters, most of them play their roles in the war. Although many characters has certain objectives, it’s clear that the show has a weakness with its character development. Only on occasions do certain side characters shine in this second season. This is because the sequel seems to emphasize on building up the story with various interconnected events. However, the grim reality is that it’s predictable down to the earth and nothing really stands out besides our main characters. Season 2 also seems to have forgotten some of the major supporting characters on their development. (Rayet anyone? Calm?) In short, it’s neglecting their chance to shine and seems to constantly try to shove down the main characters down our throats. New character such as Harklight and Lemrina doesn’t gain any strong characterization at all. For instance, Harklight seems to play the sort of devoted servant for his “master”, Slaine. On the other hand, Lemrina is has a borderline obsession with him. It’s kind odd really. The sequel almost seems to devote its entirety on Slaine’s ambitions and ultimatum. Some of the diverting romance sub-plot is hardly anything interesting with the lack of interest between Slaine and certain characters. In general, it’s messy with its characters.However, I do have to give credit to certain characters that makes their name more known compared to the previous season. One such name is Mazuurek that viewers may have forgotten about. His role in this season is expanded and in fact, even interesting to see considering where his loyalty lies. This seems to be a sharp contrast with other Martians who holds their close minds about pursuing peace. Instead of conquest, Mazuurek is devoted to Asseylum and believes her to be alive. So what does the man do? Take the risk and find her. Unlike the rest of the Martians who are too busy trying to stack up body counts or flexing their mecha biceps, the show offers a more thrilling insight on his mission. Unfortunately, this is still mostly overshadowed by our main character/antagonist Slaine. Season 2 really tries to show what he is capable of and his ambitions but it’s not working. His emotions gets the better of him and even some of the people that trusts him deeply now have turned against him. It’s hard to feel sorry for him because his own actions previously caused these consequences. And not to mention, his rivalry with a certain guy he dubbed ‘Orange’ isn’t going to forgive him.Although not overbearing, some good portions of the show concentrates on action. However, it still remains the style it portrays with its gimmicky fighting. In particular, certain mecha now has ability to clone themselves, use piercing threads to slice and dice, or even make frost out of their enemies. Technology seems to have unlimited boundaries in the series as we even see the conscious of an electronic eye take hold of a person’s mentality. As fascinating as this all sounds, there’s really not much to get hold with these creative ideas. No matter how outrageous some of these ideas gets, the end result is almost always the same. The familiar strategies used through teamwork or taking a chance by calculations. Season 1 did that and the sequel doesn’t really express itself any differently. The modus operandi seems to be that wherever battles happen, the result is almost predictable. Certain build ups and death flags are also become more like false advertisements as well. Talk about disappointment.On the more technical side, I do give praise to some of the artistic direction the sequel handles itself. Action is fluid and the coordination is attractive. Even some of the new style of the music can be appealing when combined with the intense elements of sci-fi warfare. The OP and ED songs also holds some degree of symbolism along with a few recapping of the first season. Character voice mannerism on most parts remains solid and character expressions show credibility with the events of the sequel. However, it can be cringe worthy to hear some of the stereotypical emotional scenarios because honestly, it’s all over the place.In retrospect, Aldnoah Zero Season 2 is a slick and empty hollow shell of its prequel. Many events are predictable with a lesser degree on character building but more so on their grand roles. And to be honest, it’s annoying to see the same repetitive angles used over and over. At times, it even looks fake with a wrestling-like drama with faces and heels. It’s not only that but the story itself also introduced certain characters out of nowhere. While certain characters do get more emphasis compared to the first season, some of the previously established characters seems to lack focus on-screen. Instead, we are constantly being fed by Slaine and his preposterous ambitions that can be ridiculous dull. I can’t say for a fact that the sequel is complete utter trash though as it is mildly interesting to watch the development of the Vers/Earths War. It’s somewhat thrilling to see which side will win in the end and whether or not certain characters will meet their endgame goals. But for now, season 2 doesn’t get any better. Not by a damn long shot. seem to be able to correct itself from what season 1 got started on.Like the first season, the sequel begins directly from where the season 1’s events left off except with a time skip.

Not by a damn long shot.', '-This review will contain spoilers of season one as it relates to season two-There\'s something extraordinary about trainwreck titles. Its ability to draw in viewers like moths to a flame, watching as the work fold in on itself, seemingly out of breath from the layers of its incompetence. The likes of which forming something like a toxic gas that stifles every bit of its production. Good ideas immediately dying off from screenplay pesticide, hovering over everything like a merchant of death and decay. You see, there\'s a kind of beauty to it all. The way everything topples over like a game of Jenga, with each...piece representing a bad aspect of the overall project. The act of ""being bad"" in itself isn\'t due to a lack of inherently good attributes, but the fact that what little good is there can\'t survive because the ground it\'s growing out of is a complete landfill. When your base foundation is toxic, the only thing left to do is watch creativity wither and die, as it foolishly tries to eke out a meager existence in a place not meant for its type of inhabitants.A bad show making a bad continuation is one thing, but seeing an average one that maintained a steady course of passable grade content, effectively take a kamikaze nosedive into an endless sea of stupor—now that\'s when things really get interesting. Vanilla content turned into a chocolate turd with sprinkles. Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a serving of just that. A vaudevillian display of secreted nonsense, all standing out for the wrong reasons.So where do we start with this one? It seems like a reach out in any direction to describe what went wrong would seemingly send you spiraling down a bottomless pit. Proceeding with caution isn\'t much of an option when this follow-up has the logistical density of walking on eggshells. I guess we could start by addressing the ""story and characters,"" or whatever chicken scratch this anime is attempting to pass off as such. And since I seem to be running with the poultry metaphors, we\'ll touch bases with our egg connoisseur and master tactician first, Inaho. This season sees our Gary Stu coming out of his shell, abandoning his brick wall personality to emote occasionally, almost like he\'s a ""character"" or something... well, almost. Where he served as a bodysuit for the audiences to roam about the world before, now he\'s effectively turned the autopilot off and began doing things for himself. More specifically, he\'s given an end goal to motivate his actions. Where the problem in this season lies is in what he\'s given to obtain this end goal, as the screenplay bends over backward to hand him any and all tools necessary to succeed.Where the first season was grafting its existence onto the template of Gundam as its skeleton, this season travels off the beaten path to problematic results. The ability of ""Aldnoah"" is no longer treated as a guarded inheritance by selected users, as now its power can be gained through a trading system. This system in question was possibly the worst written transferring mechanic to debut in 2015—that being a kiss. No, that wasn\'t a joke, the second season of A.Z quite literally made Inaho an Aldnoah user byways of a fucking kiss. This is something other stories would use as a form of a joke, as is the case with High School DxD\'s ""Boosted Gear,"" which is powered by boners, being done as a sexual innuendo to parody shounen content. But that\'s a comedy, A.Z isn\'t. And so this season can be seen as a joke of itself without an inkling of self-acknowledgment of that fact.But it doesn\'t stop there, as egghead Inaho is also granted another major advantage. This time diving more into the realm of 80s cinema cheese.If you\'re reading this, I\'m going to assume you\'ve already watched season one, and if not, I will have to address the events of the finale to help explain the origin of Inaho\'s next hackneyed powerup. Season one\'s finale was concluded by a big shootout involving all of our key players up to that point. A shootout that saw Saazbaum and Asseylum gunned down by Slaine. This included Inaho, who received a gunshot wound to the head. Which, by the way, is a wound with a 5% survival rate, not even accounting for the smaller 3% chance of maintaining a good quality of life after recovery. Being the Gary Stu that he is, Inaho pulls through, seemingly getting rewarded a cybernetic eye for his troubles, which grants him an even greater tactical advantage. Now he can integrate his knowledge base with access to an infinite pool of information via the internet from his eye implant. He becomes part Terminator, part egg lover, and 100% HAX; why do these circumstances make him act more human as a result is beyond my comprehension (and the scriptwriters, for that matter). I guess it took getting shot in the head and being part cyborg before Inaho could act less robotic; on a meta-level, there\'s a bit of irony in there worth exploring, but I\'ll leave you to indulge in that on your own time. For now, we have more nonsense to explore.For one, The yin to Inaho\'s yang, Slaine, has finally gone ""full retard,"" and as the wise words of Kirk Lazarus from Tropic Thunder once said: ""Everybody knows you never go full retard."" After his failure to kill the men that have been the ire of his existence—despite putting a hole through the skull of one and firing off a dozen shots into the body of the other—Slaine decides to help out Saazbaum ""cuz reasons."" Entrusting his life in his hands, Slaine vows to serve under  Saazbaum ranks for the final battle to come. You know, the ""normal"" thing to do after you empty a clip into someone with murderous rage. At this point, to say Slaine is a poorly-written character would be a gross understatement. His personality from scene to scene is a complete coin toss. From pragmatic at one moment to pure lunacy by the next, there\'s really no predicting what the screenplay has in store for him. The only guarantee given is consistent inconsistency; the ultimate oxymoron made into human form.Bringing these two sides of the autistic-character spectrum together is the ongoing war that reaches its final chapter. One that takes towards the heavens, as the earthlings and people of Vers turn the leftover remnants of the Moon into their Battle of Gettysburg. This was brought to life in shitty fashion, as it seemed that the people responsible for the post-production coverup magic in season one has finally succumbed to the same level of complacency plaguing the rest of the staffing. Likely due to the new battle locations not allowing for the use of inclement weather and structural landmarks to hide the issues, the mech suits are now left naked in the vacuum of space. Their gross textures, impersonal designs, and robust movement placed one center-stage, as they\'re sent jettisoning awkwardly across the sky. It\'s a real visual eyesore, made even worse with the stark backdrop hanging in the background of a majority of the shots. Clunky pieces of CGI just bumping ugly in the open emptiness of space that surrounds it.This wouldn\'t be so bothersome had everything else been done to a bare minimum, but surprisingly enough, the character models and sparsely used landmarks were done with a semblance of quality control behind it. By contrast, the mechs just stick out even further. It\'s a distracting mix of artificiality and decent content. Of course, Hiroyuki Sawano does what Hiroyuki Sawano does best, making the soundtrack the real star attraction amidst all the mismanaged production issues. Other than that, this 2nd season leaves very little to be desired, serving better as a drinking game for every time the show shelled out a new asspull than it does a ""decent"" continuation.Even if the first season was a ripoff, it was, at the very least, a ripoff of something good. Season two isn\'t that. There\'s nothing to sugar coat here; this was a complete disaster. Very few shows have failed to the degree in which this one does. It\'s almost impressive just how little they manage to get right. But perhaps the greatest irony is that this season failed not because it was an off-brand like its first season but because it actually tried to do something different for once. It took a leap of faith only to be greeted by the ground below, and while that would be funny in most scenarios, here, it\'s nothing short of embarrassing. piece representing a bad aspect of the overall project. The act of ""being bad"" in itself isn\'t due to a lack of inherently good attributes, but the fact that what little good is there can\'t survive because the ground it\'s growing out of is a complete landfill. When your base foundation is toxic, the only thing left to do is watch creativity wither and die, as it foolishly tries to eke out a meager existence in a place not meant for its type of inhabitants.A bad show making a bad continuation is one thing, but seeing an average one that maintained a steady course of passable grade content, effectively take a kamikaze nosedive into an endless sea of stupor—now that\'s when things really get interesting. Vanilla content turned into a chocolate turd with sprinkles. Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a serving of just that. A vaudevillian display of secreted nonsense, all standing out for the wrong reasons.So where do we start with this one? It seems like a reach out in any direction to describe what went wrong would seemingly send you spiraling down a bottomless pit.

Please, I'm begging you, do not watch season two. Stop at episode 12 of season one. Season two will ruin the entire experience for you. No matter how much you love season one, don't do it. Just don't. Anyway, on to the review:STORY:Basically, they take the entire ending of season one, take everything back, and then proceed to stop all over the plot and tear it apart, piece by piece. It's a mess. I'm honestly so upset with hoe bad this was.ART:It's almost like they forgot how to...draw their own characters. Inaho looks off the entire time, Asseylum looks like a baby whale when she's sad, Slaine doesn't look nearly as good as he did in season one, I could go on. I loved the art of season one. This was a mess, none of the characters ever looked quite right, and frankly the fight scenes were also boring to watch and were always anticlimactic. Oh, and the second ending song, which plays for episode 11, looks like it's drawn by a two year oldSOUND:The soundtrack is still amazing. Luckily that didn't change between season one and two. same great songs, and some great new songs. By all means, download the season two songs, but don't watch the show, please.CHARACTER:Basically they took all character development and recked it. the first two episodes of the season makes it seem like Inaho is gonna be better in this season. The first two episodes lie to you.OVERALL:I absoluetly LOVED season one. To the point where I had it listed as my number one favorite anime, and I was constantly making gifs of it. Second season makes me ashamed to like season one. I vote that we delete this season from existence, pretend episode 12 of season one is where Aldnoah.Zero really ends, and move on from there. on a final note: PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS SEASON, EVEN IF IT'S JUST AS A JOKE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT'S GONNA BE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. IT WILL DISAPPOINT YOU. DO NOT DO IT. draw their own characters.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS. IT WILL DISAPPOINT YOU. DO NOT DO IT."", '""BAM!"" ""BAM!"" ""BAM!!!"". This was how season 1 ended. I was rather thrilled by the sudden plot shift, and dearly looked forward to season 2. Oh how wrong I was back then.Story: 1/10The very first episode of season two should have been a warning to me NOT to continue watching. It totally invalidated what season 1 had tried to build up(in the last episode). There was no major plot progression at all. Majority of the episodes followed this simple recipe:1)Enemy(Martians) attacks2)Non-Inaho personnels try to fight Martians3)Martians engage their special weapon3)Non-Inaho personnels struggle4)Inaho to the rescue!5)Enemy Martians get defeated...by InahoIt then spirals to meaningless battles between The Deucalion and The Martians. There was no clear motive by Slaine, the antagonist. I wouldn\'t even call him an antagonist. People were just fighting in the series to waste screen time. They could have better spent that time detailing about Dr Troyard and the history of Aldnoah. Sadly, they did not. To be honest, there was no story whatsoever.Art: 3/10The mechas and their animation just did not fit the space background. It felt out of place. The facial expressions of Slaine were, at times, poorly drawn. Asseylum sometimes appear to look somewhat like a whale. Inaho\'s face looked derpish too during certain scenes. This season\'s art was sorely inconsistent, which was rather surprising since season 1 had a rather decent art.Sound: 8/10I\'m sorry but sound alone cannot save a series. Sawano Hiroyuki should not have wasted his talent on a show like this. The opening to the second series was well done. It has this rock-ballad feel to it which is just HNNNG. In fact, I felt that this season\'s opening was better than that of S1(by Kalafina). The OSTs were reused from S1 but everytime they came on I just realized why I continued ploughing through this series week after week.Character: 1/10Huh? What character?INAHO appealed to me at first because I thought he had some backstory to him that gave rise to his stoic mindset. I was wrong yet again. He is basically the solution to every problem. He gained a power-up too this season which made him even more God-like, less sensitive, and more emotionless. I can\'t say much about him because there isn\'t exactly anything else to say.SLAINE was my favourite. Was. Then he became a confused maniac - he suddenly wanted to destroy Earth for no plausible reason. While Slaine may be suffering, watching Slaine in season 2 act like a complete fool gave me more suffering. However, he was the most fleshed out character of the entire series - that I can say for sure. His dedication to Asseylum, his determination to rise up the ranks, and his cunningness pleasantly surprised me at times.ASSEYLUM. Nope I\'m not gonna waste my time talking about a character who barely made a difference in S2(Some may argue that she did something in the last episode, but did the Orbital Knights listen to her?)LEMIRA. I actually don\'t know what happened to her after the \'finale\'. She was your typical jealous girl character who wants to get into the pants of a guy that adores her sister.I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT MARITO. He is the most pretentious character I have ever come across in any form of entertainment. ""OHNO I HAVE HAD EMOTIONAL TRAUMA FROM MY PAST WAR(which wasn\'t even explained properly); I DRINK TO EASE MY PAIN; I CANT KILL AN ENEMY"". He wins the title of most pretentious character. Period. A pity that he is voiced by my favourite seiyuu who also voices Hijikata(mayonnaise).Enjoyment: 2/10I only enjoyed two and a half things from this series: the music, me being able to laugh at the ridiculousness of this series, and the last 1/2 goes to Slaine. If you have read till here(thanks for reading btw), do yourself and I a favour by skipping this season. Season 1 was all right. Just.skip.this.season. If you want mecha anime, there are better ones out there. (TTGL, E7, CG, Gundam Unicorn, FCLC)Overall: 2/10+2 points for music. I have stated earlier that music alone cannot save a series. You can have the best composer in the anime industry on your production team, but if your story has no substance, your characters no proper development, and your art no consistency, it is impossible for your anime to be worth watching at all. by InahoIt then spirals to meaningless battles between The Deucalion and The Martians.

It\'s up there with Zankyou as a failed collaboration between an otherwise promising writer/director combo that ends up being a ruse to make a quick buck.This review covers both seasons.Aldnoah is an action anime primarily. However, even t its core, the action in this series can be easily summarized in this simple step-by-step list:1. Evil Martian in mecha shows up and decimates Earth Redshirts2. Secondary characters get caught up and say it\'s hopeless3. Inaho shows up, theme music power up, and uses OP BS (Magic Eye in 2nd...season) and destroys evil Martian mecha.4. Everyone is gladBut formulaic action isn\'t the main issue, nor is the decent animation quality, it\'s how soulless and unnecessary these fights are. These fights can feel longer than they should due to padding and how little is actually happening in the fight storywise.Now let\'s discuss the story, or what little there is that drives the whole series forward. Aldnoah is a story about the struggle of the good Earth people and the dog-kicking evil people of Mars. Remarkably, the writers manage to screw up an otherwise simple and interesting premise thanks to bland characters, bad filler, and rushed plot development near the end. To make this review easier on the eyes to read, I\'ll be talking about each facet in great detail in their individual paragraphs.Aldnoah stars 2 incredibly bland main characters, Inaho and Slaine. As mentioned above, Inaho is incredibly OP, to the point where the entire Earth military relies entirely on him to win their battles for them. It doesn\'t help that Inaho\'s personality is very soulless and utterly devoid of emotion (2nd season is slightly better in this regard, but too little too late). Slaine on the other hand is initially the more interesting fellow, but his one-dimensional personality is often ruined by his sheer incompetence in the series. Slaine can\'t do anything right, even if it\'s in his capability to do so. It\'s hard to pity him however, as he becomes very much unlikable as the series progresses.The only other noteworthy character is the Princess, who is just...there. She is a MacGuffin item given life but still a hollow item inside. She\'s the main reason why this plot exists, but she\'s ultimately nothing. It\'s hard to form an emotional connection with her (which is what I believe is the main intention of the writers) because of how bland she is.Every other character in the series is so incompetent/unnecessary they might as well be trees in the background. (Aside maybe Saazbaum, he\'s so hammy and fun it\'s a shame he doesn\'t appear often).There is very little plot progression in the series beyond the first few episodes and the last few episodes. Most episodes are just filler with boring fight scenes or with characters talking about nothing and accomplishing nothing. This rushed progression is so bad, the series actually introduces a plot-important (relatively speaking anyway) character 3 episodes before the series finale.The soundtrack in the series is generally quite messy. The composer\'s soundtracks for the battle scenes are the standard samey generic ""One-Woman Waling in the background with orchestral rock"" stuff you\'ve heard before in anime with this guy composing. The one notable soundtrack which I find was not only used quite well within context, but quite pleasant to listen to is the theme that accompanies Lemrina and occasionally Count Klancain near the end of the second season.I\'ve talked about the fight scenes in great detail previously, but to emphasize how bad they really are, lets take a look at this gif made by one person on they\'re own free time with some simple software.http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1959599Even without context, this fight scene conveyed in the gif is more intense, interesting and communicates all the information that is needed to be told to the viewer. In the gif, we can tell the two girls fighting are rivals, with the short-hair girl being a degree more powerful than twintails girl, to the point where she\'s just toying around with twintails. We can also see that twintails is persistent and despite knowing she\'s way outta her league, still gives it her all and tries her damnedest to not give up. Eventually, we see that even though she lost and knows that her rival is merely toying with her, she still has a feeling of admiration for her rival, hinting that this battle may yet to conclude.These few seconds in the gif has more going on in it than any fight scene, hell, any given scene in Aldnoah. The incompetence of the people involved in Aldnoah still baffles me to this day.Really now, if you want a good mecha series with a half-decent story, go watch Gurren Lagan or something. This isn\'t worth you time.Now some of you may wonder, why I made myself watch this trite series when I could\'ve gave up on episode 2. Thing is, ever since the first episode, I\'ve always held up the belief that the series may redeem itself somewhere down the line. It is that hope, that I cling to, that pushes me onward through adversity. And now I\'m here, as a beacon to guide potential viewers away from this farce.

I could be talking about Guilty Crown, but unfortunately is Aldnoah Zero.After the end of season one, i thought ""This can\'t be another guilty crown, right?"" I was so wrong.The season two started really well, but don\'t be fooled, the story will progress to a point that you will finding yourself hating the characters you used to love and forgetting some of them because it only focus on the trio Inaho, Aseylum and Slaine. The end is weird, rushed and does not make any sense to me.(spoilers...from here)Although the end isn\'t what you could say ""sad"", it was one of the more unpleasant endings i ever saw, they focused so much in the main trio and at the end not a single one seemed happy nor sad, it was the ""so so ending for everyone"", Inaho is just Inaho, in love with Aseylum and keeping his nemesis alive by her wish, Slaine is ""saved"" by the wish of Aseylum, but this is the worst punishment for him, and Aseylum, who loved both Inaho and Slaine marry a random count (A pointless marriage, since it didn\'t really stop the war)  that appeared in two episodes and is happy because earth is in peace now.(Spoilers end here)Unfortunately i\'m in love with the soundtrack, so this is another anime that will be haunting me, every time i listen to it, i remember how unpleasant that second season was. from here)Although the end isn\'t what you could say ""sad"", it was one of the more unpleasant endings i ever saw, they focused so much in the main trio and at the end not a single one seemed happy nor sad, it was the ""so so ending for everyone"", Inaho is just Inaho, in love with Aseylum and keeping his nemesis alive by her wish, Slaine is ""saved"" by the wish of Aseylum, but this is the worst punishment for him, and Aseylum, who loved both Inaho and Slaine marry a random count (A pointless marriage, since it didn\'t really stop the war)  that appeared in two episodes and is happy because earth is in peace now.(Spoilers end here)Unfortunately i\'m in love with the soundtrack, so this is another anime that will be haunting me, every time i listen to it, i remember how unpleasant that second season was.', 'Witnessed a lot of bad reviews so it\'s high time to introduce something different - positive review to this show.==============================================~PLOT SYNOPSIS~----------------------------------------------------Season 1----------------------------------------------------Story revolves around the difficulty of what happens when humanity, hypothetically in the future,is split up into two categories:...- humans who inhabited the Earth, known as Terrans- humans who migrated to Mars and settled at the barren planet (Mars), known as MartiansThe humans who migrated to Mars, known as Martians, settled in the barren planet for a long span of time and eventually, the inhabitants established their own government system that portrays their independence from those governing bodies that control the Earth. As the generation that migrated to Mars perished and the forthcoming Martian generations soon gained a wrong notion that they\'re solely different from their Terran counterparts just because they\'ve inhabited a different planet, the notion that they\'re ancestors used to inhabit Earth fades, as time passed by.Fast forward to the future, Martians soon faced scarce resources as the barren planet gets populated. Due to the lack of bounty and infertility of the land of Mars, the Martians decided to perform a coup d\'etat (intentionally used this term since the Martians\' ancestors used to inhabit Earth) in order to obtain Earth resources. Not before long, due to the Martians\' ulterior motive, the hostilities started in order to gain what they\'ve been longing for.But in order to do that, the Martians need a stronger war trigger, a trigger that will supplement the reason as to why they need to invade the Terran\'s inhabited planet and loot. And so, an assassination attempt to the Martian Princess was framed/conspired by a Martian knight (not going to be named to prevent spoilers) in order to do just that.By making it look as if the Terrans planned to assassinate the Martian emperor\'s daughter, the Martian knight managed to persuade the nation of Mars migrants to ensue an all-out war.(This is all done just for the sake of the intent of garnering Earth resources as well as expanding their dominion.)The war breakout caused many casualties on the Terran force\'s side as they\'re overpowered by Martians through the means of higher spec mechas that makes use of a powerful energy source that can solely be derived on Mars - Aldnoah. (hence the origin of the anime\'s name is deduced)When all hope seems lost and Terrans seems to be on the brink of absolute annihilation due to the unfathomable difference in military power, whether it\'d be mecha (known in the show as Kataphrakts) or warhead strength,hope sheds light as a Terran prodigy spearheaded a movement in order to prevent the Martians\' goal from taking into full swing.The Terran prodigy, named Inaho, prevented the colonization not by brute force, but by sheer intellect; this is achieved through the means of strategic and tactical style of warfare - exploiting the enemies\' flaws, flaws that are somewhat unperceivable to a regular human\'s analysis and plans that are inconceivable.----------------------------------------------------Season 2----------------------------------------------------Following the war ignited by the Martian knight, the Terran prodigy, Inaho, after a near-death experience in Season 1, managed to survive the conflicts and became stronger than ever, intellectually speaking, in Season 2via cybernetic implant which was brought forth by war repercussions. On top of that, Inaho gained Martian accomplices,who just like him and other Terrans, wanted to make peace and form a pact/treaty.Generally speaking however, most Martians, including the emperor of the Martians himself, opposed this idea and hence, war continued to resonate.Due to the Martians\' immense military powers, conceit-driven, they have no intention of giving in. The same goes for the Terrans, whose trump card is Inaho who comes up with ridiculous plans with his strategic/tactical prowess.To summarize Season 2 in a nutshell, the continuation of the war and the conclusion of the hostilities is portrayed in the 2nd Season.============================================================================================~MORALE OF STORY~Ever heard of the terms Rayleigh\'s Scattering, Leidenfrost Effect, Meissner Effect or Quantum Teleportation?Obviously, those who have physics background would know pretty much some, if not, all of these. But for a regular person, that won\'t be the case.And so, here comes the anime called \'Aldnoah\' which incorporates these scientific jargons and exposes viewers to the realm of science.Not only are you watching anime, but as the anime progresses, the creators of Aldnoah explains to you why that\'s happening, why that didn\'t happen, what\'s the scientific explanation behind it and whatnots.Thereby, by the end of the show, the viewers gains more knowledge in the aspect of science.The real life scientific terminologies aforementioned are embedded and is used as basis in the creation of this show.Magnificently, if you think of all the animes one has watched over the course of his/her lifetime, there\'s only a handful, if not none, has encountered an anime which adheres to technicalities as in-depth as Aldnoah.Also, general knowledge is taught there indirectly via the mecha battles and conversations amongst the characters.(ex: negating smoke screens via electricity as part of the plan to counter the enemy forces\' smoke screen. Scientific reasoning behind it?The phenomenon occurs as colloids are absorbed by ions which in turn...ah forget it.Watch the anime and you\'ll learn more of such things.)============================================================================================~ART~It\'s safe to assume, or declare to be more precise, that Aldnoah has reached the pinnacle when it comes tographics. When one might ask me, ""How does modern anime graphics look like?"" I\'ll simply answer,""Watch Aldnoah and you\'ll know.""============================================================================================~CRITICISMS~All in all, it was definitely a worthwhile show to watch. I\'m bothered though, about the amount of negative reviews the show\'sreceiving.Nevertheless, frankly speaking, I was expecting this since I know for a fact that Aldnoah goes in-depth; not a lot of animes have that approach and hence, viewers are not used to it and tend to get annoyed by it to the extentthat they started hating the show and instead of being straightforward and confess that they don\'t understand much of the show due to the adherence of the show to scientific technicalities,viewers have the tendency makeunnecessary excuses (unnecesary whining, to be more precise), specifically, stating that the plot\'s cliche, apparently.There\'s a lot more complaints but I\'m too dismayed to read them, all the more, list those things in my review.============================================================================================~COMPLIMENTS~Up next, I\'ll discuss my \'compliments\' to this show after briefly discussing about the cause of criticisms.Unlike some shows that includes unnecessary fillers, flashbacks, etc. Aldnoah doesn\'t have that trait.Aldnoah utilizes every episode well, carefully selecting appropriate moments at which a particular flashbackis necessary. Furthermore, the pace is wonderfully decided, upon realizing that every episode ends at a well-timedcliffhanger. And finally, Aldnoah doesn\'t need a deus ex machina to make the protagonist prevail over the antagonists. (unless being a genius tactician is not considered a deus ex machina, my argument crumbles apart)============================================================================================~MUSIC~One of the key triggers for me to give this anime a try is because of the 1st season\'s catchy opening song.Judging by the melody of the opening and closing songs of both season 1 and 2, they\'re highly fancy. On the aspect of OST (background music), one thing that must be made known is that OSTs are incorporated to enhance a particular mood portrayed in a scene, whether it\'d be action, depressing, joyful scene, etc.However, I was too immersed on the technicalities embedded in the anime which resulted for me to become unaware of the OSTs, all in all; not to mention, OSTs are mood enhancers, so they\'re not meant to be noticed in thefirst place. PS: Opening songs of both seasons are so melodically attractive, to the extent that the songs still constantly reverberate in my mind approximately a week after I finished watching the series.============================================================================================~CONCLUSION~If you take the fact aside that Mars cannot be inhabited due to its lack of bounty of oxygen in its atmosphere, then the show will be worth watching.If you like a show that has a protagonist who takes advantage of the antagonists by outdoing the antagonists strategically, like Lelouch and Blank from the renowned animes \'Code Geass\' and\' No Game No Life\' respectively, then I hereby announce that Aldnoah is a kind of show that you\'ll enjoy, inasmuch as I did.============================================== - humans who inhabited the Earth, known as Terrans- humans who migrated to Mars and settled at the barren planet (Mars), known as MartiansThe humans who migrated to Mars, known as Martians, settled in the barren planet for a long span of time and eventually, the inhabitants established their own government system that portrays their independence from those governing bodies that control the Earth.

I enjoy it.STORY (3):The story continues where season 1 left off. The story involves the war between Earth & Martians. How will they solve their resolutions?I enjoyed season 1. It had fun characters and an excellent build-up. Unfortunately, just like Tokyo Ghoul season 2, this sequel suffers from tensionless fight scenes and boring characters.ART (4):...The animation is nothing special.SOUND (4):The music is not memorable.CHARACTER (3):Oh boy? Where do I begin?Inaho is so overpowered that he gets the job done easily. The rest of the cast members are relying heavily on Inaho all the time. Inaho barely shows any emotion, just like Edward Cullen. Inaho is just a wish-fulfilment character.Slaine was an interesting character, he could be an anti-hero. If he was given a better material, he could have been a memorable villain. However, his character was handled terribly.Asseylum Vers Allusia was useless all the time. She barely did anything. In the 1st season, she contributing something. However, in the second season, she become more useless. What are you writers doing? Give better roles to women. C\'mon. First was SAO, then its Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei, and now this.Rayet Areash, OMG. She is the most annoying character I have seen in my entire life. All she does is cry and moan all the time. She showed determination in the 1st season, however in the second season, she became more annoying that usual. If I thought Stephanie Dola was annoying, she is way worse than Stephanie Dola. At least Stephanie Dola didn\'t moan or cry all the time. I don\'t care if you say ""Her parents are dead so that\'s why she acted like that"". There are characters whose parents are dead, and they learn how to become determined to succeed. Example Shinji Ikari, he might be annoying however he showed some determination inside him.The rest of the characters are bland.CONCLUSION (3):I am not going to waste my time talking about it because I have better things to do. I enjoyed the 1st season however, the 2nd season is a mistake to watch.What ultimately makes this sequel worse than Tokyo Ghoul\'s sequel is the characters. At least the sequel of Tokyo Ghoul have characters that never annoyed me.I have to give this anime a 3 out of 10. The animation is nothing special.SOUND (4):The music is not memorable.CHARACTER (3):Oh boy? Where do I begin?Inaho is so overpowered that he gets the job done easily.

I think it\'s better to prioritize looking at the scenario, and the studio\'s track record first and foremost as opposed to getting excited because of the reputation of one individual. Of course that ""one individual"" in this case just so happens to be one of the most controversial writers in the business to date, Gen Urobuchi. I\'m not really here to get into my personal stance on Urobuchi...obviously, though If I was to be honest with you, I am for the most pretty indifferent to his output. So I wasn\'t necessarily excited to hear that this was his brainchild nor was it much of a cause of alarm to hear he jumped ship. Considering how the quality of Gargantia and the Psycho-Pass franchise suffered after he handed those off (and not to mention the fact that the guy who took his place was the same dude who brought us Boku no Pico AKA everyone\'s favorite meme recommendation) perhaps some serious red flags should\'ve been raised. I\'m sure you know where I\'m going with this. After an OK start, the writing really unravels itself into complete oblivion in the most uninteresting way imaginable.Another issue is that none of it\'s battles feels particularly weighty or meaningful in the long run. The show doesn\'t really manage to make up for that with sheer entertainment value since the skirmishes between the two factions feel very samey-samey and repetitious to the point where you can make a sort of drinking game out of it. A shot every time UFE (United Forces of Earth) soldiers shoots repeatedly to no avail at overpowered marauders from Mars and end up becoming death fodder. A shot for every time Inaho appears, analyzes the enemy and finds out their weakness just minutes into the battle and wins. A shot for every time the plot isn\'t impacted in any meaningful way and all named characters come out alive. A shot for...OK, I think I\'ve made my point. What also doesn\'t help is that the battles somehow turn a strong Sawano OST and turn into a negative. The issue here is that the music selection is incredibly shallow and overstated. They literally play the same theme for every battle against each Martian onslaught, only swapping themes once after the season break and continuing to do the same afterward. This way the OST not only makes otherwise good tracks seem stale, it also assigns the same level of importance to the battles with random irrelevant bad guys as it would the season-ending climaxes. Gimmicks are the only thing that set the battles apart from each other, the only real question is what broken power will the Martians bring to the table for a high schooler to overcome. From the mech that erases everything he touches to the mech that can freeze surroundings to the mech that can clone itself endlessly, it still manages to feel rote. The impenetrable layers of plot armor and the uninteresting hold-overs from skirmish-to-skirmish eventually make the action in Aldnoah.Zero a complete bore.Everything I\'ve brought up this far has only really been enough to make the show completely mediocre at worst, but the characters are what make Aldnoah.Zero a true failure. It\'s hard to not feel anything but the deepest of apathy for the UFE in particular since most of them aren\'t given a lick of depth and the only character arcs that are thoroughly set-up (Marito and Rayet\'s) fall off the face of the Earth in the 2nd season because they become entirely irrelevant. Honestly, the entirety of the UFE may as well be renamed the United Job-squad of Earth since they\'d be about as capable as an infant in front of a bloodthirsty pack of hyenas if not for Inaho, which finally brings me to everyone\'s favorite autistic ace-pilot. There really isn\'t much to say about the guy that isn\'t incredibly obvious from the 1st few episodes and that\'s what hamstrings the show most out of all of it\'s problems. There\'s no getting around it, Inaho is just one massive, expressionless plot-win button to the point where the likes of Kirito and Tatsuya Shiba. They try to make it seem as if he actually gives a damn about anything by having other people talk behind his back about the guy he really is underneath, but even then he fails to stir much in the audience besides boredom since he would swear vengeance upon the enemy for the death of a friend with same level interest one would put into ordering a carton of discount eggs, possibly less. He has no interesting backdrop, development or anything resembling catharsis. He\'s just ""competence"" incarnate and that\'s fucking lame.The Mars side fares better in the writing department considering, but that\'s pretty faint praise by my estimation. Of course, the only interesting character to follow throughout the entire series is Slaine Troyard for better of or worse. He has the benefit of not only being allowed to make mistakes, yet he also drives the story forward so he\'s already much better than any of the characters from Earth for that alone. The 2nd half mostly revolves around him and the decisions he makes that don\'t necessarily line up with the desires of the princess he once tried to rescue. His actions and his ambitions essentially run in opposite directions in the latter half. Without going into specific-spoiler territory, everything that befalls him in the second is completely a result of his own lack of foresight and thus it becomes difficult to feel bad for the guy. His evolution from a chicken running around with its head cut-off in the name of the Princess to some sort of Machiavellian-type mass-murderer overnight and it\'s hard to buy. The logic behind this character feels tacked on and silly. Sauzbaum had potential as a true antagonist because he was an actual character as opposed to most of the crazy warmongering elites, but even his character is wasted in a fairly stupid manner.Aldnoah.Zero is just one of those titles I\'ve completed only to question why I ever bothered with it in the 1st place. It sure as heck isn\'t smart enough to win over Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Gundam fans, nor is it stupid or edgy enough to capture the appeal of Valvrave or Cross Ange. Of course Aldnoah.Zero is full of nonsense too, but it takes nonsense far too seriously to the point where laughing at the writers is the best reaction I could possibly hope for. It never even manages to become a complete trainwreck at the end because the resolution in the final episode just feels too damn simple and lacking in pay-off. Character arcs and plot-points (like the research of Slaine\'s father, the origins of the alien technology, the issues with Inaho\'s eye, etc) are tossed into the wind since the series has wasted too much time in the 1st 23 episodes to do anything but fizzle out in a way that makes much of what the viewers subjected themselves to feel even more pointless than before.It\'s a show for nobody, not even the most die-hard Urobuchi-philes since his influence on the majority of the story is non-existent and no attempts were made to even provide a cheap imitation of his voice. Want a mech series with romance, plenty of action and a strong OST? Watch The Vision of Escaflowne or Macross. Want a full-blown epic-scaled war between two sides with plenty of history behind it? Go check out Legend of the Galactic Heroes or get into the Gundam. As far as I see it, Aldnoah.Zero offers a war without weight and politics that lack intrigue. obviously, though If I was to be honest with you, I am for the most pretty indifferent to his output. So I wasn\'t necessarily excited to hear that this was his brainchild nor was it much of a cause of alarm to hear he jumped ship. Considering how the quality of Gargantia and the Psycho-Pass franchise suffered after he handed those off (and not to mention the fact that the guy who took his place was the same dude who brought us Boku no Pico AKA everyone\'s favorite meme recommendation) perhaps some serious red flags should\'ve been raised. I\'m sure you know where I\'m going with this. After an OK start, the writing really unravels itself into complete oblivion in the most uninteresting way imaginable.Another issue is that none of it\'s battles feels particularly weighty or meaningful in the long run. The show doesn\'t really manage to make up for that with sheer entertainment value since the skirmishes between the two factions feel very samey-samey and repetitious to the point where you can make a sort of drinking game out of it. A shot every time UFE (United Forces of Earth) soldiers shoots repeatedly to no avail at overpowered marauders from Mars and end up becoming death fodder. A shot for every time Inaho appears, analyzes the enemy and finds out their weakness just minutes into the battle and wins. A shot for every time the plot isn\'t impacted in any meaningful way and all named characters come out alive. A shot for...OK, I think I\'ve made my point. What also doesn\'t help is that the battles somehow turn a strong Sawano OST and turn into a negative. The issue here is that the music selection is incredibly shallow and overstated. They literally play the same theme for every battle against each Martian onslaught, only swapping themes once after the season break and continuing to do the same afterward.

As far as I see it, Aldnoah.Zero offers a war without weight and politics that lack intrigue.', ""After watching the entirety of the Aldonah.Zero series (except for the recap, I didn't consider it necesary for obvious reasons), I decided to write my very first review on MAL.First of all, I would like to clarify something: I'm not a diehard mecha fan. I only watched other three mecha animes, specifically Neon Genesis Evangelion (including EoE and the Rebuilds), Gurren Lagann and Code Geass R1 and R2, and I could say I'm used to the genre by now.After clarifying this, now I can talk about what are my thoughts about Aldnoah.Zero season 2.I'll try not to spoil much, but I do need to talk...about some stuff that really bothered me. A lot.STORY 3/10:So we begin 19 months after the events of the first season. The war between Earth and Vers continues as we find out everyone who presumably 'died' in season 1's finale is actually still alive.We find out, through flashbacks, that Slaine Troyard spared Saazbaum's life after he shot the princess, but with the condition of taking her with them to save her life. Later on, the Earth people find Inaho unconcious and managed to save him, even though he was shot in the face.Back to the present day, Inaho Kaizuka is back to kick some martian ass and be as emotionless and flat-written as always, only now he can know EVERYTHING thanks to his new fancy cyborg eye.Oh, but how will the Earthlings fly their Aldnoah-powered ship now without the princess around? Simple, Inaho has the power to activate Aldnoah now. Just because he did CPR to her after she choked on her french fries on season 1. That's it, a fucking 'kiss' can give you the mystical power of Aldnoah, passed on generation after generation, something probably genetical, easier to get than contracting AIDS!Everyone else depends on Inaho, as always.Meanwhile, a fake princess Allusia appears, declaring that Earth must be invaded and stuff. We find out she's Allusia's half-sister and that she also has this shape-shifting power thing. The real princess stays in a comatose stage and only Slaine, Saazbaum, Eddelrittuo (the princess's loli) and the half-sister know about her.Slaine gets greater and greater ranks between the Vers soldiers, and with the help of the fake princess, gets everyone to try to fight the Earthlings and take over Earth, even thought this was AGAINST what princess Allusia desired.The ending is the stupidest thing ever.ART 5/10:The art is actually pretty neat, but the animation can be a bit confusing at times. The fighting scenes are 100% CGI and may be hard to follow. The character design is not very outstanding. Some characters look very much alike, at least between the Vers counts.SOUND 7/10:The music for this series felt adecuate, but it's a bit repetitive. It fulfills its purpose, but nothing else. The Kalafina opening was a lot better than this one. The ending theme is okay...CHARACTER 2/10:Until the end of season 1, the only likeable character was Slaine Troyard... but they fucking ruined him.Inaho is still as boring and uninteresting as in season 1. He's the clichest character I ever seen, OP'd a lot, as smart and tactical as Light Yagami and Lelouch combined, and now he's even half cyborg, as if he wasn't emotionless enough. He has no backstory, no clear motivations, no nothing. I can't even consider him as the protagonist.Slaine was the only character with actual character development, even until season 2. We saw him rise from the bottom to become almost Emperor of Vers. But after the princess was retrieved from Earth, the writers forcefully turned him into the 'bad guy', with no clear motivations, other than 'I DO THIS FOR TEH PRINCESS', so he goes against Earth, even though, once again, THIS WAS AGAINST WAHT THE PRINCESS DESIRED.There is not much to say about the other characters without spoiling stuff, but I'll just say that they're not very outstanding and there's practically no one else is very relevant in the story. Well, maybe Alussia's sister, but there's not much to say about her either.ENJOYMENT 3/10:This second season felt very promising when first announced, even though there it seemed hard to have a new and fresh start with most of the main characters 'deceased'. I even thought Slaine was going to become the main protagonist, but I wasn't sure what to expect of him.This season felt cliché-er than ever. No one dies, in contrast with the first half of the series (lol), the good guys always win and never lose, the bad guys, even with their dozens years advanced technology, are brutally defeated, and the ending is the worst shit I've ever seen.There are a lot of plot holes in the story, no plot twists or sudden relevant changes, the non-battle scenes are boring as hell, and the battles themselves... well, all praise Inaho the all-mighty. He can do EVERYTHING.BTW, why do their mechas look so much like Code Geass's Knightmares? They even have that harpoon shooting thingy... Hmmmmmm, I smell lack of originallity.........OVERALL 3/10:Disgusting.This felt as a huge step backwards compared to the first series. Actually, the first series wasn't that good either, but the second season is actually worse. The characters are even lazier written (and more unrealistic than ever), the story fucking sucks, the ending fucking sucks, they don't even have Kalafina, and it's all plain boring.If you enjoyed season 1, go watch it, but you may be VERY disappointed. about some stuff that really bothered me.

Season 2 of this anime has some twisted moments but all in all, the plot was developed nicely. Some might say that episode 1\'s revival of the main cast is bullshit. If you just call it plot armour that like 99.9% of anime out there have, you can deal with it better.-------Story-------The plot of this season was somewhat twisted. Slaine took a 180 degree turn and became the main antagonist for a reason that is deep and shall not be spoiled by me. There are as much moments of frustration...when you wished something to happen and it took a left turn and crashed down the chasm. Most of the plot devices are somewhat explained in this season though. The ending was one of the best and most complete ending I have ever seen for awhile.--------Art---------The animation used in battles was phenomenal. Each battle scene would take your breath away and when you thought its the end, the final battle between Slaine and Inaho is even better. Definitely worth watching just for the battle scenes. You wont see another mech battle with such amazing animation anytime soon.-------Sound-------What? There is music? Basically it blends so nicely and emphasises each scenes to bring out its excitement that I dont even notice its there.-------Character-------Most of the characters are more or less well developed. Some of the Counts seem to not have any back story or just a one episode description of their story.Slaine\'s character... You can call him the typical ""Twisted"" antagonist where he do something thinking he was right and at the final turn, crushed by his most important friend saying something that turns him completely. Only thing is, the twisted part is REALLY twisted.--------Overall---------Go watch it. You may end it at season 1\'s ending and call it quits. Its a good ending. But Season 2\'s ending is better. If I was to judge, Season 2 has weaker characters but stronger plot. Well. Stronger in the sense of the ending. when you wished something to happen and it took a left turn and crashed down the chasm.

If you were to flashback to about a year ago, the first season of Aldnoah.Zero was the most anticipated anime of 2014 for many(including me): the latest brain-child of Gen Urobuchi, directed by Ei Aoki, with music by esteemed composer Hiroyuki Sawano. It was a super-star of the 2014 summer anime season, but by the time it had finished airing it had fallen quite roughly from the spot-light. Problems plagued it: a lackluster cast, odd pacing, as well as mediocre writing, as it soon became the butt of the anime...communities jokes. But even so, it wasn\'t a terrible anime; at least in my opinion. It had problems, but it was still enjoyable, and even showed an occasional spark that it could be something more then it was, that it could maybe meet those hefty expectations that the community had set for it before it had begun airing. This was my mind-set as we headed into the second, and concluding season of Aldnoah.Zero. It wasn\'t the right one.Hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, and today, we take a look at the second season of Aldnoah.Zero, and maybe we can figure out where it all went wrong. I won\'t be boring you with the studio who animated it or the writers involved, all that information is already available in my review of the first season. What I will tell you is that Aldnoah.Zero 2 is a 12 episode anime TV series that aired between January 10th to March 28th of 2015, airing in that year\'s winter season. Now, let\'s jump right into where we left off in the plot.So, as a slight refresher, where did we leave off? Well, if you recall, everyone was dead. Princess Asseylum had been shot in the head, Slaine had shot Inaho in the face, and now it is 19 months later. The war between Earth and the Vars Empire has continued, though after the events of the finale of the first season, the core pieces have been shuffled, and now everyone stands in different places. Slaine is now a well-respected knight for the Vers Empire, as he has the backing of Count Saazbaum, a penance for Slaine saving the count\'s life at the end of the first season. Slaine, with the help of Count Saazbaum has rescued Asseylum from her certain death on Earth, and now they hold her in permanent status within Ver\'s military base on the moon, unsure whether she will ever wake up from her coma. With the Princess now out of commission and the last chance for peace between Earth and Vers completely gone, Slaine has devised a new way to rally troops against Earth: as now Asseylum\'s half-sister Lemrina impersonates Asseylum, using the princess\' influence to ignite the hatred between Earth and Mars to drive the war effort onward. Slaine in the meantime, works his way up Ver\'s military, with a final goal in mind that only he knows, as he leads the charge against Earth\'s military and gains the support of various counts and knights around Vers. The situation is made even more complicated as Slaine must work through his own personal stigma of being ""a terran"", a fact which places various barriers in the way of his path into a commanding position, and now, Princess Lemrina has started to develop feeling for Slaine, and she could potentially reveal herself as an impostor at any moment out of jealousy of Slaine\'s feelings for Asseylum or if he reject her advances, effectively putting an end to his plans before he even has time to instigate them.On the Earth side of the war,  Inaho has miraculously survived as well, due to some, let\'s be fair, bullsh*t involving Aldnoah.Zero that allowed him get medical attention. Inaho lives on as a soldier, now equipped with a new robotic eye that allows him to perform all kinds of life-hacks(including being able to tell if somebody is lying, scanning distance between targets and make predictions, scan for coordinates(and really this thing is just completely over-powered)). Inaho is the only one who suspects that the current Princess Asseylum is an impostor, and is determined to find where the real princess is and rescue her, even if that means he will be putting himself directly in the way of Slaine Troyard, setting the stage for an inevitable showdown between the two that may determine the fate of the entire war.I suppose I\'ll talk about positives first. As a the plot for a ""second cour"" of a series goes, it could be worse. It has pust both main characters into more commanding roles that allow more radical plot-points to occur, and it does well to recognize that these things must always have a sense of escalation as now most of the battle scenes take place in space, which, let\'s be honest, is pretty awesome no matter what context. But that\'s really all the good I have to say about it. The idea for this second season might have worked, and worked very well,  but ultimately, the execution is so lack-luster that all positives it had just sort of steadily seep out as the anime buries itself deeper under its own stupidness.The inherent problem is probably that the writing really isn\'t that good, rendering all ideas the anime had pretty much pointless. Characters often make stupid or unrealistic decisions that only serve to drive the plot onward, and certain plot-points only occur because of amazing coincidences or logic that fails to hold any sort of weight. I mean guys, are you really telling me that Slaine missed Inaho\'s head from literally point blank range when he shot him at the end of the first season? We all know the only reason Slaine missed is so this ""second cour"" could happen, and so Inaho could get his stupid robotic eye. And another thing, that robotic eye is complete bullsh*t. I don\'t care how smart the show tells us Inaho is, that eye is pretty equivalent to a Geass in terms of unfairness(though to be fair, they do add consequences later on for that plot-point, though it never really goes anywhere). It\'s things like this that make the whole thing hard to take seriously, though Aldnoah.Zero does undoubtedly want you to take it seriously. You can really tell it\'s trying to be an epic space adventure, filled with interesting politics and awesome characters, but... it just isn\'t. It\'s not like, say Valvrave, that pretty much just insulted your intelligence and credibility as an anime fan by just watching it; Aldnoah.Zero legitimately wants you to be pulled into this world, to care about these characters, and to really be on the edge of your seat as events play out. But the writing just can\'t support these good intentions; no matter how good it wants to be, just the act of treating itself like a good anime when it really isn\'t only adds to the stupid factor, and makes the show easier to insult. I don\'t want to insult Aldnoah.Zero. Hell, I still rather like the first season at the end of the day. But it\'s really not doing itself any favors by behaving the way it does, because by doing so, it\'s only going to sink lower and lower down people\'s ""good lists"", when arguably it doesn\'t belong there, at least not as much as some other shows I could mention.But here\'s the last, and maybe even the biggest problem that this second season has: it\'s just sort of boring, and I think I can offer two possible reasons about why it\'s like this. First, if you were to rewind to the pacing of the first season, what you might recall is that it was a little weird. There were two very specific ""highs"" of the series that were exciting and adrenaline pumping, those two moments being the very beginning(or to be more specific, those first three episodes), and of course the very end, where, you know, everyone dies. The space in between was where the first season lost nearly all of its momentum and promise; a space where Inaho just sort of inexplicably beat whatever soldiers the Vers Empire would throw at him, and nothing really happened besides some half-asked attempts to throw in drama(like when Rayet chokes Asseylum in the show, only for Inaho to revive her five minutes later). That\'s what season 2 largely consists of. I don\'t think the reason per say is that it actually is as boring as that mid-section of the first season, but because we\'ve already jumped the shark in terms of dramatic tension. I mean, when you ""kill"" everyone as the finale of your first season, you can\'t really top that can you? Also(and I\'ve mentioned this before in other reviews but whatever), when you sacrifice your narrative integrity, or in this case, ""killing"" all your characters and then bringing them all back literally the next episode, it sort of just renders everything pointless after that. What\'s the point of caring about what happens in this war between Earth and Mars when you feel that anything that you\'re told can be taken right back if the creators feel that is would increase the drama, or have a target audience return for your crappy second season just so they can see what happened. Pair this with, as I\'ve already said, how seriously the show takes itself, which means there are plenty of politically driven scenes that really aren\'t interesting, and yeah, it\'s all sort of boring.What this season largely consists of is Inaho and Slaine circling each-other like sharks, breezing through whatever challenge is in their way because both of them are extremely overpowered, until it is time for the final showdown 12 episodes later. Sure, some interesting stuff happens in that time that could have potentially lead to something intriguing: Lemrina\'s mental state, Slaine\'s own doubts about his attack against Earth and Inaho\'s slowly emerging humanity, but nothing really goes anywhere. There\'s only one sub-plot that really dramatically effects how events play out, but I can\'t mention it because, you know, spoilers. What I will give the anime credit for is the ending, which while a lot of people seem to find problems with, I thought it was just fine. It\'s dramatic, there\'s a certain bitter-sweet aura that I really liked, and hell, even a emotional moment for Slaine at the very end that I thought actually worked. Well, more so than much of anything else in the anime at least.Before I talk about how this second season has changed our two main characters: Slaine and Inaho, I\'ll about the only significant addition to Aldnoah.Zero\'s cast in this season: Princess Lemrina. At first, when she was introduced, I thought she had potential. Her relationship with Asseylum was sort of interesting, as she was jealous of her sister\'s beauty and how she was loved by her people, something that Lemrina would never be able to achieve due to her legs being bound in a wheel-chair and her status as a princess born illegitimately from her father, who was Vers royalty, and an unnamed woman.  This leaves her a sort of bitter and manipulative person, fully aware of how she is despised, and taking that hatred to use for her own advantages, which makes her position as currently impersonating her sister to inflame tensions between both sides of the war sort of unique. However, what really annoys me about her is her nearly blinding devotion to Slaine, which drives her motivation for pretty much everything. And here\'s the fact of the matter: she really has no reason at all to like him so much; he treats her pretty crappy all things considered. She even offers to be a ""replacement for her sister"", if that is what he wants, and none of it just doesn\'t make any sense, because you will always have this burning question of ""why?"" in your head. The anime doesn\'t really have an answer. It has the decency to question this devotion later on, leading to a couple interesting scenes which I won\'t talk about because spoilers, but like most things in the anime, it doesn\'t go much of anywhere.So, let\'s talk about Inaho first. He was a character that I thought could potentially develop into something interesting when the first season ended, because I still had no idea why he was so emotionally repressed, and as a matter of fact, I still don\'t. What could have been interesting is completely ignored, the most we get in terms of development is that he smiles a little more than he used to, and occasionally tells us profound emotional statements with the same blank look on his face. And I appreciate that I guess, but we still have absolutely no reason why he was like this in the first place. Was it because of his parents deaths? Because he tries to be the perfect soldier? We have no idea. And that\'s not good enough.And here\'s the character I\'ve been saving for last, because undoubtedly, Slaine is the star of this second season, as he makes his transition from narrative limbo into a primary antagonist. In hindsight, that\'s something that the anime had been building up to, and rather well at that, there\'s a clear progression in the ruthlessness of his actions, going all the way back to season one. I rather liked it. But the problem with his character is that his motivation as ""the big bad guy"" is practically non-existent. At first, you think it\'s just because he\'s doing everything for Princess Asseylum like always, but in light of events that happen later on, that theory doesn\'t seem to hold much water. I honestly don\'t think Slaine himself or the writers knew what he was trying to accomplish by the end of the series, sure he throws around cliche lines like ""trying to make a better world"", but I don\'t think that really makes sense either. Like many things in this anime, I like the idea of it. You could see what they were trying to go for, a good man following his heart as he tries to do the right thing for the girl he loves, but eventually everything falls apart as he digs himself deeper and deeper into his sins, and in the end isn\'t even sure what he\'s trying to accomplish as now everyone he cared about has turned against him. However, his reasons for ending up how he does by the end don\'t seem justified and logical, and he\'s ultimately flat and uninteresting as a character. Again though, I do like the moment of self-reflection at the end of his arc, even if I can\'t talk about without spoiling the ending of the anime.As for everyone else, well they don\'t really matter. Yeah. All those side characters that the first season built up: Rayet, Inko, Lt. Marito, they don\'t really do crap in this season, so much to the point that I question why they\'re all here in the first place, or why we spent so much time with them in the first season. Another waste. And if you recall, my favorite character of the first season was Princess Asseylum herself: I found her interesting as well as pretty bad-ass when she wanted to be, but again, she\'s in a comatose state for pretty much the entire time so... yeah. Those three characters above are really the only ones you need to worry or care about.Turning to animation, while I never went as far to compare side-by-side, I\'d say the animation is just as high-quality or better than it was in the first season, and that\'s nice to see, when some shows with great animation will cut corners in their second seasons, like Sword Art Online 2. But no, everything looks great, from background, to character designs, to the aesthetics of this futuristic world. The deal-breaker for a lot of people is undoubtedly going to be the mechs rendered in CG. Yes, it doesn\'t look particularly nice, but after two seasons of watching these things, I can say you just get used to them after awhile, it\'s a not a legitimate reason not to watch the show(there\'s plenty of other better reasons not to watch it), because it\'s simply a matter of getting used to them. The fight scenes are rather good too, as now they\'ve moved largely from Earth into space. I\'ve already stated the benefits of space battles(they\'re awesome), but Aldnoah.Zero really uses them to enhance the fight scenes, with the battles seeming to take full advantage of the three-dimensional nature of space, and the various factors of it which come into play during fights.Hiroyuki Sawano has returned to do the music for this second season, and as most sound-tracks he does are, it\'s fantastic. Some might find problems with how often certain tracks are repeated, but those tracks in question are so good that I really didn\'t mind in the slightest. Nothing more to say about the OST: it\'s great. However, special mention must be called to the OP of this season: ""&Z"". You might remember that I altogether wasn\'t too fond of the first season\'s opening: ""Heavenly Blue"", but ""&Z"" is a truly magnificent song, especially the full version, which is exhilarating, exciting, yet somewhat melancholy at times, like it\'s a reflection of all that was lost in the Vers/Earth war. If you close your eyes while listening to it at the start of every episode, you could almost trick yourself into thinking that you\'re watching some epic space opera, but unfortunately when you open them, it\'s always going to be Aldnoah.Zero. I wouldn\'t go as far to say it\'s the biggest reason for watching Aldnoah.Zero 2, but... yeah it is actually.So, here we are, standing at the end of this unfortunate franchise. It\'s all over; undoubtedly, a third season is(hopefully) not in the works; this is what Aldnoah.Zero is at the end of the day, the kind of show that we will look back on years from now. And despite all the promise, despite all the ways it could have succeeded, Aldnoah.Zero\'s second half is equivalent to a slow, sinking decent in mediocrity. Various life-lines appeared during its run: possibly interesting plot-lines and characters, but it failed to grab anything significant, as it sank too fast under its own expectation and incompetence. What is Aldnoah.Zero at the end of the day? A very typical, very mediocre mecha. And that, is a damn shame.Final Verdict: 5/10P.S: I didn\'t know Inaho was Solid Snake.For this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile) communities jokes. But even so, it wasn\'t a terrible anime; at least in my opinion. It had problems, but it was still enjoyable, and even showed an occasional spark that it could be something more then it was, that it could maybe meet those hefty expectations that the community had set for it before it had begun airing. This was my mind-set as we headed into the second, and concluding season of Aldnoah.Zero. It wasn\'t the right one.Hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, and today, we take a look at the second season of Aldnoah.Zero, and maybe we can figure out where it all went wrong. I won\'t be boring you with the studio who animated it or the writers involved, all that information is already available in my review of the first season. What I will tell you is that Aldnoah.Zero 2 is a 12 episode anime TV series that aired between January 10th to March 28th of 2015, airing in that year\'s winter season. Now, let\'s jump right into where we left off in the plot.So, as a slight refresher, where did we leave off? Well, if you recall, everyone was dead. Princess Asseylum had been shot in the head, Slaine had shot Inaho in the face, and now it is 19 months later. The war between Earth and the Vars Empire has continued, though after the events of the finale of the first season, the core pieces have been shuffled, and now everyone stands in different places. Slaine is now a well-respected knight for the Vers Empire, as he has the backing of Count Saazbaum, a penance for Slaine saving the count\'s life at the end of the first season. Slaine, with the help of Count Saazbaum has rescued Asseylum from her certain death on Earth, and now they hold her in permanent status within Ver\'s military base on the moon, unsure whether she will ever wake up from her coma. With the Princess now out of commission and the last chance for peace between Earth and Vers completely gone, Slaine has devised a new way to rally troops against Earth: as now Asseylum\'s half-sister Lemrina impersonates Asseylum, using the princess\' influence to ignite the hatred between Earth and Mars to drive the war effort onward. Slaine in the meantime, works his way up Ver\'s military, with a final goal in mind that only he knows, as he leads the charge against Earth\'s military and gains the support of various counts and knights around Vers. The situation is made even more complicated as Slaine must work through his own personal stigma of being ""a terran"", a fact which places various barriers in the way of his path into a commanding position, and now, Princess Lemrina has started to develop feeling for Slaine, and she could potentially reveal herself as an impostor at any moment out of jealousy of Slaine\'s feelings for Asseylum or if he reject her advances, effectively putting an end to his plans before he even has time to instigate them.On the Earth side of the war,  Inaho has miraculously survived as well, due to some, let\'s be fair, bullsh*t involving Aldnoah.Zero that allowed him get medical attention. Inaho lives on as a soldier, now equipped with a new robotic eye that allows him to perform all kinds of life-hacks(including being able to tell if somebody is lying, scanning distance between targets and make predictions, scan for coordinates(and really this thing is just completely over-powered)). Inaho is the only one who suspects that the current Princess Asseylum is an impostor, and is determined to find where the real princess is and rescue her, even if that means he will be putting himself directly in the way of Slaine Troyard, setting the stage for an inevitable showdown between the two that may determine the fate of the entire war.I suppose I\'ll talk about positives first. As a the plot for a ""second cour"" of a series goes, it could be worse. It has pust both main characters into more commanding roles that allow more radical plot-points to occur, and it does well to recognize that these things must always have a sense of escalation as now most of the battle scenes take place in space, which, let\'s be honest, is pretty awesome no matter what context. But that\'s really all the good I have to say about it. The idea for this second season might have worked, and worked very well,  but ultimately, the execution is so lack-luster that all positives it had just sort of steadily seep out as the anime buries itself deeper under its own stupidness.The inherent problem is probably that the writing really isn\'t that good, rendering all ideas the anime had pretty much pointless. Characters often make stupid or unrealistic decisions that only serve to drive the plot onward, and certain plot-points only occur because of amazing coincidences or logic that fails to hold any sort of weight. I mean guys, are you really telling me that Slaine missed Inaho\'s head from literally point blank range when he shot him at the end of the first season? We all know the only reason Slaine missed is so this ""second cour"" could happen, and so Inaho could get his stupid robotic eye. And another thing, that robotic eye is complete bullsh*t. I don\'t care how smart the show tells us Inaho is, that eye is pretty equivalent to a Geass in terms of unfairness(though to be fair, they do add consequences later on for that plot-point, though it never really goes anywhere). It\'s things like this that make the whole thing hard to take seriously, though Aldnoah.Zero does undoubtedly want you to take it seriously. You can really tell it\'s trying to be an epic space adventure, filled with interesting politics and awesome characters, but... it just isn\'t. It\'s not like, say Valvrave, that pretty much just insulted your intelligence and credibility as an anime fan by just watching it; Aldnoah.Zero legitimately wants you to be pulled into this world, to care about these characters, and to really be on the edge of your seat as events play out. But the writing just can\'t support these good intentions; no matter how good it wants to be, just the act of treating itself like a good anime when it really isn\'t only adds to the stupid factor, and makes the show easier to insult. I don\'t want to insult Aldnoah.Zero. Hell, I still rather like the first season at the end of the day. But it\'s really not doing itself any favors by behaving the way it does, because by doing so, it\'s only going to sink lower and lower down people\'s ""good lists"", when arguably it doesn\'t belong there, at least not as much as some other shows I could mention.But here\'s the last, and maybe even the biggest problem that this second season has: it\'s just sort of boring, and I think I can offer two possible reasons about why it\'s like this. First, if you were to rewind to the pacing of the first season, what you might recall is that it was a little weird. There were two very specific ""highs"" of the series that were exciting and adrenaline pumping, those two moments being the very beginning(or to be more specific, those first three episodes), and of course the very end, where, you know, everyone dies. The space in between was where the first season lost nearly all of its momentum and promise; a space where Inaho just sort of inexplicably beat whatever soldiers the Vers Empire would throw at him, and nothing really happened besides some half-asked attempts to throw in drama(like when Rayet chokes Asseylum in the show, only for Inaho to revive her five minutes later). That\'s what season 2 largely consists of. I don\'t think the reason per say is that it actually is as boring as that mid-section of the first season, but because we\'ve already jumped the shark in terms of dramatic tension. I mean, when you ""kill"" everyone as the finale of your first season, you can\'t really top that can you? Also(and I\'ve mentioned this before in other reviews but whatever), when you sacrifice your narrative integrity, or in this case, ""killing"" all your characters and then bringing them all back literally the next episode, it sort of just renders everything pointless after that. What\'s the point of caring about what happens in this war between Earth and Mars when you feel that anything that you\'re told can be taken right back if the creators feel that is would increase the drama, or have a target audience return for your crappy second season just so they can see what happened.

(Link on profile)', 'Coming from season 1 this season 2 falls slightly short from expectations. No spoiler but story takes a more political scenarios, which some people might not like, including me, but I think is nonetheless required for complete justification. But its becoming somewhat predictable, of you have seen similar anime. Still the fight scenes are incredibly enjoyable. Sound is good, not as good as season 1, art is still great, story as I said slightly falls short. Overall its still a very good anime 2015 has to offer. ', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Something that everyone struggles with are ""blocks."" Maybe it\'s procrastination for that next exam. Or maybe it\'s the comfort of bed instead of the treadmill. Whether it is mental or physical, there are those times where one just doesn\'t want to do whatever it is that needs doing. In other words, there is a lack of motivation. So maybe it\'s the joy your parents would feel by seeing a good grade, or the elation you would have at obtaining that tone body, that motivates you to accomplish that ever elusive goal. Motivation, like those ""blocks,"" is...always present; you just need that initial push to really get going. And Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a prime example for when such motivation is sorely lacking.STORYZero Two (the moniker to be used) takes place several months after the conclusion of the first season. Inaho has miraculously survived, Slaine has climbed the Vers\' ranks, and Asseylum is currently in a coma. Irrespective of their situations, war continues.What Zero Two, like its predecessor, mostly focuses on is the action that permeates much of the show. The space battles, the cool robots, the random technology; it\'s an anime that is entertainment first and purpose second. And for the most part, the anime gets this right. While everyone outside of Inaho is fodder or useless, the range of scenarios that the action encapsulates are wide and varied. Whether it be taking down a Kataphrakt from the Earth\'s orbit or using a multi-lock-on system to eliminate the enemy in a solitary strike, Zero Two is always looking to switch up the formula in order to keep the show both refreshing and fun. There are always two issues that persist through all of the fights, though: Inaho and his robotic eye. Inaho is a ""Gary Stu:"" he\'s infallible, un-killable, and nonnegotiable when it comes to battle. He never has any problems dealing with the enemy (a reason that is never really explained) and thus the skirmishes follow the same pattern and predictability: good guys are losing, Inaho devises plan, and Inaho wins. These repeated events occur at an even higher probability due to his newfound eyeball. Acting as a sort of supercomputer, Inaho\'s already unfair level of tactical skills is amplified by his trusty ocular, making what goes down between Inaho and the enemy seem more like hide-and-seek rather than war.There is another problem that persists, but not between the battles but instead between the seasons. And that is Zero Two\'s inability to properly utilize the very assets that it holds. The show has a lot of material to work with outside of the war, the main cast -- Inaho, Slaine, and Asseylum -- and the overarching plot. But it doesn\'t use any of it for some baffling reason. In fact, it even introduces new facets that go unused. Some easy examples include: Rayet and Marito\'s backstories, perceptions, and ideas; Inko and Magbaredge\'s role in the grander scheme of things; the political subterfuge that exists within both the Earth government and Vers Empire; Lemrina\'s and Maazurek\'s overall influence on the people that they were connected to; and Yuki\'s and Harklight\'s relationship with the person they were ""protecting."" There\'s a lot that is going on, mostly because there is a literal interplanetary space war happening in the background. And subsequently these myriad of relevant plot points are generated, and for good reason; they contain a breadth of potential that the anime can catapult off of. Yet, it never does: such elements stagnate and are sadly wasted by the time the anime finishes.But when the dust settles and the eggs are counted, Zero Two does contain some semblance of theme. Like the introduction stated, motivation is a factor that is omnipresent; it\'s the kind of ""entity"" that allows someone to do or not do an action based upon the amount given. And for our main trio, this idea is displayed nicely enough. Inaho is wholly guided by Asseylum\'s light, and wants nothing more than to make her wishes come true; Slaine\'s motivation is at first Asseylum\'s protection but devolves into a thirst for power; and Asseylum herself discovers through the actions of these two boys that the brokered peace that she had always dreamed about was within her grasp. And this kind of thinking, that motivation takes on multiple forms, is manifest in all parts of the show. The Martian fighters rally to fight for Slaine\'s cause, Yuki and Inko look to support Inaho, and Lemrina is spurred on by Slaine -- the only person who shared even a shred of caring for her. So, while the actual narrative is a package filled with unused goods, Zero Two\'s motivational theme is tried and true.ANIMATIONZero Two\'s art was often quite nice to look at. This is mainly due to the landscapes that the anime found itself in. There were grassy plains with overcast, arid deserts with relevant sand dunes, and dilapidated cities that harbored past transgressions. Alongside the art, the show does a nice job of keeping the choreography of the fights easy to follow due to nice use of the camera. The Kataphrakts\' abilities and the general dueling that occurred never felt overly difficult to read, making these bouts that much more exciting.The character designs for the anime are nothing too notable. It\'s a ""realistic"" setting, so many of the characters are given realistic designs. Of note are Asseylum and Lemrina for their more stand-out dresses and hair styles. But beyond them, the rest of the cast is rather unimpressive, especially in comparison to the art.Actual animation for the show was normally about average. The anime heavily relied on CG, namely with the Katphrakts and the Deucalion. One becomes desensitized to the three-dimensional usage after a time, but when it isn\'t showcasing this kind of animation, the rest is often static scenes with characters talking or lamenting.CHARACTERSZero Two places the majority of its bets on two separate couplings: Asseylum and Lemrina, and Inaho and Slaine.Looking at the pair of princesses, it\'s not immediately obvious who the better of the two is. One was sidelined into a coma and contracted amnesia for three-fourths of the show, while the other saw insignificant progression in her emotional balance. These descriptions fit Asseylum and Lemrina, respectively. The former does nearly nothing for the entire season, with her only act of importance coming through in the way of a radio message. She sees no development, serves no purpose, and has no worth outside of her name. She literally becomes a tool to be used -- for both sides of the war -- whenever the plot sees fit to take her out of the drawer. It\'s an unfortunate outcome that came to be because of her sister; Lemrina\'s inclusion in the story is not only sudden, but a direct byproduct of Asseylum\'s condition. For without the lovable, kindhearted girl, someone had to take her place. Therefore, the sibling does. But instead of being filled with good, Lemrina is filled with evil; her scorn of the position she\'s in, her jealousy of the sister she has, and her feelings of loneliness stir within her the makings of a mentally unstable being. She often talks of the moon base as being ""her home,"" simply because it\'s the only location where things have gone right for her. She\'s accepted, her sister is gone, and Slaine is by her side. Yet, her home, like her character, explodes. By the anime\'s end, while her characterization exists, she, like her sister, means nothing to the story outside of a few radio appearances. In other words, the two are bound both by blood and badness.The second pair is more of a seesaw than a level playing field. Inaho is the all-mighty warrior, the de facto champion of the Earth\'s soldiers. He begins the season compliant of the higher-ups that are guiding their hand, simply engaging in feud after feud to much success. And while Inaho always manipulates the outcome of the fights in his and his comrades\' favor, there isn\'t any manipulation of his actual character. He without a doubt plays the biggest part in regards to everything that goes down, but lacks in personal development. Which might just be a corner he was written into thanks to the writing; his unbeatable status, his ridiculously overpowered eye-friend, and nonexistent emotions make such growth impossible. He cannot be challenged and he cannot be affected; he\'s as much a robot as the machine in his brain.This leads to the higher side of that seesaw. Slaine Troyard is a man with a mission, one that he will do anything he can to accomplish. Initially, this goal was to save Asseylum, to keep her safe. But it slowly morphs into something more sinister: the attainment of absolute power. And this progression in his character makes complete sense; his previous passiveness nearly caused him to lose that which was most dear to him. So, this season, he moves from being reactive to active. Slaine\'s gall gradually grows, and as the people around him note, he no longer acts as a mere cub but as an unrelenting wolf. But as his ruthless behavior begins to amass, his unending bloodlust blinds him. Instead of caring for Asseylum, he cares only for the structure around her; he lies to her, deceives her, and undermines her, all for the sake of ""keeping her safe."" Yet, his actions sacrifice everything that Asseylum not only held dear around her but also held dear in him. And when Slaine realizes the folly of his ways, it\'s too late; he\'s been saved, forced to atone for the sins he mistakenly created. A poetic end for a poetic character.SOUNDThe OP starts with soft singing that accompanies some hard guitar and a simple drum beat. Yet, it works; it\'s catchy and sounds quite pleasant to the ear. The near halfway mark causes the singer to adopt a more prominent role in the piece, with grander singing and more skip-like lyrics. But past this point, the instruments work to overtake the singer, causing the piece to lose its established ""oomph.""The ED is also a strange beast. It is filled with background ambient effects to sound more space-like and mysterious, but drowned out by powerful vocals and more rambunctious drum playing. At the very least, the opening and ending choir-like singing is quite captivating.The rest of the OST contains specific pieces that are quite good, such as the lone female singer that follows along with the show\'s signature beat -- the one obtained from the previous season\'s ED. Others definitely fit the mood for the show, too, such as the slow violins during the tense buildups. The tracks certainly sound like Hiroyuki Sawano composed them, but they don\'t feel like his music. There isn\'t anything from them that is truly memorable or standout, despite everything sounding so nice.As for voice-acting, the cast involved performed somewhere around average. Nobody involved was truly given the opportunity to shine, but Sora Amamiya as Princess Asseylum did a wonderful job capturing that innocently tender way of speaking.ENJOYMENTPart of the reason for watching this one, at all, was in wanting to see where the characters ended up. And upon seeing them all return, that wasn\'t extremely off-putting. Sure, it\'s completely implausible, but getting to watch the main three head toward a conclusion was going to be fun to see.""Was"" is the keyword. For what was given wasn\'t fun, it was lame. Not only is the final ""duel"" between Orange and Bat absolutely boring but Asseylum doesn\'t even end up with either of them, and more specifically the obvious choice in Inaho. I\'m a huge romance guy -- it\'s my favorite genre. So watching her marry some random boy -- after having someone like Inaho chase after her, after giving him a beaded necklace from her, and after she starts to cry as she says, ""I also think of you as a part of myself"" -- is quite infuriating. Maybe his eye mistranslated his feelings towards Asseylum or maybe her decision was circumstantial. But it\'s clear from her and his actions that there was something between the two. And wouldn\'t it have been an even better sign of peace between the two sides if a Terran and a Vers became betrothed instead? Goading people on then forcefully throwing the rug out from under them is not enjoyable; it\'s frustrating.Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season starts off precariously, seems promising throughout its run, but ultimately ends on a very sour note. The story is misshapen, the characters are shoddy, and the rest is lackluster. While Asseylum, Inaho, and Slaine may be smiling by the show\'s end, I most certainly am not.SUMMARYStory: Bad, focused yet predictable entertainment, abundance of unused plot elements, motivational themeAnimation: Fine, nice art style, okay character designs, average actual animationCharacters: Bad, Slaine cannot support how awful Asseylum, Lemrina, and Inaho areSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, good soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, the out-of-left-field ""romance"" is very frustrating to handleFinal Score: 3/10 always present; you just need that initial push to really get going. And Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is a prime example for when such motivation is sorely lacking.STORYZero Two (the moniker to be used) takes place several months after the conclusion of the first season. Inaho has miraculously survived, Slaine has climbed the Vers\' ranks, and Asseylum is currently in a coma. Irrespective of their situations, war continues.What Zero Two, like its predecessor, mostly focuses on is the action that permeates much of the show. The space battles, the cool robots, the random technology; it\'s an anime that is entertainment first and purpose second. And for the most part, the anime gets this right. While everyone outside of Inaho is fodder or useless, the range of scenarios that the action encapsulates are wide and varied. Whether it be taking down a Kataphrakt from the Earth\'s orbit or using a multi-lock-on system to eliminate the enemy in a solitary strike, Zero Two is always looking to switch up the formula in order to keep the show both refreshing and fun. There are always two issues that persist through all of the fights, though: Inaho and his robotic eye. Inaho is a ""Gary Stu:"" he\'s infallible, un-killable, and nonnegotiable when it comes to battle. He never has any problems dealing with the enemy (a reason that is never really explained) and thus the skirmishes follow the same pattern and predictability: good guys are losing, Inaho devises plan, and Inaho wins. These repeated events occur at an even higher probability due to his newfound eyeball. Acting as a sort of supercomputer, Inaho\'s already unfair level of tactical skills is amplified by his trusty ocular, making what goes down between Inaho and the enemy seem more like hide-and-seek rather than war.There is another problem that persists, but not between the battles but instead between the seasons. And that is Zero Two\'s inability to properly utilize the very assets that it holds. The show has a lot of material to work with outside of the war, the main cast -- Inaho, Slaine, and Asseylum -- and the overarching plot. But it doesn\'t use any of it for some baffling reason. In fact, it even introduces new facets that go unused. Some easy examples include: Rayet and Marito\'s backstories, perceptions, and ideas; Inko and Magbaredge\'s role in the grander scheme of things; the political subterfuge that exists within both the Earth government and Vers Empire; Lemrina\'s and Maazurek\'s overall influence on the people that they were connected to; and Yuki\'s and Harklight\'s relationship with the person they were ""protecting."" There\'s a lot that is going on, mostly because there is a literal interplanetary space war happening in the background. And subsequently these myriad of relevant plot points are generated, and for good reason; they contain a breadth of potential that the anime can catapult off of. Yet, it never does: such elements stagnate and are sadly wasted by the time the anime finishes.But when the dust settles and the eggs are counted, Zero Two does contain some semblance of theme. Like the introduction stated, motivation is a factor that is omnipresent; it\'s the kind of ""entity"" that allows someone to do or not do an action based upon the amount given. And for our main trio, this idea is displayed nicely enough. Inaho is wholly guided by Asseylum\'s light, and wants nothing more than to make her wishes come true; Slaine\'s motivation is at first Asseylum\'s protection but devolves into a thirst for power; and Asseylum herself discovers through the actions of these two boys that the brokered peace that she had always dreamed about was within her grasp. And this kind of thinking, that motivation takes on multiple forms, is manifest in all parts of the show. The Martian fighters rally to fight for Slaine\'s cause, Yuki and Inko look to support Inaho, and Lemrina is spurred on by Slaine -- the only person who shared even a shred of caring for her. So, while the actual narrative is a package filled with unused goods, Zero Two\'s motivational theme is tried and true.ANIMATIONZero Two\'s art was often quite nice to look at. This is mainly due to the landscapes that the anime found itself in. There were grassy plains with overcast, arid deserts with relevant sand dunes, and dilapidated cities that harbored past transgressions. Alongside the art, the show does a nice job of keeping the choreography of the fights easy to follow due to nice use of the camera. The Kataphrakts\' abilities and the general dueling that occurred never felt overly difficult to read, making these bouts that much more exciting.The character designs for the anime are nothing too notable. It\'s a ""realistic"" setting, so many of the characters are given realistic designs. Of note are Asseylum and Lemrina for their more stand-out dresses and hair styles. But beyond them, the rest of the cast is rather unimpressive, especially in comparison to the art.Actual animation for the show was normally about average. The anime heavily relied on CG, namely with the Katphrakts and the Deucalion. One becomes desensitized to the three-dimensional usage after a time, but when it isn\'t showcasing this kind of animation, the rest is often static scenes with characters talking or lamenting.CHARACTERSZero Two places the majority of its bets on two separate couplings: Asseylum and Lemrina, and Inaho and Slaine.Looking at the pair of princesses, it\'s not immediately obvious who the better of the two is. One was sidelined into a coma and contracted amnesia for three-fourths of the show, while the other saw insignificant progression in her emotional balance. These descriptions fit Asseylum and Lemrina, respectively. The former does nearly nothing for the entire season, with her only act of importance coming through in the way of a radio message. She sees no development, serves no purpose, and has no worth outside of her name. She literally becomes a tool to be used -- for both sides of the war -- whenever the plot sees fit to take her out of the drawer. It\'s an unfortunate outcome that came to be because of her sister; Lemrina\'s inclusion in the story is not only sudden, but a direct byproduct of Asseylum\'s condition. For without the lovable, kindhearted girl, someone had to take her place. Therefore, the sibling does. But instead of being filled with good, Lemrina is filled with evil; her scorn of the position she\'s in, her jealousy of the sister she has, and her feelings of loneliness stir within her the makings of a mentally unstable being. She often talks of the moon base as being ""her home,"" simply because it\'s the only location where things have gone right for her. She\'s accepted, her sister is gone, and Slaine is by her side. Yet, her home, like her character, explodes. By the anime\'s end, while her characterization exists, she, like her sister, means nothing to the story outside of a few radio appearances. In other words, the two are bound both by blood and badness.The second pair is more of a seesaw than a level playing field. Inaho is the all-mighty warrior, the de facto champion of the Earth\'s soldiers. He begins the season compliant of the higher-ups that are guiding their hand, simply engaging in feud after feud to much success. And while Inaho always manipulates the outcome of the fights in his and his comrades\' favor, there isn\'t any manipulation of his actual character. He without a doubt plays the biggest part in regards to everything that goes down, but lacks in personal development. Which might just be a corner he was written into thanks to the writing; his unbeatable status, his ridiculously overpowered eye-friend, and nonexistent emotions make such growth impossible.

This is simply one series split into two halves*Aldnoah Zero is a mecha anime that pits the forces of the earth against a Martian empire whose technological superiority is underscored by a ruthlessness and pride resemblant of the great empires of earth with centuries of history. The year is 2014, and it has been forty-years years since the Martian empire was founded.Wait.Forty-two years?Okay, let's try this again. Aldnoah Zero is a mecha anime that features plenty of drama, action, and even a hint of romance, but fails to set up its story and characters in a way that any of these...elements can resonate with the viewer. The lead character, Kaizuka Inaho, takes the stereotypical self-insert main character to ridiculous length by having no emotions for the great majority of the series. Meanwhile his rival and series antagonist, Slaine Troyard, is a significantly more human and interesting character, far more so than the rest of the cast. But whereas Inaho's actions are guided by some sort of logic, Troyard's motivations for his absolutely insane schemes are never explained, shown, or slightly conveyed to the viewer in a believable way.Ultimately, it doesn't matter if the Vers empire has existed for forty-two years, forty-two days or forty-two centuries. Either could work if there's some kind of impetus for the conflict presented, something tangible that makes us empathise with the circumstances of both sides. But throughout the entire series, not once are we given some kind of deep glimpse into the Vers Empire. There are a lot of remarks about how the masses of Vers are poor, but we never, ever see them. We only see the handsome knights, soldiers and gleaming technology. So as far the viewer is concerned, the behaviour of Slaine Troyard, the Vers Empire, in fact most of the characters in this decrepit series is inexplicable.When I am getting increasingly bored and frustrated of Aldnoah Zero's boring, creatively frustrated plot, it has a little party trick to pull. Decent fight scenes. Watching Inaho figure out and exploit the weaknesses of the Vers Empire's high-powered mechs is one of very few enjoyable parts of this series. Ultimately, it's just a deus ex machina if you break it down enough, but it means the fight scenes are quite varied and sometimes surprising, even if the overall structure is predictable.Aldnoah Zero is nothing if not well-produced. Having the mechas entirely animated by 3D models is going to be a turn-off for many, but they're quite detailed, the designs are good, and while the animation can seem clunky, the choreography is emphatic. This is also one of the many recent series scored by Hiroyuki Sawano, and while his music often comes across as bombastic, it's distinctive and forms a great accompaniment to the action. Though, while the art and character designs in Aldnoah Zero are decent, the colour palette of the series is cool and miserable, which only serves to mirror the boredom of the plot.Frankly, with a project as large as this, a good presentation is the minimum I expect. This is what Aldnoah Zero is, the minimum of expectations. By refusing to have any kind of personality, whether figuratively in terms of story and setting, or literally in terms of characters, it doesn't offend enough to put its audience off from buying it, but it never elevates itself above mediocrity either. The question is, do I rate this a 5 to acknowledge its workmanlike averageness, or a 3 for not even trying to hide its identity as a cynical monetary franchise? Let's split the difference.Story: 3, Art: 5, Sound: 7, Character: 3, Enjoyment: 4,  Overall: 4 elements can resonate with the viewer.

Inaho is still alive and was revealed to be shot in the eye and has had it replaced with a bionic eye capable of predicting algorithims. Slaine has risen through the ranks and has gained the trust of several Orbital Knights, and continues thier plan to invade earth from the moonbase. Now onto the most annoying MC, Asseylum who spends much of the season...in a comatised state within the moonbase, she wakes up at the ending of the season but has lost her memories. She eventually regains them and during an attack on the moonbase by Terran (Earth) forces, she tries to escape from earth soldiers firing on her. She then bumps into Inaho who falls unconcious before her but his bionic eye takes control telling Asseylum that Inaho had infiltrated the base to get the, she states her feelings towards Inaho and asks him something which isn't seen to the viewer until the last episode.As we get to the last episode, Asseylum takes over from the grandfather's position upon his death, announces her intention for the war to end and that she is to marry Count Klancain (nothing but a character that is used as a plot device). Slaine and Inaho upon hearing that decide to have a final battle, it is also revealed that Asseylum had asked Inaho to save Slaine. Slaine ends up in imprisoned, Asseylum ends up with Klancain and Inaho ends.. well to be honest I don't know.Art - Nicely designed environments and mechas and the battles are nice as well. Character designs aren't too bad either, nothing really worth noting.Sound - The soundtrack is definitely the best thing to do with AZ, brings epicness to the battles as well.Character - I enjoyed the sense of rivalry between Slaine and Inaho but because of the ending all of it seemed rather pointless. I do end up feeling sorry for the both of them and to be honest, after all the two have done for Asseylum, she really does let them down, I can't help but consider her a bi**h.Enjoyment - The battles are enjoyable and the music is brilliant, the art is good but as I have already stated, the ending would most likely let many down.Overall - good but unfortunately stopped from becoming great by a poorly written and rushed ending to the anime in a comatised state within the moonbase, she wakes up at the ending of the season but has lost her memories.

Let\'s stop a moment and think back.Maybe because of the way it\'s directed, you lost track of the important messenger that Aoki wants us to understand: What\'s the cause of war, and how to prevent it.The show simply shows it to us through the story of 3 main characters: Inaho,...Slaine, Asseylum. Inaho believes in his aspect of war ""War is the continuation of negotiation, and it only stops when they get what they want"", Slaine believes in his aspect of war ""War is there because there is someone to go against, and it only stops when that boundary disappear"". Asseylum believes that ""Peace can be achieved when there is no hatred.\'How to prevent war? The series ended with everything return to 0, with the things that would happen in Ep 1 if Asseylum wasn\'t assassinated. Because there is no solution yet, to them, and to us in reality. This peace, again, is a false peace. Throughout the story, many parallels to WWII and Cold War have been made, and also many issues that are debated in Japan about their postwar situation, but let\'s not talk about that, since it would be out of the story.That\'s the basic plot of it, and IMO, the anime has done well in what it wants to tell.The flaw of the anime, but also an unique style of directing, is the ""Talk less, show more"". We don\'t know what characters are thinking, we don\'t know what are their objectives. Everything is so ambiguous, unless you notice everything, the flowers, a tea cup, or a single line. You know the main characters from other characters, from what they say. And like Aoki did say, Slaine is he protagonist of this season, not antagonist, though maybe we see him as one. Why is Slaine interesting? Because out of all people, he is the most hard-to-understand character. He lied everytime, but then it these lies there are truths. Listen to them and the tone of him, figuring out what he really wants is really an art. I understand why people still say ""I don\'t get what\'s Slaine\'s plan"" even after the ending. Because it was never talked out, it doesn\'t mean that there wasn\'t any hint. So I suggest you to watch again. ""Poor written"", maybe, but it\'s surely interesting for me to analyze every single stuff.""Let justice be done, though the heaven falls"" - the motto has been done in the series. Because all characters follow their aspects of war, that they made mistakes and eventually they got their consequence. ""Justice"" here doesn\'t mean ""The right thing"", but ""The thing that you believe in"", whether it\'s right or wrong.I don\'t get why we should compare this series to Guilty Crown, since it\'s not a train-wreck with the story of ""fighting for love"" and finished well what it wants to do. And moreover, I don\'t get why we should compare Slaine to Lelouch, since Lelouch is obviously smarter and all. Slaine can never become Lelouch, because his character is to be the ugly side of war, while Lelouch is the beautiful side of war, though Lelouch\'s way was really surrealism to me.Aldnoah.Zero is the story of reality. Whether you like it or not, this\'s what happening. At least, I think all the characters can start new lives now. Slaine, Asseylum. Inaho believes in his aspect of war ""War is the continuation of negotiation, and it only stops when they get what they want"", Slaine believes in his aspect of war ""War is there because there is someone to go against, and it only stops when that boundary disappear"".

At least, I think all the characters can start new lives now.', ""Goddammit.As an admitted fanboy of the first Aldnoah.Zero season, I was greatly looking forward to this, the second season.But, I'm left with simply a feeling of disappointment.Warning- There may be spoilers.Story- 3Disappointing. That's really all I can say. Even as a fanboy of S1, I'll admit that the story was at most, poor. From the cliffhanger of the first season, I'm not sure what I was expecting, exsctly. Inaho might be missing a few brain cells, or there may be a new main character introduced instead. Even that I would've been fine with.Instead, Inaho is given a new, shiny, Deus ex Machina eye that can...pull off spatial calculations in seconds.Ok, I can work with that.Oh, the eye apparently has a will of its own....I f*cking hate you.The main focus of this season, to me, was mostly slaine. But, I'll get into that in the character sections.Art- 8The art follows the style of the last season.Explosive action scenes with close to flawless use of CG (In my opinion),And all around pretty good art.Sound- 9It's Hiroyuki Sawano.From the seeping vocals to the flawless OST arrangements, the sound is amazing.And that's all I'll say.Characters- 2This is where I really, really wanted to see some improvement.The characters weren't that great (understatement) from S1, so I was hoping that Inaho ' s presumed death might force them to mature in some ways (and we all know how well that went) in addition, the one non-onedimensional character also fell flat.Slaine kidnapped Seylum, and what happens?He puts her in a healing tank of some sort and looks at her.Besides a few moments, he really doesn't have as much development as he did.Enjoyment- 5I'll admit, I enjoyed it for the numbing action scenes, but.. that's about it.Overall- 4Meh.So much potential gone to waste from the first season.It really saddens me. pull off spatial calculations in seconds.Ok, I can work with that.Oh, the eye apparently has a will of its own....I f*cking hate you.The main focus of this season, to me, was mostly slaine.

Why did this happen? I know season 1 wasn\'t necessarily a masterpiece, but you could at least make the case that it had clear intentions, contrived as its methods tended to be. Here\'s it\'s a gigantic car crash at the beginning and end, occupied by a lot of nothing of note happening! What happened to all the big moments that season 1 was peppered with? What happened to letting characters sometimes have backstories or anything that could help them somewhat resemble actual characters rather than caricatures (not that the antagonists of the first...season weren\'t caricatures anyway)? What happened to the wonky action scenes that often used actual movement and terrain to its advantage sometimes? How do you shit the bed this hard?Oh wait, it\'s the second season of a mecha anime that already had some major scriptwriting issues that were bound to worsen as the series progressed. That explains everything! Geass R2 (ok that might be unfair cuz R2 ain\'t anywhere near as bad as this show), 00 Season 2, SEED Destiny, meet your new best friend as I proceded to beat the ever-living shit out of him!The first episode is literally just a baffling cop-out of the first season\'s ending. It\'s an actually incomprehensible middle finger and one of the worst first episodes I have ever witnessed. Both Inaho who got shot in the head at point-blank range and Asseylum who was shot by a VERS version of a shotgun in the head, are still alive with no major head or brain damage. Count Saazbum, despite being riddled with bullets, is alive, and Slaine takes both him and Princess Asseylum with him, and everyone just fucks off and rejoices, except Slaine who goes nuts throughout the course of the season. The finale of the first season was a horrendous cliffhanger that already relied on terrible melodrama and arbitrary sequences to sell itself, but actively undercutting everything it tried to accomplish is not at all a good way of trying to ""make up for it"".1 and 1/2 years later, Slaine has gone through the ranks of the VERS people, and with a now seemingly evil Asseylum leading, he feels that it is his turn to take charge and eliminate the humans of Earth to make it their new home. Inaho, and the rest of that military he was in, continue the battle, with little having being changed. The rest of the show until the finale is just Slaine rising through the ranks and Inaho taking down more VERS and keeping one prisoner to help him find Asseylum. Better than the first episode which has more plot holes that Saazbum had bullet holes, but a meandering mess where almost nothing of value happens. The finale just turns into this mush of obscene melodrama and rushed circumstance because they wanted to get the war over quickly and cut to everything and everyone having a mostly happy ending without the proper time necessary to devote itself to showing us a sense of proper reconstruction and consequences of the war\'s end. It\'s a baffling nightmare that makes me wish I was watching the final arc of Macross instead.Inaho and Slaine are the actual worst here, which is an accomplishment given how terrible Inaho was last season. Inaho continues to be a ridiculously overpowered tofu MC except with less arbitrary douchebaggery towards Slaine and more robo eyes because he really needed to cement himself as superhuman. Slaine is the ultimate angsty, melodramatic pile of shit who just screams blood, cries, and vows for vengeance without having any concrete character or even having his progression naturally link up with the first season in practice. There\'s so little to mention regarding any of the other characters either. There\'s nothing going for any of them outside of the camaraderie some of Slaine\'s lackey\'s towards the end of the series share. It\'s a neat gesture, but it\'s too little, too late. Everything else is just a black void that somehow trumps even the abysmal writing of the narrative.Visually, the show suffers compared to its predecessor as well. The CGI was never good, but the mechs tended to be surrounded by large objects in the first season so they facilitated movement and covered up some of the faults that were present. Here, empty space everywhere, both on Earth and in space! That means we get to see the awful CG mechs in full glory, just hovering most of the time. The 2D artwork is still solid, however. Sadly, it\'s wasted on pretty mediocre character designs that don\'t tend to have too much movement during most of the action scenes because TROYCA\'s awful CG (maybe it was A-1 Pictures, I wouldn\'t be too surprised) needed do be dragged around all the time. There\'s significantly more actual animation when the characters are running around doing their own escort missions or hanging out than during the battles themselves. It\'s pretty, but that\'s all there is.The dub was ultimately one of the only saving graces of the show, even with some of its star players such as Patrick Seitz gone. That said, the dub is once again overshadowed by the show\'s OST which comes with several new insert tracks and bombastic background tracks to marvel at. There aren\'t too many new additions and the new tracks aren\'t quite as good as ""No Differences"" from season 1, and perhaps this isn\'t one of Hiroyuki Sawano\'s best OSTs, but it\'s still one of the highlights of this miserable series. The opening, ""&Z"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki, is a stellar track that builds up a sense of tension and melancholy before launching into a bombastic sequence that hypes you up for each disastrous episode. The main ED, ""GENESIS"" by Eir Aoi isn\'t as great as what came before, especially when it goes from emotional to sorta plain in the chorus, but it\'s still a nice song to listen to. The penultimate episode\'s ending theme, ""Harmonious"" by Asseylum Vers Allusia starring Sora Amamiya, is a lot more emotionally resonant, really representing the emotional climax the penultimate episode wants to have.It\'s been several years since I\'ve seen it, and I still remember how much of a disappointment Aldnoah.Zero was. After season 1 fell apart, season 2 decided to trample over any good will that was left before meandering for 10 episodes and then crashing and burning in spectacular fashion again. It\'s amazing to witness how easy it became to get disillusioned with this franchise by this season if the previous one didn\'t already do the trick. It\'s like witnessing a car crash and wondering if the people survived only for the wreckage to explode at the very end! It\'s amazing! I wouldn\'t say I despised this season, but it really was a gigantic misfire that imploded in on itself. This second season makes the first look like Turn A Gundam, and that comparison is honestly fitting if you\'ve seen both A.Z and Gundam. If nothing else, it was entertaining to see the community react the way it did to this mess. Still, watching and talking about the show is honestly tiresome, and that right there speaks volumes of this dumpster fire more than its catastrophic first episode ever will. season weren\'t caricatures anyway)?

Like me *facepalm*"", 'I have somewhat a bias towards Aldnoah.Zero S2 because of the fact that it is the first anime I have watched in about 2 months. That being said, Aldnoah.Zero is an extremely entertaining and satisfying series, if bit here and there were a bit dissapointing. I\'ve said in my review of Aldnoah.Zero S1 that I wouldn\'t have minded not having a sequel at all, and I still stand by that. However, this series was pretty great too. My one major problem with this anime is that it basically disregards everything the first season tried to set up. Everyone is still alive (*sad face*) and the...one good part of Inaho\'s character (he\'s actually smart) is completely overrided by his new magical super eye. Most of the character development was halted, and each of the character arcs seem to have magically vanished, which was only a let-down to me looking back on it, but a let-down none the less. Those of the supporting cast who do seem to get some kind of closure in their development seem to have gotten it during the 19 month time skip between the series. The show instead focuses on one man and his rise and fall: Slaine. In the first series and the beginning of the second, I was on team Slaine, and in this second season there was nothing more satisfying than watching Slaine actually do something right. I believe in the Crunchyroll comments this was described as ""getting Slaine\'d"", which I found very appropriate. More towards the middle of the series he turns into something very near an antagonist. I also liked the character of Lemrina, as she very much reminded me of Slaine in the first season, only slightly more lucky. The biggest triumph of this series to me would be the lack of climax. Okay, let me explain. There is indeed a climax, but not anything one would expect from a mecha anime. It\'s an unexpected turn in the story and it was very satisfying on a character perspective. However, to all of you meatheads who watch anime only for epic large-scale battles who think character development is Goku learning a new Super-Saiyan form, you will be dissapointed by this series. My favorite part of this anime was how it ended, but it left too many things open. I kind of want to see a series of OVAs that take place during the 19 month long time skip to actually develop some characters. one good part of Inaho\'s character (he\'s actually smart) is completely overrided by his new magical super eye.

But after wanting to watch something new I started with Aldnoah Zero. I loved how the story was about war,Sci-fic and the individual characters in the anime. I really enjoyed the whole season until the end where the main protagonists the princess and Inaho died. Of course I immediately continued with the second season and found that they were actually alive. This gave me hope again which let me continue watching.Story (7/10) : The story was perfect. Everything was interesting and understandable to  people that had watched the first...season while paying attention. It might have been odd that the second season took place 19 months after the end of season one, but that didn't pose much of a problem. The sad and point-decimating point however was the ending of the anime in which the princess married a different Knight that had not even appeared in season 1. I would have personally preferred that she ended up with Inaho or Slaine. Speaking of Slaine. He really stepped up his game-plan and (to me) seemed like the main protagonist. In my opinion well done.Art (10/10) : There is not much to say about the Art. The space battles were pretty good and the quality amazing.Sound (10/10) : The Sound was perfect too. The voicing was well done and the Soundtrack even beat some Soundtracks of season 1.Character (9/10): Character design was really good. I loved how they portrayed Slaine and his desire for power and of course the princess. They also did a good job portraying the other characters so once again-Well done!-So overall the anime received an 8/10 from me. I dont know whether this ending occurred in the manga/light novel. An alternate ending would have been better though!!

At the time of writing this review, I have compelted watching the series. This review might be a little late, but do take a look and see what I think about it and give me some pointers as well on my Afterthoughts blog post on my profile so we can discuss and at the same time, let me improve on writing reviews so I can come up with better ones next time.I\'ll put this section here early in case you guys miss it. Do visit my blog section on my profile after reading my review for...an Afterthoughts pertaining to this particular Anime for some healthy discussion. Thanks!Here goes:1) Story (3/10)- At this point, you would probably have finished watching the first season of this Anime. You wouldn\'t understand what was going on if you delved straight into the second season without watching the first. Read between the lines here. What I actually meant is that the story is kinda complicated and twisted in the fact that you have a war between Terrans and Martians and yet the one leading the Martians later on in the series is actually a Terran. Like I\'ve said before, if you didn\'t watch the first season before starting on the second, you wouldn\'t understand what was going on.Having loopholes in the story doesn\'t help as well. First season aside, the second one is another one where unless you are set up to intentionally be killed, you will never die. Not specifically mentioning scenes, there are points  in the Anime where characters get shot in seemingly vital areas, yet live.2) Art (7/10)- In all honesty, this area of the Anime is one of its saving graces. In a Mecha Anime, you\'d expect the fighting scenes to be well illustrated, with the machinery, gunshots and whatnot to be well depicted.Take what I said with a pinch of salt, though. Even though I mentioned that the art was pretty decent, there were also some Kataphrakt designs that were ridiculously not in-line with their ability. If you didn\'t know before, every Count has a Kataphrakt that is associated with a special ability that is unique from the others. How they are not in-line, I will leave that up to your imagination as you watch the series.3) Sound (8/10)- Another one of the areas in which I would watch the Anime for. Sound choices pertaining to whenever fighting was about to start was pretty apt and generic music choices were good too. One point to note is that the overuse of the same music whenever the two main characters, Kaizuka Inaho and Slaine Troyard, were about to go into an epic 1v1 battle will sound boring to those who have heard it multiple times.4) Character (5/10)- Passable in the sense that I was worried about how Inaho would develop as a character in the second season after getting shot in the head in the first. The same goes for Slaine, as well as Count Saazbaum. Saazbaum was a bit of a disappointment as [START OF SPOILER] he was killed off early by Slaine [END OF SPOILER] so he didn\'t have much time to develop. Inaho and Slain, on the other hand, were given the entire season to develop as I must say that I am somewhat disappointed as well. Sure, both of them have had big advances in their area as to the things they are able to do and their individual skill in controlling their respective Kataphrakts, but what they were able to do with them is disappointing.5) Enjoyment (6/10)-Despite the low score on the Story section, I actually enjoyed the Anime series as a whole. Action was good; the fight scenes were nothing too incredible but not bad at the same time. Interaction among the characters, not just the main ones, were pretty decent as well. There were some, but not too much, of those cheesy scenes whereby ""All right guys, we\'re at a disadvantage here. We need to band together through our strong feelings and we\'ll be able win.""6) Overall (5/10)-Overall, I find the second season mediocre at best. If you\'ve come to watch it because of the first season, then why not just go all the way and watch the second one as well. I personally wouldn\'t recommend the second season of an Anime to a person who hasn\'t watched the first, but if you\'re simply jsut a big fan of mecha Anime, why not? an Afterthoughts pertaining to this particular Anime for some healthy discussion. Thanks!Here goes:1) Story (3/10)- At this point, you would probably have finished watching the first season of this Anime. You wouldn\'t understand what was going on if you delved straight into the second season without watching the first. Read between the lines here. What I actually meant is that the story is kinda complicated and twisted in the fact that you have a war between Terrans and Martians and yet the one leading the Martians later on in the series is actually a Terran. Like I\'ve said before, if you didn\'t watch the first season before starting on the second, you wouldn\'t understand what was going on.Having loopholes in the story doesn\'t help as well. First season aside, the second one is another one where unless you are set up to intentionally be killed, you will never die. Not specifically mentioning scenes, there are points  in the Anime where characters get shot in seemingly vital areas, yet live.2) Art (7/10)- In all honesty, this area of the Anime is one of its saving graces. In a Mecha Anime, you\'d expect the fighting scenes to be well illustrated, with the machinery, gunshots and whatnot to be well depicted.Take what I said with a pinch of salt, though. Even though I mentioned that the art was pretty decent, there were also some Kataphrakt designs that were ridiculously not in-line with their ability. If you didn\'t know before, every Count has a Kataphrakt that is associated with a special ability that is unique from the others. How they are not in-line, I will leave that up to your imagination as you watch the series.3) Sound (8/10)- Another one of the areas in which I would watch the Anime for.

U DUN FKD IT UP.MINOR SPOILERS, nothing that will surprise you.Aldnoah Zero basically had the setup of Code Geass, Slaine = Lelouch , Lemnrina = CC .The first season is relatively average, Inaho going seed mode every-time and destroying every enemy in their ``vastly superior mechs`` , Slain not having much screen time sadly.The second season goes like this, skip everything to do with Inaho and his crew of generically boring friends. Enjoy watching what Slaine will do next.Each episode...goes from 20 to 8-10 minutes of just watching Slaine and his Orbital Knights in action, literally the BEST part of the anime, Inaho pales incredibly had in comparison, it`s utterrly astonishing that they copied and pasted what he did from the 1st season instead of focusing on Slaine.At the last few ep`s Slaine totally loses his drive, his princess is in another castle, boo fkn hoo ._.Minor spoiler here.Asselyum basically announces that she`s married some random Orbital Knight and want`s everyone to stop fighting, Slaine gives up. What he shouldve done is use his `Fake Princess`Lemrina and have her accuse the other one of being a fake all while being beside Slaine who would order his followers to continue their mission.Bam, a stroke of genius from Slaine and the anime keeps going in a fking great direction instead of the train wreck it turned into.The scriptwriters should`ve been replaced with someone competent.- Slaine was the best character, could`ve been better- Inaho was overbearingly boring, shouldve stayed dead- Whoever directed this was a moron.I rest my case. goes from 20 to 8-10 minutes of just watching Slaine and his Orbital Knights in action, literally the BEST part of the anime, Inaho pales incredibly had in comparison, it`s utterrly astonishing that they copied and pasted what he did from the 1st season instead of focusing on Slaine.At the last few ep`s Slaine totally loses his drive, his princess is in another castle, boo fkn hoo ._.Minor spoiler here.Asselyum basically announces that she`s married some random Orbital Knight and want`s everyone to stop fighting, Slaine gives up.

Some might say that episode 1\'s revival of the main cast is bullshit. If you just call it plot armour that like 99.9% of anime out there have, you can deal with it better.-------Story-------The plot of this season was somewhat twisted. Slaine took a 180 degree turn and became the main antagonist for a reason that is deep and shall not be spoiled by me. There are as much moments of frustration when you wished something to happen and it took a left turn and crashed down the chasm. Most of the plot devices are somewhat explained in this season...though. The ending was one of the best and most complete ending I have ever seen for awhile.--------Art---------The animation used in battles was phenomenal. Each battle scene would take your breath away and when you thought its the end, the final battle between Slaine and Inaho is even better. Definitely worth watching just for the battle scenes. You wont see another mech battle with such amazing animation anytime soon.-------Sound-------What? There is music? Basically it blends so nicely and emphasises each scenes to bring out its excitement that I dont even notice its there.-------Character-------Most of the characters are more or less well developed. Some of the Counts seem to not have any back story or just a one episode description of their story.Slaine\'s character... You can call him the typical ""Twisted"" antagonist where he do something thinking he was right and at the final turn, crushed by his most important friend saying something that turns him completely. Only thing is, the twisted part is REALLY twisted.--------Overall---------Go watch it. You may end it at season 1\'s ending and call it quits. Its a good ending. But Season 2\'s ending is better. If I was to judge, Season 2 has weaker characters but stronger plot. Well. Stronger in the sense of the ending though.

The combat was very enjoyable to watch but alike its predecessor, the story and characters kind of lacked substance. It seems that the writers were trying to evoke emotions out of Slaine, but you really just don't care enough about the story to feel empathy. There's nothing thought provoking about this season either, so you're really just here for the soundtrack and combat. "", ""I had high hopes for Season 2 and it actually did not disappoint me. The characters were good,but, the main character being a bit dull on emotions was one let down. And the biggest let down was the princess (not going to spoil anything for anyone).End could've been different, more like a happy ending. The ending was,well, it disappointed me. Felt like everything was kinda rushed. Fights were good enough and the story line was good as well.Hence,9/10 from me. ;)If you've watched S1 and not sure about watching the S2, then I'd say... go ahead and watch it. It's worth watching. All the...excitement builds up to the max and it's just that good. excitement builds up to the max and it's just that good."", ""Story (7/10) : The story was perfect. Everything was interesting and understandable to people that had watched the first season while paying attention. It might have been odd that the second season took place 19 months after the end of season one, but that didn't pose much of a problem. The sad and point-decimating point however was the ending of the anime in which the princess married a different Knight that had not even appeared in season 1. I would have personally preferred that she ended up with Inaho or Slaine. Speaking of Slaine. He really stepped up his game-plan and (to me) seemed like...the main protagonist. In my opinion well done.Art (9/10) : There is not much to say about the Art. The space battles were pretty good and the quality amazing.Sound (10/10) : The Sound was perfect too. The voicing was well done and the Soundtrack even beat some Soundtracks of season 1.Character (8/10): Character design was really good. I loved how they portrayed Slaine and his desire for power and of course the princess. They also did a good job portraying the other characters so once again-Well done!-So overall the anime received an 8/10 from me. I dont know whether this ending occurred in the manga/light novel.

So as I look at the written reviews - there are so many 2s, 3s and 4s - I was thinking was the anime that bad? Had I lost 12 hours of my life watching a piece of unwatchable junk? What I can't understand is if people think it's worth a 2 or a 3 - why keep going? Why bother finishing it and wasting more time if it was that bad? Are there so many masochists with nothing better to do than watch...bad anime after which they write scathing reviews, resulting in even more time wasted?Obviously the answer is that the greater the promise, the more crushing the disappointment. And that is the problem with Aldnoah.zero (I will be reviewing the entire series - both 1 and 2 together). To be fair, it is a beautifully animated  and scored series with nothing to fault the character design or the setting. It promised much in the first 5 episodes of season 1 (some minor spoilers will be present).Starting off with some death and destruction - we see one of the school friends killed quite early on and also Rayet's father killed setting the stage for some potentially epic and emotional scenes which however never materialised. The series is entertaining enough but it never quite matched the early promise. No one else significant dies in the whole rest of the series and there are multiple plot lines which teases the audience only to slap them in the face, almost literally.It's like falling for the girl, thinking she also likes you, leaning in for a kiss then you open your eyes and she's gone off with some random stranger instead. That basically sums up the ending. You are left thinking, what the hell is going on here? Am I really watching the show I thought and hoped I was watching? It's just so disappointing to see a series promise so much just crush itself by inconsistent plot 'twists' and character actions.I picked this series up because it just appeared on the Australian Netflix and I certainly don't regret it. It is entertaining enough to keep you involved but man, it could have been so much more. Greatness comes in small increments and by degrees. It's a real shame that the ending just lacked so much emotional impact and was anticlimactic in the extreme. For more epic endings watch gurenn lagann or my favourite code geass.In summary - if you are a big fan of mecha, sci fi action - Aldnoah is fun and entertaining. A score of 7 is fair because it's definitely not abysmal. Yet I do understand why so many people are upset because if only they had changed a few elements, e.g. an ending with asseylum picking inaho only to have him die heroically or if only inko was used properly as a romantic interest - this would have been an awesome anime. Looking at it objectively, there are a number of other anime which are definitely better overall but I think for a superficially fun time but ultimately hollow experience you can certainly give this anime a shot. bad anime after which they write scathing reviews, resulting in even more time wasted?Obviously the answer is that the greater the promise, the more crushing the disappointment.

At face value aldnoah.zero season 2 appears to be a mess of plot holes and out-of-character development, but if you enjoyed season 1 enough to pay close attention,  the characters actions, while irrational, are not entirely unexpected.The three main characters all represent a particularly singular trait, mostly in relation to the war. Inaho: the logical, Asseylum: the pacifist, and Slaine: the emotional.Inaho's drives remain logical ones, only wanting to end the war as soon as possible to keep his friends safe. He harbors no ill-will and hatred born from battle isn't something he submits to.Asseylum's would do anything for peace, except mass murder. Asseylum's drive as a character remains the same, but some burdens of war attach themselves to her.Slaine's endless emotional trauma continues to chip away at him. His character development is by far the most drastic. His goal of ensuring Asseylum's safety relies on him piling up bodies causing  him to lose pieces of his gentler self bit by bit, and in doing so loses the part of him that Asseylum is fond of.My biggest complaint is the shows overly rushed ending and surface explanations for some of the events in between seasons 1 &2, as well as the final 2 or 3 episodes. This anime shows a lot without explaining everything. Sometimes that serves to benefit the show, but other times, as in its final moments some more character dialogue and interaction would have been much more satisfying. I think after 25 episodes of robot fighting it could have chilled out for one episode to just have the characters all sit down and talk. All in all it leaves far too much up to open interpretation and honestly I want another season on the political ramifications on the outcome.  It's one of those gloss over endings that kept the action going until the last possible moments.This anime tends to rub salt in the wounds it creates(as most reviews for this anime demonstrate) but if you enjoy the feeling of a show affecting you emotionally, whether that be in anger, sadness, or frustration, then I highly recommend it.

There is no character growth or development (unless you count surgical ones). This counts for most of the main characters who all seem to lack any credible depth in their personalities. You just don't really care for any of them, and the ones that are slightly interesting just get sidelined. Slaine on the...other hand, gets written to be some poor man's Lelouch, trying to gain power with his brilliant keikaku. He is probably the only character with some development but he just becomes so unlikable because he just acts like an illogical dick most of the time. Death is cheap in this series, and it really brought it down for me. I am not sure if there was some studio meddling that happened between the seasons, but there just seemed to be no real climax after a good plot build up in season 1. I am going to say the saving grace for this show was the art style and music. You're unlikely to get too invested in the story or the characters. In summary, it's basically a show that is okay to watch while in between seasons or episodes of better shows. other hand, gets written to be some poor man's Lelouch, trying to gain power with his brilliant keikaku.

In summary, it's basically a show that is okay to watch while in between seasons or episodes of better shows."", 'Now then, well to start?I suppose I will start with the good.Sounds 7/10I enjoyed a handful of the score immensely but at the same time almost none stuck.aLIEz is probably the song from the whole show, while rest just blur with one another and the moments of silence had more impact on me.Art 6/10The art is the same quality more or less, although in couple scene the frame rate and quality of animation should be greater, with one of the most notable scene with those issues being one with Inaho and Slaine on the beach.The CGI of the mechs was okay in the space scene...but when put next to buildings on Earth made them look plastic and comparable to CGI used in Initial D.Characters 3/10The main problem of the show is that the main cast is quite week. An average viewer starts to emphasize with Slaine after all the ordeals he goes through but his character is ruined as the anime progresses. There is also the fact that the Inaho\'s squads appears to be protected by the plot armor as none of the is even close to death, despite the fact that they have to go around without Inaho\'s tactical brilliance for 18 months + the duration of season one, unlike the Orbital Knights.Inaho 2/10Everyone jokes that he is emotionless since season one and rightfully so. For a split second the anime tries to mislead viewer that he got character upgrade as well as cybernetic upgrade, as Inko comments on him making a small talk, but in the end he is as emotional as ever. He generally shows his emotions only around his sister Yuki and Princess Asseylum, since the anime still tries to use this weak excuse for a romance similarly to Sword Art Online. While his tactical abilities in the first season could easily shutter the suspension of disbelief of viewers, his cybernetic eye takes the cake. The eyes is able to, among other things, map out the whole moon station despite not having any kind of access to the system, has zoom allowing to not only see battle on Moon from Earth, despite the fact that this kind of thing cannot be achieved with very specialized lenses, assess the enemy\'s geographical location without satellites. Had such technology been available to humans, they would actually have a read fighting chance against Marsians as they are also surprised at the Inaho\'s abilities, although they do not know it\'s mainly made by the cybernetic eye. Inaho is quite a hypocrite as well as he suggest Inko not to fight, despite the fact that seconds before his own sister asked him the same thing and he refused.Speaking of the cybernetic eye, Inaho is quite the hackers since he upgraded the provided software for his own means. Good to know.While I always like Inaho\'s design as it makes him look more like a side character then lead, his ""tactical abilities"" are the only thing that gives Earthlings upper hand despite they far worse mech and spaceship technology. Deucalion boosted their defense as well, but the military mostly operates using Inaho\'s brilliance.Cybernetic Eye 6/10Considering that it learned to lie, it went through more character development that the main character. But it\'s ability to detect lies is just as questionable as other crazy things it can do, as stress patterns can be caused by multitude of factors such as fear, disgust or anger.Slaine 7/10Since Slaine has won multiple hearts of fans throughout the 1st season, being treated like a scum, betrayed by ""Orange"" just because, tortured and belittled, it wasn\'t surprising that he basically became star of the show. I found myself actually wanting the Martians to win, considering how little I cared for the Earthlings. It was interesting to see him go from a fierce protector of the princess to actually finding motivation to conquer the Earth even if it went against his princess\'s wishes. Had he remained loyal to his ideals I would have ranked him higher, but considering how quick he was to abound his plan and go suicidal mode I couldn\'t help but feel disappointed. He did however become a better tactician that was more believable that what Inaho has been pulling off those two seasons, and even when his plan doesn\'t turn out the way he planned, he is able to turn the outcome to his favor.<Spoilers>Princess Asseylum 2/10Apart from forgetting everything that have happened in season one, she had the chance to get an interesting spin on her character, but since the only thing that she did recall was seeing bird with Inaho, I guess the power of boner...I mean lady boner was stronger. She display the same level of naïveté as in season one, but at least she took active part in fighting against her own people then. I hoped that she would take at least some responsibility for her actions, considering how kindhearted she is but it seems it only extends towards Earthlings.Klanclain plot/10Considering how suddenly and out of place he felt, I can\'t really say much about him other than he was a plot device. In one episode we see him traveling to meet Slaine with almost childlike friendliness and curiosity, the other he is off marrying the princess. If the writers needed some to seal the deal, they might have as well used Mazuurek as he was given actual character development and similar character traits to Asseylum. Klanclain is pretty much prince charming arriving to save the die out of nowhere.Mazuurek 6/10Speaking of Mazuurek, he was definitely one of the most flashed out characters, especially among Orbital Knights, but in the end he was delegated to the sidelines more or less. The fact how easily he trusted Inaho is something hard to swallow however. Had Mazuurek knew the princess personally at least to some extend, which clearly he has not, it would be more believable that he considers Inaho\'s suggestion worth investigating, especially how Slaine was keeping her away from everyone. Then again, he might just be as naive as the princess. Fukuyama Jun did a good job with his character as well, so I was glad that he didn\'t die in two episodes like other Orbital Knights tend to.Harklight 8/10I actually found him the most appealing out of whole Martian cast. Especially after he went ahead and returned to Slaine\'s side and thus directly going against his orders, which in turn inspired Slaine not to give up without a fight. Although I don\'t always like Hirakawa Daisuke\'s performance *cough* Itou Makoto *cough*, he shined in this particular role.Eddelrittuo 8/10It was interesting to see her attitude change towards Slaine in comparison to season one. She definitely gained more maturity and understood Slaine better than someone who was friends with him for five years - Asseylum.Lemrina plot/10Lemrina showed up kind of nowhere (I even joked after seeing the first season that Orbital Knights are silly for trying to eliminate Asseylum unless she has a sister hidden away somewhere) similarly to Klanclain and pretty much behaved the way I expected her too. I ended up liking her more that Asseylum since she had more depth despite being essentially a plot device.The rest of the cast remained the same, without any major changes to their character. Since they haven\'t much to being with, they interactions were simply mundane. Inko had potential to go in an interesting direction, but the power of lady boner she has for Inaho stopped her dead in the tracks.Story 3/10There is so much wrong with the plot, I can\'t even. Putting aside the obvious plot devices such as Cybernetic Eye, Lemrina and Klanclain, the final outcome is simply unbelievable. It\'s impossible for the Orbital Knights who were there just to fight, not counting the ones that were there for resources like Mazuurek, they wouldn\'t stand down simply because the princess said so. The show even points it out, but as soon as she takes the rains completely suddenly everyone decides to chill, of course fighting for ""earth scumbag"" was something that most of them didn\'t want in the first place but considering how trigger happy most of them are, it\'s came across as very unrealistic. The fact that Slaine immediately abounds his own plan, even after Lemrina shows him support was out of character as well. Slaine was at the point when he was going to do anything to achieve his goals: lying, killing, putting his princess in a cage, simple announcement of marriage should be something to steel his resolve. Besides, why he couldn\'t use Lemrina to counter princess\'s speech? There is no way of distinguishing between the two and as long as he would use a pirated signal like the real one did, everyone would be confused as to what is real. The fact that he stood up didn\'t prove anything as we have seen Lemrina stand as well.Let\'s also talk about Asseylum\'s with to save Slaine. In what world is keeping someone, who basically destroyed everything in his path and was willing to die, alive is the merciful thing to do? He has no way of redemption. He was pronounced that and he cannot do anything other than live in prison for the rest of his life. It makes me actually wonder if Inaho didn\'t keep him alive for his own reasons, but told Asseylum that he put him out of his misery. Considering how he back stabbed Slaine in season one and would have shot him if Slaine wasn\'t first to pull the trigger, I wouldn\'t be surprised.</spoilers>Personal Enjoyment 2/10The main reason why I had hard time fully enjoying that show is that I felt that my intelligence was being insulted. Recognizing that someone posing as the Princess in the first episode was as not surprising for me as the fact that the Nilokeras must not have the barrier on joint point and feet or that Mazuurek\'s mech has to be attacked from the top. The same goes for pretending to be Lemrina. As soon as she asked Slaine ""Would you mind explaining yourself"" it was obvious that it wasn\'t her. Those moments that were supposed to make me ""no way!"" simply ended up annoying me to bits. The only moment when I did end up surprised was when Slaine figured Herschel\'s weakness.It was simple done better in different anime.Want thick political plot, good mech fights, great character development?Go watch Code Geass or Gundam series.

At least you won\'t be disappointed.', 'As this is the second cour for the show Aldnoah.Zero, I will assume you have already seen the first half, but not the second. Going off this basis I will partially discuss major plot lines that occur within the first cour of the show. If you actually plan on wasting your time with the first and possibly the second cour after my (and many others) warning against such a path, I would suggest you find another review. Though I honestly don\'t know why you\'d want to, as there are far many other mecha anime out there that both look better and are presented better. But...without further ado, here is my take on Aldnoah.Zero\'s second cour.Story: 3/10Picking up nineteen months after the first half, we find not much has really changed on a whole. We discover that Slain is now a knight under Count Saazbaum. Princess Asseylum is in a bacta tank recovering from her gunshot wound at the end of the first cour, and is thus comatose. Finally, we find that Kirit- I mean Inaho, is not dead and now has a supercomputer in place of his eye, as he was shot in the face at the end of the first half. It appears almost nothing has happened in the last nineteen months, as the war is still on, but none of the characters have changed, or have changed so little its unnoticeable. All major developments have been stalled, and it seems like the only purpose for this time skip was to make it more dramatic when Asseylum inevitably wakes up, making the time skip wholly unnecessary.Without spoiling anything that occurs in the second cour, this show story clearly had a lot potential, as The Urobutcher himself created the original concept and first episode. Being a big fan of Urobuchi anime, (Psycho-Pass, Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, to name a few) this show had a lot going for it. However, with constant nonsensical character developments, and the walking Deus Ex Machina of an MC, we get a very unpolished product. This show had a direction, but it felt like the directors wrote the story into a corner, and instead of re-writing it, they just had Kiri- I mean Inaho, fix all the problems magically. While this is less annoying in the second half and more realistic due to the introduction of Cortana in the form of Inaho\'s left eye, it\'s still extremely annoy to watch the supposedly vastly inferior Earth forces constantly overpower and win out over the technologically superior Martian invading forces, because some kid is far too intelligent for his age.Art: 4/10While the art is not godawful, for a mecha show, you expect your mechas to look nice. But when they are just mechas are all CG all the time, they look very choppy and out of place with the rest of the characters. The characters themselves are pretty boring, and only have a couple of unique features, but for the most part just look like your average KyoAni esque anime character. (Note, I realize Kyoto Animation did not animate this show, that\'s just the name I\'ve given to characters that look like this, as they might as well be KyoAni characters) While I do like the KyoAni style design, it\'s getting really monotonous, when everybody looks the same. However, my major gripe and the reason why I score the art so low, is because the CG mechs. I cannot stand this trend of godawful CG showing up in shows. It\'s lazy, looks like garbage, and it needs to desist, as it brings down quality as a whole. Speaking of lazy...Sound: 3/10To me, sound might as well just mean soundtrack, and so that is the biggest factor for this low score. However, the voice acting in this show was of average quality, and I had no qualms with it. The actual SFX was decent as well, but wasn\'t anything all that unique, but was certainly not bad. Now my main issue with this series is Hiroyuki Sawano. This is a man who has taken the Call of Duty approach to sound design. The first show I saw that he worked on was Guilty Crown. Guilty Crown has one of my all time favorite OST\'s, and is a big reason I think so highly of it, even though it has some awkward plot lines here and there. The next show I watched that had Hiroyuki\'s name on it was Shingeki no Kyojin. This show also had a very good soundtrack, but I couldn\'t help but feel it was far too similar to GC\'s. Take Bios and The Armored Titan\'s Theme, for example. Both have German-ese vocals, loud orchestral music + bass. Not exactly the same but the style just feels stagnate. It only gets worse from there, as next was Kill La Kill, which like Aldnoah was also a disappointment. I feel this is also in part to Hiroyuki, but KlK had a lot of it\'s own problems. Again, the only song I even remember is ""Don\'t Lose Your Way"", and only because it\'s so campy. Finally, we get to A.Z\'s OST, and at this point it all just sounds like poorer versions of GC\'s OST, as if Hiroyuki has run out of conductive genius, and is just trying to emulate his previous successes.Characters: 2/10I\'ve already said basically anything that needs to be said about Inaho Kirigaya. Kazuto Kaizuka is Deus Ex Machina, and nothing more. He\'s a kuudere, but without the dere. He\'s completely unlikable, and I was very excited at the concept of him being dead at the end of the first cour, as it meant we\'d hopefully get less plot convenience and more actual story. However, he comes in and saves everything every time, so much so that he\'s not even a character, he\'s more like a force within the series that pushes it forward because no one knew how to write a story without the Eagles coming in and saving the Earth and Company.Next is easily the best and most frustrating character in the series, Slaine. Slaine was the most relatable character within the series, and is thus the most frustrating because he is not given the proper development he needed to really shine and make this a series worth watching. In the end he just feels like a crappy version of Suzaku. He gets a very good arc that could have gone sooo perfectly for him, but you know he can\'t achieve his goals because the ""good"" guys have to win.All other characters feel like set pieces, and are so distant they don\'t feel real. The only one I want to mention is Kouichirou Marito. This is a character that in the first cour gets a great amount of development and could actually be a great character fighting with his PTSD after encounter a Martian warship and his forces being devastated by it. But I can tell you exactly what\'s wrong with him, by simply quoting what is, at the time of writing this, is his bio on MAL itself: ""No biography written.""Enjoyment: 1/10Very few shows actually piss me off. Even shows I absolutely despise, like Mirai Nikki, were incapable of pulling this feat off. I knew exactly what was going to happen at every turn, and was never surprised. This show followed the most linear path it might as well have been a line on a piece of paper, it\'s about as generic as one too, so I\'d have trouble distinguishing which was which. That\'s a lie of course, because one of the lines would make me extremely perturbed, telling me exactly which is which. I don\'t write reviews that often, but when I do, it\'s for shows that I love so much and think are underrated, or I hate so much I feel it\'s my civic duty to warn others to stay far, far away from them.Overall, I personally rate this a 1/10, but I think it\'s actually closer to a 3/10. This was a mainly negative critic, but I felt this show had so much potential, and because it didn\'t live up to it, I personally feel like it stole my time from me. And I want it back. without further ado, here is my take on Aldnoah.Zero\'s second cour.Story: 3/10Picking up nineteen months after the first half, we find not much has really changed on a whole.

This show followed the most linear path it might as well have been a line on a piece of paper, it\'s about as generic as one too, so I\'d have trouble distinguishing which was which. That\'s a lie of course, because one of the lines would make me extremely perturbed, telling me exactly which is which. I don\'t write reviews that often, but when I do, it\'s for shows that I love so much and think are underrated, or I hate so much I feel it\'s my civic duty to warn others to stay far, far away from them.Overall, I personally rate this a 1/10, but I think it\'s actually closer to a 3/10. This was a mainly negative critic, but I felt this show had so much potential, and because it didn\'t live up to it, I personally feel like it stole my time from me.

About as okay as the first one.So in the first episode, the main characters are reintroduced and a little recap plays, explaining how and why the characters are in the current positions. Once that\'s out of the way, the story runs forward....The pacing in here is pretty \'meh\'. Plots points are spaced out and built up enough to not seem contrived but only just. I can easily see how one would feel that it\'s too fast. As an example, one of the major side characters makes an extremely controversial declaration early on. Shortly after, another twist occurs. All the little stories such as this are paced in a similar fashion. They are introduced then tied up soon after, before the plot point can properly establish their significance to the characters involved.On another note, there are more battles against the Aldnoah-powered Martian mechs compared to the first one. Each presents a unique physics problem for the Earth protagonist, Inaho, to solve. Seriously though, he\'s the only one that really matters in these fights, everyone else is fodder, albeit less dumb than in the first season. These fights, for me at least, are the main draw of the show, so more is good. In these, whether Martians or Earth(lings?), I find myself rooting for whichever side the protagonist is on. This makes for an interesting internal conflict in me when both protagonists, Slaine and Inaho, are in the same battle. Except the last battle, that one didn\'t feel exciting enough for a final showdown.Character development is pretty much non-existent here. No one\'s personality changes and no one takes an out-of-character action that changes your opinion of them. The Martian protagonist, Slaine, may be considered to have character development if you watched the first season but even then, it isn\'t explained WHY and HOW anywhere. It just... happens. One other possible character development involves Inaho, in the last episode, and even then, Inaho himself isn\'t the one doing the developing. And it\'s not as if you didn\'t already know that part of his character...It\'s evident that the anime is trying to be something great, with plot twists that could have been powerful and the fact that protagonists are on opposing sides but it falls flat and ends up with a lacklustre story with lacklustre characters.Still, I was able to somewhat push these problems out of my mind so they didn\'t reduce my enjoyment much despite my gripes with it.Animation-wise, it\'s kinda good; shiny robots with shiny bullets, robots zooming about, robots exploding. Nothing terrible, nothing really noteworthy. Just good overall.The music is okay. Unfortunately, no especially booming, epic music to go with the finale or fights in general, unlike the first season with portions of ""aLIEz"", the ending song of said season. Instead, it\'s remixes of ""aLIEz"" and another song that didn\'t evoke excitement and was just kind of sat in the background.Overall, the show tries to be something great but is unable to live up to its ambitions. I DID enjoy watching, if only to find out whether it gets better. The unique Martian mechs are where the fun is at, each being something of a scientific puzzle which, as one who likes physics, I quite enjoyed. If it weren\'t for that, the score I\'m giving would be 1 point lower.7/10On a side note, I dislike how the ending song is high-powered and fast in the first 10 seconds then suddenly relaxes. Those 10 seconds were literally (not exaggerating) the only part of the song I like. The pacing in here is pretty \'meh\'.

I haven't seen a sequel to an anime bomb this hard since Tokyo Ghoul Root A and Psycho-Pass 2. It is quite astonishing how an anime can do a complete nose dive in quality over the course of a couple of episodes and even though I thought that the first season of Aldnoah.Zero was mediocre I would think that it would stay that way throughout its whole span but I was proven wrong.Story: (2/10)The story of Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season starts off 19 months later after the ending of the first season with...Slaine rejoining the Martians and the whereabouts of Princess Asseylum being unknown. One of my problems with the story is how predictable it is with its writing and it definitely shows this the most during the battles. This is how most of the battles go, 1. Enemy shows up with a new mech that has a special ability. 2. The characters get into their own mechs to fight the enemy. 3. The enemy's mech shows its special ability by killing many no name characters. 4. The characters all panic because they can't find a way to beat the enemy. 5. Inaho comes out of nowhere and comes up with a plan to defeat the enemy and then immediately kills the enemy. It just gets so predictable that it gets really boring to watch and to make things worse is how they give Inaho a new ability to make him much more overpowered that he already was. Another problem this story has is how season 2 doesn't take the time to close up any plot holes that were left from the first season and it even adds new plot holes to the story. The way Aldnoah.Zero Season 2 ends is just very unsatisfying. It feels like a big slap in the face after finishing the anime.Art and Animation: (6/10)The art stayed at the same quality like the first season of Aldnoah.Zero. The backgrounds still look pretty good and the character designs managed to stay consistent but the only thing that held the art back was the CGI which was also the main problem I had with the art in season 1. The CGI appears even more than it did in season 1 and seeing all these scenes with CGI makes things much more unappealing to look at. The animation still managed to stay consistent with its fluency.Sound: (7/10)The sound is still the best part about Aldnoah.Zero. They still kept all the same good songs from the first season and the OP and the EDs are good. The voice actors were all solid and the sound effects were average.Characters: (2/10)The characters yet again are the worst thing about this anime. All the new characters that were added into this season didn't add anything to the story and were very forgettable. Inaho and Slaine didn't improve at all, Inaho still stayed the same no personality character and his only purpose is being able to defeat all the enemies that appear. Slaine in this season became much more terrible because of how much more inconsistent his personality is. He pretty much changes his opinion on things every second just to further the plot. All the villains in this are either one dimensional or only appear for one episode because they die in that episode.Enjoyment: (3/10)The only things I found enjoyable in this anime is the art, animation, and sound.Overall: (3/10)Aldnoah.Zero's 2nd Season managed to make an already mediocre anime much more worse than it should have been and I would in no way recommend this anime.

But if all you're looking for is character development and a wicked story with crazy plot devices, you're not gonna find that here. The passage of time in the plot direction is a little messy as it compresses days, weeks and possibly months into disjointed scenes, but it's not a bad thing as you can still figure out that time actually passed.ART/SOUNDInstead the majority of the production budget...is on the soundtrack (by Hiroyuki Sawano) and 3D mech generation, which is fluid and smooth compared to the likes of Gundam.COMPARISONGundam is the popular modern standard of all mecha/sci-fi interplanetary warfare, and if you're going to compare this to any Gundam installment, Gundam will win almost every time. But appreciating Aldnoah.Zero for its uniqueness instead of its similarities to Gundam is what will really get you the most enjoyment out of this show.For one, combat in Gundam essentially boils down to individual duels between pilots in a warfare setting. In Aldnoah.Zero however, characters work together in combat and defeat foes that have obviously more advanced technology through ad hoc calculation and strategy.Battleships in Gundam play a more active role and engage enemies with their own artillery. Whereas here you'll find that they are more of a resupply/comms station and do not engage as frequently.There are obvious plot devices that span from the Gundam series of the 2000s and up, but for the same reason that Gundam is the modern standard, do not simply dismiss this anime as a 'cheap Gundam clone'.As a longtime Gundam fan, I wasn't sure what to expect when watching Aldnoah.Zero but I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Gundam is to Aldnoah.Zero like two games of the mecha genre, but have very different combat systems and UIs.

Season 1 of Aldnoah.Zero was awesome. I had a lot of fun watching this badass mech anime. It ended on such a cliffhanger that made my head explode I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Boy did I wish I didn't know what happened next.WARNING SPOILERS BEGIN HERE:So at the end of Aldnoah.Zero season 1, the Princess and our edgelord main character both are shot dead and that's the end. I was losing my shit cause it was so...fucking incredible. But then there was a dissapointing turn over in the second season where they retconed their deaths to them both living and they didn't really die...FUCK THAT BULLSHIT! It now felt meaningless and all forms of excitment where you could build from that where we could see a background character rise up to become the real hero and keeps the memories of the Princess and edgelord in their hearts or whatever and it could have been a really exciting and very emotional. But no they brought them both back to life and nothing of consequence was lost. It was so shitty and from there on it went downhill. It was the sharpest nose dive I've ever seen in writing. Aldnoah.Zero 2 is absolutely trash. I am so angry and sad to say it but I dropped this show fast before it got even more painful. I felt cheated of a real story and series. This could have been, no wait, it should have been amazing but it just ended up shitting the bed and ruined some really amazing potential. I hate cop outs on the death of characters. It drove me up a wall during Attack on Titan and it did it here for me too. fucking incredible. But then there was a dissapointing turn over in the second season where they retconed their deaths to them both living and they didn't really die...FUCK THAT BULLSHIT! It now felt meaningless and all forms of excitment where you could build from that where we could see a background character rise up to become the real hero and keeps the memories of the Princess and edgelord in their hearts or whatever and it could have been a really exciting and very emotional.

Both shows have two characters that I liked do a complete 180 just because.....reasons. Which in turn completely ruined both of their characters.BUT...That\'s one of the many reasons why I completely hated the 2nd Season of Aldnoah.Zero and this is coming from a guy who enjoyed the 1st Season.(There will be SPOILERS in my review)[Story]: (2/10)""People die if they are killed""...Appearantly, that\'s not the case for Aldnoah.Zero II. The first season of Aldnoah.Zero ended with one of the most shocking and disappointing cliffhangers I\'ve ever seen. At that point, I thought to myself ""How would they proceed with 2 main characters now dead?"". There\'s a part of me that made me believe they would be revived in some sort of way but another half of me made me believe that\'s BS because they would never do it......Except they did. I\'ll get to that later and for now I\'ll talk about the so called ""war story"" in Season 2.Honestly, I have no more idea what the 2nd Season is trying to tell. I feel like the story that they were trying to tell in Season 1 (The war between the Terrans and Martians) just diminished here in Season 2. The war story is still there but to me, it\'s a ridiculous war story that I would rather not take seriously anymore. So basically, the 1st Season ended where the war ""finally ended"" between the two races. Oho, but it turns out the war has re-ignited once again because of Slaine\'s sudden thirst for power and his twisted vision of bringing the Princess\' vision of peace, or in other words ""to stop the fighting"", by completely eliminating the Terrans. Now, that\'s how you ruin a good (but not perfect) character. What in the mother of shit were the writers smoking? Seriously, for a character like Slaine, his vision just doesn\'t make fucking sense and seems like an asspull just so they can turn him into an antagonist.Wait a minute! Slaine\'s views does make sense! It\'s because of a weird ass love triangle going on between Slaine, The Princess, and Inaho. Slaine got jealous, he got mad at Inaho and he re-ignited a war between the two races just so he can kill Inaho and get the Princess all to himself and at the same time, achieve her vision.......Give me a fucking break. A war started for the 3rd time because of some guy who wanted the Princess\' fucking pussy?! This is the absolute reason why I can\'t take Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season\'s story seriously. What started out as a dark and serious war story ended up as a fucking joke of a war story. I mean, just compare this show\'s story to Saving Private Ryan\'s story and you\'ll see how much of a joke this shit show is. Haha, ""shit show""..A term I don\'t use often because it\'s rare for me to hate a show.You can tell the writers were getting super lazy for this season when they decided to resolve all of the character\'s sub-plot points during the the 2 year timeskip. Rayet got over her father\'s death off-screen, the Lieutenant\'s PTSD doesn\'t seem to be an issue for him anymore and etc. Like what the shit?! What kind of a lazy character development is that? I wanted to see it on-screen and not during the time skip. Since they decided to do it during the time skip, they should have provided flashbacks on how or what they did to solve said problems.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9/10)The animation looks exactly the same as the first season so I\'ll give it the same rating. My opinion on Art, Visuals, Character Designs, Mecha Designs stays the same because I didn\'t really see any changes.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9/10)It pretty sad how bad shows gets all the great soundtrack these days. I mean, I\'m watching a show right now that\'s considered a masterpiece by many and the soundtrack is just absolutely bad. Even the OP and ED theme song for that show is bad. However, for this show, both the soundtrack and the OP/ED theme songs are great. I\'m also still loving those goosebumps-inducing insert songs by Sawano. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is  &Z"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki and the ED theme song is ""Genesis"" by Eir Aoi. I\'m actually bummed out that Kalafina didn\'t come back for the 2nd OP but Sawano did a good job on the 2nd OP. Though, I would have highly preferred if Kalafina came back. For the ED theme song, I just don\'t like it. Well, in general...I just don\'t like Eir Aoi and her songs.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (2/10)Every character that died in the Season 1 finale somehow f*cking lived in this season for whatever reason. Inaho, who got shot in the head and in the chest multiple times lived. Like tell me in what universe would a person survive after being shot in the f*cking head and in the chest multiple times? What\'s worse is when Inaho got shot in the head, it benefited him. He got this bad-ass bionic eye that made him even more overpowered than before. Now, he doesn\'t need to come up with tactics because his eye will literally do it for him. What in the hell have they done with Inaho? His personality is as boring as a rock and yet the gods of fortune are on his side and making sure he fucking lives no matter the outcome of the situationSwitching to other characters who survived was the Princess. Though, her revival is a bit more believable since the Martians are a technologically advanced race so I wasn\'t really surprised that they managed to revive her. Speaking of revival, what\'s her purpose in the show? The Princess to me is more of a plot device. She doesn\'t develop any further..In fact, I don\'t think she received any character development at all. She\'s just there because....she\'s pretty much just a tool being used to advance the plot. Nothing more, nothing less.  There\'s also that red guy who lived after being back-stabbed by Slaine. Turns out Slaine spared his life because he has other ulterior motives.So all in all, every main characters/antagonist that we know lived to fight another day. What kind of a fucking war story is this shit? I have watched many war movies/TV shows and this is literally the first show I have seen where none of the main characters died. Only the characters who aren\'t really important to the show died. All this talk about the ""horrors of war"" in the show is just pure BS because I didn\'t see any. Also, what was the purpose of that shocking cliffhanger at the end of the 1st Season?There\'s one more character that I haven\'t talked about and that\'s Lemrina Vers Envers. She\'s the Princess\' half sister and I thought she was going to be a good character but that didn\'t happen. She\'s just your typical jealous younger sister and whines all the time like why her sister is more successful than her and why her sister gets everything while she doesn\'t. I wouldn\'t have cared about Lemrina\'s cliched personality but it\'s just poorly executed.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (5/10)My experience in watching Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is like watching a Michael Bay film. It\'s got great action and full of explosions but the story and the characters are just terribly written.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season was just downright terrible. I really wanted to like the 2nd Season because I actually liked the first season but the writing is terrible, plus they ruined Slaine\'s character. The portrayal of war is a fucking joke and they decided to make Inaho more overpowered by giving him a bionic eye and making the other pilots of the Kataphrakt stupid just to make Inaho look like a smart tactician. The story, compared to the first season, was also terrible and this is because they decided to focus on the stupid love triangle which started the 3rd war. If you love or enjoyed the 1st Season then I don\'t recommend that you watch the 2nd Season.[OVERALL]: (4/10)Pros:+Awesome Action Scenes+Awesome Mecha Fight Scenes+Soundtrack + the insert songs are amazing+Great Visuals and AnimationCons:-Story is even more worse than the 1st Season-Characters that died in the 1st Season somehow lived-Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season\'s new war story is an absolute joke-Stupid Love Triangle-The show ruined Slaine\'s character-Mediocre ending to the series Appearantly, that\'s not the case for Aldnoah.Zero II.

There\'s a part of me that made me believe they would be revived in some sort of way but another half of me made me believe that\'s BS because they would never do it......Except they did. I\'ll get to that later and for now I\'ll talk about the so called ""war story"" in Season 2.Honestly, I have no more idea what the 2nd Season is trying to tell. I feel like the story that they were trying to tell in Season 1 (The war between the Terrans and Martians) just diminished here in Season 2. The war story is still there but to me, it\'s a ridiculous war story that I would rather not take seriously anymore. So basically, the 1st Season ended where the war ""finally ended"" between the two races. Oho, but it turns out the war has re-ignited once again because of Slaine\'s sudden thirst for power and his twisted vision of bringing the Princess\' vision of peace, or in other words ""to stop the fighting"", by completely eliminating the Terrans. Now, that\'s how you ruin a good (but not perfect) character. What in the mother of shit were the writers smoking? Seriously, for a character like Slaine, his vision just doesn\'t make fucking sense and seems like an asspull just so they can turn him into an antagonist.Wait a minute! Slaine\'s views does make sense! It\'s because of a weird ass love triangle going on between Slaine, The Princess, and Inaho. Slaine got jealous, he got mad at Inaho and he re-ignited a war between the two races just so he can kill Inaho and get the Princess all to himself and at the same time, achieve her vision.......Give me a fucking break. A war started for the 3rd time because of some guy who wanted the Princess\' fucking pussy?! This is the absolute reason why I can\'t take Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season\'s story seriously. What started out as a dark and serious war story ended up as a fucking joke of a war story. I mean, just compare this show\'s story to Saving Private Ryan\'s story and you\'ll see how much of a joke this shit show is. Haha, ""shit show""..A term I don\'t use often because it\'s rare for me to hate a show.You can tell the writers were getting super lazy for this season when they decided to resolve all of the character\'s sub-plot points during the the 2 year timeskip. Rayet got over her father\'s death off-screen, the Lieutenant\'s PTSD doesn\'t seem to be an issue for him anymore and etc. Like what the shit?! What kind of a lazy character development is that? I wanted to see it on-screen and not during the time skip. Since they decided to do it during the time skip, they should have provided flashbacks on how or what they did to solve said problems.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9/10)The animation looks exactly the same as the first season so I\'ll give it the same rating. My opinion on Art, Visuals, Character Designs, Mecha Designs stays the same because I didn\'t really see any changes.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (9/10)It pretty sad how bad shows gets all the great soundtrack these days. I mean, I\'m watching a show right now that\'s considered a masterpiece by many and the soundtrack is just absolutely bad. Even the OP and ED theme song for that show is bad. However, for this show, both the soundtrack and the OP/ED theme songs are great. I\'m also still loving those goosebumps-inducing insert songs by Sawano. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is  &Z"" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki and the ED theme song is ""Genesis"" by Eir Aoi. I\'m actually bummed out that Kalafina didn\'t come back for the 2nd OP but Sawano did a good job on the 2nd OP. Though, I would have highly preferred if Kalafina came back. For the ED theme song, I just don\'t like it. Well, in general...I just don\'t like Eir Aoi and her songs.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (2/10)Every character that died in the Season 1 finale somehow f*cking lived in this season for whatever reason. Inaho, who got shot in the head and in the chest multiple times lived. Like tell me in what universe would a person survive after being shot in the f*cking head and in the chest multiple times? What\'s worse is when Inaho got shot in the head, it benefited him. He got this bad-ass bionic eye that made him even more overpowered than before. Now, he doesn\'t need to come up with tactics because his eye will literally do it for him. What in the hell have they done with Inaho? His personality is as boring as a rock and yet the gods of fortune are on his side and making sure he fucking lives no matter the outcome of the situationSwitching to other characters who survived was the Princess. Though, her revival is a bit more believable since the Martians are a technologically advanced race so I wasn\'t really surprised that they managed to revive her. Speaking of revival, what\'s her purpose in the show? The Princess to me is more of a plot device. She doesn\'t develop any further..In fact, I don\'t think she received any character development at all. She\'s just there because....she\'s pretty much just a tool being used to advance the plot. Nothing more, nothing less.  There\'s also that red guy who lived after being back-stabbed by Slaine. Turns out Slaine spared his life because he has other ulterior motives.So all in all, every main characters/antagonist that we know lived to fight another day. What kind of a fucking war story is this shit? I have watched many war movies/TV shows and this is literally the first show I have seen where none of the main characters died. Only the characters who aren\'t really important to the show died. All this talk about the ""horrors of war"" in the show is just pure BS because I didn\'t see any. Also, what was the purpose of that shocking cliffhanger at the end of the 1st Season?There\'s one more character that I haven\'t talked about and that\'s Lemrina Vers Envers. She\'s the Princess\' half sister and I thought she was going to be a good character but that didn\'t happen. She\'s just your typical jealous younger sister and whines all the time like why her sister is more successful than her and why her sister gets everything while she doesn\'t. I wouldn\'t have cared about Lemrina\'s cliched personality but it\'s just poorly executed.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (5/10)My experience in watching Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season is like watching a Michael Bay film. It\'s got great action and full of explosions but the story and the characters are just terribly written.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season was just downright terrible. I really wanted to like the 2nd Season because I actually liked the first season but the writing is terrible, plus they ruined Slaine\'s character. The portrayal of war is a fucking joke and they decided to make Inaho more overpowered by giving him a bionic eye and making the other pilots of the Kataphrakt stupid just to make Inaho look like a smart tactician. The story, compared to the first season, was also terrible and this is because they decided to focus on the stupid love triangle which started the 3rd war. If you love or enjoyed the 1st Season then I don\'t recommend that you watch the 2nd Season.[OVERALL]: (4/10)Pros:+Awesome Action Scenes+Awesome Mecha Fight Scenes+Soundtrack + the insert songs are amazing+Great Visuals and AnimationCons:-Story is even more worse than the 1st Season-Characters that died in the 1st Season somehow lived-Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season\'s new war story is an absolute joke-Stupid Love Triangle-The show ruined Slaine\'s character-Mediocre ending to the series', ""Aldnoah.Zero is one of the most popular mecha anime that was released during the late 2014. It was able to catch the interest of many anime consumers due to its cast. Like come on, who would not like to watch an anime that was created by Gen Urobuchi with his signature nihilistic themes and tragic characters? The series was also able to gain popularity because of its “uniqueness”. It is not like the other mecha animes where the main protagonist pilots a state of the art powerful mecha and fighting against less advanced mechas. This story is about a less advanced mecha fighting very powerful...and super advanced mechas. Something like the opposite of Gundam. It is also unique because it does not focus on a single character but two characters, who are both equally the main protagonist but they fight in opposite sides. This makes the anime a lot more interesting to watch especially watching how all the characters interact with each other.StoryThe story of the 2nd Season of Aldnoah.Zero is the direct continuation of the first season of Aldnoah.Zero. It takes place about 19 months after the Earth Federation’s victory against the Vers Empire on Earth. Since the battle on Earth has ended, most of the battles are now being performed in space. Yes, the war between Vers Empire and Earth Federation is still ongoing. In the story, Slaine has now become a knight for the Vers Empire working directly with Count Saazbaum. He is also now the pilot of the Kataphrakt Tharsis and is using it to defeat the Earth Federation. Inaho is also back and is fighting for the Earth Federation with his valuable skills in defeating the Martians. The story also give a lot of time with these characters such as their plans and their interactions with each other.New characters are also introduced as the story progresses such as the other princesses of the Vers Empire. In the beginning, the story is decently paced so it is unlikely that one would be able to lose interest in the series very quickly. It won’t bore you to death.However, the problem that I have for the series is that it could be too fast or too sudden which makes the series less emotionally impacting. Due to the fast speed, things that should have been emotional are not as emotional as it should be. The last few episodes was also very rushed like they just tried to fit something that could have taken at least four episodes long into one single episode. This problem is actually what made me give a lower rating for this anime even though I enjoyed it nearly from beginning to the near end.ArtThe art is exactly the same as the first season of Aldnoah.Zero but with greater amount of fluid fight scenes. The movements and fights appears to be a lot more fluid than the first season but this is probably due to the fights are now often being performed in space so there is a lot less restrictions in movements. However, the CG is still as impressive as the first season and would always make you want to see more of the action.SoundThe sound in this series is as fantastic and exciting as the first season. The music being played during the battles and fight scenes would get you pumped up and makes you want to watch more. It was also very well placed such as putting the right song in a battle scene or in an interaction scene.The opening was also amazing due to it being able to catch the emotions of the two main protagonists very well and how they are affected due to their losses. It is one those few anime openings that I could watch over 5 times without getting tired of it. The ending song aLIEz was also really catchy.CharacterThe second season of Aldnoah.Zero has all the main characters from the first season. All the characters remain relatively the same in the beginning of the anime such as their personalities. They all have their own different personalities as the first season which might be better because it does help balance the ideologies in the series. However, the thing that the second season has that the first season did not was character development. Well, more on Slaine's side. Inaho only had extremely little character development. However, you could now see the main characters such as Slaine and Inaho changing very slowly as the series progresses. Inaho is becoming more emotionally responsive while Slaine is becoming more ruthless and cunning. One thing I enjoyed about the first and second season of Aldnoah.Zero is that you really feel for the characters (except Inaho), even the minor ones (except Rayet). The characters that you might hate in the first season, you might like them in the second season because a different side of them are now being expressed such as some of them are fighting to avenge their loved one or trying to protect the people that they care for.Enjoyment and OverallI must say, I enjoyed watching this anime especially since I enjoyed watching the first season as well. However, the ending was a very big disappointment. As I said before, I found it too rushed during the final episode of the series as well as I didn’t really enjoy the ending based on my personal preferences. It appeared very forced but that is only my opinion. Other than that, I recommend watching this anime. and super advanced mechas. Something like the opposite of Gundam.

And it really does try to. You have everything you\'d want to see in a mecha anime: action, cool effects, and maybe, and just maybe, even nice characters.So, you may say, if Aldnoah.Zero has all of those things, why does it fails bad, so bad (in the second season even more) at shining like the jewel it wanted to be?There\'s a lot to say about this anime, and I perfectly know that if they just tried, Aldnoah could have turned out even better than the train-wreck that actually is.When you...watch an anime, and of that anime, even after one year, you can\'t even remember the plot or the most important scenes, man, that\'s not a good sign.You didn\'t succeed in making something that people would remember. I clearly remember plots, stories and wonderful moments of anime that I\'ve seen before Aldnoah, and I feel something when I remember them.But with this anime is impossible. And it pains me, \'cause the first season got my hopes up and gave me lots of feels.Enough with this, let\'s get to the core of the review.Story: 5Okay, I\'m not making a summary because it\'s boring for you who read it, and me to write it, and it\'s unneeded.To put it frankly... You never know how sequels will turn out.They can ruin the entire anime to the point you hope they never existed (Kuroshitsuji II), they can be freakin\' awesome (...still have to find an example) or they can be horribly plain.That\'s the plain case.If the story ended with the last episode of the first series, it would have been better. The plot is static, they want you to believe it\'s dynamic, they want to give you action and character development but you never see any of them.The pattern is always the same: mighty enemy (that is always the same enemy), Mars people fighting Inaho\'s squad and the always and casually useless people of Earth that need Inaho\'s intellect to save the day.Whoa. How convenient.No, seriously, you arrive at the end of the story and you already know that every fight will end the same, that at some point Inaho will do something that will turn the tables and the enemy will be defeated. Or even if he doesn\'t do that, he still goes on on living, he never really puts his life at stake, though they want you to believe so.And again, it\'s useless to talk about the flaws of the plot, that are the same of the first season; the Martians, that in less than 70 years develop an unnatural hate towards people of Earth, and about all the moments the plot goes nowhere.Want me to sum it up? Two twinks fighting over one woman.And how does it end? It\'s a shitty ending, I guarantee you that much.Art: 8While the plot (and the characters as well) are really deplorable, the art is pretty good. Actually, what I really loved were the mecha fighting scenes and all the effects that were added. More plain and flat is instead the character design. Nobody is particularly outstanding. Though the animation is fluid and dynamic.Hm. Yeah, that\'s all.Sound: 10If hearing Hiroyuki Sawano\'s name doesn\'t ring a bell, let me make your sense tingling. Hiroyuki Sawano is the composer of lots of anime OST. Guilty Crown, Ao no Exorcist, Shingeki no Kyojin, Owari no Seraph and many others. I don\'t know many names of composers but I can tell that his music is something else.His soundtrack is what made me give to this anime a full 6. Sawano\'s music is what it takes to an anime to take a step and get in another rating –in my opinion, of course.There\'s something really awesome and stunning in the ost he makes. If you\'re thinking the anime is a shipwreck (well, I think it\'s a train-wreck, but please, ignore me in this point), please, take at least an hour, or even half an hour of your time, to listen on Youtube to the songs of the ost. ""Harmonious"", but even the other titles.Then, if you still feel the hatred for Aldnoah, I won\'t blame you.But if you feel the feels, you\'re on the right track, pal.Character: 3No. Just no. Don\'t give me this s**t that characters are original, that there\'s development and all, \'cause there\'s nothing.The side characters are there just to be some filler, and most of them are useless to the plot/nuisances to the core. You see some Inaho\'s friends, and yet you have to understand what\'s the meaning of them being there. They\'re pretty good, okay, but they\'re nothing compared to the almighty Inaho.And maybe it\'s normal in some anime, that a bunch of friends gather around an overly strong MC, but this is not the case.In this case every side character is useless, their being on board doesn\'t really make a difference. And what about Inaho\'s sister? Yes, quite forgettable.She doesn\'t really shine.Where\'s the character development? In the martian girl?, that starts caring for terrestrials? But please.The ending is the stunning evidence that all they went through was useless to the means of their internal growth. The princess in particular, was the biggest delusion ever.Obviously is no needed me to tell you that this anime tries to be so original by recurring to absolutely-not plain personality models like the tsundere one.Hail for originality.Enjoyment: 4And then we get to the enjoyment part. Watching Aldnnoah.Zero was a pain. But not watching the first season, that was rather enjoyable. No. It was watching THIS season. My excitement for the new episodes decreased and decreased even more and for the end of the anime, it all went downhill.Overall: 6Watch it when you have time to kill. When you want to watch a mecha anime but you don\'t want to weight yourself with a deep plot or with questions about the meaning of life. When you want to see a totally predictable fight. Or if you watched the first season and you thought you\'d give it a try despite all of this.Do it.

First and foremost, the plot became even more monotonous, the characters lost their remaining charm, the protagonist became even more powerful and the fights lost their creativity, which they possessed in the first season.[Story 2]Slain wants to play the glorious antihero, without any real approach and this he does. But instead of it becoming fascinating, none of that happens. He does boring things, throwing around...contentless dialogues. There is fighting. The protagonist now shows his new omnipotent ability and massacres all his opponents.Only the last 5 minutes of the anime, I found just so entertaining.[Characters 3]The princess is in a coma for 70% of the anime and is good for practically nothing until the end.Slain is an empty shell of a classic failed antihero, who probably couldn't even convince himself.The rest of the enemies are clichés and cannon fodder to show how powerful the protagonist is.[The] The Protagonist, with his new eye, is practically an oversized god of war who uses his orange training robot to send every opponent to paradise with a side slap.The supporting characters had no screentime at all, except for some fan service and irrelevant small talk.[Animations 7]The animations possessed the same level as in the first season. Successful and dynamic CGI. Good background animations and visually pleasing.[Music 5]The intro is worse than in the first season, but the rest remained the same. As well as the fact that once again they don't understand how to use the music properly and thus couldn't create a single climax. Since the same music played almost from the beginning to the end, it damaged the atmosphere a lot.[Conclusion]Aldonoah Zero is merely a visually and musically appealing work, which could hardly show any strengths in terms of content and failed all along the line.Honestly, I wondered at first why the ratings were so low, even though the first 2 episodes were quite attractive. However, I was able to realize quickly enough how wrong I was and what was in store for me.[Enjoyment 3] contentless dialogues. There is fighting.

However, I was able to realize quickly enough how wrong I was and what was in store for me.[Enjoyment 3]"", ""well...i just finished the second season and decided to write a review about it...it was horrible really...i expected a lot more than this :|story 1/10:so basically all 4 major characters are alive not dead...i was like WTF? :| and then Slaine went insane and decided to kill everyone because of his princess and Inaho stopped him and then the princess married another guy and Slaine went to prison for the rest of his life...OMG CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?what is this?one of the worst ending ever with a shity plot alongside it :|art 7/10:art was good enough...character designs were specially good :)sound 9/10:i loved the soundtracks...in this anime more than anything else..specially the ending *~*character1/10:none of the characters in this anime act straight...in season1 i had the right idea about almost all of them but in this season they seem lost.Inaho is like a robot running around do what he wants and thinks that his way is right all the time...the emotional moments in this anime are ruined by him acting like a total robot saying what he supposes to say and just that...not a single smile...and even when he seems angry or sad it doesn't seem that he is...i mean what's wrong with you :| even when he was talking about the princess who he seemed to like he was like an empty shell.Slaine has so much emotion that he can't control(opposite of Inaho)...he was from earth and yet his love blinded him to attack his own people just because of his princess and at the end the princess left him and married some other dude for political reasons or something :| i mean what the hell were you thinking you dumbass idiot jerk :/Asseylum...the princess of this anime that everyone was in love with...she was all about 'i'm weak'...'i couldn't do anything' and stuff like that...despite being a princess she couldn't do a damn thing..she was just running around talking about earth's blue sky...the only good thing about her was that she wanted peace that led to an actual peace between earth and mars.as you can see this anime does not have that much of interesting characters...waste of everything seriously*sigh*enjoyment 3/10:3 reasons why:1.art 2.sound 3.title and as for title i mean the whole idea of this anime is interesting but the story sucked obviously.overall 4/10:well well...4 is more than enough for this anime i think...i have no reason to recommend this to you so just skip it :D i'm sure there are so much more anime series out there than you can enjoy lol :D in this anime more than anything else..specially the ending *~*character1/10:none of the characters in this anime act straight...in season1 i had the right idea about almost all of them but in this season they seem lost.Inaho is like a robot running around do what he wants and thinks that his way is right all the time...the emotional moments in this anime are ruined by him acting like a total robot saying what he supposes to say and just that...not a single smile...and even when he seems angry or sad it doesn't seem that he is...i mean what's wrong with you :| even when he was talking about the princess who he seemed to like he was like an empty shell.Slaine has so much emotion that he can't control(opposite of Inaho)...he was from earth and yet his love blinded him to attack his own people just because of his princess and at the end the princess left him and married some other dude for political reasons or something :| i mean what the hell were you thinking you dumbass idiot jerk :/Asseylum...the princess of this anime that everyone was in love with...she was all about 'i'm weak'...'i couldn't do anything' and stuff like that...despite being a princess she couldn't do a damn thing..she was just running around talking about earth's blue sky...the only good thing about her was that she wanted peace that led to an actual peace between earth and mars.as you can see this anime does not have that much of interesting characters...waste of everything seriously*sigh*enjoyment 3/10:3 reasons why:1.art 2.sound 3.title and as for title i mean the whole idea of this anime is interesting but the story sucked obviously.overall 4/10:well well...4 is more than enough for this anime i think...i have no reason to recommend this to you so just skip it :D i'm sure there are so much more anime series out there than you can enjoy lol :D"", ""Very minor spoilers if you call them that.Story: 10It followed great from the first season. It was minor but I think it is worth mentioning there was something I liked a bit less but couldn't put my finger it on. I knew it was either with the story or characters. It was not with the story. It was actually very well thought out and they did not force anything to make more money. They set out what they intended to do and did exactly that. It concluded in a way that was pretty satisfying in all honesty and I left content with the story altogether.Art:...9Same as season 1 review. It was great. The space battles were amazing to watch as well so it was an added bonus.Sound: 8Again same as season 1 review. It was really good all around.

Its not just raw mecha brawling in case you might be afraid of that. Gen Urobuchi acted as director which usually makes the story...tend towards the dramatic plotlines.Genre tags might be:political, action, mecha, sci-fi,drama;;;NOTABLE THINGS ABOUT THE PLOT;;;- The second season of AZ sadly starts off with a totally random beginning that contrasts the ending of the first season a lot which is my biggest problem (and that of a whole lot other people ;P ) with the whole aldnoah.zero anime. The rest of the story is rather consequent.- The story of AZ2 pretty much centers around Slaine Troyard going on a political rampage just as badly as he got pushed around in season 1.- The director Gen Urobuchi did not excert his hobby too much. (Which is something like killing people in unexpected situations);;;MY OPINION;;;I really loved the first season. And I guess that influences this review a bit.But one straight sentence right off: The main character Inaho and the start of the second season are trash.I\'ve gotten permission from ModeratelyHuman to quote him cause I couldn\'t have gotten the message about Inaho more on point than he did when he was rating the characters.""9/10 Inaho\'s robot eye. A new character. Yes. The eye has its own character. Yes. THE EYE GETS MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN INAHO HIMSELF. At first the eye is nothing but a tool, but then it starts taking over parts of Inaho\'s brain and becomes its own thinking entity. It even starts chatting up the princess while Inaho was unconscious. Look at that development. Oh yea. Such character. ""Despite a lack in character personality details in generell, a lack in dynamic characters, the story sometimes being predictable, using many generic characters and a really shitty start off for the second season I still enjoyed the show a lot.Why? Because aside from lacking a lot of things the core elements are well refined. It has a consistent flow (except season 2 start) of the story with changes and betrayels being well introduced and happening not happening in seconds.The art is beautiful. The soundtrack is awesome.Slaine aside with his detailed and dynamic personality the rest of the static cast do complement each other rather well. Many characters (especially those form mars) in this anime do not act only because they have to but rather because they want to. They have values they are fighting and arguing for. Some of them go down still believing they died for the right thing. Which takes a lot of devotion. A character trait that isn\'t so prominent nowadays. (Most popular trait in our age seems to be envy which I am sick of.) And one thing is very important in my opinion: A character does not have to be dynamic to be beautiful. Im refering to characters like Count Saazbaum, Count Crutheo, Asseylum, Lemrina, Marito, Magbaredge and maybe some others. Just mentioning that being dynamic is not about overcoming some trials be they in your mind or real, but its more about the ability to change perspective.All of them together form a beautiful environment for a well made story wich is underlined by great art and really awesome music.;;;TO-SUM-IT-UP;;;If u can get past Inaho, the start of the second season and you prefer devote characters over envious ones than u will love the show.Credits to ModeratelyHuman for the quote and I recommend to take a look at his review which has more depth but more spoilers.

Kaizuka's older sister keeps saying he shouldn't be fighting despite the fact he's the only reason they're winning any battles at all.Great way to kill 3 hours if you have nothing else on your list. Makes for...good background noise and pretty battle scenes with cool mechs. Not overly interesting and you don't have to worry about missing anything. Trust me, you will NEVER hit the rewind button during this series. good background noise and pretty battle scenes with cool mechs.

Trust me, you will NEVER hit the rewind button during this series."", 'tl dr; The score is most likely inflated due to my favoritism towards mecha anime in general, but I liked it a lot, contrary to the many low scores given by a good portion of the reviewers.With the relatively ""shocking turn of events"" at the end of Season 1, we get to see much more action in this season as well as a bit more ""diversity"" in views on the side of Vers. From what I remember, there were 3 crucial points in the story that could have been stretched to more episodes if the studio had the opportunity to do so, in my opinion....By this time, the audience knows how the scene is going to go from the background soundtrack that plays behind the discussion taking place between the characters.Slightly abrupt ending, the fighting scenes were pretty (although they could have been much prettier), a bit underwhelming conclusion for the relationship between the characters, BUT kept me watching till the end without any thought of dropping it.

I didn\'t plan to watch it at first because I\'m not a great fan of mechas. But since its debuts it received good critiques, and I wanted to know why.Story : 6/10There were good ideas. A conflict between the Earth and the Vers Empire, the power of Aldnoah, etc... but sometimes I really felt like watching Code Geass. There were some similitudes between the main characters of both series, but also by the way that season 2 could have been better, instead of being really bad and poorly written. Moreover, I think it would have been better without...the emphasizing of the relationship between Inaho, Slaine and Asseylum. The anime should have been more centered on war, politics and action instead of a ridiculous triangle between the main characters.Characters : 3/10As I started watching episode one, I felt disappointed. They started to present one of the main character : Asseylum Vers Allusia, the princess, and immediately I disliked her because she\'s the typical naive girl that doesn\'t know what\'s going on outside. And during the show, I felt like she wants to achieve peace without taking care of the ideals of the two sides, while she is supposed to be kind and gentle. For me she was empty. Her character doesn\'t evolve, neither for Inaho. Indeed he\'s smart, his actions were sometimes really good, but he doesn\'t show any emotions... My favorite one is Slaine, because although he did bad things, he\'s the only one to have evolved and to have been well-written. I think he doesn\'t deserve this kind of end. Asseylum receives all the merits although she did nothing since the start.The other characters could have been great but they weren\'t well-developped (such as Inko, Yuki...) and I wanted to see Marito in action more often, instead of Inaho. As the story progresses, different protagonists appear but I didn\'t find them interesting. Lemrina could have been a better character but for me it just looked like the writters created her to put someone on Slaine\'s side and to say ""Her sister Asseylum is better because she\'s nice"". Moreover, her design is not very pretty... I felt sorry for her.Art : 4/10Many people says that the art in this anime is great, and I don\'t agree because I actually disliked it. The chara-design is too simple and looks like those on ""moe animes"". It doesn\'t match with the serious aspects of the series, and because of its simplicity, I wasn\'t caught by the different emotions shawn by the characters. Background and mecha designs were correct but I really disliked the chara-design.Sound : 9/10The best part of the anime. It\'s one of the main points that made me watch Aldnoah.Zero. I really like the first opening by Kalafina, but mainly the original soundtrack composed by master Hiroyuki Sawano. ""BRE@TH//LESS"" and the ending ""aLIEz"" are my favorites. The problem is that I found the music too great for this kind of anime. They were epic, but the actions were not.In the end, I didn\'t really enjoy the show. It isn\'t one of the worst anime I\'ve seen, but it could have been better, especially if Asseylum was not there, or if she wasn\' too naive, and also if the story was better, and more interesting. the emphasizing of the relationship between Inaho, Slaine and Asseylum.

Be warned, there is going to be some harsh language, and plenty of SPOILERS; so if that's not what you are looking for, just do the TL:DR and move on.TL:DRAZ could've been one of the best mecha anime of recent times, however due to limited thought capacity and the 5 seconds effort given by the director and producers, the ending is sour AF and...will trigger you harder than seeing LBJ in yet another NBA finals with yet another team. So if you got anger management issues then do yourself a flavor and do not attempt to watch this, just leave now and forget Aldnoah.Zero ever existed cause you will be fuck pissed after watching the ending.Let me start off by getting this out of the way, I actually enjoyed the series as a whole. Season 1 was exceptional, easily the best anime of 2014. The problem was season 2 and the ending.Now that I got that out of the way, let's move on to some ratings & spoilers.Story 7/10 - Season 1 easily rate at a 9/10, the emotions of the characters, the pace, execution, planning, and surprises actually captivates you as a viewer and captures your heart, however in season 2 this just drops flat to a 5/10 at best, like Kira's x105 running out of juice then getting shot down because it's not yet a freedom. Yes, there is nothing new about a war between Earth & Mars, they have been fighting ever since gundam invaded space UC0079. What makes AZ stand out is how ridiculously OP Inaho is, and how everyone from Vers has no brain. No, this is anime, it does not need to make sense. Hell, even if the story is a complete ripoff of Iron-Blooded Orphans /s (no it couldn't have been since AZ came first), and it would've been Negan if they gave AZ a proper ending. So rather I should be saying that the story is tried and true even gundams got off from it. Unfortunately, this happy but not happy, tragedy but not quite Othello ending just left everyone with their mouths opened making shapes that looks like wtf and dropping words that sound like duck. Atleast clockwork planet has an excuse for being bad: it's just plain bad, period. From all the way up the AZ story takes a scary drop, the decline is real, and it's a sad ride into the sunset yet you can continue expect shit like this from what you thought were decent studios such as A1. The story as a whole is still decent despite the horrible end.Characters 2/10 - I'm going to draw some parallels in this section in my futile attempt to justify why despite the characters being so bad I still gave it a 7/10 overall. Let's start with the protagonist Inaho, who shows no emotions whatsoever. Which is fine, better than hearing Sasuke whine and cry everytime he got sennen goroshi-ed. Asseylum loves you, but you let her go. Inko loves you, but you too dumb to do anything about it. All you know is how to blow up Katafuks (Kataphrakts). Seriously you could've done so much more than just giving blows. Then there is his love interest, or uninterested one side unrequited love, Inko. Give this girl a medal. I commend you for showing that idiot Inaho so much love and not committing seppuku for almost letting Inaho die multiple times because you totally could've prevented it. /s On a serious note, Inko really got shafted by authors for not letting her do shit. She could've been so much more being the main heroine of the second season and all; but ofcourse not, who are we kidding this is AZ we talking about.The antagonist, Slaine, I won't go into details here why his character design was a complete fail, there are plenty of 100 pages essays and discussions on that all over the net, just google it if you are interested. All I will say is that we viewers put more thoughts into this than the producers ever did. Kill the man, exile him, make him Yagami Light, but please, do not leave us hanging by locking him up in a prison smiling. That's the worse shit you can do in an ending, unless you are planning a sequel. Then finally his love interest, Asselyum. Omfg I don't even know where to start. I don't know if she's just effing dumb or playing dumb; but I do know one fact these producers are one tough act to follow. You don't go pinning your ending of the main heroine with some douche nobody called Crapkind (Klancain) who has less than 7mins54seconds screentime (Yes, I counted tyvm) in a total of the last 4 episodes they decided to dump him in. Who's that dude? I don't even know his name. Seriously I had to wiki dudes' name. There's so much you guys could've done that would've made the ending less sour, ie. pussyblock, cuckold, destroy her via anal probe and have Lemrina take over the world; anything would've made for a better ending but no, ffs you don't go putting your main character together unhappily ever after with some Cockain.Lemrina - Respect. She's one of the only one in the series to stay true to her cause and her words despite getting the short end at every turn. I'm surprise she didn't just blow Slaine into space (moon base) with her autonomous moped.The rest of the characters just didn't get the attention they deserved and that's where the series really ended up short.Art 8/10 - I actually had no problem with the animations like some people did. If you have watched as many bad anime as me, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say this is pretty good - nor excellent, definitely not bad. For reference sake: Shana & fate/stay 10/10, Kakegurui -5/10. You get the point.Sound 10/10 - Kalafina & hiroyukisawano, enough said.Overall 7/10 - I'm by no means someone hard to please, I even think madoka is entertaining (at times), nor do I think very hard if the story in an anime make sense or not because lets face it, most anime isn't supposed to make sense (ie. valvrave); but the AZ ending has gots to be some of the least thought out, worse executed crap I have seen in recent years, even majestic prince didn't trigger me this hard. Don't believe me? Disagree? just google aldnoah zero ending on reddit and you will see my opinion is the majority. But hey, what do I know, I'm just a guy who spends most of his spare time watching anime and reading manga. My $0.02. will trigger you harder than seeing LBJ in yet another NBA finals with yet another team. So if you got anger management issues then do yourself a flavor and do not attempt to watch this, just leave now and forget Aldnoah.Zero ever existed cause you will be fuck pissed after watching the ending.Let me start off by getting this out of the way, I actually enjoyed the series as a whole.

You get the point.Sound 10/10 - Kalafina & hiroyukisawano, enough said.Overall 7/10 - I'm by no means someone hard to please, I even think madoka is entertaining (at times), nor do I think very hard if the story in an anime make sense or not because lets face it, most anime isn't supposed to make sense (ie. valvrave); but the AZ ending has gots to be some of the least thought out, worse executed crap I have seen in recent years, even majestic prince didn't trigger me this hard. Don't believe me? Disagree? just google aldnoah zero ending on reddit and you will see my opinion is the majority.

The Martian humans\' attack on Earth humanity, comes from the original Mobile Suit, and the special alien-made engines powering Suits which is debatable of having came from either 00 or Code Geass, the Deucalion\'s Season 1 design is basically the Egg Carrier from Sonic Adventures (see the bonus rant at the end), with everything else being a spoiler-laden mass robbery from Gundam Seed. The story had only 2 unique plot-points to really call it\'s own, the first in Season 1 with awesome nods to WW2, training highschool students to operate the latest military hardware in preparation for war, something any war history buff would squee at, and the second plot point being the sentient eye implant, both ultimately squandered being introduced and plot-relevant once and after 3 episodes never impacting the story again, which brings me to the animation quality.The series\' graphics leave something to be desired, oft notably dropping animation quality during 2D moments most notably while characters are emoting especially dramatically, dropping below the ""cinematic"" 24 frames standard in non-interactive entertainment (tested true by rewinding the scene where Princess\' servant breaks out in tears and replaying it several times), and with the 3D models occasionally loosing focus to the backdrop during action-heavy scenes I can\'t say the show holds up visually. Audio doesn\'t hold up much better, character\'s lines don\'t always sound right as the Mic\'s condenser kicks in mid-line and they suddenly get quiet mid-emote with a few episodes outright sounding like the entire thing was recorded through a tin can.Overall, the series is kinda disappointing even though I went in with low expectations it failed to meet even those by blandly copying countless other shows and not doing any of it justice by being better in any way.Bonus Rant:I\'m not usually the type to outright rip on or get VERY mad at something in Anime, but I can\'t let this pass, the series\' Deucalion ship design (for the majority of season 1) is a Chinese knockoff of Dr. Gerald Robotnick (aka E.G.G.M.A.N.)\'s Egg Carrier, taking off from being disguised in a heavily forested area, with diamond-shaped rear thrusters, the VERY distinct hull shapes designed to house the front and rear Beam Cannons with their distinctly placed and shaped shrouding perfectly intact, the fore-deck rising launchpads designed to aid in mass-deploying jets, the similarly designed deck cannons that break same when attacked, the only notable changes are that they slimmed down the overall shape to be more flat and reduced the enormous wings to a vestigial spoiler-like thing dangling haplessly off the back end. This annoyed me a TON and nobody seems to have noted the thinly veiled plagiarism it represents in their reviews. Shame on you Gen Urobuchi and Pinakes for stealing designs from the magnificent Doctor Robotnick, I won\'t let you get away with this! >:( main plot is ripped various seasons of Gundam and its\' spinoffs.

But it can be too unreadable sometimes. backgrounds are good and overrall it\'s looking great.Sound :AZ have those incredibly beautiful songs that fulfill perfectly their job at making scenes epic af.I don\'t have much to say about it. It\'s great and identical to season 1.Character :Let\'s face it... Slaine and Inaho are the worst characters of all time.Inaho first, he\'s a young man, very calm, obstinate, too intelligent AND skilled in fights. I seriously hate him, because he\'s just too strong compared to the others, goddamnit it\'s just the brother of the most normal soldier of all time, except that his sister does have a better background than him, and a better chara-design too, and everything !Slaine is... Uh just a reason to have season 2, that\'s all, he is just hateful.Rayet and Inoko are better characters than those two guys, even if Rayet and Inoko are that kind of classic characters ! But they fill the story perfectly.Enjoyment :It\'s good to watch, but when you don\'t have something more interesting to see.Conclusion : So, AZ Season should not exist, it\'s good when you just want to see some giant robots fighting each other, but that\'s all, and there are a lot of shows that are significantly better.If you read after this, you\'ll see spoiler, take care.====================SPOILER==SPOILER==SPOILER==================Let\'s talk about some characters that i pointed out the issues previously.Inaho, this ""best genius of all time"", he should not be in this season. Why ?Because in the end of season one, he\'s been killed, like Asseylum. Season 2 could have been way better with him dead, following the war in the eyes of Inoko, or Rayet for example, to see how they manage Inaho\'s death. Inaho were already a genius, but they had to him a computer in his eyes, because ""WE HAVE TRANSHUMANISM GO CHECK THIS OUT WE ARE SO ORIGINAL"", hell no. It\'s just more annoying to follow him.That\'s the main reason that AZ is a mess, and you should not watch it.After we have all of this :-Lemrina hime is a good character but completely messed up because of Asseylum Hime, she should be dead for this season too. Lemrina Hime is a girl that really loves Slaine, and that\'s a good story, but Asseylum should be a ghost that avoids Slaine to fall in love with her, not a girl falling asleep waiting her episode to wake up.-Fights are just Inaho beating some guys with his skills that are incredible, and it\'s boring, when there\'s a fight you just wait to see how he will save others even if he\'s not there. It\'s okay it\'s the main character, but here he can just fight them alone with his excessive skills and intelligence.Don\'t watch this, don\'t waste your time. great because of the main character, more on that later.Art :I\'m not a huge fan of CGI, but i\'m not totally against it, AZ have a great animation, with some very dynamic mecha fights.

Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.The plot has more howlers than a werewolves convention. The Martian war effort is enfeebled by the demands of the plot from start to finish. Putting the female lead on ice for a third of the series is not the way to develop character. Inaho's character is somewhat strikingly presented, but developed so little from season 1 that he really should have died back then. Even getting a portion of his brain removed doesn't slow him down! Supporting character might as well be...dead, or very nearly, for the role they take in overcoming problems.The resolution of the war is maddeningly unsatisfying. If a war in which millions have died could ever be ended by a speech and a marriage, such things should not be, for the sake of human dignity. While convincing explanations can be contrived for most of the plot developments, as for Inaho's repeated victories, such things lean unsatisfyingly on the outlandish situations contrived by the writers. But as Kazuo Koike might have said, characters, characters, characters can still make such a frustrating story loved.Grand scale, of events, battles, and emotions, is the major draw of Aldnoah Zero, apart from the very decent score, and the unforgettable Byronic hero Slaine Troyard. Seriously. Making dreadful mistakes with noble but hopelessly flawed intentions is his tragedy; never giving up is his heroism; tragic anti-hero 101. Lelouch or Light Yagami never enthralled me like Slaine does, because his motives are nobler, his beginnings humbler, and he feels real pain and frustration as they never did. The thoughts behind his actions in season 2 are often quite an enigma, but discovery and retrospection are part of the story. The way events mould Slaine's character completely contrasts with Inaho's dead immobility. If only the writers had developed the grand events they conceived, rather than reducing an interplanetary war to a squabble between two boys. Slaine was such a human character and so gave the impression that he could accomplish anything, I could never think of him as a bad character, only badly used.Lemrina deserves some credit as a strong, well-constructed character as well. Her ending, with no place for her on either Vers or Terra, was rather sad. Slaine's ending...I saw as a painful kind of redemption.

All his suffering, struggles and conflicts for the one person he cares about, only to realise that was not what she wanted and carrying on anyways because that is the only way he knows how to move forward.The human actions and thought processes of Slaine, the very trait least associated with the technologically advanced Martians is in stark contrast to the robotic and logical thinking of Inaho, who is supposed to represent the raw humanity of Earth.

I must admit that I loved season 1 of this anime and I had great expectations for the second season. After I finished the whole second season I begun to have different thoughts about it.Firstly, I don't really know if it was good or not. I think the anime should just stop on season one. Seriously, I think that anime makers had no ideas for the second season so they just made the second season on spontan.Secondly, I'm trying not to spoil anything, but I didn't like the Slaine's change. Like what the hell...happened to him? I understand that he was jelous, but he didn't need to do things he did. As well as I didn't understand this Inaho eye thing. Like I have so many questions about the second season.Finally, the only 10 I would give the second season is the characters. Okay I know that I said that I didn't like some changes in the characters, but I must admit that they're feelings and thoughts were very well made. In my opinion the best character in this series is Princess Asseylum. She is the only one that I think that did not change.To conclude, I can say that season 2 wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The first season is definetly better than the second. I can say that you can watch the second season but don't have too big expectations for it.

If you are overly worried about spoilers, skip over the character section, and only read the rating, but I do recommend the whole thing.I am VERY mixed about this one. It was a very hot and cold anime. I really liked Aldnoah.Zero as a series, but my last review was fairly mixed as well. I'm going to break it down:Story: This was both great and horrible. It had moments that I believe were pretty stellar, but overall it draggggggged on for a bit with events that were fairly boring on...uninteresting. I was able to count several plot holes or Deus Ex Machinas, and that was upsetting for a series I had enjoyed. 6/10, for story.Art: I think that the animation was very well done, and the people were all done quite well, with the exception of most Inigo's face scenes. Factoring all of these into account I believe a 9/10 would be fair, rounding from an 8.5/10. There is a lot more cool Earth imagery, and the space stuff is welldone for those scenes.Sound: Yeah, I don't have much to say about the music in this season. The OST had fairly similar reviews for this, some good tracks some bad tracks, and an OP/ED that I didn't like.  Giving it a 5/10 for sound.Character: I hated Inaho as a protagonist, he just rubs me the wrong way. He just didn't live up to the potential he could have, and seemed very 2D. I LOVED THE POETIC, FULL-CIRCLE THAT THIS ANIME DOES! Without spoilers I cannot describe it, but in that moment, I was willing to give it a 10/10, for the sheer greatness of it. The reason it is here is because it involves a key moment of character development for some key characters. Slaine was horrible for some of this season, until after I had it explained to me, the key symbolism around his character, my love for him exploded once again as I realised how deep he was and what great imagery his character portrays (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD) if you just look into his eyes (END OF SPOILER). I think that with the explaining that it shouldn't have needed, it will get an 8/10, more if it was more easy to understand, but I feel like this entire anime may have gotten higher ratings and more positive reviews if that were the case.Enjoyment: This is gonna be mixed, but I did like it all-in-all, and after I got over the initial questions and some of my disdain for the ending, I got have decided to give it a 7/10.Overall: Taking into account the not-so-great story, the great animation, the mediocre sound and great character development. I am going to give this a 7/10 overall, one lower than last season. If you've seen season 1, I recommend watching this and then checking out the thread that explains the ending, as I believe many people can be too harsh on this anime unless some of the great points are explained (I won't because I would prefer not to spoil it here, the thread is: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/37smuc/spoilers_why_aldnoahzero_ending_makes_senses/, it is worthwhile checking out after you view the anime, even for people who watched it a while ago and are just scrolling through the reviews).

If you've seen season 1, I recommend watching this and then checking out the thread that explains the ending, as I believe many people can be too harsh on this anime unless some of the great points are explained (I won't because I would prefer not to spoil it here, the thread is: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/37smuc/spoilers_why_aldnoahzero_ending_makes_senses/, it is worthwhile checking out after you view the anime, even for people who watched it a while ago and are just scrolling through the reviews). I really liked it in some areas, and disliked it in others, I still believe it is worth an initial watch, especially if you already finished season 1."", 'Okay, my fellow patrons of MAL, we need to have a serious talk. How in the actual fuck is this rated a 7 out of 10 average? Like seriously who\'s coming and watching this shit and going ""Oh yeah baby this is a masterpiece right here."" Anyways, on with the review. I did my best to clean this review up for spoilers, but I kinda have to at least break the first episode wide open to rate the series for you.Story 2/10: The ""plot"" if you can even call it that, is a continuation of the last season 2 years after the events it ended...on. Now, I didn\'t love the last season or anything, but it had its strengths. One of those strengths was a strong, Albeit somewhat out of character for our protagonist, ending that had three of the four major developed characters die on camera. Surprise surprise, they\'re all alive. No one died in the climactic ending of the first season. I won\'t go into all that much detail about it because I\'m getting a migraine just remembering it, but it was pretty BS. So yeah, the rest of the show is Slaine using Asseylum\'s sister (she exists now btw) as a body double for Princess Asseylum to rally the orbital knights to end the ceasefire and go back to war with earth.It was Absolutely abhorrent, I promise to you I\'m not that smart, but this show manages to go above and beyond to insult even my troglodyte intelligence levels. Normally this would be the area where I would put down more or my personal opinions on this aspect of the show, but I think the bias I riddled into my plot summary speaks plenty as to how shit the story is.Art 7/10: Honestly one of the better parts about the show. Most of the robots are interesting and have eye-catching designs, but a good handful of the martian ones look like someone entrusted the design process to a 9-year-old Roblox modder and just told him ""Make something that shoot\'s lighting or some shit."" The clash between 3d and 2d animation is a little weird when they\'re both in the same frame, but most of the time it\'s not really an issue, and the art is handled well.The action leaves a lot to be desired, and the action always felt kinda clunky with the 3d animators wanting to move the robots as little as possible and just have them standing around shooting, it got pretty boring pretty quickly and just felt lazy overall. The world feels kinda empty in the few shots you do get off it, and everything else art-based is alright.Sound: 8/10: The best part of the show by far. The intro is meh and the outros are bleh but everything in between is YES. The only reason this isn\'t higher is cause they recycle a few tracks a little past their welcome but other than that it was awesome. The voice acting was great, but the sound design was amazing. Even though I hate action scenes where everyone is standing around shooting, the guns sound great, and hearing them go off, along with everything else on the battlefield you can hear, is really well done and deserves praise. That is where the praise for this show stops, onto the next part.Characters 1/10: 1/10 was a rating I didn\'t think I would ever have the honor to hand out. I used to look at people leaving reviews on things and see they left the lowest possible score and think ""Okay, maybe it was bad but nothing is really THAT bad.""Unfortunately for me, this WAS that bad. I am genuinely surprised it managed to be this shit in this department, but the last season didn\'t leave me with high hopes so let\'s just jump right into it.Kaizuka, InahoBy far the worse character in the entire show. Zero development, at least some of the other characters had ATTEMPTED to develop just a tiny bit by Inaho never budges even the slightest bit. As if he wasn\'t already stupid overpowered last season, with no explanation, of course, this season turns to dial way up to ten. After he was fatally shot but miraculously survived, they replaced his left eye with a (I shit you not, this is actually what they did I promise I\'m not exaggerating this) fucking computer that\'s linked to his brain and lets him see and prosses literally everything around him at lighting quick speed with virtually no consequence. The eye allows him to never miss shots, see enemies that are 100% invisible, process relevant information and instantly send it to his teammates, and so so much more. If he was Jesus last season, he died, rose from the dead with his new brain-computer that does literally everything, and became God. He is unkillable, and the layer of plot armor around him is so dense it has its own gravitation field strong enough to single-handedly kill the entire series via fall damageSlaineAn objectively good character in the first season, oh how the mighty have fallen. As the main bad guy of the show, he lies, cheats, steals, and kills friends more than foe almost indiscriminately with no clear objective. He\'s an absolute joke.Asseylum:This part contains minor spoilers, skip to the next character if you don\'t wanna see em.[spoiler]Sadly she wakes up from her coma and comes in contact with Inaho who was supposed to be her love interest for a few minutes in one episode. Zero development, equally as bad as Inaho but I just have less to say about her due to her limited screen time[/spoiler]KouichirouThe war vet from Heavens Fall for those of you who don\'t remember. Didn\'t get any more screen time than anyone else on the supporting cast, but I liked the dude and wished they gave him ANYTHING this season. Easily the best-written character, but they basically threw him out.All the other supporting characters were basically nonexistent this season, even ones with minor to major development last season are just kicked away and ignored.Enjoyment 3/10: I didn\'t like this show, and it was really had to finish when I realized about halfway through it wasn\'t getting any better, and I just couldn\'t look away from the train wreck. Inaho is one of the worst protagonists I have ever had the pain of watching and it hurts so much. Every single fight in this show is just a rundown of the following that even someone as stupid as I am would be able to figure out.1. Oh no, it\'s an enemy martin with some crazy zany abilities and it\'s killing all of our guys! How will we ever kill it?2. Don\'t worry guys, Inaho here, I just crunched some numbers with my cyborg eye-brain calculation thingy and figured out how to kill it.3. Invincible martin dead, Inaho unscathed and unphased like the God he is.Overall 3/10: Don\'t watch this show, I don\'t normally encourage people away from most media cause even if I don\'t like something, someone else might but this is just a new level of awful. Download the soundtrack or watch a handful of fight scenes of it on YouTube, please for the love of god just don\'t bother with the entire show. on.

In this review I will be focusing on the good aspects, since all the bad ones have already been written in depth.So why did I give it a good review? There are a few reasons why. I personally feel that there are many other animes that are worse than this, and it should not be deserving such a low score. I also wish for the creators to...be recognised for their work. This is an original anime, and you must admit that the animation was pretty darn good. Next, I think that this anime deserve views. Unlike what some other reviewers claim, I feel that those who finished season 1 should continue with season 2. I mean, with the massive cliffhanger in season 1, who would not want to find out what happens next?So now, moving on to the good qualities of this anime.Similar to other good animes, Aldnoah.Zero made me hyped up for all the action to come, and successfully stir up emotions in me. I also feel the same sadness and longing for more when the anime ended.The music does not need to be elaborated upon. It is epic.This anime takes the action genre very seriously. Every episode is action packed. be recognised for their work. This is an original anime, and you must admit that the animation was pretty darn good. Next, I think that this anime deserve views.

A few times it was actually sloppy it seemed, but for the most part was still good...just not on the same level as Season 1 was.Characters...well I like the characters for the most part but I blame the portions I don't like on story/writing.  The story was simply not as good in this one because many of the actions of the characters didn't make sense.  They felt forced, especially Slain.  I...wish they had stayed truer to how Season 1 felt...minus the last episode where things started to get questionable.  Then how they followed up and explained the final episode of season 1 in the first couple of episodes of season 2 just set the stage for a season that in no way could follow up to S1.I will say that had this been a standalone show, with no season 1, I may have rated it an 8.  As it is however, it is a bit of a let down after experiencing Season 1 and I admit I was a bit disappointment at how they shifted some of the characters and story, which is what left this as a 7 instead.Still a good and entertaining watch, but still had hoped for more after seeing S1, as it was truly great. wish they had stayed truer to how Season 1 felt...minus the last episode where things started to get questionable.

However, I personally feel that this is a great second season.The story picks up from where we left off and hints at things to come while also reestablishing the overarching plot and what has happened so far. The story is good, as it really does go off of what we know so far very well. However, coming from the first season, the story this time around is a bit more chaotic and all over the place. With the way the first season ended, it left me wondering what would the...second season do. After watching this season, I still don\'t get why they did what they did in the first season. Some parts are done in order to introduce a new mechanic to the story while others are done merely to add controversy. After all this, the overall season was very boring somehow, despite so much going on all the time.

This time around, however, they seemed to want to do more with this and were willing to soil his character with OP smarts. The rest of the characters are all relying on him too much this time around as well, whether they are aware of it or not. Slaine\'s character, however, was better utilized this time around. Some characters were handled poorly while others were handled with care, which throws things off. Unfortunate, but this is the case.The animation quality is still the same as the first season.

He’s left his fellow comrades to help...you , how can he hurt you? If you’re afraid that he’s a spy , just keep an eye on him and use him later , I know you’re Smarter than this!…and what the hell do you mean by “ use her for your own end?! ” ”…Let’s pass away this one…I have No problem with shooting Inaho but why did you first try to save Saazbaum from getting killed by Inaho? What would you accomplish by doing this? He’s tried to kill your beloved Princess while Inaho is trying to protect her during the mission? then you didn’t have to suffer for the Princess’s Injury.In the second season Slaine got completely insane…like you know that the Princess wants peace , so why are you trying to attack the earth after killing Saazbaum?  I mean you shouldn’t  got that serious , just use the fake Princess to put an end to the war!...and why the hell did the Princess Married some random guy in her way? You can gain authority on him just by doing nothing!Positive Aspects:There were a lot of this plot holes…but let’s be a bit positive , The Background Music was by Hiroyuki Sawano which worked on AOT and was Awesome , and changed my view on Mecha animes which I hated…but  the overall action was great and the plot made me watch it to the end to see what happens next. it was actually kind of addicting. You would definitely like the Battles and the way Inaho finds his enemy weakpoints and how he defeats them. Also it’s kind of Awesome seeing each side doing differend operations to stop their foe. It’s not definitely a Masterpiece but was Entertaining and worth to watch…I would Recommend watching it… you , how can he hurt you?

In season 1, shit was fucking real dude, count something something shaazum was shooting niggas and slaine shot both his boss in ep 2 or something and Inaho.

But A-1 films decided that they should milk more out of the franchise and make the anime shit.  For people who wants to watch this season of Aldnoah, dont.

The angles are quite nicely drawn as well and everything is quite in proportion (there isnt girls with huge tits, small body and eyes bigger than their mouth)Sound:The music is one of the best ones ive ever heard from animes.  Hiroyuki Sawano's music are never bad.  The battle music and the OST are really good as well.Character:All the characters are really well developed.

Honestly the character development is quite good but then i just absolutely despise Slaine.Enjoyment:The OP is really good,  ED is really good as well.  Just that people being too pussy to kill people really ruins this season.

Just that people being too pussy to kill people really ruins this season.  Honestly if possible ill give enjoyment a solid 0 because it ruined season 1.Overall:Everything is really well made, except for the plot where if people actually pulled the trigger the story can have a lot more plot twists eg the princess pretending to be Slaine etc."", 'IntroThere were times where I don’t really care about analytical way of seeing anime, and just watch them mindlessly. Yes, it is when I just came to this hobby. At that times, every single anime is actually stood out to me and I could pretty much talk about how good they are.Now its been roughly 6 years since I started, yes I am still new but there is one thing that have been bothering me since years ago, and that was Aldnoah.Zero. Honestly speaking, like any other anime on my early days, Aldnoah.Zero got a pretty high rank from me, but not to everybody else....Why? That is the question that I wanted to asked and I am here after I watch it few more time and oh boi I was wrong. So, without further ado, LETSGO!Story + CharacterIn the beginning of the series, humanity has divided into 2, the Terrans, humans that lived on earth, and Martians, humans that lived on Mars. This words is literally everywhere on the series like its forgetting the word “human” and just go racist. Anyway, Martians lived on Mars due to the discovery of Aldnoah which literally fuel up everything. This makes them dissociate themselves from the Terrans. Even though that Aldnoah fuels up everything, resource in Mars is limited, so they invaded earth in search for resource (why the hell they didn’t think about that in the first place? HMM). Coming long way from Mars, they bring their mechs or Kathaprakt, and their flying castle with them.On earth, humanity- I mean Terrans has developed their own kathaprakt after seeing them in the first war (which failed due to certain reason) but it lack of power due to fact that they don’t have aldnoah.The premise is actually really good and the first episode will likely leave a strong impression on your mind. But things went downhill from that point. I’ll get to the character first before going back to this.The characters are pretty much predictable, our main protagonist (which still in highscool), and his friends, the Princess of Vers (yes, im aware of spoiler so chill guys), and our main antagonist, any other character is poorly made (except Lt. Marito which is really good in season 1) to the fact that we dont and the story don’t care about them anymore in the second cour. To make it simple ill introduce the mains as these: Bland-oversmart main character, too-plain Princess, and what-is-in-his-mind antagonist. I know justifying their character as that is horribly but like I said, to make it simple (and it hurts your hearts if you overthink about them).Now back again to the main problems, the story has this particular way of telling which part is the main focus of now, not by following the “plot”, not by resolving around the main character, but the story resolve around the Princess. Some may think that the story changes a lot from season 1 to season 2 (which it is), but it’s not random, it’s just because of this not-so-popular formula.That and the fact that none of the main leads have a believable reason to develop their character is already enough to turn down this series. And I guess that is what happened.Animation + MusicAldnoah.Zero was a collaboration project of A-1 Pictures and TROYCA. The collab is actually good due the fact that TROYCA can cover what A-1 Pictures lack of: maintaining quality. That is why we got some solid animation throughout the season, heck even throuthout the series.The down side of the production is actually the use of BAD CG (INPUT GIGGUK sound) yes Gigguk, Bad CG. The use of CG is pretty much the same as Initial D. For tou who doenst know about Initial D, I mean that it is pretty bad. I guess it’s the only thing that is good from second season, the fact that we don’t really see the mech (In the space) so we didn’t really bothered with it.Aldnoah.Zero has 2 famous composers on its back. Kajiura Yuki and Sawano Hiroyuki. Which is I don’t know why but has much downside that the good side. The thing is that we cant have 2 primary color in a single anime. That’s why the first season’s OP and ED feels don’t match. I appreciate the decision of letting Kajiura Yuki go and went full Sawano for the second season, even though that it’s decent, but it has it’s own colour.Wrap UpSo in the end, it turns out that there is so many downside of the series. But even so, I still enjoy the times rewatching it for this review. I don’t actually sure why, but I guess I just weak for main protagonist that smartly use his brain to win a fight. The first season, is actually quite enjoyable overall with pretty good climax. But things gotten worst in the second season thus the first season’s climax feels not believable, which led to my biggest disappointment of all. Oh and by the way, Aliez is the only track that I listen to recently, and is the strongest that reminds me of this series.So I bring you Aldnoah.Zero with the final rank of B that it’s up to you to watch it or not, but it has the “give it a try of your own” from me. As for three of recommendations I give you, Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann, the obvious ones but I need to recommend it because Guren Lagann is the one that teaches me what is Mech anime and what it is to be a man, then I suggest you Darling in the FRANXX for some real character development, it is not finished yet but I have a strong faith in it, and lastly Heavy Object, it is written by my favorte light novel writer and the main protagonist also use his brain to save the day.

I really enjoyed the first season because of Slaine's character and the plot twist I didn't expect. Also, it was a new story that I could get into. But in this second season, it took everything I loved about this character, threw it in my face, and gave it a happy ending to Inaho, which happens to be one of the blandest characters in most anime I've seen. If anything, I recommend watching the first season for its music, well animated scenes, and the development of Slaine and other side characters such...as Rayet and Cruhteo. I'm so disappointed; I wanted a lot more of this season. I gave it a 6 because I love Slaine as a character. as Rayet and Cruhteo. I'm so disappointed; I wanted a lot more of this season. I gave it a 6 because I love Slaine as a character."", ""Wow just wow one of the best show I have ever watched in the first season only to have it end like this.I could not wait to see the second season of the show but almost everything that was good about it was torn to sheds.The characters made sense and their decisions too in the first season but now they all seem to just stop and the do opposite in this season I was left asking why a lot and I am still asking 3 years later after finishing.Pace at times was awful and new characters are thrown in at out of no where with...no backstory given or their is one given so fast you have to watch it twice.I am still mad at how this ended my advice to you don't watch the first season so you won't me mad at binging let down. no backstory given or their is one given so fast you have to watch it twice.I am still mad at how this ended my advice to you don't watch the first season so you won't me mad at binging let down."", ""I'm going to sum up pt 1 here too. The ending of part 1 was good and I overall liked part 1 more than part 2. Part 1 showed more charcater with Inaho and everyone, while part 2 showed more mars development and the reasoning (I just explained everything bad rn) what i mean is i liked part 1 a lot more because it was a bit more enjoyable and emotional. In part 1 we learned about the characters and there were more deaths that mattered. Meanwhile in part 2 we learn more about Slaines progression through the rankings and his goal and how he...wanted to demolish war, so he had to get rid of Earth. Slaine did few good things in this part (he was shown being human, but he fucked up massively) He tried to get rid of Earth (honestly idk what I would do in his situation because he didn't think Asseylum would wake up during his conquer but its fucked up because if she never woke up than everyone on earth would be dead, but Slaine and Asseylum would be together on Earth during the endless peaceful era) Slaine just ended down the wrong path by saving Sazzbaum, but without that Asseylum would die. Speaking of Saazbaum his death is kind of sad tbh. I thought Saazbaum would hate Slaine for saving Asseylum but its the opposite Slaine betrayed Saazbaum right after he adopted Slaine. Saazbaum wasn't a good person, but I liked it whenever they talked about taking earths resources and Saazbaum said that it would only help out the high class people. Basically meaning its only to benefit the rich. Saazbaum thought about how to help the lower classes, but it never developed. I also liked how Saazbaum isn't completely taking over earth for the resources or jealousy. Hes doing it for revenge against his wife's death. Cruhteo was a good character too in part 1. I like that he was truly loyal to Asseylum but when he found out that Slaine was loyal beyond torture it was too late and he was murdered. Once that happened i liked Cruhteo but he then died:( before we got to see his character shine he dies by Saazbaum:(. Apart from the loyal servant Slaine had there isn't too much for the Marzians. I like how Slaine was though before he wanted to conquer Earth. He went to Earth to save Asseylum he killed the traitors to Asseylum who tried to assassinate her, but then he tries to rescue her again but Hes too late and see's her get shot by Saazbaum. Than he saves her life in the end, but he tried to conquer Earth. All of this could've been avoided if Inaho didn't attack Slaine whenever they found the ship. Than Slaine would've met Asseylum and would've been on their side since the start. Now lets talk Inaho. Hes super smart and collected. My complaint in the first season is how we never see him scared or terrified when Hes about to die. Apart form the last episode of part 1. Inaho has said that he was scared, but personally its hard to see since he always looks calmed and collected, but in part 2 we get to see him in pain and frustrated. Since the end of part 1 he got a mechanical eye which works super well for him (honestly why don't more soldiers have mechanical bodies. It works perfectly for Inaho. Like Inaho said it only helps him 30% of the time which is still something) and he overworks himself with the eye which causes him massive amounts of pain. Good thing he doesn't rely too much on his eye, but I liked that. We finally got to see him in pain. Sure he was  bloody and he was injured in part 1 but its more sad when u see him unable to process things. My biggest complaint with Inaho in part 2 is that Hes literally impossible to defeat with his new eye. His eye calculates things such as position, height, location, depth, gravity all under 30 seconds. He can easily shoot in space by calculating the mass of asteroids and adding other asteroids and finding out the movement of the enemies and he always hits. Holy shit this makes him impossible to beat (except whenever Hes out of his Mecha or his eye hurts) In part 1 we got to see him getting wrecked or losing battles but since he has a mechanical eye his perfect at so many things. I didn't like that. Its like he was a A+ student in all physic classes and Hes good at using mechas and he can use strategies mid battle beating enemies. A good thing about this anime are the strategies . They're pretty far and really logical too.Heres an example Lasers shoot forward; however, missiles have gravity and since the earth is a global circle the lasers wont hit a target if they're super far in the ocean; however the missiles can thanks to gravity. Thats a great strategy to use. and others too with protected areas not covering the whole body. Like how u can have pads everywhere or else your movement will be impaired severely.Now lets talk side characters.Inko is horrible why does she like Inaho Hes not very considerate, but he does seem cool and why do they even try with a romance subplot? The best thing about her is her friend group in the 2nd part which is Rayet and the other girl.Yuki Shes a pretty cool character, but she makes mistakes a lot and isnt very reliable, but she gets the job done. Shes Inahos older sister which is cool and she tries to protect Inaho a lot, but I wonder if she knows why Inahos like this? Has he always been calm and collected or just silent. I liked it whenever at the end of part 1 Inaho looked at his bookmark Yuki made for him it was pretty sad bc it was a 50/50 chance they could survive doing a suicidal mission, but luckily the main cast survived the descent onto a enemy ship. I really liked that. Yuki is probably one of my favorite side characters in the anime bc what she means to Inaho. I liked it whenever Inaho yelled at Yuki bc she messed up in battle. Because he was being real and not so affectionate then.Rayet I dont really like her but her backstory's pretty sad, but she creeped me out whenever she choked out Asseylum. I understand why but that just freaked me out. I like how in part 2 she makes a firend group with Inko (which makes Inko a better character because she isn't dependent on Inaho all the time, I like how its shown in the opening) I also like how her and Inaho let Maazurek escape and how Inaho kept telling her that she's changed form the time she almost killed Asseylum. Apart from that idrc about her.Marito was a cool character. I like how in part 1 he had trauma that couldn't let him fight but in part 2 he was able too thxs to the doctors prescription of reliving the trauma. Marito also has wits to him because he was able to help Inaho figure out the arrow techniques and other things, but his trauma allowed him to get the enemy in position for Inaho to destroy one of the Mecha's . He also has a friendship with the doctor and Yuki which is cool, but apart form that not much, but he is a rememberable character.Calm hes probably Inahos coolest friend from school. I like how Calm was able to help Inaho in Inahos second battle where he distracted the Mecha and Inko used the crane. I really liked that battle because it showed everyone working together compared to the other fights. I wish Calm wasn't just a  engineer but it kind of worked out because Hes decent at it and him and Inaho were school friend's. My biggest complaint which is horrible is that he forgave Asseylum for getting his friend killed in the first episode because she's pretty and a girl. Calm was so determined to avenge his friend and kill all Marzians but whenever he found out that the Marzian on board was a girl he forgave her. what the fuck. That ruined his character for me, but I still liked him more than Inko.The ending- Honestly everything that happened was thanks to Inaho and I wonder how many medals he won. Inaho is clearly respected and being honest. In part 1 Inahos goal was to survive and the best way to do so was to defend from the Mechas and help Asseylum stop the ship. In the second part Inaho did a lot to help Asseylum and that's because Asseylum tried helping INaho when he was about to die and I liked that change in character. Hes motives changed and you can see that with him freeing Mazuurek. I like the difference between first part him and second part (except his bionic eye)With Slaine a lot changed. You could move with him and believe everything Hes doing is right, but then u think of everyone from earth (basically the whole first part) and you realize Hes in the wrong. If only Inaho let Slaine see Asseylum things would be different. I like how the ending is happy, but it's also sad too. Not everyone wins. Slaine put himself down the wrong path and can u really blame him? He though Asseylum would be asleep for more years, but im glad she woke up. everyone would've died and she would've died because of Lemrina.I wish the main duo had something different. Instead of them hating each other I wish they talked more (just like the end of the last episode with Inaho and Slaine finally talking face to face)It reminds me of a worse version of Lelouch and Suzaku. When they were still friends, they had arguments and more like that (Ik it would've been hard/impossible to replicate the same thing, but still this duo feels worse. Slaine and Inaho are not equal. I didn't even know that Slaine knew how to use a mecha. Slaines backstory is sad though, but its also fascinating a kid from earth going to mars and meets Asseylum who saves your life and now your on a different planet than u rise through the ranks. Its not like he lost loyalty towards Asseylum because even after 2 years he kept meeting with her and showing her stories while she was asleep. It sad because she was loyal to her but betrayed her beliefs. In the end everyone believes Hes dead except Hes in a prison wanting to die. wanted to demolish war, so he had to get rid of Earth. Slaine did few good things in this part (he was shown being human, but he fucked up massively) He tried to get rid of Earth (honestly idk what I would do in his situation because he didn't think Asseylum would wake up during his conquer but its fucked up because if she never woke up than everyone on earth would be dead, but Slaine and Asseylum would be together on Earth during the endless peaceful era) Slaine just ended down the wrong path by saving Sazzbaum, but without that Asseylum would die.

In the end everyone believes Hes dead except Hes in a prison wanting to die."", ""Phew... okay... time to start talking about the 2nd season of Aldnoah Zero. Please be aware that there may be MINOR spoilers (more-so for the first season), but I'll do my absolute best to minimize them.Season 1 of Aldnoah Zero left so many things in the air that, to be quite frank made my jaw drop. It left an amazing cliffhanger and had SO much potential to change the direction of the narrative. This left me excited for what was going to happen in Season 2 and almost had me giddy to watch future episodes.Season 2 let me down in regards to this. The overall...story of this anime pales in comparison to the first season. There is some political intrigue, but it felt that the hugely increased stakes and potential direction of the narrative fizzled out and left us with a decent story, but one that can only be a shadow to what it could have been.Another unfortunate thing this season suffered is a decrease in development for the supporting characters. I'm a big sucker for supporting characters to have some form of arc for their character, however minor. These characters were definitely portrayed in the anime to fulfill a certain role, but it feels like the writers pushed them aside for the grander narrative which again, paled in comparison to Season 1.The action in this anime (both the first and second season) is always very good. Having a soundtrack playing through impactful battles just heightens the tension of the conflict even further. Seeing certain abilities of certain robots was also quite the highlight.Overall this was a pretty meh continuation of the first season. The first season left so many things open with a great cliffhanger and this season feels like it didn't fully capitalize on it. It's the same with certain characters development as well.Season 1 did a great job of setting up the ground work, and this season story-wise did a pretty average job of utilizing it. The action was great, much like the previous season, but the amount of investment I had suffered due to the lack of interesting plot. 6/10. story of this anime pales in comparison to the first season. There is some political intrigue, but it felt that the hugely increased stakes and potential direction of the narrative fizzled out and left us with a decent story, but one that can only be a shadow to what it could have been.Another unfortunate thing this season suffered is a decrease in development for the supporting characters.

These characters were definitely portrayed in the anime to fulfill a certain role, but it feels like the writers pushed them aside for the grander narrative which again, paled in comparison to Season 1.The action in this anime (both the first and second season) is always very good. Having a soundtrack playing through impactful battles just heightens the tension of the conflict even further. Seeing certain abilities of certain robots was also quite the highlight.Overall this was a pretty meh continuation of the first season. The first season left so many things open with a great cliffhanger and this season feels like it didn't fully capitalize on it. It's the same with certain characters development as well.Season 1 did a great job of setting up the ground work, and this season story-wise did a pretty average job of utilizing it. The action was great, much like the previous season, but the amount of investment I had suffered due to the lack of interesting plot. 6/10."", ""This review contains spoilers of the first season.The second season doubles down on the same faults of the first season. Story makes little sense. Random action with random mechas with random powers. Plot tries to get smart at times but it feels forced and contrived. All relevant characters continue to be annoying or boring or both. The characters that had some traces of personality barely get any screen-time. The plot is nonsensical. The Plot Holes are a constant.The first season is awful but ends with a bang. Two main characters get killed. And I mean really killed, the princess takes two close range shots, one...to the chest and another to the head. Inaho gets a frontal shot to the head through the left eye at point blank range. So they are dead right? Of course not... they both survive and they are just fine. The princess takes some time to recover and the boring boy gets a cybernetic eye that makes him even more overpowered than he already was. I was hoping that one of them would actually die, preferably the boy because he is insufferably boring. You can't push Plot Armor more than this, its just baffling.Then we have more than one scene where mechas are fighting in space and complaining about the unpredictable wind... yeah, the unpredictable wind in space... but you may ask, why? why would the writers pull such nonsense. Well its simple, they had to show how amazing Inaho was with his cybernetic eye compared to the secondary characters, so Inaho can use his eye to somehow predict the unpredictable wind and hit the enemy, while the others in their billion dollar mechas don't have this feature, because basic logic doesn't matter.But why do I bring up this two scenes. Its simple, it shows right away that this anime is about an initial concept, an idea, and then random things are just thrown around, for shock value, for time filling, for convenience and to make the characters look cool (but in fact only makes them look obnoxious and cringy). I'm not saying that building something around an idea is bad, I'm just saying that Aldnoah.Zero does it in the worst possible way.Since it's clear what the show is about and what archetypes each character represents, everything happens exactly as I had imagined. I really struggled to watch this anime and I could only do it while doing other things at the same time. to the chest and another to the head.

It heavily focuses on my favorite character Slaine so if you dislike him or his relationship with the princess this season isn\'t for you. Slaine is bound to be defeated by the ""hero"" of the show Inaho, but you get to deeply understand Slaine\'s motivation for fighting and the messed up things he does. As a hero Inaho falls flat as he emotionless-ly is able to destroy everyone and have better chances of being with the princess. The ending might be tragic but the entire show is enjoyable and worth the watch. Not just for the...romance and space politics but for Gundam fans to see awesome robots fight each other. romance and space politics but for Gundam fans to see awesome robots fight each other.', ""So with season 1 I gave it a very generous score and I am also doing that here because overall I'm not too critical and can enjoy most anime I watch.So spoilers for episode 1 of this season nothing that happened in the last scene of season 1 mattered as even though Inaho definitely got shot in the head and died and the princess should have too they are both alive for this season. The season starts with some random ice mecha but no mecha like this shows up again which leaves unique mecha powers which could be interesting behind and instead they go...for the all in on Slaine's character which leads to basically nothing happening all season, this season was needed and stretches about 5 episodes worth of content into 12. Nothing really happens until around episode 4 and then nothing else happen after that until about episode 10. The characters still aren't developed at all except Slaine really but the CGI is still good and so is the music so those 2 elements are the best things about the show. Inaho's new robot eye thing can basically do anything so the action gets very repetitive and uninteresting especially since most of the battles have no effect on the story and are just there to fill out the run time as the story only progresses when we are with Slaine and that's still at a snails pace.Overall this season is garbage and probably not even bearable for most people unlike the first season which just felt a bit shallow in the character department but the music and animation is good this season so I will give it a 6 but honestly it could be a 5, Just watch season 1. for the all in on Slaine's character which leads to basically nothing happening all season, this season was needed and stretches about 5 episodes worth of content into 12.

SPOILERS are mentioned.I first heard of this anime as I was playing its 2nd opening, &Z by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki, on osu!. I vibed A LOT to that opening and aLIEz by the same artist. Intrigued, I gave this anime a go and I finished within 2 days! I\'ll be giving a different review than most of the ones that are trashing on such a slept-on anime.Aldnoah.Zero (AZ) gives you so much action and hooks to keep your eyes on the screen for as long as it can. I finished the second season in ONE sitting. The...mechs have unique abilities, there is in-fighting present (in both seasons) rather than a simple ""good guy vs. bad guy"" type of cliche, the atrocities of war are deeply emphasized and detailed sympathetically, and cliffhangers! Some dislike the ending and cliffhanger of the first season, but for me it spiked my interest and made me worry, sympathize, and attach myself to the characters. The story is overall very interesting and praise-wrothy, it succeeded my expectations.The character development is satisfactory. Each of the main characters has a unique personality and motivation that drive them as soldiers of the United Forces of Earth. I love Inaho\'s intelligence, Slaine\'s troublesome endeavours, the positive spirits of Princess Asseylum, etc. Not much ""evolving"" really happened, though. But don\'t let that alone give you a dissatisfactory rating for AZ. The MC\'s (good ones) work constantly with each other, provide support to one another, and the plot goes by fast anyways. The first season is literally continuous without any breaks, I think. With war being on their minds 24/7, the process of preparation, strategization, combat, and recovery is repeated and leaves little room for character development. This process is executed while incorporating many of the critical aspects of this awesome anime.I enjoyed the story as well. For many parts of AZ, especially the second season, I was heavily invested and shocked to the point where I had to pause an episode and take a breather. I was always whispering or thinking stuff like ""Holy sh*t you are so screwed"" or ""bro WHAT?"" I GENUINELY loved the plot progression. Don\'t think about AZ as a simple plot diagram where you have an exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Think about there being quite the few plot diagrams in each season. This isn\'t actually the case but to me, that\'s how it felt like. And I was thrilled and excited.Some extra stuff: SawanoHiroyuki and Mizuki\'s music CARRIED this anime. All of the openings and endings were INCREDIBLY fitting to the anime. The music, overall, really gave AZ that pathway into recognition that it deserves. The music furthermore expresses the themes and grandness of AZ. The sountracks elevated KEY plot points and events and heightened viewing experience.If I had to give some feedback:-The design on many of the Martian Kataphrakts were ugly IMO.-I wish there was more backstory regarding the ancient civilization and Aldnoah.

Gokujou Seitokai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/456/Gokujou_Seitokai,"[""Gokujou Seitokai is a lovely, rather under-appreciated series.  Certainly if it were defined by its genre (a school comedy), it would not stand out from the million other school comedies, all with more cute, young characters filled to the brim with moeness (and who induce purely visceral &quot;kyaaa!&quot;, squeals, or nosebleed reactions).Gokujou Seitokai follows the formulaic school comedy idea fairly closely, and boasts a rather, if you will, clich&eacute; student council centric cast.  But this is also where this series shines.  I left something out when I said this series fell into the school comedy genre because technically speaking, this is a...satirical school comedy.We need not go far to find evidence of this; just the title of this series alone has satirical elements to it.  &quot;Seitokai&quot;, as you might already know, means &quot;student council&quot;.  &quot;Gokujou&quot;, then, is actually an abbreviation-- the full title of this series should actually be Miyagami Gakuen Gokudai Kengen Hoyuu Saijoukyuu Seitokai (Miyagami Academy Maximum Authority Holders Ultimate Level Student Council).  I hardly need to point out it pokes fun at ridiculously long titles and names for things to make them sound impressive (think &quot;ultimate attacks&quot; in fighting anime series).  Because of this satirical take, the series is not hindered but actually made better by its simple and rather predictable storyline.Art-wise, it's fair enough to not really bother you either way.  The animation is less than stellar, and sometimes you're left wondering where the heck the characters are looking at since they usually seem to have far-off gazes to their eyes. It shouldn't bug the average anime viewer very much, though.  I didn't even notice it when I watched it the first time around.  Colour-wise, this series goes with softer pastel colours, and it really goes well with the vibrant cheeriness that Gokujou Seitokai exudes.The OP and ED are very good, in my opinion.  Before I really get into the songs, I must say, it's particularly surprising that Gokujou Seitokai isn't more popular.  It has an astounding seiyuu cast, with most (I'm talking 75% and above) being veterans and solidly A-list seiyuu.  I won't elaborate too much on this since not everyone is into seiyuu (or even original Japanese audio), but if you are interested in seiyuu, I urge you to take a look at the cast.  And although it has an impressive seiyuu cast, I can't give higher than 8/10 because there weren't any gut-wrenchingly mind-blowing scenes for the seiyuu to perform at their full capacity.Now, the songs.  Tamura Yukari sings the upbeat, cheery OP.  It works, to say the least, since Tamura has one of the most moe voices I know.  Oh, and this might be a concern for less serious anime goers.  You may find the protagonist (voiced by Tamura) to be a little too high-pitched.  I remember it getting on my nerves before I got my bearings and got used to the relatively high-pitched voices for girls in anime.  The ED is very good too, and it's sung by several veteran seiyuu.So... to put it shortly, I think this is a series I'd recommend to anyone who likes school comedies.  It's suitable for all levels of viewers.  Less serious anime viewers will like it for the hilarity, and people who've watched a gazillion school comedies will probably like it for the satirical elements.  It also has vague (but very there) f/f vibes.  It's played up for comedic value, but yuri fans will probably like it as well.  (Anti-yuri people probably won't mind it, since as I said, it's played for comedy.)  One thing to note, however, is that this does not have seinen-esque fanservice in the manner of cleavage shots or I-see-your-panties-and-get-massive-nosebleed gags despite the entirely female cast.

But the more I watched the more I found this series to be unique.- There doesn\'t seem to be a plot at the beginning but as the series goes on hints are thrown and it\'s slowly revealed.- While it seems completely like a comedy there is a nice amount of drama in itWhat It\'s About :- Mainly...it\'s a slice of life which revolves around the problems and situations that the student government council has to deal with. But unlike typical student governments they have more power than the staff themselves ( they also have quite of bit of money ), they even have their own Covert and Assault divisions. The fact that they are rich allows for quite a bit of creative and amusing situations.- While most of it is slice of life, there is a main plot hiding beneath everything. Rino is brought to the school by a mysterious penpal and as the series goes on the motivations and mystery is revealed.What I liked :+ A variety of interesting characters while each character gets an interesting background, personality, and story. The series doesn\'t just throw characters and expect you to like them, they actually make you care about them.+ Plenty of laughs to go around given the large cast of colorful characters and situations.+ Each episode is accompanied with a different story ( while slowing revealing the plot ) which keeps it from being repetitive.+ While it seems to be mainly a comedy it does take itself seriously at times. I found it emotional.+ The fact it centers around a powerful student council keeps it fresh and interesting. It allows interesting situations not typical in a slice of life series.+ Instead of slice of life from a student, it\'s from the perspective of the students that ""control"" the school.+ There\'s actually some nice action going on+ Cheery feel good Anime like others have mentioned+ It ended up nicely, though there are still questions that haven\'t been answered.What I didn\'t like :- The ending somewhat brought up more questions for me. I\'d explain but this is a spoiler free review.- Some questions left unanswered ( like the puppet ).- The twists aren\'t that big of a twist.Conclusion :I don\'t have much to complain since I found it to be a heart warming series. It has a more interesting take on the slice of life genre since the student council itself isn\'t your typical run of the mill student government.

The following three paragraphs will talk about my experience before watching this anime, so you can skip that if you want.I discovered it reading a post by an anime veteran (1200+ watched) in a gaming forum. There was some discussion going on about the current state of anime and he used Gokujou Seitokai as an example of an school comedy without any trace of fan service. I thought I should give it a try and tried to download it.I said I tried to download it because I didn\'t know this was so rare when I...tried to find it. I tried to get it via Torrent but none of them had seeders. I got a few torrents from the most popular anime sharing sites, and after over two months, someone appeared in the seeder list and I started to download it.At this point I forgot about the non-fanservice thing and just wanted to watch it because it was so rare. Even you search about it in Google, you won\'t find much. The IRC channel of the only fansub you can find that subbed Gokujou Seitokai, 3WA Subs, is empty. I was really curious to watch this. I didn\'t expect it to be good, I just wanted to satisfy my curiosity.I started this review saying that I didn\'t know why this wasn\'t popular. After watching just a few episodes, I was surprised that this unknown show I\'ve heard about in a discussion forum was so good. The best word to describe Gokujou Seitokai is ""enjoyable"". The episodes are really enjoyable to watch. They have an air of innocence and comedy that doesn\'t exactly feel unique, but the combination of everything creates a really good experience.The main character is Randou Rino, a young student that has nowhere to go after her mother died of an illness. At this point, her only \'friend\' is a puppet she calls Pucchan. Following a letter written by someone who identifies himself as ""Mr.Poppit"", she heads to the Miyagami School, and meets the Gokujou Seitokai.The Gokujou Seitokai is a student council that has more power than the school staff. They are considered fantastic by the school students and everyone loves them. They have all sort of unique members that resolves all kind of problems that may happen in Miyagami School. Being invited by the Student Council president and founder Miyagami School, Jinguji Kanade, Randou Rino joins the Student Council. The episodes usually follow her and the other Gokujou Seitokai members as they resolve all kind of situations.That anime veteran was right when he said it had no fanservice. We are so used to it that it feels strange. There is no fanservice at all. This is a school comedy without a single panty shot in the whole 26 episodes. The characters aren\'t unbelievable cute, they look normal instead. I know fanservice is not just sexualizing characters, but I don\'t believe you can find fanservice in any other form as well in Gokujou Seitokai. I don\'t take this as an necessarily good point - fanservice can be either good or bad depending on the situation and if its needed or not - but finding an anime of this genre with none at all was very interesting. Even if you don\'t like the genre, I\'d recommend watching it just for the reference.What makes Gokujou Seitokai so good is the experience from the viewer\'s point of view. While there isn\'t that much positive to talk in the sound department and even less in the visual (actually, there are some really ugly scenes),  the episodes are so well made it makes up for everything. The stories are fun and innocent, simple jokes and funny, unrealistic situations will make sure you\'ll have fun watching this.You should watch Gokujou Seitokai. Its an unknown, underrated, wonderful experience created by simple yet wonderful characters and a charming atmosphere. tried to find it. I tried to get it via Torrent but none of them had seeders.

They are considered fantastic by the school students and everyone loves them. They have all sort of unique members that resolves all kind of problems that may happen in Miyagami School. Being invited by the Student Council president and founder Miyagami School, Jinguji Kanade, Randou Rino joins the Student Council. The episodes usually follow her and the other Gokujou Seitokai members as they resolve all kind of situations.That anime veteran was right when he said it had no fanservice. We are so used to it that it feels strange. There is no fanservice at all. This is a school comedy without a single panty shot in the whole 26 episodes. The characters aren\'t unbelievable cute, they look normal instead. I know fanservice is not just sexualizing characters, but I don\'t believe you can find fanservice in any other form as well in Gokujou Seitokai. I don\'t take this as an necessarily good point - fanservice can be either good or bad depending on the situation and if its needed or not - but finding an anime of this genre with none at all was very interesting. Even if you don\'t like the genre, I\'d recommend watching it just for the reference.What makes Gokujou Seitokai so good is the experience from the viewer\'s point of view. While there isn\'t that much positive to talk in the sound department and even less in the visual (actually, there are some really ugly scenes),  the episodes are so well made it makes up for everything. The stories are fun and innocent, simple jokes and funny, unrealistic situations will make sure you\'ll have fun watching this.You should watch Gokujou Seitokai. Its an unknown, underrated, wonderful experience created by simple yet wonderful characters and a charming atmosphere.', ""This is my first review for an anime. However, my overwhelming enjoyment for this series compelled me to write a review. I feel like it is one of the most underrated animes. The inclusion of a puppet, Punchan, was a bit strange, but as I watched on I understood why he had to be one of the central characters to the story. The puppet is in fact alive and speaks and acts on his own accord when handled with a pair of hands.This is one of the few animes I've seen that constantly kept me laughing. Gokujou Seitokai is a surprisingly charming feel-good anime. The...very beginning had a striking similarity to Stawberry Panic, but there is no yuri at all.The Gokujou Student Council members protect the school and in doing so forge a tight-bound friendship with one another. They each have their own special abilities and in coming to Hiyami High School find their strengths. It's definitely one of my favorites. very beginning had a striking similarity to Stawberry Panic, but there is no yuri at all.The Gokujou Student Council members protect the school and in doing so forge a tight-bound friendship with one another.

Its amazing how each character became so in depth in such a small frame of time!I absolutely loved every minute of rewatching this! Some parts I had remembered...very clearly and others just were so exciting to rewatch and relearn again!This whole series is silly and fun! Just exactly what the doctor ordered during this time (corono-19 pandemic) and I would absolutely recommend this series to anyone that enjoys slice of life. Plus, for me, this series is pure nostalgia! Just what I needed during the shittiest of times lolBasically its a series that cares about its characters (main, side, background, all of the above) in a way that nurtures the viewer, rather than overextending the viewer's care. Its cute, fun, and it has some unexpecting loopholes in it.If you decide to watch it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! And I'm sincerely sorry if its still difficult to find subbed or dubbed!

Gravitation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/243/Gravitation,"[""I used to be such a fangirl for this series. Looking back, I can still see why I loved it so much, but I feel like I evaluate it with a more objective perspective now.STORY - I would venture to say that Gravitation was probably one of the first of its kind. Certainly, this was the title that opened the floodgates for hundreds of other shounen-ai titles at the turn of the century. Sure, if you pick through the music and ignore the gay pairing, you leave yourself with a simple, old-fashioned love story about one person pursuing another's love while a troubled past stands...between them. Nothing new there at all. But Murakami's decision to intermix a very strong musical plotline together with the core romance was a very smart move indeed and probably one of the main reasons I took to this series so readily. I really appreciated the fact that Shuichi's attention was split fifty-fifty between his career and Yuki -- this balance made things interesting in so many different ways because there were times when Shuichi's two goals seemed to go against each other and he had to decide which was more important. The fact that he sometimes had trouble putting one above the other made him easy to sympathize with, and it was refreshing to see that the romance wasn't always the absolute central point of the series.I also really enjoyed the insight into the music industry, though much of it was certainly exaggerated. It's amusing in a way how much I shirk away from caring about the rival bands and scandals for musicians in real life, but Gravitation got my attention anyway. The drama was good, and I suppose you grow to care about these characters much more than those in reality. Unfortunately, Yuki's deep, dark past could be considered the most clich&eacute; aspect of the entire series, and even in my fangirl days, I was never really impressed by it. Still, within the thirteen episode series, the subject is skirted around constantly and details always remain a bit fuzzy around the edges. I suppose it's partially because much of the series is very comedic and the horribly tragedies of the past are only explored enough for the present to make sense. It works alright enough, but it certainly isn't anything amazing.All in all, Gravitation's story is a good, fun twist on a simple, old love story. While not perfect by any means, it's still both a brilliant comedy and a touching romance, and there's enough little surprises to keep you excited for the entirety of its run!CHARACTER - I don't think there was a single bad character in this entire series. Each and every one of them had some sort of role to fill and had their moment in the spotlight. Though there were a few classic archetypes like Yuki, the dark and mysterious one, and Hiro, the best friend, somehow the little quirks in their personalities made them seem a little less typical. Yuki especially, armed with his tragic past, was an interesting character to follow because he himself admits that he doesn't understand himself. In retrospect, his probably wasn't the most accurate or the most convincing account of trauma and psychological health problems in the world, it works well enough for the story's purposes.Shuichi was a fun protagonist, considering he was also one of the series' primary sources of comedy relief (in the first episode, he was late for a meeting because he had to go save a turtle being harassed by a bunch of kids, you know). Spastic and crazy most of the time, he's moments of seriousness almost seem random, but where Yuki's past only worked well enough, Shuichi's dynamic personality actually worked very well. It's clear that his love started off as simple infatuation and that he had to deal with mostly un-reciprocated feelings for several episodes; it was thus intriguing to watch how his generally happy personality dealt with the chaos, turmoil, and heavy uncertainty that came with the relationship he found himself in. It was also nice to see a character that wasn't always sure of himself and his feelings -- even though it was easy for the audience to tell how he felt, Shuichi still questioned himself and the &quot;purity&quot; of his love wasn't cheapened by the absolute certainty other characters sometimes have.Pretty much all of the other characters are also worth mentioning, but I'll try to be more brief for the rest of them: Ryuuichi and Tohma are probably the most interesting characters aside from our main boys. Both front one image of themselves while maintaining ulterior motives that are both understandable, easy to sympathize with, and realistic enough, making them more whole as characters. K and Sakano, both wonderfully unique and quirky, aid Shuichi in the comic relief, and they do it oh so very well. Tachi, and to a lesser extent, the rest of ASK, are probably the flatest characters in the entire series, which is rather impressive, I think, because they're not that unbelievable of characters despite that. And though Gravi is a very obviously bishounen-centric series, the three whole female characters we get are all fairly respectable. Mika, Noriko, and Ayaka all serve their roles well and don't bring down their sex! Power to that.ART &amp; ANIMATION - The animation was more or less average. It wasn't outstandingly exceptional, but nor was it terrible and poorly done. Some introductory scenes are made to look like a live action piece, which made things interesting, but again it isn't anything eye-popping. The bright and flashing lights during performances were good and realistic; some of the backgrounds throughout the series also looked quite nice because of similar effects. Though the characters are drawn in a pretty generic style for the most part, super deformed chibi people jump in quite often for emphasis and comical effect. The &quot;normal&quot; characters don't much resemble Murakami's original style, but thats probably partially due to the fact that Murakami's style changed dramatically during the course of her twelve volume manga. The chibi style on the other hand, is pretty easy to recognize as Murakami's own.MUSIC - Gravitation is everything about the music. The music in this series is what makes it complete, and I wouldn't have it any other way. From beginning to end, Gravitation is filled with perfectly appropriate background music, no matter how long or short the clip or scene is. Many a times, insert songs are rehashed as soft instrumental and piano versions, helping to bring in familiar themes for emphasis and emotion.J-rock artist Kinya Kotani sings all of Bad Luck's music in the series. Though his music has changed significantly since his work in Gravitation, his work at the time suited Bad Luck very well because Kinya's personality was near identical to Shuichi's. Seriously! Someone like that actually did exist in real life! &quot;The Rage Beat,&quot; Bad Luck's main insert song is incredibly upbeat and energetic, perfect for pumping up the audience; it's also very inspiring to listen to and helps gear everyone up for some exciting confrontation. &quot;The Rage Beat&quot; actually plays once an episode for like the first five episodes, but you don't really tire of it. If anything, you get more excited for it every time. &quot;Blind Game Again,&quot; the band's other insert song is equally energetic, though a bit more serious sounding, which fits very well with when its used. Nittlegrasper's only song in the series is &quot;Sleepless Beauty,&quot; which is performed by K.ITO + D.K. (Kenichi Ito and Daisuke Kuroda) It's a breathtaking song and also suits the band very well.Funnily enough, Murakami obviously got her inspiration for some of the characters in Gravitation from real life groups. Nittlegrasper, a legend in the series, is comprised of Tohma Seguchi (keyboardist), Noriko Urai (keyboardist), and Ryuichi Sakuma (vocalist and lyricist). Nittlegrasper disbands with Ryuichi leaving to pursue a solo career in America, and Tohma becoming the president of NG, a producing company. Now, Icemen was a real life j-rock band, though they certainly weren't as famous as Nittlegrasper, they performed &quot;Shining Collection,&quot; Nittlegrasper's song in the Gravitation OVA. Icemen is comprised of Daisuke Asakura (keyboardist), Kenichi Ito (guitarrist), and Michihiro Kuroda (vocalist). Icemen disbanded in 2000 with Kuroda leaving to pursue a solo career in America, and Daisuke is now the very capable producer of many j-pop/j-rock bands. Including Kinya Kotani. And K.ITO + D.K. And Yousuke Sakanoue (who did Gravi's OP theme). NG produces all the music for Bad Luck. DA produces all the music for Kinya. Well, what a coincidence! The change that Murakami made was adding in Noriko, the purple-haired keyboardist in place of Kenichi, the red-haired guitarrist. But wait, Hiro, of Bad Luck, is a red-haired guitarrist! And they're both on white guitars no less! Guess she was trying to make it less obvious where she got her inspiration.Really though. The music in Gravitation is fantastic. The OP theme is one of the few that I actually sat through every single time because I was so enthralled by its energy. The ED theme is similarly entrancing, though with a slower, calmer melody. Good stuff guys, seriously.DUBBING &amp; VOCALS - The original voices in Gravitation are exceptional. A lot of renowned voice actors worked in this anime, and they all live up to their name. Seki Tomokazu works Shuichi's personality beautifully. His voice is energetic and strong when need be, and softer, more quiet and scared when need be; the emotion that rings in Shuichi's voice is incredibly convincing. Shuichi's singing voice is that of Kinya Kotani, and I've already rambled about that. Ryuichi's voice has a similar effect with emotion. Yamaguchi Kappei has played a lot of famous leads, including Ranma and Inuyasha, and though he doesn't play lead in this anime, his character is nonetheless quite essential and a good voice never hurt in that. And since Ryuichi's character changes so quickly from second to second, it's amazing that he sounds so good. His normal, chibi, cute character is fitted with a perfectly adorable and simply lovable voice. It really does sound as if a child is running around and squealing about the Monster Gao and cars going zoom. Then, quickly, in the blink of an eye, Ryuichi will be serious and his voice suiting him just as wonderfully.My favorite voice in the series is neither singer however, but rather, Tohma Seguchi, for he is voiced by Orikasa Ai. You can't really can't tell Tohma was voiced by a woman unless you already knew. She does a phenomenal job with it, making Tohma a strong and eeriely convincing character. He can show support and kindness when he wants to and give calm and simply chilling orders when he's irked. Tohma means buisness; he gets what he wants. And that's made perfectly clear. Orikasa Ai is also the voice of Ryoko from Tenchi Muyo!, and not to mention Quatre from Gundam Wing, who looks freakishly like Tohma's twin.Gravitation has been licensed and dubbed in the US by The Right Stuf International. Because TRSI hasn't worked with that many series, the names on the cast list are unfamiliar and unimpressive for the most part. I bought the first two DVDs when they came out and thus saw the first six episodes dubbed. I couldn't do it anymore after that. As a fan of the series, I realize I was probably (and still am) a bit purist about it, but I usually consider myself to have a pretty high tolerance for bad dubs (I made it through ten episodes of the 4Kids One Piece, after all). Gravitation's dub was just that awful. All of the characters sounded flat and unemotional, and they all sounded like they had the same voice actor. Shuichi wasn't nearly as energetic as he should have been. It was simply bizarre hearing Tohma with a very generic man's voice. Yuki's voice was probably the most forgivable, but that's probably because his archetype was the easiest to type cast for. One of these days, I might go back and watch those DVDs again for a second impression, but when the original is just so damn good, I don't know why I would. (My impression of the dub does not affect my score in the &quot;sound&quot; category of this review.)OVERALL - Gravitation really is a piece of work. It can go from absolutely hilarious to troublingly dark (and vice versa) in three seconds flat. You get two stories at once, two missions, two goals. You seem to jump back and forth from one to the other, but in truth, they're both intertwined through relationships and an mysterious history, making things quite intriguing. Gravitation is worth a watch, even if you aren't particularly fond of shounen-ai. In the end, it's a romantic comedy with a dark twist, and I've known a good number of people who don't care for the genre at all to have fallen in love with this series because the boy's love isn't the point. (Just a plus.) between them. Nothing new there at all.

(Just a plus.)"", ""The truth of the matter is that most shounen ai anime just isn't good; be it because of the crappy story, obvious fan service or bad direction. However, Gravitation doesn’t just pull it off as a shounen ai but as an anime in general.The story follows Shuichi Shindou, a 19 year old vocalist trying to make it big in the music industry and Eiri Yuki, a young, cool and cold romance novelist and pretty much revolves around the couple’s careers, love life and past. Nothing complicated or confusing neither is it plot less or pointless. The series is short, only 13 episodes long but...every episode is filled with quality; it’s well paced, never did it ever feel even slightly slow or boring. It's simply entertaining which is what an anime should be!Shuichi is a generic uke; he’s loud, cute, innocent, has a feminine body (which he uses for his failed plans) and is quite open about his love towards Eiri yet he’s a loveable character. I don’t usually like characters with this sort of annoying personality but with Shuichi he grows on you, maybe because its quite nice to have such an energetic character as the main lead.Eiri is….a cool guy, look wise and personality wise. He’s the classic “Tall, dark and handsome” character fan girls scream over. When I said before it revolves around the couples past, its actually his past that it’s focused on (I mean, seriously, you can’t expect Shuichi to have a dark past now could you?)Other characters include Hiro and Suguru who are the other members of Shuichi’s band ‘Bad Luck‘, Mr K their manager, Mr Sakano their producer, Tohma Seguchi their boss, Eiri’s brother in law and a member of Shuichi’s favourite band ‘Nittle Grasper’ etc. The cast of Gravitation is likeable, they’re mostly used for comic relief and for a 13 episode show they all carry a decent amount of distinct characteristics. Tohma reminds me of some petite pretty boy gangster though, the way he handles certain situations and is one of the more serious characters.Here comes the music. A very important part in any anime, even more so in this one since it’s a show all about music. The music and themes in this are just simply fun and personally I quite liked them - the opening and other songs the band sung had some techno in it which made the songs really funky, which I enjoyed since I don’t really listen to techno. The piano themes used when there’s a ‘heart-warming moment’ or whatever got me every time (in a good way) and the ending is used to create a cliff-hanger moment at the end of each episode.However, it sort of annoyed me that they recycle the same song/scenes every time they showed Bad Luck singing - only a couple of other times did they use new footage or songs. The music aren’t masterpieces but it’s a great listen.If outfits come under art, I would down rate the art because the performing outfits that Shuichi and Ryuichi wore are HORRIBLE. They look like some bad cop out from the 80’s which I don’t understand how it managed to find its way into this show since Gravitation came out in 2000. Then again, I don’t live in Japan so I don’t really know how singers dress there, though I’m pretty sure no singer in their right mind would dress like that.  Other than that little critique the art was fine. The cover shown in the summary pretty much tells you what the art is like - bright, pretty and cute, so not much more I can really discuss on that.In my opinion, Gravitation is one the best shounen ai out there to date. The only reason why I say “one of” is simply because I haven’t watched all the shounen ai out there, but even so it’s still up there because it also does well as an anime. It’s well funny, throughout the series I had had many good laughs. There are extremely lame and stupid moments (e.g. Shuichi dressing in dog costume) that had made me cringe but I guess that’s just part of the course. There are also shocking pause-the-screen-to-take-in-what-just-happened moments which either puts a huge grin on my face or make me look completely dumbfounded.The music industry aspect is quirky, serving much humorous content with the sheer craziness of it all and does make the audience doubt the music industry of today if that’s how it’s really run. And even though it is shounen ai, don’t be completely put off by it - I guess if you ever want to explore this genre then Gravitation is a good or perhaps the only place to start. every episode is filled with quality; it’s well paced, never did it ever feel even slightly slow or boring. It's simply entertaining which is what an anime should be!Shuichi is a generic uke; he’s loud, cute, innocent, has a feminine body (which he uses for his failed plans) and is quite open about his love towards Eiri yet he’s a loveable character.

Back then, I was looking for some yaoi or shounen-ai to watch. Going through various forums and reviews I found Gravitation, downloaded it and started watching.With every episode I hoped that the next one will be better, but unfortunately they all were at the same low level. An over-emotional immature kid who’s able to sing only one or two sings through all the 13 episodes, with huge eyes and pink hair, dressed in some funny coat and shorts. Thanks, I’ll pass.Instead of funny,...try pathetic. I don’t remember laughing much when I watched it. And when I did it was more of the silly actions of the main character than of the actual humor. The art isn’t stunning either, the music even worse.There were, of course, some scenes that I liked, but not many of them. The only character I could like was Yuki Eiri because of his outwardly cold and indifferent demeanor. But even that wasn’t good enough to begin liking the anime in the slightest. I survived to the end of it and was glad to be able to finally remove it from my HD. Well, the last episodes I watched thinking ‘only 4 (or less) left, if I survived till now, I can finish it as well’.And ever since I watched it I’m wondering how it’s possible that so many people worship it. I cannot understand it. For me, it was probably the worst anime I’ve ever seen. try pathetic. I don’t remember laughing much when I watched it.

Other than being a shonen-ai anime, Gravitation was supposed to be an anime about making it big in the music industry. Sometimes, I think that aspect is overlooked. I think if the shonen-ai and music making aspects were balanced, Gravitation would have been better.The cast, as expected, were full of gorgeous male characters. My favorites would be Hiro and Yuki &ndash; I like the mysterious, tall and handsome types. Shuichi was okay, he gets on my nerves...sometimes, but he&rsquo;s really cute when he&rsquo;s chibi-fied. His choice of outfits is questionable though &ndash; his normal clothes are okay, but the banana suit and the school girl uniform was too much. Why can&rsquo;t he be more like Ryuichi who&rsquo;s cute all the time?I&rsquo;m always impressed when a female seiyuu is assigned to a male character. Takimoto Fujiko (Fujisaki Suguru) and Ai Orikasa (Seguchi Tohma) were good in portraying male characters, however I like Takimoto Fujiko more because when I first heard Seguchi Tohma&rsquo;s voice, I knew his seiyuu was female right away. Ai Orikasa&rsquo;s voice was too high pitched and mellow, which is unfitting for a male president of a record company. Of course, I can&rsquo;t forget to note Tomokazu Seki, who was Shuichi&rsquo;s seiyu. He&rsquo;s my favorite no matter what roles he picks.Visuals for gravitation were interesting. I like how they incorporated real images with the animation &ndash; it makes it look different. However, when it&rsquo;s just pure animation, I have to say I&rsquo;m not a fan. The drawings were inconsistent, and needed work. Yuki&rsquo;s face changes almost every episode. Same goes for the coloring. There were times when there were stills and repeated scenes were used. That&rsquo;s just being lazy for me. The visuals did get better towards the end.As for the music, the OP reminded me a lot of Pet Shop Boys songs. I only heard a few of their songs (I wasn&rsquo;t born yet when they first started), but when I first watched Gravitation I immediately thought of the Pet Shop Boys. I like the ED better, it&rsquo;s quite catchy but I kinda wish a girl sang it. It is a shonen-ai anime after all. There&rsquo;s also the insert songs, which were nice, but again &ndash; Pet Shop Boys.It could have been better, not that I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s bad &ndash; but it needed some improvement.

(I think I might make this a hobby)To be honest I thought the anime of Gravitation, was just poor. It was obnoxious, and way too irritating. I barely got through it. Thirteen episodes was more than enough for me. And although most of my friends tell me to watch the OVA’s.. I have no motivation to do so, that is how bad the anime was.The characters had very little development, they stayed the same throughout. For example the main one remained obnoxious and kind of naïve. It’s a very typical shounen-ai. Cheesy, with no twists, and absolutely no real plot development. Most fans...of this anime are indeed female, but only because it is classified as cute.Guess when I’m looking for shounen-ai, or more so yaoi. I should look for more serious things, and less cute. A tease and a waste of time. As harsh as that sounds. :(The only thing I can really commend it for, is the music. It has decent music, and voice overs. of this anime are indeed female, but only because it is classified as cute.Guess when I’m looking for shounen-ai, or more so yaoi.

They tend to have excessive amounts of fanservice, poor character writing, and are usually of a rather subpar quality. However, every now and then there comes a show that truly makes an impact on the community and redefines the genre. Unfortunately, this is not that show. This show is still pretty good though, and I genuinely think it is worth a watch.Visuals: I'm not going to lie, if you don't like the aesthetic of most early-2000s anime, you will hate the look of Gravitation. Although, for me personally, some of my...favorite anime are from the early-2000s, so I really enjoyed the look of this show.Characters: I really liked the characters in Gravitation. Like a lot. One of the reasons I enjoyed this show so much, in fact, was probably because of the characters. For starters, the main character, Shuichi, was very fun to watch grow and develop over the course of the show. And while I do feel like the true resolution of his characters of his character arc can be found in the OVA, Lyrics of Love, the show does by all means do him justice. And while some people may find him annoying towards the start of the show, he really does grow on you as the anime progresses, and I truly feal that he is the heart of gravitation. Moving on to Shuichi's best friend, we have Hiro, who often played straight man to all of his Shuichi's crazy antics. Now he could have simply remained as such for the duration of the show but we actually also get to see a more serious side of him as the anime goes on, and he actually ends up becoming one of my favorite characters. The final character i want to talk about in this part of the review is... Yuki. Yuki is Shuichi's love interest. When i first met Yuki in the anime I hated him. And to be honest, for a large portion of the show Yuki is a very dislikable character. And if the show never bothered to delve into his backstory or why he is the way he is, he probably would have remained dislikable for the whole anime. Fortunately, for us viewers though, the show does a wonderful job of explaining his origins and past, and watching his relationship with Shuichi bud and grow throughout the course of this anime was easily one of the pest parts of this show.Sound: I can't not talk about the OST in a show about music. First of all, I just need to say that this anime has one of my favorite openings of all time. It has a very nostalgic feeling, and almost reminds me of the openings from GTO. The ED is worth a listen as well, not to mention all the songs played by Bad Luck and Nittle Grasper throughout the course of the show. And this is yet another reason why I like this show so much. This anime could have easily chosen to focus on the BL portion of its story, and have just included one or two good songs, but the fact that it provides an equal amount of care and attention to both the BL and music portions is proof that it goes above and beyond in its execution.Overall Thoughts: Gravitation is an anime that I would recommend to not only any BL anime fan, but just any romance anime fan in general, and I guarantee you will not regret putting any time into this honestly really well-made rom-com anime.Sincerely, Moshimochi284 favorite anime are from the early-2000s, so I really enjoyed the look of this show.Characters: I really liked the characters in Gravitation.

I don't think that many boys would like it though, because I suppose only we, girls, love shounen-ai :P I could be wrong of course. The story is very good and original in my opinion, it shows how someone who is really in love could fight with all  prejudices (and there are trurly many of them). The art is really one of my favourte tipes, though there are a bit too more chibis, but I like it :) Since you're watching about musical groups in this anime too, the sound is outstanding, really good...and made with effort. The charactres are most of all boys, but very cute ones ;) They are really good made especially when you know that half of the manga is cut if not more. I've really enjoyed watching this anime so I recommend it to all of you, especially girls ;P and made with effort.

Gravitation has been the &quot;shounen ai&quot; flagship for many years, and it is well deserved. While other anime series lose themselves with complex storylines and characters, this one dazzles you with it's over-simplicity.The story of a boy who longs to be a famous singer [who hasn't dreamt of that?] and equally longs to be loved by the person of his dreams [and who has not dreamt of this either?] the story barely deviates from this idea and therefore lacks the need to embellish or exaggerate the overall theme.

However beyond the latter and Antique Bakery, much of my exposure to ""boys love"" titles have consisted of subpar and angsty melodramas focused on ""dominant"" and ""submissive"" types of attractive male characters that made me not survive any further than the first few minutes of a show\'s first episode. Sadly, Gravitation follows this same mold to a great extent in its focus on Eiri and Shuiichi\'s developing relationship with each following...the dominant and submissive roles respectively. Both characters got quite obnoxious with their personalities for me with Eiri\'s barely expressive demeanor and Shuuichi\'s energetic and intrusive behavior. The approach that the anime takes in their relationship developments is just as irritating where the plot keeps teeter-tottering their developments between going smoothly and strained on enough occasions throughout the show\'s run, which made me blow enough steam over why Shuuichi doesn\'t just jump ship from his angst-loaded lover having enough mood swings. To its credit, the series does at least provide decent fleshing-out of its prominent characters and provide some believable elements to the complications that arise when becoming a celebrity such as the paparazzi and handling the fast rise of fame acquired. However, these few positives elements aren\'t enough to outweigh my sheer annoyance of the main pairing of Gravitation as I could care less about neither their relationship nor characters because of how melodramatic they were.

Gravitation has a lot of slapstick elements, it's comedy, a bit of dramatic and romantic.In fact: If you can suppress the gay theme (if you are not into it) and if you like romance anime, you could have a fun time watching Gravitation.I won't go into the Detail about the sound and art, I think there are enough reviews out there which already did so."", 'This is a funny, and romantic history of Shindo Shuichi`s life.He was a normal school kid, who is a singer in his little band called Bad Luck, with his best friend and life partner Hiroshi.His life went on a turn when he met the great novelist Eiri Yuki.He fellt in love with Yuki, but Yuki plays a lot with Shuichi-kun.Shuichi and Hiro starts to grov with they`re music, and soon they reach the top.It`s a cute love-love story, with beautiful music, strong lines, funny characters and on the anime there are just awesome music:D ', 'This is so CUTE! Ok, now that my fan girl love has been squeezed out, I’m sorry but I can’t help it! This show has everything a yoai girl would fall in love with. Cute guys, drama, romance between a cute little brother character and a hot older male.Shuichi is like a little brother, always acting out on his feelings even when it might get him into trouble. He also is known to put people in front of himself. He doesn’t care what happens to him as long as everyone else around him is happy.I love Hiro! His design is really cute and...he always teases Shuichi about his love and anything else but he is always there for him like a best friend should.I wish Yuki would be nicer to Shuichi. I feel so sorry for him since he keeps getting beat up by Yuki both mentally and physically. Most of the time, I wanted to punch Yuki for acting the way he did though that would of broken my screen.As you can tell, I really got into this one and my fan girl couldn’t help me get past the fact they weren’t real people. The way the creators made them, most of the time they felt like they could be people I would meet on the street one day.The artwork is kind of so so actually. It is beautiful when they put a lot of effort into it but then lacks in other places. The design of the eyes is beautiful and the romance scenes too but when we get into the comedy part, it lacks slightly.The music is rather awesome for a j-pop boy band. Some music is a miss for me but others like the opening are really awesome. Unfortunately, Yuki (English Dub) keeps sounding like he’s just reading lines and doesn’t show much emotion. I know he’s an angry guy but he could at least put a little more emotion to it.

What can I say about you in this small review that can express my feelings about you? Let us see:Honestly, I don't understand why people don't enjoy this like I do. I can't expect everyone to like everything I do, but this one seemed like it could reach out to a lot of different people. I mean, it has a whole lot of comedy, but it still has its serious moments. My friends that like anime have read the manga and watched the anime, and we all LOVED it.Gravitation is, in my mind, one of the greatest things ever made. It's about a...singer named Shuichi Shindou who is in a band called Bad Luck with his best friend who plays the guitar named Hiro. He loses the lyrics to a new song and a mysterious man picks them up, and literally tells him that he sucks and that he has no talent.Later on, you find out that the man is Eiri Yuki, a famous novelist who is very popular with the ladies. And it just sorta takes off from there.At times, this whole show doesn't seem very realistic, but it's an anime. Who says it has to be realistic?Story: (9) This has some of the funniest stuff I have ever read in it. It gets really crude at times, but not as much as the manga. The story at times can get so random that it's hard to keep up, but in a good way.Art: (7) Gravitation does not have the greatest art in it. Although at times, it somehow adds to the anime. It's not an eyesore, but it's no Code Geass or Death Note.Sound: (10) Every song in this anime is in my top favorites. I bought the cd a while back, and I have every song memorized from beginning to end, especially Spicy Marmalade and Shining Collection.Character: (8): I love a majority of these characters. Shuichi is so immature that it's adorable! Eiri Yuki has so many sides, and I love each and every one of them! Ryuichi Sakuma is definitly my favorite character. He makes you think of a five year old, with Kumagoro (Mr. Bear, if you're watching the dubbed). K is the most badass person ever on the face of the planet!But some characters, I just want to stab in the neck with a knife, like, at first you might think you love Tohma, but then he's just a sick bastard that needs to die. Ayaka is just a bitch. That's all there is to it. (I was gonna say more, but this is really long!)Enjoyment: (10) I easily give this a ten. I have watched the anime five times in a row now, and I still cry from laughing so hard at most points. It's just so random and innocent, yet sad and emotional all at the same time. You will sit there with tears of sadness running down your face, and all of a sudden you fall over laughing.Overall: (9) This has to be my favorite anime of all time (besides Death Note). It is just that amazing. If you don't like yaoi, then stay away. Especially from the manga. That is a lot more sexual than the anime. I highly recommend this, because it is just an anime that about everyone can get a good laugh from. ^.^Thanks for reading! =3~Tracy singer named Shuichi Shindou who is in a band called Bad Luck with his best friend who plays the guitar named Hiro.

So, let's look at something romance-oriented. This series is based on a manga by Murakami Maki. In 2000, 2001 it was adapted into an anime by Studio Deen with help from Production Reed. Without further ado, let's look at Gravitation.Story:Our narrative opens with Bad Luck, a musical duo with singer Shindou Shuuichi & guitarist Nakano Hiroshi. The two are being berated by their manager for their failure at coming up with new songs and with the deadlines rapidly approaching too. Which happens. Art isn't easy, you've got to put it together bit by bit. That evening, Shuuichi...is walking while examining the lyrics he's got when they slip away from him and hit a passing stranger. A handsome and tall stranger. The young man call the lyrics garbage, saying that Shuuichi has no talent. This inspires Shuuichi to finish in order to prove this stranger wrong because Shuuichi greatly cares about his opinion, thinking he was cool.It turns out this stranger was Yuki Eiri, a popular romance writer. Shuuichi continues to run into Yuki, prompting the other man to question whether or not Shuuichi has fallen for him. The two eventually share a snog in an elevator, much to Shuuichi's delight and confusion. Can the two of them turn this chance encounter into a functional relationship or are they destined for failure?The biggest flaw with this series is the tone. For the first five episodes, it has a very light-hearted, fluffy type of tone with a lot of zany visual gags. In the sixth episode, things take a very abrupt, and very dark, turn and the rest of the series tries to balance the more serious content with the lighter and sillier elements, mainly leaning towards the lighter. I do give the series credit for trying to handle the darker aspects with gravity and not just letting them drop. However, it's still pretty awkward in spite of their best efforts. A big part of the problem is that this anime is also kind of stupid, with a lot of moments that are really absurd or even nonsensical. These scenes could work fine if the series didn't try mixing them with serious moments. A manager kicking in the door while holding a gun to introduce himself, that's actually really funny. A scene like that and a somewhat explicit, very serious assault scene, however, do not really belong in the same work.On the positive side, the zany moments are largely amusing and most the series, tonal awkwardness aside, is quite endearing and fun. The love story elements are effectively handled and there are a lot of sweet moments betwixt Shuuichi and Yuki.Characters:As a whole, the characters in this series are a lot of fun and most of our major cast have a nice amount of complexity. I quite like the stuff they do with Yuki's family and their issues and the best friend dynamic with Shuuichi & Hiro is stellar. The character who really stands out, at least to me, is Hiro. I really like the way he's written. The issue is with our major antagonistic character, Aizawa Taki. The man comes across as cartoonishly evil and has no real motivation aside from a vague and petty jealousy. He's one-dimensional to the point where you could give him a serpent emblem and have him take orders from a man in a metal face mask and not change his characterisation in the slightest. Which wouldn't be an issue if the series were entirely zany but, due to the serious aspects, it becomes a problem.Art:The artwork is pretty nicely done with the characters and backgrounds getting some nice details. The visual jokes are largely effective as well. The biggest issue is that Bad Luck's musical performances are a bit lazy in terms of recycling footage.Sound:The vocal cast in this is quite impressive. Seki Tomokazu & Inoue Kazuhiko portray the chemistry between their characters really well. We also get strong performances from Orikasa Ai and Matsumoto Yasunori. The music is really strong. However, it suffers from laziness similar to the performance scenes. They keep using the same Bad Luck song. At least a third of the episodes, and more than half of Bad Luck's performances, seriously use the same song. While it is a good song it also gets a bit old after hearing it so many times in the span of thirteen episodes. Give credit to anime like Love Live and K-on, they give you a bunch of different songs that get used at varied enough times that none of them ever feel over-used.Ho-yay:In addition to the lovely relationship between Shuuichi & Yuki, we have a gent who outright states that he loves Yuki more than he loves anyone else. Ryuuichi is also quite homo-erotic and Yuki's brother is clearly also interested in boys.Final Thoughts:As a zany, comedic work, Gravitation is enjoyable and endearing. Its biggest failing is that its serious sub-plots are out of place and result in tonal awkwardness. Which does weaken the series quite a bit. Overall, though, I give the series a solid 7/10. If you're interested in seeing a nice romance with a lot of really funny, absurd moments, it may very well make a good choice for you. Just be aware that things are going to get serious and those scenes aren't going to play well with the rest of the series. Next week I'm looking at Gangsta. is walking while examining the lyrics he's got when they slip away from him and hit a passing stranger. A handsome and tall stranger.

I was generous rating this a 3 since there were a few funny scenes, but getting through this show was rough. The main character was cute plenty of times, but every episode I found myself mad at them for doing things that made no sense whatsoever. I understand why the second main character, Yuki, acted the way he did later on, but their relationship was messed up throughout the whole series. This show makes it seem like it's supposed to be sweet how Shuuichi is...fighting for his love yet he's treated horribly 90% of the time.Okay I'll leave it there, I know a lot of people like this show so I'm not trying to stop people from watching it. Personally, the execution of this show was extremely disappointing to me. fighting for his love yet he's treated horribly 90% of the time.Okay I'll leave it there, I know a lot of people like this show so I'm not trying to stop people from watching it. Personally, the execution of this show was extremely disappointing to me."", ""Gravitation was probably the only anime which really made me appreciate Yaoi, because the whole story was just amazing. The whole series shows a typical relationship between two guys, one being older than the other. Even though it seems as if it will be predictable, there's still a dark past and secrets which are un-known. Gravitation is probably one of the most well known Yaoi's because it was the first of it's time. There's quite a bit of comedy throughout the series, and every character has a side which you'll love about them. What really gripped me in this anime though was how the relationship...had such a big age gap, and it wasn't a magical anime, or anything like that including powers it was just a normal couple going through different stages - and thats why i love it.Shuichi Shindou wants his band Bad Luck to be big in the music business, and with his best friend Hiro and Suguru Fujisaki his dreams become reality. He's a very mad, energetic character and probably my favourite, because he never gives up. Bad luck was his whole life until he meets Yuki one day, and cant get him out of his head. He realises his idols are now his rivals, his friends have there own problems and the one he's madly in love with is hard to please.Eiri Yuki, suprisingly a character who gets away with anything because he can be so charming. His attitude can be terrible though, and he prefers to block people out instead of letting them in. He's done things which he's not proud of, but his writing career sometimes helps to make him forget. Shuichi ends up in Yuki's apartment and slowly into his heart, even though Yuki may hate him at times.Other characters such as Hiro, and Ryuichi are brilliant and really make the series a whole lot better. Hiro is always there for Shuichi and is really dedicated to the band, and soon gets his own love problems. Ryuichi is the lead singer for Shuichi's favourite band, Nittle Grasper and changes from his idol into his rival. They stay friends though, and Ryuichi is probably one of the most comical characters.Tohma Seguchi is forever trying to split Yuki and Shuichi up and Mr Sakuma is forever stressing out. One of my favourite characters though has to be K, Bad Lucks mad manager who always carries round a gun and forces everyone to do what he wants them to.I was addicted to Gravitation and i still am, and i would recommend it to anyone. Even Yaoi (Boy x Boy) haters this could still be an anime you'de like, it's a boy who's music dream and love life collide, and i think it's highly enjoyable. had such a big age gap, and it wasn't a magical anime, or anything like that including powers it was just a normal couple going through different stages - and thats why i love it.Shuichi Shindou wants his band Bad Luck to be big in the music business, and with his best friend Hiro and Suguru Fujisaki his dreams become reality.

So if i saw it without reading the manga first i would be in love. First of all i would be in love with the Eiri Yuki character. A cynical, cruel and a cold hearted guy who looks like some kind of ancient greek god. And like all the cold hearted guys' his mask gets ripped off, and we find out that he is just a human like all of us.Shinji character is too &quot;stupid&quot; in my opinion. The...anime series show him as some weird crossover of a five year old girl and a teddy bear. He cries too much and does too much stupid stuff. He's really pathetic but kinda cute too.The story is kinda close to the manga one, so besides dropping some events i think they did a good job on it.The art is typical, nothing outstanding, but it's nice and colourful. Oh and Yuki's character is just great!All in all i think that gravitation is a really good anime, for those who like shounen-ai, and is a fantastic love story.I really enjoyed it, and i think there is no girl that wouldn't. anime series show him as some weird crossover of a five year old girl and a teddy bear.

The stroyline was very interesting as well, and no matter 'what' happened, I was always squealing for more! The voices were actually amazing, unlike other Anime's I've seen.I loved the music and how creative Maki Murakami-san was on this!

(aww, makes me sad)plot: 8/10i found the story cool actually. i mean a writer falls in love with a singer? that isn\'t one thing you\'d see in everyday life. but when the story gets a move i found myself bored because of the love-hate relationship. sort of like taming a dog using the candy and whip. but the latter part was a surprise...:)art: 8/10the art is good enough for what it\'s worth, which pretty much means... uhm. if you\'ve seen sukisho, it\'s kind of like of the same level, only with darker shades and cruder details. but if you haven\'t, i think it is safe to say that the art is ""cute"". haha. ugh. words fail me.sound: 9/10since the main character is a singer, then expect songs! but not too much amount of songs. haha. yeah. just right. i didn\'t placed much attention to the seiyuus so, sorry about that. but the bg music doesn\'t affect much.characters: 9/10i don\'t have anything much to say about the characters. i didn\'t like yuki\'s (seme) temper =__= i found myself shocked whenever he turns cold towards shuuichi. but i couldn\'t bring myself to hate him because he says too much pick up lines. haha. shuuichi is your average clingy uke.enjoyment: 8/10well, it kept me pretty well entertained for the time being. i wanted more action actually. =__= but it provided more fluff. haha. i think it\'s good for those who cannot handle yaoi but likes shounen ai.overall: 8/10compared to other shounen ai anime i\'ve seen, this is probably one of the best. there are only a handful of such anime, so i\'d recommend it to those who likes shounen ai. i\'m influenced heavily by the art and story so no surprise about that :)owari :) :)art: 8/10the art is good enough for what it\'s worth, which pretty much means... uhm. if you\'ve seen sukisho, it\'s kind of like of the same level, only with darker shades and cruder details. but if you haven\'t, i think it is safe to say that the art is ""cute"". haha. ugh. words fail me.sound: 9/10since the main character is a singer, then expect songs! but not too much amount of songs. haha. yeah. just right. i didn\'t placed much attention to the seiyuus so, sorry about that. but the bg music doesn\'t affect much.characters: 9/10i don\'t have anything much to say about the characters. i didn\'t like yuki\'s (seme) temper =__= i found myself shocked whenever he turns cold towards shuuichi. but i couldn\'t bring myself to hate him because he says too much pick up lines. haha. shuuichi is your average clingy uke.enjoyment: 8/10well, it kept me pretty well entertained for the time being. i wanted more action actually. =__= but it provided more fluff. haha. i think it\'s good for those who cannot handle yaoi but likes shounen ai.overall: 8/10compared to other shounen ai anime i\'ve seen, this is probably one of the best. there are only a handful of such anime, so i\'d recommend it to those who likes shounen ai. i\'m influenced heavily by the art and story so no surprise about that :)owari :)', ""Although it's kinda shonen-ai, i think everyone might enjoy this anime. It's not too dramatic... and has quite funny scenes.It's kind of a musical anime, there are a few songs of the bands which are quite good. you can enjoy the music in the background as well.the plot is simple, easy to follow, and exciting i must say.It's one of the best animes i've ever seen. personally i had fun watching it and i hope that others who seen it had fun as well.this anime is warmly recommended for everyone. "", ""I decided to write (a partial) review after seeing the mediocre score Gravitation has been given.I am bestowing an overall 10 to redeem it.Story 9I've just finished watching Guilty Crown and three words. Underwhelming af. It reeled me in with a fresh and fantastic introductory plot but meandered on without much substance, then sugar coated with tonnes of fan service. I mean, I like fan service but its a cheap way to win over your audience when its used like that. Anyway I rambled on about a completely irrelevant anime to tell you that this is not what Gravitation does. It has a lot...of juicy meat to the story and easy to follow. It hooked me in from the minute it started to the second it ended with no messing about and I am begging to The Gods of Gravitation (Studio Deen thats you) that the anime will have a second season or a movie or something god please. It's just that amazing.Side note: I thought the ambience of the anime was well balanced in terms of its seriousness and cringe-factor (Guys, its yaoi – it’s got to have some cheese). Just like on the music stage, the storyline is theatrical and dramatic; one moment it’s cute and light-hearted, the next, it’s passionate and intense. I disagree with you lemons who complain that it’s too cheesy, cringe, etc - it's not.Art 8Considering how dated the anime is (almost 17 year, jeepers) I still enjoy the quality and style…. and tangent to the actual art but one thing that bothered me when I first watched the anime were the flamboyant, frilly crop tops Shuichi Shindou and Ryuichi Sakuma wore during their performances. I’ve gotten used to it after years but seriously, Britney Spears from the 2000’s would like her top back.Voice  / Music / Stuff that you listen to 10I can’t emphasize enough how fucking fabulous the Japanese dub is, it really is. Like everyone part of the cast deserves fucking cookies and a medal (not you though English cast). I know English dubs are notorious for being sub-par but I was mortified when I first heard it. It’s tasteless (not to mention emotionless) and just embarrassing to watch.One thing I would like to see English dubs adopt is the use of female voice actresses for male roles (not sure if they do or don't). Japanese dubs do this a lot and it works really well. Ai Orikasa’s voice dubbing illustrates a beautiful allure to Seguchi Tohma’s character. His voice is gentle and soft spoken but also firm and charismatic and I think the femininity in his voice made it so believable.Everyone else deserves a honourable mention but I think other reviewers have said pretty fair stuff about the Japanese dub (and also this is a partial review). I mentioned Seguchi to comment about the female dubbing and not because it was particularly better than the others.Ok as for music, I’ll look past the fact that ‘The Rage Beat’ (Shuichi’s song) gets overplayed (but not overkilled – it’s catchy as hell) with more or less the same video montages. However, there's one thing I don't buy. The song is first introduced in the beginning of the series when Shuichi is an amateur but gets rehashed when he is also pro. I'm pointing this out because later in the series, a large chuck of the plot pirouettes around how much Shuichi’s vocal ability and performance has evolved... its the exact same song inserted every time so I don't think so? Then again, its probably more a matter of production costs.Nevertheless, ALL the music, the opening, endings, insert songs, Ryuichi’s song, etc are all catchy and sentimental – just the way I like it.Character 10Gravitation has some of the most memorable characters.

"", 'Honestly, I have no idea what to say for this show. I heard about it years ago and was reminded of it again by a YouTuber who put it next to a positive representation to an LGBTQ+ show.Absolutely no offense to anyone whose a fan of this show, but... I\'m so confused as to how.I\'m not sure if it\'s fair giving a review on it since I haven\'t finished it (I don\'t really want to...), but I am honestly so baffled by the remark in making this a positive representation when the show itself leads to I think so many problems that I...have with shows that are lent towards the shonen ai/yaoi genre.Enjoyment: 6/10I can\'t say that I didn\'t enjoy this show but from a gulity pleasure prespective of the cheesy late 90s-early 00s period of anime. It reeks in cliches we\'ve grown to know, and speaking for myself, love.First of all, the obvious cut corners for the budget cuts even from the first episode alone, when they loose live action footage to replace animating a run cycle. It is so unexpected and goofy, and I can\'t help but love it ironically.But I say that in regards to all of the enjoyment I got from this run through of it.Character: 5/10These characters felt a lot like card board cut outs to me. From how they\'re designed to what they say, they felt like little paper puppets on a stick performing on a screen. They\'re not memorable to me, and fade in with all the other characters I\'ve read as a stupid kid upon first running into this genre.Sound: 6/10I\'m personally not a fan of the music either, but I can see it being objectably good. Since this show\'s main focus is on a music career, I think it would have to be. And I\'ll give it that it is, it\'s just not my taste.Art: 4/10Again, a product of its time. And I\'m not a fan of art from around this era. The designs are extremely tacky and almost expected of each character type?Also, I\'ve always tended to stray away from this type of style in which case they have one of the men look like a child and the other of more a mature adult. It\'s not a good look for me. This anime definitely has that.Story: 3/10If you were to throw the summary off Gravitation as a quick pitch, as a shonen-ai, I would have thought it would\'ve been a decent story. However, it\'s delivered in its situations is not what I think as cute or ideal.The romance, or whatever you want to label it as, is very showy but there wasn\'t any chemistry behind it.There are scenes with Yuki bad mouth and degrading Shuichi, but then making out with him right afterwards, to be followed with, ""Don\'t let the kiss give you the wrong idea.""??? Fool, you came on to him. That\'s so... weird????There are many different scenerios that Shuichi gets himself into these situations where all these different men have their florally sparkle twink twink gauassian blur moment but there\'s absolutely no build up, maybe aside from his band mate that one time. But as I will mention again, designing a youthful character and pairing him with a more mature looking character is creepy. If you\'re going to make these characters somewhat around the same age, don\'t make them look so contrasted.I don\'t think I would be as hard on this show if I didn\'t see a YouTuber with a decently sized following recommend it over other shonen-ai that I thought has a lot more commendable substance than this one. have with shows that are lent towards the shonen ai/yaoi genre.Enjoyment: 6/10I can\'t say that I didn\'t enjoy this show but from a gulity pleasure prespective of the cheesy late 90s-early 00s period of anime.

The writers took a twelve-volume manga and smashed it down into a thirteen-episode anime series. The artwork is beautiful, the songs are great, the characters are just as engaging as in the original, but the problem is how much of the story has been cut from this masterpiece manga series.Shuichi Shindou and his friend Hiro Nakano have just hit their big break and are an up-and-coming band (named Bad Luck) who are trying to finish their first album for their debut concert. While searching for ideas in the park...Shuichi's song is blown away and he meets famed author Eiri Yuki, who insults his song, causing Shuichi to throw a fit and write an even better song just to show the writer (who at the time he doesn't know is famous) up.It seems that the writers have traded story and art for music, but even that is rather lack-luster as in the thirteen episodes Bad Luck has only three songs features, and their rivals Nittle Grasper have perhaps one or two. Even still, the comedy and romance have stayed in tact and it's a nice anime to take a day to watch and perhaps get yourself in the mood to read the daunting twelve-volume manga that accompanies it.

Also, it looks like the anime cels were stretched...since every character's eyes look stretched to their limit.The Japanese dub was the cloak that hid the horrible truth of this anime adaptation.

However I found this to be a very good anime having finished it in one day.Story: The overall story was not very realistic. It was very open of gay relationships and you don’t find that in today’s world. But I think that made it unique and a very good watch.Art: The art was interesting. Not bad not good. It by no means took away from the watching experience. I thought it was fair giving it a...6 on a scale. Some of it was good and some was bad.Sound: Being that this was also a music themed anime, I thought this was an important aspect and was not disappointed. It met my expectations very well. All the songs sung during the anime were spectacular. At first, I didn’t enjoy the OP but eventually found it to my liking as I watched it more. The sound in this case was well done. Of course better is out there but it was well enough.Character: I LOVED the characters on this show. The uke perspective was well done as well as the seme. I mainly loved that most characters were not how they seemed. You frequently find your self, mouth wide open, looking at the screen in awe. It’s a very well played cast. Many of them had hidden aspects that really drew you into the story.Enjoyment: I gave this a ten, it was well done. One of those things you find yourself making comments on and just really getting into. I myself very much enjoyed this anime. So even if you don’t like shounen-ai I think you should give this anime a try. The shounen-ai concept is not to deeply played. Sure there are cute moments here and there but it doesn’t go to into detail.Overall Score: 8 6 on a scale.

To make things clear, I didn't decide to start writing now and on this anime all of a sudden because I liked or disliked it. It just happened to be this one.I remember searching through the internet to find an old-style shonen-ai or Yaoi anime because I aesthetically enjoy this format, which lots of people don't. A matter of taste truly.You should not have high expectations of such anime. As expected the story is not great -maybe it is in the manga, I haven't read it and I'm...not going to, so I don't know -  but it's not complete nonsense either. At the very least it doesn't only revolve around two guys falling in love and their relationship. (The drama in the plot is more than what it should've been so it loses its effect. Or maybe it's just due to poor directing.)What I enjoyed about this anime was the sense of comedy although it was a little bit too much sometimes. I liked the fact that some things -Not the story or main incidents- didn't make sense and were so out of blue. That's one of the reasons I like older anime.the last thing I want to mention is that I enjoyed the music in this anime. not a fan of vocals but the OST was beautiful and enjoyable.Overall, I think it stands a chance to give you a good time, only if you consider the cliches of the genre. not going to, so I don't know -  but it's not complete nonsense either.

I rewatched it again for the first time after over a decade and have much more mixed feeling about the show. Overall, I would say that while it was not bad, there are a lot of other anime set in the entertainment industry, as well as shounen ai, that are a lot better.Story: I like the overall concept and setting for the storyline. What is not to like about characters...with a dark, mysterious past and a new band trying to break into the music industry and make it big? It makes a fun backdrop to the romantic element of the story, however I would say that the execution of that storyline was only mediocre. Compared to a story like Skip Beat (the manga in particular), these elements are not nearly as fleshed out and developed.Characters: Again, I liked the basic concept of the characters (their past, their motives, etc), but to be honest, I found both of the main characters to be REALLY annoying. Yuki is just a straight-up dick most of the time, and Suichi\'s whiny, childish, over-the-top personality was not endearing.Sound: For an anime that is about the music industry, I was decidedly not impressed about the music in the show. Especially in the first half of the show, when they kept using the same song over and over again. Maybe it just wasnt my style, but either way I felt like the music often detracted from the experience of the anime.Art: Mediocre. I wouldn\'t say that it was terrible, but I did not love the style of it. It seemed very dated, and more like an art style from the 90s than something from 2004/2005.Enjoyment: Despite having many elements that I did not like, I did still enjoy watching the anime. It was light and fluffly, and the pacing was fast enough that it didn\'t lose my interest.Overall: I wouldn\'t put this a the top of your ""to watch"" list, but if you are into this kind of show, then it might be worth watching if you have the time to kill. with a dark, mysterious past and a new band trying to break into the music industry and make it big?

Is my genre, right? I won't say it is a yaoi since it is really not. This story is too fast pace for me. Well, basically, it consist of 12 episodes. However, unlike other anime who successfully show how a relationship grows, this one failed to do so. In my opinion, that is. Apart from that, the twist of the story if kinda cliche since what is the number 1 or the main issue when it comes to this type of relatio ship? Yes, it is the gender. There are also other twist...on the story such as sickness and the past which I think increase the curiousity or suspense of the series. There are some comedy on this, if I remembered correctly. But that is not enough to entertain or give a deeper impact on me, personally.Don't misunderstand. It is not bad, it also is not that good. For me, it is fine.CHARACTER: 5/10The only character my attention goes to is the opponent vocalist. Still, it is only on the last two to three episodes where he got serious? The protagonist is kinda jolly person which always get affected by his surrounding, most of all is his partner. The partner looks great, honestly. But the bestfriend of the protagonist has much more charm and impact than the protagonist himself. In my opinion. No offense.SONGS: 7/10The songs of this series are good. But I still expected new songs along the way since it is a music genre anime. However, it failed my expectation. The series only focuses on one song only. The voices are fine, though.ENJOYMENT: 5/1050:50. I want to enjoy it since it is an anime. And I never drop any anime I've started to watch. It is also the first time I've watch such genre. So so. But it lacks on something. Lacks of enjoyment? Lacks on impact? I wanted more, expected more from the character. As I've said, the story is too fast pace that I failed to cope up on the feelings they're trying to portray. It feels kinda fake. Or rather vulnerable. So that must be why I did not really enjoyed it. on the story such as sickness and the past which I think increase the curiousity or suspense of the series.

But the bestfriend of the protagonist has much more charm and impact than the protagonist himself. In my opinion. No offense.SONGS: 7/10The songs of this series are good. But I still expected new songs along the way since it is a music genre anime. However, it failed my expectation. The series only focuses on one song only. The voices are fine, though.ENJOYMENT: 5/1050:50. I want to enjoy it since it is an anime. And I never drop any anime I've started to watch. It is also the first time I've watch such genre. So so. But it lacks on something. Lacks of enjoyment? Lacks on impact? I wanted more, expected more from the character. As I've said, the story is too fast pace that I failed to cope up on the feelings they're trying to portray. It feels kinda fake. Or rather vulnerable. So that must be why I did not really enjoyed it."", 'Overall: The story had a lot of potential...but the execution was just...bad. Despite dealing with mature themes of sexual assault and violence, the tone is extremely off-putting because it constantly switches between (trying to be) serious and comedic/childish from one moment to the next. I was hesitant whether I should judge this show as a comedy or serious story but I’m going to go with the latter as that’s how I ultimately view this show’s storyline.Story: Honestly, they could’ve chosen to either go the realistic route (which is what I would prefer) or the targeted-for-children funny/lighthearted route. Yet they tried to mix both and it...simply did not work. For example, there were three scenes I could remember where the two protagonists were discussing something in a very serious tone and yet the setting completely did not suit the tone (SPOILER in parantheses: why does the MC have to be dressed in a ridiculous cosplay outfit while talking about sth serious???)At the start of the show, I was about to cry in a few places but before I got the chance, they did a choppy cut to the next scene (comedic) without a smooth transition.Art: I generally like this kind of art style of the 90s and early 2000s. While this is my personal preference, I am really tired of the trope of having the more dependent (or submissive) male partner look like a girl/child. Nothing in particular stands out, but I’d have to say that the colours and clothes they wear are really ugly (or ostentatious at best).The animation itself was choppy but tolerable and they often reused the same animation from when they sang before (although this is quite common so I can overlook that).Sound: The two main songs (by Ryuichi and by Shindo Shuichi) weren’t bad. The melody was nice but I don’t think it completely suits the tone of the story when it’s trying to be serious. The sound design and the background music were very lacklustre though.Characters: The characters do not completely fall flat but the dialogue is cheesy in many places. I don’t know why so many shounen-ai or BL have an asshole-ish seme and an annoying and dependent uke. I like Eiri Yuki’s back story but there was only one scene in which he showed some actual emotion. There was not enough of a gradual build up to that scene, and the way he and Shuichi behave is simply not realistic.Enjoyment: I’m conflicted as I truly saw a lot of potential in this story but I couldn’t bring myself to enjoy it. I was hoping for a more heavy, dark, and heartfelt story about falling in love, chasing your dreams, and dealing with reality but yet I was met with a waterfall of terrible textbook jokes that seemed so out of place. If they got rid of all that terrible comedy, I think I could bring my enjoyment from 5 to a 7.TLDR: I liked the idea of the story and was disappointed by the exaggerated comedy and jarring tone shifts in the story. To put it simply, the story, while somewhat cliche, had a lot of potential to explore noteworthy themes (considering it came out 20 yrs ago) but the show was ill-directed and had mediocre character and sound design. simply did not work.

If your looking to get into yaoi, then I say Gravitation is an exceptional place to start. This being my first yaoi, I am very happy with this choice.Story: 10This anime isn\'t just a yaoi, it has much more of a story than that. Its kind of a dark romance. It follows the kind of story, that at the end of the anime, I straight away was looking into buying the manga as I wanted to experience that again. Also, the yaoi is pretty soft core, it focuses more the emotional side of Shuichi...and Yuki\'s relationship and I loved that.Art: 9I\'ve always found that I enjoy the older art styles of anime rather then the usual anime style we get now days. The art presented in this anime is a win win for me.Sound: 10Gravitation did the whole ""music anime"" just right! When you make an anime to do with music, you have to bring in good songs, Gravitation did exactly that. The background music is great, but its nothing of a standout. The opening is catchy and very much stuck in my head.Character: 9Shuichi is a bouncy anime character, but at never one point did I personally find him to be ""annoying"", actually he\'s quite cute. I especially enjoyed Yuki as a character very much. The side characters are pretty thought out, they\'re enjoyable.Enjoyment: 9HIGHLY ENJOYABLE! Enjoyable from start to end.Overall: 9If you are looking to get into yaoi, I highly recommend this anime. The romance is great, the story is outstanding and whether your into yaoi or not, I\'m you\'ll still find some enjoyment in this anime. and Yuki\'s relationship and I loved that.Art: 9I\'ve always found that I enjoy the older art styles of anime rather then the usual anime style we get now days.

So what do I have to say about it? Is it as fantastic as everyone says it is?Story: If you haven\'t heard of this anime, have you been living under a rock? But anyway. The story is about a boy named Shuichi who, with his friend, Hiro, just got a record deal by starting a band called Bad Luck. Shuichi\'s dream is to become just as famous as his favorite band, Nittle Grasper,...someday. When in the middle of writing a new song one night, the blow carries it off, and it ends up in the hands of a famous romance novelist, Yuki Eri. However, their meeting is not friendly in the slightest when Yuki tells Shuichi that he straight up has ""zero talent."" To prove him wrong, Shuichi finishes the song and produces it. However, was this an act out of spite or just for senpai to notice him? I\'m sure other stories like this exist, but when it comes to a gay couple, it\'s more than just getting your crush to notice you. I feel as if Gravitation is an accurate representation of how the media shows homosexuality back in that time period, and despite it being a yaoi, it shows more than just the smutty stuff. It shows the internal struggles between the two lovers and how they can be accepted in this cruel world. If I really wanted to explain this in full, I would just say, ""Watch the show."" Just do it. As far as rating goes, I\'d give it a good 10/10.Art: For an anime done in the year 2000, I have not expected the art style the show has. The glittery stuff looks like something from the mid 2000\'s, but that\'s what makes the show more of a staple for itself. Sometimes there are light moments, and sometimes there are dark, but the animation fits so well. Oh, and by the way, Yuki\'s design happens to be the most amazing thing since sliced bread. Nothing seems to be out of place for me, so I would also give it a 10/10.Sound: Since this anime highly focuses on music, it has to count, and boy, does it make itself original and very well known. The voices are amazing and every song has left a huge impression on me. I think the only song that I found okay was the ending theme to the show, but it just bored me compared the others. Not that it\'s bad or anything like that. My favorite song has to be Sleepless Beauty of all things. I guess that\'s because I listen to the piano version. Because of that 9 out of 10. (Oh, and a little side note just because everyone knows about it already, DON\'T WATCH THE ENGLISH DUB UNLESS SOMEONE REDID IT!)Character: What makes this show besides the music are the characters as well (since this is a yaoi, and it can\'t be without the main couple in it). I thought I was going to hate Shuichi because normally characters who act like kids around this era of anime annoy the living shit out of me, but this show just proved that Shuichi is more than just a cute face. He\'s determined, and he does get angry about serious moments. I guess he kinda depends on the person like every other shojo boy anime ever, but just give him a chance. Yuki is the person that I thought was more of a hit or miss. Depending on what type of person you are, you can determine what kind of person Yuki is. Yes, he was mean to Shuichi at first, but without spoiling too much, there are reasons to why Yuki acts the way he does. And for the physical comedy scenes, I personally found those moments to be more comical than abusive, but that\'s up to your interpretation. The side characters are either a hit or a miss. The hits for me personally are Hiro, Tohma, and Sakano. They are completely unexpected from the stereotypes that you see in other anime. The other characters are nothing special in my opinion. Like I said in the story portion of the review, this show is completely unexpected, and you should go into the show thinking absolutely nothing about it. I would say 9/10 for this part.Enjoyment: This show is kinda like eating fruit. The more you watch the show, despite getting the bruises sometimes, it\'s still the same sweet flavor, and it only stays that way. I\'m just gonna warn you now that the ending to this show is not exactly the true ending. I\'m assuming if you want more, just watch the OVAs that came out before the show did. Also, if you\'re wondering if this is a true yaoi or not, if you\'re extra curious, read the manga. I heard there is more...smut in there than what the anime has to offer (cuz you know, 2000, it sucks for if you want a gay anime to last for a long while with the true elements). Still, it\'s a really fun show to watch, and I highly recommend it. 10/10Overall: I\'ll let the math do this for me. Rounded 10 out of 10 someday.

Rounded 10 out of 10', ""Well, I guess it's better than the manga.Gravitation is a story about an audience surrogate for teenage girls who loves a tall, pretty bastard, because he loves him. He loves him, so he loves him. They're both attractive and audience surrogate won't stop saying he loves the pretty bastard, so they must be in love! Wacky things ensue à la Loony Tunes and homosexuality is treated like a kink, so teenage girls can get off on fetishizing a a perfectly normal sexual orientation.If the above is your bag, then you'll love Gravitation.

YesIs it good? No.Honestly if you're looking for some good ol' shonen-ai, look no further. The relationship between Yuki and Shuichi is pretty cookie cutter stuff- but the fact that this was written in the nineties makes it a bit more special. It actually does tackle some tough subjects like homophobia and sexual harassment but not well enough for it to be actually commendable. At least it isn't glorifying rape (*cough cough* koisuru boukun) And I have to admit...

There were other anime/manga of the same genre that came out first, but Gravitation is different, you'll love the story, the characters, and the music!!!The story is one of a kind, our couple protagonists, are both successful, one being a vocalist of a famous rock band, and the other, as an award winning writer ( so none of them are poor, who needs to sell his body for money).Everything is not yaoi, Shuichi and Yuki are...the only yaoi couples, the supporting characters have lovers of their own, but not of the same gender, which is actually great, rather than a story wherein all the hot guys are making out with the other hot guys, leaving the girls all teared up.The art also improved as the story progresses, Shuichi looks way much better after cutting his hair.The MUSIC is to die for, well in the anime, of course, opening and ending themes, and all featured songs really suited the anime well. Glaring dream is one of the best songs I've heard.The only thing I don't like about this, making them fall short of a single point is that, some situations are irrelevant, like giant robots, huge guns, car and helicopter chases, it makes the story less genuine.The sequel Gravitation EX is still on going, and I don't know if the author is still planning to continue it, but I pray that she does, because I want to finish the story, it'll give me a peace of mind :) the only yaoi couples, the supporting characters have lovers of their own, but not of the same gender, which is actually great, rather than a story wherein all the hot guys are making out with the other hot guys, leaving the girls all teared up.The art also improved as the story progresses, Shuichi looks way much better after cutting his hair.The MUSIC is to die for, well in the anime, of course, opening and ending themes, and all featured songs really suited the anime well.

And if there are, there's hardly any plot to it at all. If you just want to watch sexual intercourse, this isn't for you. All there really is in the anime is a few kiss scenes. But, the plot makes up for it. Even though it's a cliche plot, the characters and sound made up for it. The animation was shockingly well. I could barely tell the anime was old. The art works well and makes the series all more the laugh.

And anime.Because I wasn't a fangirl before I watched it, I didn't base the entire show on the yaoi factor.Characters- Shuichi was a really cute and funny protagonist. He was definitely my favorite. I liked all the characters for different reasons, though somehow, I never really liked Tohma (or Ayaka, but who did?). I might have to...take another look since my character tastes have changed since then.Sound- The whole show is about music, and the music was great! I was used to American pop radio, so the lyrics (translated) were something new, but I still liked the songs.Voice Acting- I first watched the show in English dub, and I loved the rest of the show so much I didn't even realize how bad it was. However, after the first 2 episodes I couldn't find the English dub anywhere else on my Ipod's Youtube app, so I watched the show with the original Japanese dub. At first it was hard to follow the subs, but I liked it better, because Shuichi's, Tohma's, and Ryuichi's voices were SO MUCH MORE FITTING. And because Sailor Moon was my next anime, after hearing the English dub was so terrible, I didn't watch English dubbed anime for a while. So this might've spoiled English dubs for me.Art- The art was good. I started drawing manga because of this show. It was a lot better than mine, and it inspired me, so I have to give it credit. I didn't see any breaks in animation.Story- I loved the story. I laughed, I cried, I forgot about the world because I was so entranced into the story. It was good how they balanced their relationship with the career and not overdoing one over the other.OVA- The OVA was ok. I hated how they changed the art though. Shuichi's pink hair suit him perfectly. I just really didn't like the art.So yes, this anime is very special to me. I highly advise you watch it, even if shounen-ai isn't your thing. take another look since my character tastes have changed since then.Sound- The whole show is about music, and the music was great!

The story doesn’t have anything new in it, the clumsy and persistent guy falls in love with the cold hearted hot guy with a dark past. But the way the present it keeps you entertained.Although if you like anime with a serious and in depth plot with a lot...of meaning I don’t recommend you watching this.It is an anime that will make you forget everything and laugh at the silly things that happen.

Its shounen ai and the relationship between Yuki n Shuichi is very awkward yet cute :P2. Yuki's male japanese voice is very sexy and deep and I would recommend you watch it only in japanese with subs because the dubbing was Atrocious!!3. The music from Shuichi and other singers in the anime are very catchy and sound like the kind of music you want on your mp3 player lolOver all the story isnt anything special but I think its very enjoyable! The only downside is they didnt add much detail to it and the ending felt rushed to...me so they could have done 21 eps easily but they chose not to still, this shouldnt stop you from watching it as its a enjoyable shounen ai/BL anime! me so they could have done 21 eps easily but they chose not to still, this shouldnt stop you from watching it as its a enjoyable shounen ai/BL anime!"", ""This was surprisingly so entertaining! Jam-packed with every romance cliche and every and all possible scenarios, Gravitation is so nice to watch and very funny at times. The story is very, VERY dramatic but I really enjoyed it. I also loved the characters so much. Eiri and Shuichi's relationship is that of a typical romance show but also very cute!! I liked that, for the most part, the people around them were very supportive and they do talk about same-sex relationships although not in a way to make a statement or anything. I also noticed that there are only a few romantic relationships portrayed which...I appreciated! Usually, a lot of the side characters would get a potential love interest but that's not the sole focus of the show. Granted, there are only 13 episodes and more to the manga. However, the art is not the best.... I'm a sucker for this style in particular so I don't mind but there were some noticeable moments where the art was lacking. But besides that, I really liked this short series??? Definitely one I would come back to rewatch. I appreciated!

Speaking for the anime itself, it's pretty good: short and sweet.The story is simple, and far from anything truly original, about a protagonist, generally liked by everyone, who wants to bring their band to platinum level.However, what makes this anime stand alone from the rest is the difference in characters.  Being only 13 episode, there isn't a lot of chance for the characters to be discussed deeply, which is fine, considering this anime shouldn't be taken to seriously anyways.  The characters are funny...even the jokes, however lame, sometimes leave me smiling.The music is...good, and even if it's not exactly your style, I found that it was catchy enough to get used to, and it ended up complementing the characters and the series.I would recommend that if you're in the mood for something light, and don't mind mildly implied shonen-ai, you should sit down and watch this. You can finish it in a day or two XDAlso, I'd like to mention that i saw this anime in English.

It continues the proud tradition of romance protagonists fighting against all odds to keep someone important to them, while being surrounded by a cast of characters who would all be better, for them.The early episodes were a bit of a chore to get through. In true paperback romance fashion, the stock and trade of Gravitation, on a scene-by-scene basis, is emotional immediacy. Everything that happens to Shuichi and Yuki is the height of drama, the stakes are as high as they\'re ever going to...be, and every episode feels like the season finale or even the series finale. It can be a bit much to take in. I\'m still trying to get acclimated to the characters and the world, and I\'m being forced to deal with emotional tones that would come at the end of a more competently paced series.In truth, you\'re not supposed to watch the show with a critical eye, like I decided to do. Rather, you\'re supposed to immerse yourself in the feels, accept the vibes as they\'re presented to you. Once I reminded myself to do that, it got a fair sight more tolerable. I even wound up enjoying my experience, by the end. A few of the sight gags are actually pretty funny, and once the writers decided to get past Yuki\'s initial phase of ""playing dumb manipulative games with the heart of some dude who literally doesn\'t deserve it,"" I found his struggles to engage emotionally with Shuichi to be... coherent? Interesting? I was engaged with it.There are a few elements of the plot I don\'t particularly like. Without going into spoilers, certain elements get thrown around that the writers, I feel, don\'t handle with the appropriate level of respect. Rather heavy plot beats get dropped into the story, seemingly for no other reason than to create drama, and are discarded as irrelevant as soon as they\'ve been allowed to appear on screen and make the JoJo ""menacing"" vignette at the protagonists. But, as I said, this sort of high intensity emotional storytelling is de riguer for romances, and by letting go and stewing in the vibes, the intended experience was still more positive than negative.Overall, I\'d probably put Gravitation in between a 6 and a 7. It is an okay show. If you\'re a fan of romance stories, this is definitely an appealing one to watch. be, and every episode feels like the season finale or even the series finale.

Good times hahahaha.Yes I did watch the dubbed version of this but I was still kid back then and I get annoyed at subtitles lol.Thinking way back I enjoyed all of the episodes of this show. The funniest is dubbed king dedede,I mean his voice,his accent,It's just perfect hahahahaha.If you still watch cartoons or just a Kirby fan and If you want more kiddy  innocent stories then I recommend this anime to ya'll....(First Review By The Way) (First Review By The Way)"", ""I personally have enjoyed what I have watched of Kirby because I am a huge Kirby fan at heart. There are adorable parts to each episode (in other words, everything Kirby does is cutecutecute), and, honestly, that's enough to keep me entertained at times.However, this anime is obviously geared towards kids for the most part and thus can get pretty annoying at times (for instance, how many times will Kirby be told to inhale an enemy he *can't* inhale?). The storyline is nonexistent at worst and bland at best, although the plotline regarding the origins of Kirby is somewhat interesting.I would watch this anime...if you're a fan of Kirby; I would also like to say that you can easily jump into the middle of the series to watch various episodes without having to know a lot of background, which is a plus for me. if you're a fan of Kirby; I would also like to say that you can easily jump into the middle of the series to watch various episodes without having to know a lot of background, which is a plus for me."", 'I\'d always enjoyed the Kirby games, but in many of the games, there isn\'t really a sense of community and the characters don\'t tend to speak that much. This show has a world full of goofy characters with personalities!At first, I was worried that this show would taint my opinion of the games, but it provided some explanations for things and made me like this franchise even more than I used to.Plot (7/10 - Good):This show has a very episodic formula and the plot is typically just that King Dedede tries to defeat Kirby using the Demon Beasts he orders from Holy Nightmare...Co/Nightmare Enterprises (in the dub) while messing with everyone else in Cappy Town. Sometimes Dedede doesn\'t do anything, but it still mainly Holy Nightmare\'s fault that anyone has problems at all. Still, I found it a fun series and they always managed to keep things interesting.There are also the Star Warriors and the Galaxy Soldier Army side plot who had some sort of war where they tried to rebel against Nightmare, but most died or went into hiding, which I found cool. Although most of the history with that isn\'t touched upon that deeply.This series can be quite childish, as it is a kid\'s anime. Though it can sometimes be kind of dark/serious, at least in the japanese version. 4kids censored most of the darker moments in the dub and added a bunch of wacky music.Art (5/10 - Average)I enjoy the cheerful artstyle of this show. It seems decent in my opinion. Everything\'s colorful and there\'s so many cute things. The animation isn\'t that exceptional or fluid. It has definitely aged somewhat. There are segments where they used quite a bit of CGI/CE 3d effects and I think that it\'s fine mostly, but that\'s where its age definitely shows the most. In my opinion it\'s weird how they made Dyna Blade literally always 3d, she doesn\'t look too good ngl.Sound (7/10 - Good ((scored for the Japanese version))):The voice actors in this show are great in the Japanese version, though I dislike a majority of the voices in the English version. They express emotion well and Meta Knight sounds badass, you could forget you\'re watching Kirby lol.Southern Dedede is a classic and pretty hilarious I must admit even as a sub watcher. He\'s like Foghorn Leghorn, but raspier and a penguin. Fake Hispanic Meta Knight makes me cringe I\'m sorry, especially with that knock-off Zorro music they added in. But I may be biased, I\'ve gotta admit I do dislike how campy 4kids\' voice acting/added soundtracks are most of the time, especially after seeing the Japanese. Tiff and Tokkori, the bird guy sounded really annoying especially from what I\'ve heard of them in English.The music of the Japanese version is great. A lot of it is remixes of classic songs from the games, too. I\'ve always really liked Kirby soundtracks. I can\'t say no to that and that weird-ass ""Macho-san"" weight loss song ""Go Go Heaven"", though it was weird, it was catchy af.Characters (6/10 - Fine):They\'ve added some exclusive characters in this series. Some of them are just temporary one-offs, some are side characters, but others are even main characters. (Escargon/Escargoon and Customer service, two characters originally from the anime actually later appeared in the game Kirby: Mass Attack though as a cameo though which is pretty nifty.)About the characters though:There are the Cappies who are the main inhabitants of the town and instead of attacking people and wearing strange mushroom caps and bouncing around like they do in the games, they are a somewhat peaceful, civlized people, though they are quite stupid and due to this are manipulated by Dedede often enough in this show.Kirby is a pink puffball who can copy the abilities of others or of things. He is a Star Warrior. He\'s confirmed to be a baby in this show, so he can\'t speak except for the made up word \'Poyo\', but he\'s pretty cute. He seems to understand others just fine despite not being able to speak though.Kirby loves eating, sleeping and playing with his friends. He\'s not the smartest and is quite naive, being a baby, as seen in many episodes where he gets tricked/ridiculed (mostly by King Dedede) very easily. He\'s cute, yet he can fight fiercely whenever needed, often aided by his warp star and copy abilities.Fumu/Tiff is one of the villagers who is not a Cappy. She is quite compassionate towards others and one of the few of average intellect to smart in this show so I found myself agreeing with her quite a bit. Although sometimes she is also naive and gets annoyed easily, being a child. She is one of the main characters and usually one of the main reasons why Dedede\'s plans fail. She is very protective of Kirby and loves and cares about him. Due to that fact, she can control his warp star and calls for it when he needs it most.Bun/Tuff is Fumu\'s younger brother. He is like Fumu\'s opposite, being brash and generally quite dumb, but they still get along well.King Dedede is a spoiled, selfish, bratty penguin who always has to get his way. He\'s always buying new demon beasts/monsters for his amusement which he uses to try to defeat Kirby, but always fails and ends up with a huge bill for buying the demon beast without looking at the price. He seems to enjoy bullying Escargon despite him being his most loyal lackey.Escargon is Dedede\'s sidekick/servant who gets beaten up all the time, yet stays with him. He seems to care a lot about his king and is very loyal, he will also happily join him in pestering others.Meta Knight is the mysterious, cool-headed knight guy. He\'s an experienced Star Warrior who works for King Dedede, but will disobey orders when they\'re utter bullcrap. He\'s pretty strong, but he only ever helps Kirby if he REALLY needs it. Oh yeah and his eyes change color depending on his mood, now tell me that isn\'t sick.The main cast generally have an interesting dynamic and there\'s plenty of conflict and bumps in the road to spice things up. All in all though, there isn\'t much to write home about. The characters have basic personality traits and not a whole lot of depth to them, but that suits Kirby just fine.Some of the plots in this show teach lots of great life lessons btw, yup. Such as...Don\'t kill people\'s dads...Don\'t waste food...and slavery is bad. :)If you watch this series, I would recommend watching the original Japanese version. But I personally couldn\'t some of the later episodes with subs since these are all fansubbed and there was never an official subbed release like newer anime tend to get so that might be a problem for those of us who can\'t speak Japanese, unless you can switch to English and deal with that change for some episodes at the end.But yeah... the English version changed many things including: bits of some of the characters\' personality, some scenes that were deleted or heavily altered (like the reference to the movie Psycho in the Halloween episode lol) and things in general that were alteredLike instead of there being a rebel ""Galaxy Soldier Army"", all the rebels/army were unanimously referred to as Star Warriors, even if they\'re not Star Warriors. May be a nitpick, but Star Warriors were seemingly supposed to be great warriors with lots of power and higher up ranks, rather than just any generic soldier. They got rid of most of the original soundtrack, which was really nice as there were lots of remixes of songs from the games. Also, I found many of the English voices annoying, but that\'s my opinion.Edit (2023): I enjoyed this show a lot as a kid. The original version of this review was actually written by twelve year old me growing up in foster care and I have tried to keep the original ""feelings"" intact even having come back to edit this to an extent so it\'s on the same level as future reviews.

I watched Kirby: Right Back at Ya when I was younger, so nostalgia might play a small factor in this review.The series has its ups and downs. I personally dislike the dubbed version by 4Kids, since every other sentence out of a character's mouth is a corny pun, and somehow 4Kids managed to butcher an already stale story line from the original Japanese version.If you expect complicated story lines and many plot twists, this show isn't for you. It's simple to follow, since it's a show aimed at kids. If you plan...on watching this show instead of playing Kirby's Adventure/Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland to understand the story line, I highly recommend you do not do that. The games and this show's backgrounds are from completely different universes altogether.The animation isn't something to praise over, although that's comparing to today's standards. I didn't complain when I watched it years ago. The animators wanted to include some 3D animation within some scenes. Some of it works out, some of it doesn't.I think the best part about the show is, not Kirby, despite him being the main character, but Dedede's and Escargon's shenanigans. The two of them make up the show's entertainment more than any other character. There are a few other characters who get their time in the spotlight, but it's usually only for an episode or two out of the 100 episodes, 101 if you include the 3D special.I believe this show really did have a lot of potential. The villains for example had little background information, so technically you can imagine their background any way you want. They could have made the villains darker and much more threatening to Kirby had they taken the chance, since they're very well known to do that in the Kirby games. But just like the games, they don't emphasize much on background and story.Overall, I love the show, but it could have been so much more. on watching this show instead of playing Kirby's Adventure/Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland to understand the story line, I highly recommend you do not do that.

It has an easy an simple plot that anyone can follow. Kirby, a pink (alien?) star warrior crash lands on the planet of Pop Star. There he befriends the citizens of Cappy Town and defends them from monsters that their king, King Dedede, sends to kill Kirby.The characters are very likable. Tiff and Toff are Kirby's best friends who will always look out for him. King Dedede is a funny yet foolish villain whose reasons for antagonising Kirby are like that of Lex Luthor's hatred of Superman. And lastly, Meta Knight, the coolest character in...the whole show. He is the dark, quite, mysterious knight who works for the king but will help Kirby whenever he gets the chance.Art/Animation (8.5/10): The art is modern. The show often uses bright colors to emphasize Cappy Town as a peaceful and happy place. The show was animated with CGI. The CGI was fluid and worked well with the 2D artwork but there were some scenes where the CGI failed to render properly.Sound/Music (8.5/10): The sound/music were good.

The anime has lots of characters and monsters that do not appear in the games, so if you want to watch something with lots of different monsters, then this is for you.The story of Kirby: Right Back at Ya! is ok. The problem with the story is that once you have watched the first few episodes, then it is just like that for the rest of the anime; King Dedede and...Escargoon trying to get rid of Kirby. It is very predictable, and has almost the exact same plot for every episode. The story is not bad, but it isn't good either.The art is nice. This anime has lots of creative monsters that have been designed very well. The characters are well designed too, even though Kirby is a round ball which is straight forward to draw. Kirby: Right Back at Ya! also has decent effects which give you different feelings as you watch.The sounds are actually quite good. The music that goes on during the episodes is quite catchy and suits the event that happens at the time. Something that I really like about the sound is that every character has different music that plays every time they appear in an episode. I especially like Meta Knight's guitar.The characters are great! They are well designed and some make you smile just by appearing in an episode. The monsters in the anime which do not appear in the games are the best, in my opinion, such as Wolfwrath. Meta Knight reveals some of his back story in the anime, which makes him even more interesting.Watching Kirby: Right Back at Ya! can really keep you busy when you have nothing to do. Once you have starting watching, you can't help but to find out what goes on next, especially if it is about the characters you like the most. While it is very predictable what will happen, it is still fun finding out what will go on in the next episode.Overall, Kirby: Right Back at Ya! Is a very good anime; I would recommend it if you like cuteness, or even if you like a bit of action sometimes. It may not be perfect, but you should give the first few episodes a try and if you like them, then watch the whole thing. If you don't like them, then it probably isn't the anime for you, as it is pretty much the same thing in every episode. Escargoon trying to get rid of Kirby. It is very predictable, and has almost the exact same plot for every episode. The story is not bad, but it isn't good either.The art is nice. This anime has lots of creative monsters that have been designed very well. The characters are well designed too, even though Kirby is a round ball which is straight forward to draw. Kirby: Right Back at Ya! also has decent effects which give you different feelings as you watch.The sounds are actually quite good.

Once fully in English & about halfway through in Japanese. Based upon a popular video game series by Nintendo & Hal Laboratory, the anime did it\'s own strange adaptation based upon the video games. There\'s one thing to note about the anime also, most notable the English dubbing company. Apparently, while some people claim that 4kids is the butcher of all decent anime *cough Sonic X, *cough One Piece.* With the Kirby anime, honestly to me it\'s not all that different from English to Japanese....While some forms of ""American Dubbing"" have been put into place, however we\'ll get into that soon.. To me it wasn\'t all that different. But now let\'s get into the concept of this anime.Now basic story, Kirby lands on Pop Star he found by two children named Tiff & Tuff (lots of puns in the english dub). Kirby lives with the family to fit in more with society and in Cappy Town. King Dedede & his minion Escargoon try to defeat Kirby for a profit for the company Nightmare Industries. Basically that\'s the jist of the story. Nothing more to say honestly, it\'s basic but it gets the job done. All of the characters speak except for Kirby, which is similar to how he is in the video games. So I won\'t complain. They got the source material right for that.Most episode basically follow a similar path, Kirby is loafing around being himself, the characters give a lecture on how Kirby should act. Like Kirby has the personality of a child & he honestly doesn\'t know any better. Dedede hires a monster or a setup or Kirby and his two friends get lost somewhere. Plus, Kirby once in awhile gets a copy ability to win the fight. This sort of set up runs for about a hundred episodes most of the time and honestly does get extremely tiresome. However there are some unique episodes that sometimes come out if you do pay attention. Plus, it\'s a shame that Kirby rarely gets an screen time sometimes. Most of the attention is either given to Dedede trying to end Kirby or Tiff/Tuff giving a pointless lecture. Kirby is either seen in the beginning eating food or in the end fighting an enemy. A better build up would have worked way more honestly.There are some small bits of censorship such as the removal of guns, the context of Japanese food has vanished & even English text was cleaned out of the anime. It\'s minor though, cause to me it doesn\'t effect the quality of the anime but it\'s just a notice for some of you. Lots of characters from the games make tons of cameos such as Meta Knight, Whispy Woods, tons of Waddle Dees, Chef Kawasaki & lots of enemies. The art style is also decent to me, the colors are quite vibrant and the main characters do pop out. But a little flat in terms of the art direction and scenery. The music is nothing to write home about either, even in the English or Japanese dub.The voice acting in English is quite funny honestly. Nothing too terrible considering the source material. But it leaves a lot to be desired for. The Spanish accent of Meta Knight is honestly insanely cringy to no end but King Dedede\'s Southern accent is absolutely hilarious though if you don\'t take it seriously. The puns in this anime are insanely noticeable, some of them don\'t make sense but you have to realize it\'s an anime for children so it does make sense why.Overall, Kirby Right Back at Ya is something you\'d probably enjoy if you\'re a huge fan of the video game series. But as an anime itself, it leaves a lot to be desired for. The lack of Kirby himself really diminishes the value. Plus the typical plot, generic OST & questionable voice acting will probably get you scratching your head asking why. Though some of the source material is there and a few episode are enjoyable. You should probably look at this anime not as a tribute to the video games, but as a massive joke. Think of it like fan fiction, but it\'s not that painful.

It's mediocre at best to say the least, can get quite cheesy sometimes but still somewhat enjoyable.Art 7/10: The art is rather good, the characters are well drawn and there is also some 3D animation thrown in which may get a little annoying but it's not terrible. The backgrounds and everything else seem decent but just don't expect anything amazing.Characters...9/10: The characters are great, likable and somewhat well developed, I'll briefly describe some of the main ones.Kirby - Although he is a baby, Kirby has the power to suck up any enemy's powers and use their own powers against them. Aside from battling, Kirby loves to eat, sleep, and be around his friends.King Dedede - He's the bad guy that will do anything to get rid of Kirby. Why? He is actually jealous on how many people like Kirby. He purchases monsters from a company called Nightmare Enterprises (Holy Nightmare in the Japanese version) so that they can attack Kirby. King Dedede lives in his own castle along side with Escargon and other characters.Meta Knight - He is known to be quite mysterious since he works for King Dedede but even so, he knows quite a lot about Kirby. He likes to push Kirby to his limits so that Kirby becomes more aware of what he is capable of. He is also the last of the Star Warriors that remained long ago on long battles against Nightmare. He usually doesn't like to get involved into any situation until the last minute so that he makes sure Kirby is prepared to fight any unexpected monsters. Overall, he's a smart and skilled warrior that knows how to get things done.Keep in mind, there are some characters that never appeared in the Kirby games but they seem to fit in well.Voice/Music 8/10: The voice acting in both the Japanese and English dub are well done. The music in the Japanese version was actually better than the English version. If you seen the English dubbed version you'll always get introduced to the annoying Kirby intro and it's also in the credits while the Japanese version is the complete opposite.Overall 8/10: Although Kirby: Right Back At Ya! is quite good, it does have it's flaws but even so, it's one of the better cartoon shows Nintendo has created. It would have been better if 4Kids didn't get their hands on this show since a few scenes were taken out/edited and this hurt the show from what it originally had. If you're new to Kirby then this show wouldn't probably be a good start but if you're a fan of Kirby and have not seen the show, it's worth giving it a try. 9/10: The characters are great, likable and somewhat well developed, I'll briefly describe some of the main ones.Kirby - Although he is a baby, Kirby has the power to suck up any enemy's powers and use their own powers against them.

This is what you would call an initial review. It is my impression of this show after watching a good handful of episodes. This is a long series and if I am to be honest I don\'t think I will finish it. As a side note to all you nintendians out there I am not a fan boy nor am I a hater. This is just a review from a dude that watched the show. On to it we go.This show is about as Saturday morning cartoon as it comes. It is cute as all hell and not in the traditional anime style...but more in the god dam I want to punch it sort of way. There was nothing overly smart or even particularly interesting about the story either. On top of it all every thing and every name is a pun, and Meta Knight is some sort of Spanish (castanet entrance music and all). Now I don\'t claim to know much about Kirby but that seems a bit off to me. None of this is necessarily a bad thing though. It makes for great background watching. Some ambient noise to study with or just to play when cleaning or something. The opening song is a good laugh as well.I could go on with how the characters don\'t have a lot of depth to them or how simple the animation is but It would not be far to do so. There is an over arching story and there is also 3+ seasons so I have no doubt the characters will grow in a very Pokemon style pattern, gradually. Of the 10 odd eps I watched there were still moments that had me laughing so I think it will defiantly get better. The ""winks"" made to the fans of the small pink monster are less than subtle so a true lover of Kirby will get a kick out of this one no question.So to wrap it up I say have a go and decide if its for your self. It is a great one for the kids as it follows a very simple and repeatable template and as I said its can quite easily be watched on the hand so its not the worst for the older generation.Fan boys/girls gonna love I can tell you that. but more in the god dam I want to punch it sort of way.

But despite this, there are many themes that ring true to adulthood and there is plenty of social commentary that rings true to this day. A few examples:Episode 28, Pollution and Exploitation of LabourThis episode features the brainwashing of citizens into performing labour, in order to industrialize Pupupu Land. The effects of pollution and brainwashing are clearly seen here, as well as the lesson that heroisms can be a thankless job.Episode 49,...Animation IndustryThis episode is arguably one of the funniest ones in the anime. It is a satire of the anime industry, where many are overworked and underpaid. The civilians in Pupu Village all make an anime under the command of Dedede, which ends with them being severely sleep deprived and one screaming ""Animators have human rights too!"" The finished anime is a parody of the Kirby anime, with Dedede taking the place of the hero. It\'s a whole entire mess, with the animators also filling the roles of voice actors. Here is a quote that sums it up.Meta Knight: Doing post recording without rehearsal... this isn\'t sane.The whole ""anime"" they\'re broadcasting just gets worse and worse, but in the most meta and hilarious way.The HumourMuch of this anime\'s humor relies on introducing an idea, and having it build in ridiculousless or insanity that it eventually spirals out of control- eg. A ""which restaurant can make the spicier dish"" episode, a pie-throwing episode, an obesity episode, ""devil kirby"". If that\'s your thing, I would definitely recommend this anime. As well as this, the anime regularly parodies themselves and inserts references from pop culture.The CharactersDedede and Escargon\'s shenanigans are a must-watch: though much of their interactions is slapstick, they are sometimes shown to cling to each other in times of need and Escargon is once seen singing a parody of the anime\'s OP, with the lyrics about Dedede. He also outright states he loves him in doing so. Their relationship is what makes the show.Meta Knight is one of the characters dearly loved by the viewers. He is one of the few with a developed past, and a mentor figure for Kirby. He is often the voice of reason, and although he may act morally gray, he is always there for Kirby in the end. Most times he takes on a serious or cool role, but that is what makes his comedic moments all the more funnier.Oh, Kawasaki. This guy might be one of the funniest characters in the anime. From his horrible cooking shenanigans to his one-liners, his presence makes a scene more hilarious. One of the most memorable lines I remember is the others discussing they haven\'t seen Dedede recently (obesity episode) and Kawasaki outright saying ""Maybe he\'s DEAD?"" Oh, he also once tries to cook Kirby, who is blissfully unaware of what\'s going on.All in all, this is an amazing must-watch especially for kids, and an anime even adults can enjoy if they watch the right episodes.

Yet thanks to endless puns, interesting characters and some familiar voices (Dr Eggman) this is something everyone can enjoy.What particularly impressed me about the characters is they stick to their core personality throughout the show and you don't find yourself halfway through a series wondering what on earth happened to a character that was so fundamentally firm to their convictions. The best example of this would be Tiff who is always on the lookout for potential trouble and makes a concerted effort to do what is...best for Kirby and the residents of Capi Town.Initially Kirby will come across as very simple and cute, but his growth in the show not only in each episode but throughout the series is great to see. Not only does he improve in terms of powers but you see him develop as a person as well. If you have 20 minutes to spare I recommend watching this show. best for Kirby and the residents of Capi Town.Initially Kirby will come across as very simple and cute, but his growth in the show not only in each episode but throughout the series is great to see.

As far as the actual show goes it's loosely connected and clearly designed for a younger audience.Each episode is typically New Character/Event comes to Cappy town - 12 minutes of Kirby and friends/Dedede doing whatever - Final fight with a copy ability.There are exceptions and many episodes noticeably focus on psa themes form the early 2000's like being environmentally conscious or brushing your teeth. Honestly, not a terrible show but the main characters, Tiff and Tuff, are annoying at times, which...is a large detriment to episodes that feature them prominently. Kirby is cute, Meta Knight has a cool voice, but the real showmaker is Dedede. His southwestern accent and general antics with Escargoon are the highlight of the show and what makes it so memorable and enjoyable.As far as the original Japanese audio goes, I personally can't imagine enjoying it aside from the better soundtrack, which was modified for the 4kids dub. The Japanese cast is fairly standard for a typical cartoon, however the eccentricities in many of the voices don't carry over well in my opinion. For me, and I assume most people, Kirby Right Back At Ya is a good show because the dub is great and iconic. Aside from the dubbing, it's about as standard as an early 2000's kid's show gets. is a large detriment to episodes that feature them prominently.

(Well, I think about half or so of the viewers when it first aired already had a Kirby game or two, but there's that chance most of the rest never played a Kirby game.) While the original name is Kirby of the Stars, Western audiences know it best as Kirby: Right Back at Ya!; indeed, MAL has it listed as such. 4KIDS was sadly the distributor, however, they know how to market anime and make it popular amongst children (as evident...by Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!). Kirby may have been better off in someone else's care, but would we have the same memorable elements that 4KIDS have given us such as Dedede talking like a hick, Escargoon sounding like Paul Lynde, and Meta Knight with a Mexican-sounding accent?While it's still the case with most other games-turned-into-anime, Kirby of the Stars has a bit of an episodic feel to it, carrying a story complete with original characters while still keeping to the Kirby universe. And yet, the story feels a little fresh in some aspects. For starters, it portrays everyone's favorite pink hero Kirby akin to a baby who can only say “Poyo” at first. Kirby doesn't speak in the games, and we got some voice-acting of Kirby in Super Smash Brothers, but he didn't sound or act like a young child (I could be wrong, though—again, I'm just a casual fan). In the anime, he needs guidance from Tiff whom acts as a mother-figure, and the friends he makes over time, such as Tuff, the local Cappy children, Tokkori (though he won't admit it), and many others. In the meantime, the tyrant, childish King Dedede doesn't want him around, and the moment Kirby proves he can fight and thus interfere, he's determined to really get rid of him. (But he develops a tiny soft spot for him as time goes on.) What he doesn't realize is he's being played by Nightmare Enterprises, the corporation he has been affiliating himself with, and their presence can be felt throughout the show. And surprisingly for a show about a cute character doing adorable things in a slice-of-life and bringing a laugh or two out of the viewer, there's some pretty deep and dark moments that come up—in the original Japanese at least.The art is easily recognizable, and is unique in that they've incorporated 3D into the 2D animation. Kirby, King Dedede, Escargoon and some of the monsters are drawn like this most of the time, you really can't miss it. In comparing the first episode with the last, one can see the art shift in how the 3D is presented. It's very conspicuous in the beginning, and it slowly starts to blend in with the rest of the animation. 3D animation in cartoons wasn't unheard of, per se, but it was still a bit primitive, and it does show its age. It's not as bad as one would think, but it's a bit jarring in some areas. As for the colors, as it's a kids' show taking place in a world that is peaceful for the most part, everything's colorful from the characters to backgrounds. And some of it is pretty to look at. King Dedede's castle is one of my favorite structures in the show in how it's presented from the outside and inside. There are numerous rooms in the castle, and they all have their own special lighting and color scheme.When it comes to the voices and music, the original wins hands down, no questions asked. However, all of the opening theme songs—both the original and dub's—are fantastic. The first Japanese opening is bouncy and light-hearted, the second is orchestral and dramatic, a song fit for a hero saving the day. The dub's, in the meantime, is classic catchy 4KIDS-fare that proclaims Kirby is going to kick your butt whether you take him seriously or not. Speaking of 4KIDS, their music is hit-and-miss, and I mean REALLY hit-and-miss. By themselves, some of the pieces of music are fine. But 4KIDS has that mentality that every single scene needs music in it, so when scenes change, so does the music, and they basically bash into each other trying to shove one out of the way for a few bars. After a few episodes, one will eventually recognize each theme and thus disrupts the mood, because rarely does the music fit in with the mood.Voice-acting is 100 times better in the original because almost everyone at least sounds like they fit their roles (the Mayor sounds too squeaky and feeble in the original and it kinds bothers me). Kenichi Ogata as King Dedede and Naoki Tatsuta as Escargoon are in my opinion the best-sounding characters in the anime, though Banjou Ginga as the Customer Service Guy, Atsushi Kisaichi as Meta Knight and Makiko Omoto as Kirby are excellent as well. However, that isn't to say 4KIDS doesn't have their own greatness. Ted Lewis as both King Dedede and Escargoon makes it a hilarious combination with their dialogue. 4KIDS' scripts are “meh” at best, but they know how to write funny dialogue, and they went all out with these two. King Dedede's voice is based off George W. Bush, and Escargoon's Paul Lynde. Dan Green makes for a very convincing slimy Sales Guy, he's a joy to listen to. And then you have Meta Knight being portrayed by Eric Stuart as a Mexican vampire. Some people don't like this voice, but others find it charming or amusing. Don't get me wrong, it can sound grating on the ears after a while, but in small doses, it's great. With exception for a couple of other voices here and there, the rest of the cast are decent at best. While I can't stand Tuff's voice (Tara Sands has her good moments elsewhere, just not here), Tiff I feel doesn't have a great performance in the dub. Kerry Williams isn't a bad voice actress, but the voice chosen for Tiff is a bit iffy at times, and she sounds more loud/big-mouthed than she really is.So overall, Kirby of the Stars is a sweet anime in which the heart is with the characters and their interactions. Since the audience is watching them live their life—and each character has a different way of living—we come to know them on a near-personal level. Special mention goes to the Cappies, who at times are hard to like because they're rather stupid and cowardly, whether it's the result of living under a tyrannical king or what, I don't know. But nearly all of them have their own personalities, and there are certain individuals who are special in their own right. (It's just that sadly, some of those individuals become their own person late in the anime, though those episodes tend to be enough to give you a better opinion on them.) There are other characters that show up here and there, and some of them are somewhat recurring, but there's a lot of them to really list any specific ones outside of I suppose Knuckle Joe.The anime is kinda hard to find depending on the episode and whether you're watching it subbed or dubbed. But it's well worth the search, and depending on your own personal tastes, you may come to like specific episodes and/or characters. And there are many such memorable moments in both versions. Popularity-wise, it's no Pokémon or Yu-Gi-Oh, but I honestly feel it should be up there if only because of its heart and ability of sucking up one's own heart in the process. by Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!). Kirby may have been better off in someone else's care, but would we have the same memorable elements that 4KIDS have given us such as Dedede talking like a hick, Escargoon sounding like Paul Lynde, and Meta Knight with a Mexican-sounding accent?While it's still the case with most other games-turned-into-anime, Kirby of the Stars has a bit of an episodic feel to it, carrying a story complete with original characters while still keeping to the Kirby universe. And yet, the story feels a little fresh in some aspects. For starters, it portrays everyone's favorite pink hero Kirby akin to a baby who can only say “Poyo” at first. Kirby doesn't speak in the games, and we got some voice-acting of Kirby in Super Smash Brothers, but he didn't sound or act like a young child (I could be wrong, though—again, I'm just a casual fan). In the anime, he needs guidance from Tiff whom acts as a mother-figure, and the friends he makes over time, such as Tuff, the local Cappy children, Tokkori (though he won't admit it), and many others. In the meantime, the tyrant, childish King Dedede doesn't want him around, and the moment Kirby proves he can fight and thus interfere, he's determined to really get rid of him. (But he develops a tiny soft spot for him as time goes on.) What he doesn't realize is he's being played by Nightmare Enterprises, the corporation he has been affiliating himself with, and their presence can be felt throughout the show. And surprisingly for a show about a cute character doing adorable things in a slice-of-life and bringing a laugh or two out of the viewer, there's some pretty deep and dark moments that come up—in the original Japanese at least.The art is easily recognizable, and is unique in that they've incorporated 3D into the 2D animation. Kirby, King Dedede, Escargoon and some of the monsters are drawn like this most of the time, you really can't miss it. In comparing the first episode with the last, one can see the art shift in how the 3D is presented. It's very conspicuous in the beginning, and it slowly starts to blend in with the rest of the animation. 3D animation in cartoons wasn't unheard of, per se, but it was still a bit primitive, and it does show its age. It's not as bad as one would think, but it's a bit jarring in some areas. As for the colors, as it's a kids' show taking place in a world that is peaceful for the most part, everything's colorful from the characters to backgrounds. And some of it is pretty to look at. King Dedede's castle is one of my favorite structures in the show in how it's presented from the outside and inside. There are numerous rooms in the castle, and they all have their own special lighting and color scheme.When it comes to the voices and music, the original wins hands down, no questions asked. However, all of the opening theme songs—both the original and dub's—are fantastic. The first Japanese opening is bouncy and light-hearted, the second is orchestral and dramatic, a song fit for a hero saving the day. The dub's, in the meantime, is classic catchy 4KIDS-fare that proclaims Kirby is going to kick your butt whether you take him seriously or not. Speaking of 4KIDS, their music is hit-and-miss, and I mean REALLY hit-and-miss. By themselves, some of the pieces of music are fine. But 4KIDS has that mentality that every single scene needs music in it, so when scenes change, so does the music, and they basically bash into each other trying to shove one out of the way for a few bars. After a few episodes, one will eventually recognize each theme and thus disrupts the mood, because rarely does the music fit in with the mood.Voice-acting is 100 times better in the original because almost everyone at least sounds like they fit their roles (the Mayor sounds too squeaky and feeble in the original and it kinds bothers me). Kenichi Ogata as King Dedede and Naoki Tatsuta as Escargoon are in my opinion the best-sounding characters in the anime, though Banjou Ginga as the Customer Service Guy, Atsushi Kisaichi as Meta Knight and Makiko Omoto as Kirby are excellent as well. However, that isn't to say 4KIDS doesn't have their own greatness. Ted Lewis as both King Dedede and Escargoon makes it a hilarious combination with their dialogue. 4KIDS' scripts are “meh” at best, but they know how to write funny dialogue, and they went all out with these two. King Dedede's voice is based off George W. Bush, and Escargoon's Paul Lynde. Dan Green makes for a very convincing slimy Sales Guy, he's a joy to listen to. And then you have Meta Knight being portrayed by Eric Stuart as a Mexican vampire. Some people don't like this voice, but others find it charming or amusing. Don't get me wrong, it can sound grating on the ears after a while, but in small doses, it's great. With exception for a couple of other voices here and there, the rest of the cast are decent at best. While I can't stand Tuff's voice (Tara Sands has her good moments elsewhere, just not here), Tiff I feel doesn't have a great performance in the dub. Kerry Williams isn't a bad voice actress, but the voice chosen for Tiff is a bit iffy at times, and she sounds more loud/big-mouthed than she really is.So overall, Kirby of the Stars is a sweet anime in which the heart is with the characters and their interactions. Since the audience is watching them live their life—and each character has a different way of living—we come to know them on a near-personal level. Special mention goes to the Cappies, who at times are hard to like because they're rather stupid and cowardly, whether it's the result of living under a tyrannical king or what, I don't know. But nearly all of them have their own personalities, and there are certain individuals who are special in their own right. (It's just that sadly, some of those individuals become their own person late in the anime, though those episodes tend to be enough to give you a better opinion on them.) There are other characters that show up here and there, and some of them are somewhat recurring, but there's a lot of them to really list any specific ones outside of I suppose Knuckle Joe.The anime is kinda hard to find depending on the episode and whether you're watching it subbed or dubbed.

I finally found it and I'm glad I did. The show is just as good as I remember it and I had an absolute blast binge-rewatching it. I gotta say the animation is not very impressive but that is not the show's fault as...it wasn't very mainstream and so it didn't have a huge budget and also TV CGI in the 2000's wasn't very developed. Although the voice acting is pretty decent, the sound design felt a bit off until I realized what I was watching is probably a dubbed version.

And what a great way to start off by reviewing a special from 91 days, an anime that was my 2nd most favorite Anime of 2016 after Mob Psycho 100. I was so happy when i got the news that 91 Days was making a special and looked forward to it. And after seeing it, I was genuinely pleased.The episode consists of 3 separate plot points. It more serves as a prequel of flashbacks with the first part (Shoal of Time) being at the time when the Vanetti kids were still...young, the second part (All our Yesterdays) which marks the introduction of Vincent Vanetti and his entry into the family, and the third part (Tomorrow, and Tomorrow) which catches up to the recent day right after the events of Episode 4 ""Losing to Win, and What Comes After"" with Angelo and Nero on the way back to Lawless.Overall, the story is pretty good for this prequel episode. Although i enjoyed all 3 plot segments,  the second segment where we first see Vincent Vanetti meet with Ganzo, Testa Lagusa, Orco and have an interesting game of cards together to pass time, really caught my interest a bit more. We finally get to see the more calculating side of Testa Lagusa, a character which had less backstory and screen time in the actual show. We also get to see a young ambitious Vincent Vanetti who joins the family and would later go on to be the established don of the Vanetti family in the main series.*My ONLY complaint is the sequence of the segments. I feel it would\'ve been so much more better had the first and second segments swapped places. The second segment should have been first in the episode since it was how it all began for the Vanetti family. It predates the first segment by a couple of years. Come to think of it, it\'s probably the very first event in the timeline of the entire showIf you are wondering whether this episode is important, then wonder no more: it does not contribute to the main plot in a major way...... but rather only in small doses. However, apart from some minor cameos, there are no teasers nor foreshadowing whatsoever. If you have seen 91 Days, then I do recommend you watch this just for the sake of a minor backstory in the form of a prequel flashback.Would I recommend to watch it ? Definitely.

This one was probably one of the best specials a series can have, it gave a lot of information that we were lacking and enforced a lot of plot points, and also, made it a lot harder on us to accept the story's closure.- Story (8.0/10):This special gave us more than we could have ever asked for, and no, it was not a definitive conclusion of the story, more like a backing up.It tells the story of the formation of the Vanetti family,...the meet up of Genzo, Vince, and Raise, some background about Nero and his siblings as kids, their , and everything, while also keeping an eye on some unincluded scenes from the current story's timeline, providing more bromance between Nero and Angelo. It was all beautiful and heartwarming.- Art (8.8/10):I have to say that this special was somehow better than the parent series in term of animation, I don't know but it felt much more shape and with more quality, the colors where more vibrant as most of the events happened in areas clouded with vegetation in a countryside setting.- Sound (7.2/10):Too bad there wasn't a DUB version for this one, it would have been far better had it have one. The SUB isn't the worse but the DUB suited this better in my opinion. I'm glad the opening and ending theme songs were kept as amazing as they were.- Character (8.0/10):This special focused more on the elderly, we had more background about Raise, Genzo, and Vincent, Orco as well, we got to see what kind of men they were, what their relationships were, it made more sense of what they did later on, and even more devastating.- Enjoyment (8.6/10):I didn't think I would enjoy 91 Days Special to this degree, this was a damn fine special episode than rose up and gave more meaning to the main franchise.- Overall (8.1/10):I would really recommend this pick, mainly of its focus on the characters, giving them extra development and dissecting them for the better.

16bit Sensation: Another Layer,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54041/16bit_Sensation__Another_Layer,"[""“A game that doesn’t dare to dream isn’t a game at all!”It’s difficult to give a series an accurate review or score just based on a few episodes and it’s entirely possible the plot ends up dropping the ball, but for now, 16bit Sensation has been a fun and compelling series with fantastic character dynamics and a lot of passion for the gaming/VN industry.If you’re familiar with the author’s other work “The World God Only Knows,” there's a lot of similarities in how this series approaches its character writing, style and humor. The main character, Konoha, has been a consistently entertaining presence throughout the few...episodes that have aired between her absolute passion for her craft as well as her silly antics. The art style and animation do a great job of bringing out her charm with how many different facial expressions she gets. She’s got some fun dynamics with the other introduced characters as well, who admittedly don’t have a ton to them just yet but certainly have potential. Even aside from the more charming comedy moments, Konoha has already had some very compelling character writing as well that will immediately get you invested in her story and goals. The quote I started this review off with comes directly from her and immediately sells you on the character, and the good moments haven’t stopped there. She feels like a great hybrid between Keima and Elsie almost, and her passion has been one of major selling points of this series. The other supporting cast members have also bounced off of her well and have been compelling and fun in their own ways. Plus, this series has cute girls! And cute girls who love cute girls! (in games)The plot hasn’t picked up a ton yet but there’s a lot to like so far. This is definitely more of a character driven show but there’s a pretty intriguing time travel plot here that does a great job exploring the history of games and VNs as a medium and I’d even say the series has a bit of an educational vibe when it comes to some of these topics. There’s also a lot of potential for where the story can go given the ability the main character seems to have been given that will allow for a lot of creativity with how the plot can be approached. It’s entirely possible it could end up dropping the ball in future episodes but for now it’s been a pretty interesting aspect of the show.The art style is visually really nice, the character designs in particular are very good with the important characters standing out visually and the art difference between 1992 and the current year feels really pronounced as well. The OST admittedly isn’t anything super special but fits for the series. All in all, this has been one of the most enjoyable and fun series this season with great humor, compelling character writing, and the overall “vibes” of the show just being super nice. I’m hoping this series gains more traction and more people check it out in the future, because there’s a lot of things to like about this series. It’s possible the series fumbles in later episodes and the score goes down, but if the plot ends up being fantastic and the characters remain compelling and have solid development, this could even turn into a 10. episodes that have aired between her absolute passion for her craft as well as her silly antics.

Many would say that it\'s Summer 2021\'s Bokutachi no Remake a.k.a Remake Our Life!, or for the veterans in us, 2017\'s offerings of Fall\'s Anime-Gataris (which is one of the first Otaku-based shows I\'ve watched since starting anime back in that year, that I still enjoy to this day), with...a tinge of Winter\'s Akiba\'s Trip The Animation or even Summer 2016\'s New Game! series, mixed in with this Spring\'s Mahou Shoujo Magical Destroyers for the insane and non-stop unpredictable story-moving action.As for 16bit Sensation, apart from the manga, which serves as the basis for the anime, which takes place in the 1990s and details the game creation processes of that era, Another Layer takes that resemblance and intertwines that with its own ""spin-off"" territory of sorts through a 3rd-person POV. The manga got its start as a Doujinshi at Comiket 91 in December 2016, created by illustrators Misato Mitsumi and Tatsuki Amazuyu of AQUAPLUS, based on their time in the bishoujo game industry, and one fine gentleman by the name of Tamaki Wakaki, the mangaka best known for Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai a.k.a The World God Only Knows, and one of the scriptwriters alongside former AQUAPLUS game writer Tatsuya Takahashi for the ""original"" anime. Trust me, if there is a show that you NEED to pay absolute attention to all of the fine details that make it work, it\'s this one.The story begins in modern-day 2023, where game production is treated like a sweatshop of black companies pushing their staff to work harder for low pay and increments, even for those who find their passion in creating games. And one such person is 19-year-old Konoha Akisato, who is a budding illustrator working hard at what she does best, but she\'s not satisfied that the game corporation company that she\'s working for doesn\'t exactly appreciate her work and even demotes her as a sub-illustrator colouring background characters. In a fit of rage, she ran out of the company, never wanting to see them again. A few days later, Konoha sighted a traditional game shop that\'s been taken care of by an old woman, who so happened to have a case of old, influential Bishoujo VNs a.k.a Visual Novels, that are sold for dirt cheap. Of course, Konoha\'s Otaku senses light up, but she feels bad for the old woman that she could not purchase them from her and leaves her unintended. A few days later, a paper bag containing those same games appears at Konoha\'s home, though she doesn\'t know what to do with it since both the old woman and the game shop mysteriously disappeared...until she opens one game and realizes that she is instantly transported back to 1992 after meeting someone who tells her of the reality that she has time-travelled back to the past. With that reality struck to her face, Konoha wants the acclaimed company Alcohol Soft to work with her dream of making Bishoujo games.Not everyone is a game industry nut, so I\'ll spare everyone\'s homework and give only the details that you need to know: the in-series game company Alcohol Soft, it\'s based on the real-life game developer Cocktail Soft, known for eroge/VNs such as Doki Doki Vacation ~Kirameku Kisetsu no Naka de~, and Welcome to Pia Carrot, both of which Misato Mitsumi and Tatsuki Amazuyu worked on before moving to AQUAPLUS (of which game studio Leaf is a sub-brand). Also, most of the games that were in the paper bag, from Dōkyūsei to Kizuato and Shizuku, were also games from AQUAPLUS/Leaf, and 1996\'s Shizuku would become the de-facto standard for how game developers would create VNs going forward, thanks to game writer-cum-scriptwriter Tatsuya Takahashi. Aside from debut director Takashi Sakuma, who doesn\'t have as much knowledge as his staff team does, you can tell that 16bit Sensation: Another Layer is a re-telling from the eyes of the prevalent people in the AniManga industry, so much so bearing the fact that it\'s a love letter to the history of Bishoujo VN games like Key\'s Kanon, Clannad, and Little Busters!, paving the rise to fame for the lucrative VN game market. This makes the anime so palpable and cements itself in a league of its own...that\'s if Tamaki Wakaki had some radical ideas introduced into this ""spin-off"". And if you\'ve watched or read his prior series, you already know what I\'m talking about. No spoilers here; it\'s best that you experience it for yourself.Joining Konoha in her game-making endeavour are the people of Alcohol Soft, whom in the future will become a tour de force in the VN games scene but will get disbanded in time to come. The first person is Mamoru Rokuda; he is the company\'s sole programmer and the son of the company\'s owner, Masaru. He is quite the rudimentary lover of the PC-98 platform (the business-oriented version of the consumer PC-88 series, which allowed its parent company, NEC, to dominate and establish the Japanese PC market from the 1980s to 2000), and he will not relent on making games for future platforms of Windows 95 and beyond. But all Konoha needs is convincing and persistence to allow him to see her vision, which he will then give way to and make her dream a reality. Thankfully, Konoha is not alone, as there are also Kaori Shimoda and Meiko Uehara, both concept and line artists, with the former being a CG illustrator and the latter wanting to become a programmer. Together with the mask-wearing scenario writer Kiyoshi Gomikawa, the 5-man team completes Alcohol Soft, bereft of Konoha\'s future technology and essentially starting from scratch for said time traveler. It\'s definitely a work of art by going back to the basics, and aesthetically, this is one of the anime\'s strong points.Studio Silver may be a rather old studio that has existed since February 2001, but their recent breakout together as a studio collab effort with Arvo Animation on the Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai a.k.a We Never Learn: BokuBen series since 2019, certainly paved the way for the studio\'s single output to come. And 4.5 years later, it\'s through this show that looks pretty decent, as far as I can tell. No problems here whatsoever if it looked like a low-budget show from the outset, which I can tell you that it\'s not.The music...is highly debatable, but it\'s definitely the elephant in the room. For Shoko Nakagawa, she\'s definitely acclimated to shows that were made for young kids, but considering that her last ""adult"" effort was on Akiba\'s Trip The Animation, serving as one of many ED songs, this OP song will not cut it for a lot of people. I find it musically pleasing, but the lyrics are a whole other story of sounding just weird and bad. The better part comes with the ED song sung by Konoha\'s VA Aoi Koga, with lyrics done by J-Pop artist KOTOKO and composed by Shinji Orito, who is the music composer of Key\'s VN anime adaptations of Air, Kanon (2006) and Little Busters!, to name a few, along with the ED visuals of pixel art, which are great to see.If there are high points I can say about this show, it\'s of Aoi Koga delivering her performance as Konoha Akisato, sounding just like the 19-year-old version of herself who carries the entire show with ease, as well as the ED song growing more on me as time passes. Otherwise, I\'m just kind of disappointed in the reception that this show got for trying to be something different from what was already established a.k.a the manga. This, to me, is intentional creativity as the creators and the staff wanted it to be, and I think this succeeded in its delivery.Otaku lovers, you ought NOT to miss out on 16bit Sensation: Another Layer.

You\'re missing out on a real historian\'s gem, which has been lathed on Another Layer.', 'What even is the anime industry in 2023? I would say it\'s like a cocktail with a bunch of mystery flavors. You won\'t know how it tastes until you try it.On the one hand, we have a variety of anime about time travel with virtually no originality and, on the other hand, we have hen- *cough*, please excuse my language. Now imagine combining those two aforementioned\xa0""flavors,"" adding a bit of gaming passion fruit and diluting the mix with some crushed ice to avoid making it too strong. The extravagant, yet tasty, cocktail\xa0 you would end up with is 16-bit Sensation: Another Layer; a unique take...on the time travel trope that manages to keep its audience engaged with its top-tier voice acting and simple but effective storyline. Let\'s savor the taste together, shall we?As mentioned above the story is pretty straightforward: The protagonist, Konoha, is obsessed with bishoujo games and time travels to 90s Japan to make MORE. The only thing on her mind is gaming and cute anime girls, which officially dubs her as the most cultured anime character this year. Keep in mind that this love of bishoujo games isn\'t just some joke for her, it\'s her life.\xa0This kind of character motivation guides the plot and avoids overcomplications, resulting in a lot of funny moments. The humor works because Konoha\'s 3 total braincells along with her obnoxious personality, clash with a group of confused\xa0 underpaid ""adults"" that have no idea what a present day otaku is capable of. Good comedy is seriously scarce nowadays, so take advantage of it while you still can. 16-bit Sensation has definitely got it down in the funny department.On to the rest of our wonderful cast of\xa0 ""adults."" Their de-facto leader is Mamoru: another obsessive, stubborn and maybe-adult, who, like Konoha only has one thing on his mind; the PC98. The guy probably sleeps, eats and drinks thinking of PC98 world domination. To the point though, believe it or not, the chemistry between him and Konoha is one of the most wholesome elements of the show. Without diving into spoiler territory, try to imagine two characters who have decided to dedicate their whole life in only one thing, trying to have a deep and meaningful conversation. There is absolutely no way that could work. However, these two proved us wrong. Their conversation has got to be the most irrelevant and yet most emotional experience ever. The amount of passion they both have for their hobby explodes into vivid, motivational monologues about eroge. You read correctly. This anime makes you feel emotional watching two brainlets talking about eroge. If that\'s not incredible, I don\'t know what is.To dig into this a bit deeper, the fact that 16 bit sensation succeeds so well in conveying this passion and emotion is not only because of the character\'s personality, but mainly because of the voice acting. Now before you start angrily commenting about how annoying the protagonist is, hear me out. The VA for Konoha is also the one for Kaguya Shinomiya from Love is War. If you\'ve seen both shows or at least heard this voice actor before you would know what I\'m talking about. In short, she\'s excellent. All the emotional high notes were delivered with perfection and I\'m not even going to comment on how talented someone has to be to do Kaguya\'s quieter and imposing voice and turn it into Konoha\'s passionate squeaky monologues. The production team really most have put everything into hiring her and it paid off with interest.One more aspect of the plot that\'s worth exploring in more detail is the time travelling gimmick. Despite it being severely overdone, 16-bit Sensation manages to add some ""spice"" using it. In their world, you may only travel to specific dates in the past using the release dates of 90s games, which, in a sense, limits the protagonist\'s ability to have an impact in the world\'s timeline. This restriction in combination with Konoha\'s lack of a brain makes the time travelling tropes practically obsolete, since the future never changes significantly. By doing this the show, creates a balance to develop the characters and reinforces its comedic theme. Or at least that was the idea, until we start building towards the finale where the trope\'s impact makes its sudden appearance. This shift in tone in the later episodes in tandem with the shows overarching themes makes for a very surprising twist.TLDR; All in all 16-bit Sensation made me feel things I didn\'t expect, made me laugh more than it should have and overall blew my expectations out of the water. On the surface it might have a pretty shallow plot with not many complications, but that quickly changes as you watch more and get invested in the story. If you like a good comedy with a surprising twist, I highly recommend it. The protagonist\'s voice might be a turn off at first, but trust me, by episode 4 you\'ll have your mind changed.Thank you very much for reading! on the time travel trope that manages to keep its audience engaged with its top-tier voice acting and simple but effective storyline.

Good comedy is seriously scarce nowadays, so take advantage of it while you still can. 16-bit Sensation has definitely got it down in the funny department.On to the rest of our wonderful cast of\xa0 ""adults."" Their de-facto leader is Mamoru: another obsessive, stubborn and maybe-adult, who, like Konoha only has one thing on his mind; the PC98. The guy probably sleeps, eats and drinks thinking of PC98 world domination. To the point though, believe it or not, the chemistry between him and Konoha is one of the most wholesome elements of the show. Without diving into spoiler territory, try to imagine two characters who have decided to dedicate their whole life in only one thing, trying to have a deep and meaningful conversation. There is absolutely no way that could work. However, these two proved us wrong. Their conversation has got to be the most irrelevant and yet most emotional experience ever. The amount of passion they both have for their hobby explodes into vivid, motivational monologues about eroge. You read correctly. This anime makes you feel emotional watching two brainlets talking about eroge. If that\'s not incredible, I don\'t know what is.To dig into this a bit deeper, the fact that 16 bit sensation succeeds so well in conveying this passion and emotion is not only because of the character\'s personality, but mainly because of the voice acting. Now before you start angrily commenting about how annoying the protagonist is, hear me out. The VA for Konoha is also the one for Kaguya Shinomiya from Love is War. If you\'ve seen both shows or at least heard this voice actor before you would know what I\'m talking about. In short, she\'s excellent. All the emotional high notes were delivered with perfection and I\'m not even going to comment on how talented someone has to be to do Kaguya\'s quieter and imposing voice and turn it into Konoha\'s passionate squeaky monologues. The production team really most have put everything into hiring her and it paid off with interest.One more aspect of the plot that\'s worth exploring in more detail is the time travelling gimmick. Despite it being severely overdone, 16-bit Sensation manages to add some ""spice"" using it. In their world, you may only travel to specific dates in the past using the release dates of 90s games, which, in a sense, limits the protagonist\'s ability to have an impact in the world\'s timeline. This restriction in combination with Konoha\'s lack of a brain makes the time travelling tropes practically obsolete, since the future never changes significantly. By doing this the show, creates a balance to develop the characters and reinforces its comedic theme. Or at least that was the idea, until we start building towards the finale where the trope\'s impact makes its sudden appearance. This shift in tone in the later episodes in tandem with the shows overarching themes makes for a very surprising twist.TLDR; All in all 16-bit Sensation made me feel things I didn\'t expect, made me laugh more than it should have and overall blew my expectations out of the water. On the surface it might have a pretty shallow plot with not many complications, but that quickly changes as you watch more and get invested in the story. If you like a good comedy with a surprising twist, I highly recommend it. The protagonist\'s voice might be a turn off at first, but trust me, by episode 4 you\'ll have your mind changed.Thank you very much for reading!', '""16bit Sensation"" Is a great anime, that is only held down by the ending.What I am trying to get at is that the last 3 episodes are noticeably worse writing and quality wise then the rest of the series, mainly because it feels like the writers didn\'t have enough episodes to put in all the content they wanted to put in this anime and were forced to cut content, or were rushed to complete the last few episodes because of time constraints.Either way it feels like the quality dropped throughout the twelve episode run, since the art gets to points where it is noticeably worse...for some scenes, and some scenes seem cut short a bit.But this is FAR from being bad at all, it\'s characters are well constructed and are not made to be stupid or dense. Konoha is probably the most annoying character by far, but it\'s their character so it\'s intended. The story is a bit crazy, but it is something that you can vibe with, even if it sometimes doesn\'t make sense all the time.Overall though it is a good anime.Watch it if you don\'t mind a decrease in quality over 12 episodes.🗿 7/10 🗿 for some scenes, and some scenes seem cut short a bit.But this is FAR from being bad at all, it\'s characters are well constructed and are not made to be stupid or dense.

If you want a variation of Shirobako — look elsewhere. This is an uninspired ""teen girl does time travel"" anime that uses old tech as a cheap nostalgia bait. The deepest it gets into the actual creative process involved in VN creation is within the first few episodes where the main character Konoha first teleports into the past and finds out that in the 90s you had to use your mouse to draw on PC (the horror!).The problem is that creative team behind this production is as knowledgeable about...VN/old tech/overall 90s topics as their main character. So they just throw a few old VN names (that they have rights to) in your face and maybe dangle a floppy or two over you... but some retro PC visuals and a running gag about a character who is just so in love with outdated NEC PC is all you\'re gonna get, because the anime doesn\'t actually care about all that stuff.In retrospect after watching it in full, I\'m not sure what it cares about at all?It\'s not about Visual Novel creation.We are told the main character Konoha hates her job in the industry in 2020s (because she\'s a newbie and noone will listen to her 1000 page long script about ""half-angel half-whatever Mary Sue saving the postapocalyptic fantasy sci-fi time travel girls und panzer meets makoto shinkai world"" that she\'s certain would be a mega hit unlike those pesky boring whatever-it-is-they-do-nowadays).Okay, she\'s 19 and has an entry level job, she doesn\'t understand her beloved industry yet, maybe once she gets transported to the past we\'ll get to learn about VN creation together with her? (No, we will not).In the past, even when she gets actively involved in the process of making VN (and not running completely unrelated errands like she does most of the time), the process itself is basically skipped over. Anime just says ""and then the creative process ensued, and the artists artisted, and the scenarists said ""it\'s scenariing time"" and scenariod all over the place, and 5 seconds later our new game of the century was ready, yay!""It\'s not about genuine love for old tech or any other 90s things.Time travel scenarios implemented within the real world are great for showcasing old-timey stuff the author genuinely cares about and speculating about humanity\'s possible future. In theory... Thinking about this makes me remember the episode in Shirobako where they scheduled a field day to learn more about what\'s gonna be in their new anime. 16bit Sensation\'s ""field day"" was opening a Wikipedia page about the 90s in Japan and promptly forgetting half of what they just read.Noone looks or talks like they belong in the 90s, the tech they use is anachronic (either already too old to be useful by the time events happen, or probably shouldn\'t exist for another decade), the business side of things is... Let\'s not even go there. Everything is either a blatant plot device, or only exists because it showed up on the first page of pictures when the production team googled ""90s Japan"". Same goes for the faceless future. Noone cared what it looks like because it only exists for the main character to undo it anyway.Funnily enough, I don\'t feel like it\'s passionate about time travel either.Sure, it\'s the premise of the whole thing, but the level of detail and thought put into the inner workings of it is negligible. It\'s a time travel show because Stein\'s Gate was a widely popular time travel show. And people nowadays love time travel, right? Fairly close to isekai too, and people are into isekai, right?The time travel is the whole plot, and it\'s honestly such a mess. It jumps all over the place constantly. Half of the time it forgets where it started and why it went there in the first place, then there\'s also /checks notes/ aliens, I guess? Honestly, it reads as if their main character wrote this whole thing.And, of course, it\'s not about the interpersonal relationships between main characters.Or, even if it is, it does a terrible job at that as well. Everyone loves our quirky main character because she\'s so cute and quirky, (and because people in the past are just so much kinder and better than in our pesky reality). Sure, they grow in a literal sense, since the anime takes place in the span of ~30 years, but none of them really grow and change as people. But I guess there\'s not much place to grow from when you only exist to support the main character, fix her mistakes, pat her head and tell her how cool and special she is and how much you missed her.As a fan of all things VN I desperately wanted to like this and find something good in it, but it was just a bland and uninspired waste of time.

It's like an unspecified rule that doesn't get talked about in terms of a checklist for a show to draw the attention of a viewer. If you tick most of those boxes, then the show will be a hit for you. Which this show has done in more ways than one, and it's going to be such a nice bright spark, for this season of anime. Let me explain.Story/characters: 8The story follows Konoha, in her 'dream' job. Or least, it can seem a bit of a nightmare...for her, but she'll keep trying! Oh she'll keep trying. It's one thing that really drives this anime forward. Konoha's whole personality really makes the anime shine. Her character really adds so much, and brings out the shine in other characters as a result. Which will seemingly only make things way better for those around her as time rolls on.

You only need to watch the first few moments, to really zone in the feel of the show they give off. Really capturing the atmosphere, and really fitting into the themes of the show perfectly. It really does feel at times that you really did go back in time, to see how things looked back in the day, to come across how it all was back in the day, to how it transitions into now times. It's quite clear of this, when you see how the old office looked, compared to how our MC's room looks back in the present. Not to mention being backed up  by such a cool and creative OP and ED.

A good watch for sure."", 'As someone who started watching anime in the early 2010s, this anime felt like a blast to the past and really reminded me of why I love anime and moe culture so much.This anime is a love-letter to bishoujo visual novels. If you love visual novels, bishoujo anime characters and art, anime otaku culture, and maybe some old school tech stuff (?), this show is pure nostalgia and fanservice. From what I\'ve seen, it seems that the game development setting is not the main focus and is more a means to give the viewer insights into the creation of visual novels - the main focus...being bishoujo game history and culture. This series is one big appreciation post, both this and the manga source material, like a time capsule capturing the early era and evolution of of otaku culture, even inserting real-life anime and visual novel references wholesale and unedited.Contrary to what the MAL page might imply, this show is an anime-original sequel or side story of the 16bit Sensation manga. (I have not read much of the manga so I cannot comment too in-depth on this though)The manga takes place in the 90s, following a PC shop sales assistant who knows nothing about bishoujo games. She discovers and is roped into making bishoujo games as a character artist in the early years of the industry. It explores the early era of bishoujo games through a non-otaku\'s journey in 1992.The anime on the other hand takes place in 2023, following a modern day bishoujo game fanatic. Stuck in an unsatisfying routine job and unable to make the bishoujo visual novel of her dreams, she makes a wish and is shot into the past, where experiences the early days of the medium she loves so dearly first-hand. It explores the early era of bishoujo games, through the eyes of a bishoujo otaku living in 2023, via time travel back to 1992.As such, the protagonists from both the manga and anime discover and experience the early days of bishoujo games, but from different starting points.The manga has a linear progression through time beginning with 1992, while in the anime the protagonist makes time travelling jumps from year to year against this same linear timeline. Literally ""Another Layer"" layered above the existing story, as the title says. This is a genius meta set-up and creative decision made to cover the series\' information-heavy topics in a way that is friendlier and more familiar to the average modern day anime viewer when compared to the manga. (In the manga, there is so much text outside of panels that it feels like you are reading a comic-textbook about visual novel history rather than a manga) By having the story take place from a 2023-girl\'s POV instead of 1992-girl\'s POV, the average modern day viewer can be taken through the protagonist\'s jouney of exploration in a more relatable way, and the stark differences of the older era can be explained organically by the other characters. In this manner, the anime is able to very effectively show and contrast the present culture and what we have now against the surprisingly distant, different past - showing how far we have come and how different things are now - the things we have gained and the things lost to time that most of us will likely never experience or ever even hear about.The main character is annoying and has an annoying high-pitched voice. The art style seems a little dated and slightly mediocre. However, this might just be my nostalgia speaking, but when keeping the subject matter in mind, Konoha is really the most exaggerated and exemplified vessel of a bishoujo otaku, with her otaku quirks cranked up to the maximum. The way she behaves is also reminiscent of how a specific archetype, common in visual novels or 2000-2010s animes, talks and behaves. Konoha is just that passionate annoying but lovable idiot archetype, with an unadulterated full-force passion and full-force annoyingness. This in-your-face annoyingness isn\'t as common now in modern mainstream anime, and it also feels especially annoying and out of place here because of how realistic the setting is. But I believe this is done purposefully because that personality itself is sort of a symbol of the very moe culture which this anime wishes to embrace, and is thus extremely thematically fitting (in addition to her optimism being narratively fitting to the plot). The same goes for the art style. It feels just the right amount of dated to really feel like maybe a 2010s anime, yet not look too shabby. Everything plays in to the nostalgia aspect. All things said and done, the more episodes I watched, the more I found myself deeply appreciating the annoying MC and the dated art style because it reminds me so much of the anime I watched in my own early anime watching days.Enough pretentiousness from me. Getting down to the story itself, I don\'t really have much of value to say. The story is lighthearted and uplifting, and the storyline so far is typical time travel stuff which is entertaining to follow along. The side characters aren\'t memorable, but the dynamic between the main pair is very wholesome. It\'s too early in the anime for me to say much more though. I do feel the biggest appeal of the anime is its heavy appreciation of bishoujo culture rather than the story itself.The OP sequence is very cool, while the ED song is a beautiful nostalgic callback to the style of OP songs for some of the most well-known classic bishoujo visual novels. The fact that the ED was composed by Shinji Orito, a founding member and composer of Key Visual Arts, probably explains why.I don\'t like to give airing shows a rating, so this is a provisional one. being bishoujo game history and culture.

The creatives behind it don\'t seem to understand the draw of the original work, and as such replaced it with an original plot that\'s a giant mess. The story meanders, drops the ball on both the source\'s and its own themes, and they jammed in one of the least likeable and least well written original main characters I\'ve seen in a long while. The most frustrating thing is that this comes at the cost of a fairly interesting manga this anime is ""based"" on. This show really should not have been...made.-------------------------------------The title of the show is actually fairly smart on reflection, albeit deceptive. You can quite easily infer that ""16-bit sensation"" is something about a by-gone era when computers still operate on that structure, possibly some sort of nostalgia trip concerning it. Thus ""16-bit sensation -another layer"" would be a story on top of it, similar to how graphic artists would employ multiple layers to their work; this is pretty relevant because the main characters of both the anime and the manga are both graphic artists working on bishoujo games in their respective eras. If this was all the information you got, one could almost imagine there was some parallel or comparison we could make between the two works. It\'s unfortunate then that the show is instead a badly photoshopped mess that barely draws on what was good about the manga.It\'s actually fairly clear the show doesn\'t recognize what the draw of the original work was: nostalgia for Akihabara as a hub for otaku and technological activity going back to the 80s, and the boom for lewd computer games that came along side it. The original manga puts that nostalgia under a fictional lens and follows a young college student in her somewhat strange journey to becoming a graphic artist for one tiny company trying to etch out their place in this lewd game wild west. She and the colorful cast of characters within the company each put forth their own feelings and views on what\'s happening and the games they like, which serve as the author\'s way in providing a rounded perspective of those times.The anime completely ditches this for a haphazardly written time-traveling shlock that puts bishoujo games on a pedestal; it\'s so important it makes interdimensional beings come to Earth to understand its power. The original cast are now side characters with their views and perspectives omitted, simplified, or hijacked by the newly inserted main character. The nostalgia trip elements of the story are similarly omitted or breezed over because the new sci-fi plot takes so long to work out that you don\'t really get to dwell on it. They basically took apart the original story and jammed it around this non-sensical plot that doesn\'t even have a sensible set of rules for its time-travel. They rewrote the plot and made it the worst of both worlds.It\'s equally frustrating that they pushed what is a fairly nice cast of characters into the background just so they can introduce the show\'s main character, a down-in-luck graphic artist for a dead end bishoujo game company ""just chasing the trends"". She is impulsive, loud, self-serving, and prideful; in a different context or time she might have been an attractive main character, but in this work she just comes off as as dumb, selfish person who has things go her way because the story requires it. It\'s actually quite disgusting that they removed character development in other characters just so this new main character can replace them, in the exact same way things panned out.The expansion in a certain character\'s role is also quite revealing; they needed a male character to serve as the foil and love interest for the new main character, and to basically cover the elements of the story that wouldn\'t proceed because the main character is so dumb she wouldn\'t have been able to process it. They turned this characters love for PC-98 computers into an obsession that doesn\'t make sense even in the worst of shlocks because there was no other way to proceed in this mess of a story, and in the end pushed him into a love interest hole as if there was any actually development in that front.Even if we ignored the original manga and looked at the show independently, it\'s still a poorly written product. In turning it into a time-traveling story where the actions of the main character change the future, it doesn\'t just take focus away from Akiba and the nostalgia around it, but from its main subject of bishoujo games. This sci-fi plot is actually so intrusive it pushes all its original themes out, so halfway through the show you\'re wondering what exactly you\'re watching this for. We\'re also presented with future versions of the original cast, but they hardly do anything and serve only as cameos as if anyone watching the show would have enough attachment to them to feel anything.This all combines to make what is possibly one of the most aggravating shows in recent times, and I really hope whoever made it don\'t work on anything within the industry anymore. This is actually shit. made.-------------------------------------The title of the show is actually fairly smart on reflection, albeit deceptive.

This is actually shit.', 'I gave it a 10/10, but for most people it won\'t be a 10/10. I had a subjective reason to give it a 10/10, and that reason is that this anime strongly resonated with my passionate love for the culture of Akihabara. I\'ve only been to Akihabara once in my life, but what\'s more important is that feeling of fascination and wonder about the unopened box of all the anime goods and shows out there that I haven\'t yet experienced. This feeling is what I call my ""love for the culture of Akihabara."" Unfortunately, this feeling has died over the years as the global culture...has changed. After more than a decade, the anime industry hasn\'t prospered and I would argue that it is stagnating and/or declining. (I have no statistics to back this argument; my only source is my observation of the content that the industry since created). The box has been opened and everyone knows what was inside it and only tries to create something similar to what was originally inside the box. This show is no different. It credits its imaginative sources to past works such as Steins; Gate. But the one thing this show did innovatively is the main character\'s love for Akihabara. To me - just to me - the show felt like a eulogy to the good times past. That\'s the one thing I really appreciate and love about this show, and the show itself was also very entertaining to me.Now I will talk about the facts. The art and animation is rendered in a way that it doesn\'t feel like it was done by a horrible studio; it\'s totally watchable. The ED is a ""soft banger"" only if you watched the show and had something inside you resonate with it. The ED makes me feel nostalgic about the past which is what it should do considering the contents of the show.

The first half is an elegy for the bygone golden age of galgames, while the latter half is a paean to human imagination and passion. If the creators chose to focus and deep dive on either one, this anime would likely have been a better show.For galgame enthusiasts, ep.1 is a nostalgic trip down memory lane, featuring names from the heyday of galgames: _Dokyusei_ (Elf), _Shizuku_ (Leaf), _Kanon_ (Key), _Rance_ (AliceSoft)...Aaaaaand the ending theme was composed by Shinji Orito from Key, with Lyrics by Kotoko (a pity that it wasn't sung by her!). As the main character, Akisato Konoha, time-traveled to...the past, the audience got a glimpse of how the galgame industry progressed. Even younger viewers would find this part quite fascinating (at least I did!): How illustrations were done with a scanner and mouse in the era before Photoshop and tablets? How to achieve rich shading and texture with very limited color palettes through dithering? How did game developers react when transitioning from PC-98 to Windows? It reminded me of _Shirobako_(2014), which similarly depicited tons of domain knowledge about anime production.Unfortunately, portrayal of galgame industry remained on surface-level and of very small scope. The first half of the show focused extensively on Konoha's soliloquy and interpersonal relationships, which became quite repetitive. The latter part, starting from ep.7, obviously attempted to explore the possibilities of the time-travel premise. While the efforts were commendable, the story was quite messy with too many questions left unanswered. For this reason, two parts of anime felt disconnected, despite all the foreshadowings the creators tried to put in.Imagine you work in a declining industry that you are very passionate about, and you had the chance to go back to its golden age - what would you do? Create your own project? Transform a company? Or change nothing and simply enjoy the industry's prosperity as an observer? I believe all these angles could have led to interesting and plausible stories. The key is to make one choice, and tell the one stories with all seriousness.The anime has other shortcomings as well. Konoha wasn't an adorable character to begin with - she was really loud and had a sharp voice which I couldn't bear with. Her behavior was so unpolished, which didn't align with a 19 y/o character with work experience. Starting from ep.4, the animation quality began to falter, sometimes resulting in weird distortion. And of course, the most severe issue is the plot as I mentioned above. Overall, I felt the anime squandered an excellent opportunity to build a story around galgame industry. the past, the audience got a glimpse of how the galgame industry progressed.

One of the reasons is the fact that it was among two highly awaited shows in Fall 2023: Sousou no Frieren and Kusuriya no Hitorigoto. Also, the manga wasn't famous enough to bring some mainstream hype. Which is a shame, since this series was one of my favorites from the season with all its good points and flaws.16bit tells the story of Akisato Konoha, a 19 year old illustrator who works at Blue Bell - a game company that focus only on the trends of the market....Such thing brings Konoha a feeling of disappointment towards the industry. After the end of her working hour, she finds a game story on her way home; there, the young illustrator finds classic visual novels from the 90s and 00s such as Kanon by Key. While checking the works available in the store, she is suddenly sent to 1992 (21 years in the past). There, Konoha finds a visual novel company called Alcohol Soft – composed by members such as the programmer Rokuta Mamoru and the illustrators Shimoda Kaori and Uehara Meiko. Konoha works hard to show her drawing skills with the 16 colors available in that time and to be part of Alcohol Soft's crew.Little by little, she learns about their interests in common and blend in with the community, making a friendship with Yamada Touya, a girl who shares the love for moe and bishoujo with Konoha.This anime pays its good portion of homages to the visual novel industry, with references to works such as Sakura no Uta, Fate Series and many other milestones of the bishoujo and action genre. It's interesting how it all feels natural, partially due to its main location: the 90s Akihabara, with all its otaku culture in peak. The series also shows how the japanese market changed through time, and how the bisoujo genre lost its spotlight.16bit is a love letter for the visual novel industry. Even though it goes a little off rails in the second half, it never ceases to be interesting and enjoyable. The plot keeps going, with a charismatic cast and a passion for the media it is inspired on. It might be rushed sometimes but it tackles its themes well. Visually, the series makes use of bright colors and vintage filters, the main female characters are fitting to the bishoujo concept. The sound consists of songs with a happy atmosphere, with a special mention to the opening. The BGM's take inspiration in novel soundtracks, with a high similarity.All in all, 16bit is a show that is worth watching. Especially if the novels theme is part of the reader's interest. It's one of the few works that represent and pay an homage to the industry, which has lost some of the influence it had but never ceased to show its true magic to the ones who love the media.

I actually was really invested in this anime at first since despite the time travel gig, this was seemingly a chill show about developing video games. However, as the season went on, the story spiraled so out of control that it eventually lost me. Although the aspect of time travel was still part of this show, it played a semi-important role in...the story since whenever Konoha travels back to the past, the show primarily focuses on the events happening at that time, with the small sci-fi elements of Konoha’s time jumping being secondary to the actual development of the games they’re making. Despite this, around halfway through the show, the story starts introducing stuff like AI, espionage, and some other thriller-esque elements, and at that point, I had completely no idea what I was watching. The anime eventually circles back to the central ideas of this series in the finale and we get some great character moments from Konoha and one of the biggest side characters in the series, Mamoru. I like the dynamic between these two and I like how their relationship progresses throughout the season. Again, I’m a bit polarized by 16bit Sensation: Another Layer since there are a lot of interesting ideas in this show, and I do like the backdrop of Akihabara throughout the years as things change whenever Konoha time travels, as well as the focus on the cultural impact on video games. However, the second half could have been a little bit more concise and focused since there was so much going on it was hard for me to stay invested in the anime, but the show does have a conclusion that at least left me satisfied. the story since whenever Konoha travels back to the past, the show primarily focuses on the events happening at that time, with the small sci-fi elements of Konoha’s time jumping being secondary to the actual development of the games they’re making.

It’s got one of the most loveable MCs of the year, an interesting time travel mechanic, cool historical lessons about game development and is an all around fun time. One of the most underrated shows of the year.We often hear people talk about video games being creatively bankrupt and not innovating these days. Some of that is exaggerated, but there’s also a little bit of truth in that. Companies prioritising profits over creativity and being afraid to try new things. Instead opting for more generic and...safe options. 16 bit sensation explores the gradual decline of the visual novel industry and Akihabara in general.What really stood out to me about this show from the first episode was the amount of real life references in this one. In just the first episode, we see Madoka Magica, Lycoreco, SAO, Fate Grand Order and many other Aniplex titles. At some points it feels like a glorified ad, but at the same time, it enhanced my immersion because this world feels plausible. When we see Konoha going to work her dead end game developing job, where she’s not allowed to innovate or really push herself because the company just wants a cookie cutter eroge… it feels real.The other thing that stood out as unique to me is the time travel mechanic. James Cameron’s terminator is hailed as one of the best examples of time travel of all time, and I love seeing shows like this follow in its footsteps. Time is not linear, changing the past doesn’t just change the past, but also the future. Throughout the show, after time travelling to the past, Konoha realises that what she does in the past also affects her current reality and having to balance her role as an employee at alcosoft back in the day, with not wanting to damage the future made for some cool tension and stakes. The way in which she time travels is also somewhat uniqueOf course, as I said earlier on this does feel like it was made as a love letter to otaku culture as a whole. There’s so many references and otaku cultural tidbits throughout the show. From talking about real cult classic visual novels and games, to real events to understanding the thought process behind bishoujo games. While otaku culture is arguably doing better than ever irl thanks to the mainstream nature of anime these days, it is true that Akihabara has been declining since the 90s and is mainly a tourist trap these days. So seeing a show cover something that’s actually going on right now was interesting. Of course it’s done in an over the top anime-y way, but you can genuinely learn quite a bit from this show.I for one had no idea about the complexities of Visual Novel production. I came out of this series with a newfound appreciation and respect for everyone involved in that process. From writing scripts, to recording character’s lines, to hand drawing every CG, these games are really works of pure passion and I think the series does a great job of capturing that. This whole subculture would not be possible without people like Konoha who want to help people express themselves through art. A lesson modern developers could stand to learn.Interesting premise aside, the show also looks amazing. It has a nostalgic sort of art style and character design to it. Konoha, voiced by Koga Aoi is without a doubt one of the cutest girls this year, and a very fun main character. The side characters are awesome as well, bringing a lot of funny moments and personality to the creative process and story as a whole.The only negative I’d have about the series as a whole, is they introduced kind of a weird plot point at the end with AI that I thought was a little shoehorned. But other than that, the series is a fun ride and one of the more underrated shows of the year. I’d actually put it in the top 10.

Her foil and co-conspirator, Mamoru, who initially dislikes Konoha, slowly comes around over the course of the series because of his own passion for the long-since-discontinued PC-98.With colorful and frankly beautiful character animation (Konoha’s faces alone are worth the price of admission) the story leans into what anime does best: be crazy and over-the-top.As...the series proceeds, interspersed with interesting lessons in how games were made a quarter century ago, there’s time travel, aliens, and corporate conspiracies.Does it all work? Absolutely not!But that’s a big part of its great charm! The people behind 16bit Sensation seem to really love the whole idea of creativity, in particular as it relates to games, but more than that, as the off-the-wall alien episode illustrates.Konoha and Mamoru bond over the course of the series less out of any romantic feelings (though I can’t rule out that’s implied, too) than over the fact that both feel so ardent about their respective interests - and the fact that they share the desire that others learn to love the things they feel passionate about, as well.While the show’s reach sometimes exceeds its grasp, I personally feel it’s just a pure joy when anime cranks out a show like this. One that may be a bit short on commercial appeal, but is just filled to the brim with the kind of over-the-top nuttiness and enthusiasm that makes wading through a thousand isekais worth it. the series proceeds, interspersed with interesting lessons in how games were made a quarter century ago, there’s time travel, aliens, and corporate conspiracies.Does it all work?

In the middle of it all, suddenly you get aliens and the whole thing starts becoming fully anime original and pretty batshit crazy without much of a satisfying resolution.Still, despite this, I still enjoyed the show quite a lot. I enjoy VNs a lot and have fond memories of Akiba from the past, and seeing that kind of passion translate so...well is heartwarming in a sense, with some shade thrown around low effort AI art to boot, always a way to my heart. Mamoru-kun's infatuation with PC98 is hilarious and yet so empathetic at the same time. As someone with a niche and dying hobby (i.e. real VNs that aren't gated by gachashit mechanics), I can relate to his plight and obsession.And it is a very bittersweet show when you think about it. We've seen quite a few nostalgic otaku-oriented shows this year, and I think 16bit hits the nail on the head when it comes to capturing that bittersweet feeling of a time long gone. Dejiko is no longer there welcoming people into Akiba, and the streets are all almost completely plastered with exploitative shallow gacha games with stories that have no end to them, an insult to the bishoujo-ge that inspired them in the first place.We may never see a return to the era so cherished by Konoha, the economics and competition no longer make producing them on a scale circa the 90s and 00s any viable, but perhaps the real desire to create something truly remarkable is inside yourself, and that other people out there, wherever they are, alien or not, are still also passionate fans of bishoujo-ge too, and maybe someone somewhere will make another bishoujo-ge that will capture our hearts once more. well is heartwarming in a sense, with some shade thrown around low effort AI art to boot, always a way to my heart.

And the pitch stays nearly the same throughout...Point being she's mildly annoying to listen to and her dialogue is not great. You want to cheer her on and see her develop, but she seemingly doesn't learn anything and stays mildly self-centered albeit chipper and somewhat positive. Maybe if she'd lost an arm or a leg she'd be entitled to complain so much and frankly it'd make for a more endearing character (an illustrator missing an arm? Now there's a character idea..!).16bit Sensation is one of those shows that could've been something special, but along the way someone stopped herding the cats/creatives and production just kind of gave up on delivering a cohesive story, which is probably why it's an odd 13 episodes and why the show sometimes feels a little rushed.Turns out the real message of the show is that sometimes projects don't pan out, no matter how much passion you have for it. Maybe that was the intention all along.Unless you want a bit of reminiscing and an expect-nothing experience just to see some fun ideas being bandied about, maybe give this a miss and spend your time more wisely.

You have been warned.Based upon a popular manga of the same name 16 Bit Sensation Another Layer is a comedy and supernatural genre anime that gives us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a young girl long devoted to pursuing her interest in playing ancient Bishoujo games and designing and creating characters for said games was to be given a...unique opportunity. An opportunity of a lifetime one could say for which she would be able to go back to the heydays of her treasured Bishoujo games in a Japan of the past and see with her own eyes how they were created from the very beginning.Just what would happen if our heroine were to take this opportunity and go back to a time where all she loved and admired about her games were still alive and kicking and start making her mark on history?But as they say the more ripples you create the bigger the potential storm. Just how big of a storm would this indulgence of hers cost her in the world around her?Taking its name from the 16-bit integers and memory addresses that formed the core of the much-vaunted PC-98 desktop computer to which our dear Mamoru was so in love with 16-bit sensation is a most unusual anime, to say the least. media, the series overall premise of a young adult being granted the chance to hop through time is not by itself an unusual one given its popularity within popular media what made it stand out in my eyes was its fusion with the dream of going back to the heyday of Bishoujo games and being able to see how artists, scriptwriters and programmers worked as they created the games that would to a generation of people provide the best entertainment and immersion that they had experienced to that point.As both a gamer who has an interest in how VN’s are created as well as being an avid fan of the visual novels that the Bishoujo genre of games symbolized this series was one that I felt resonated with me and was an easy pick to watch this season. And oh boy this one proved to be quite the ride.Konoha AkisatoKonoha Akisato is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the series’ main protagonist. A 19-year-old rookie illustrator who works for the Blue Bell game company in modern-day Japan Konoha from her initial appearances was shown to be a positive, cheerful, and spirited young woman who while young and relatively junior within her role was nonetheless a determined person and passionate about creating characters for games. However, despite possessing excellent skill at creating characters for the games that she is passionate about it can be seen that Konoha in the modern world was far from pleased with her role for despite working in a role that most girls her age would be proud off to Konoha this was anything but a job that she was content with for rather than creating cute girls for the Bishoujo games that she adored she was instead providing colour for the backs of male characters that anyone could do. But more than anything what frustrated Konoha the most was the fact that the Bishoujo games that she adored, and to which had inspired her to become an illustrator were no longer popular and in their place were mobile and Gatcha games that featured characters that were far from her cup of tea and were fast making her dream an impossible one. That is until one day Konoha were to have a fortunate encounter with a mysterious game shop whose games provided her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go back to her roots and see what it was involved in creating the very games that she adored by going back to their heyday.As the series progresses and Konoha gets the opportunity to hop through and explore different time periods, her personality gradually starts to change. While Konoha at the start of the series was shown to have great pride in her ability as an illustrator which served as her primary motivator in being able to fulfil her role this was offset by the fact that while she adored the older Bishoujo games that dominated her childhood she had little knowledge of what was actually involved in their creation. Despite this however thanks to both the opportunity to explore different timelines and being able to learn from veterans like Meiko and Kaori not only was this remedied but thanks to both their support and her own core personality traits of being hardworking and having a strong desire to improve herself Konoha was able to realize just how much was involved in the creation of the games that she adored. Though at first dismayed that her prized skill with drawing with the tablet was unusable in the various timelines that Konoha visited this act of starting again from scratch under the tutelage of her peers at Alcoholsoft I felt while having the effect of improving upon her knowledge of designing and bringing to life of characters using both software and techniques that she never would have been able to make use of in her own time also served as an excellent way for her to realize that the creation of characters is just one of many stages that were involved in the creation of Bishoujo games.This revelation, while shown well in the strong bonds that were forged between Konoha and Meiko and Kaori was perhaps shown best in the strong bonds that were forged between her and Mamoru. While their relationship had the most rocky of starts due to both their contrasting personalities and views on games this bond of theirs gradually served as the final piece of the puzzle for Konoha’s development as a character that allowed her to realize the true sense of joy that came from not just being able to create games that you were passionate about with peers that share your passion but also in the process being able to contribute in ensuring that it would survive in not only their hearts but the hearts of their fellow fans as well.Mamoru RokudaMamoru Rokuda is one of the main characters of the series and serves as both Konoha’s co-worker and eventual friend within the series. Initially serving within a small and little-known video game company named Alcoholsoft as its sole programmer Mamoru in his initial appearances was shown to be someone that while young being only 15 at this time was nonetheless someone that was intelligent, confident, and expressive to the point of being disrespectful to those that were his seniors. Despite his attitude problems and the unique bond that he shared with the company manager Mamoru was someone that was earnest, hardworking, and showed great pride towards both the field of programming and the programs that he makes for his peers which he views as being perfect. However, while his skills as a programmer were undeniable and were an asset to the team at Alcoholsoft his brooding and logical nature, tendency to do illogical things and his unusual fascination with the PC-98 computer were seen to create something of a barrier between him and his peers at Alcoholsoft.Mamoru’s life of acting as the company’s resident computer expert were to have a profound change one day when joining the company out of nowhere was a young girl who despite being clueless about game development nonetheless was one that while lacking in verifiable experience more than made up for it in her passion for drawing characters. Though the first encounters between Mamoru and Konoha were far from being a positive ones due to his personality, as the series progressed, and their bonds deepened this began to change. At the beginning of the series, unlike his peers at Alcoholsoft Mamoru did not have any interest in developing Bishoujo games and indeed was shown to only see them as a means for him to improve his skill with computers and programming. However, while the passion and dedication that he showed towards computers and to the PC-98 in particular created distances between himself and his peers as the series progressed this sense of passion was seen to become an important foundation for the company in the face of the many tech advances that we witnessed over the course of the time leaps. This sense of foundation however within the narrative was not limited to that of being the tech expert of the company though as in line with the time leaps Mamoru unlike Konoha was able to age and in being able to expand his life experience was able to realize not only how difficult management of a company was on the production side but also how much of a balancing act it was for the financial side as well.While Mamoru never saw himself as being the potential successor to the company the level of maturity that he gained from ageing allowed him to realize that for them to be successful as a brand they not only have to be cautious with their finances but also be able to work effectively as a team in order to get their games out. Whereas in the past Mamoru may had just done what was needed on the tech side of things I really liked seeing him get more involved in the company side of things by working with Kaori and the others as they learned to adapt to the new times and incorporate new tech and software into their arsenal. Though it was humorous to see him still try to create newer games on his prized PC-98s. While Mamoru never became as passionate about Bishoujo games as Konoha and the rest of Alcoholsoft did his experiences of working alongside them in the background as well as his unique encounter with Echo and his company I felt served to make him realize the kind of joy and satisfaction that can come from being able to work on something together and in releasing it contribute in keeping a genre alive. And while his dream of having his prized PC-98s conquer the world never came close to fruition this new understanding of his while serving to make him a more effective member of the company also served to make him an excellent partner for Konoha throughout the narrative as he possessed both skill with tech and the logical mind that can make sense of Konoha’s circumstance that I would daresay confuse the hell out of anyone else if they were to listen to her.As a character, I felt that Mamoru was both well-designed and developed which served as a nice contrast to Konoha throughout the narrative. While their initial personality, base traits, and beliefs on the topic of Bishoujo games were polar opposites in all regards the successive time leaps while serving an admirable job of advancing the story also served well to establish Mamoru as both an anchor for Konoha as well as that of a foundation to which she can stand upon while getting her bearings in the turbulent world of time leaping. This sense of leap-based development within the narrative I felt synergized well with the strong character chemistry that was established between Mamoru and Konoha throughout the narrative that allowed Mamoru to act as an effective anchor for Konoha where his sense of logic, intelligence, skill with tech and ability to adapt on the fly served as an effective contrast to Konoha’s tendency to get confused and do things without thinking of either alternatives or take advantage of assets that were around her a fact that Konoha was seen to be eternally thankful for within the narrative.KaoriKaori Shimoda is one of the main characters of the series and serves as one of Mamoru and Konoha’s peers within Alcoholsoft. In her initial appearances, Kaori was shown to be a kind, caring and polite person who was friendly and supportive to all she met and indeed behaved in a manner that was benefiting of both an elder sister and a sempai for Konoha within the company. While nominally a member of the company’s art department where she created the CG art alongside that of her best friend Meiko, she was also trusted by management to act in the capacity of a second in command when needed to which her confident nature, intelligence, and levelheadedness and more importantly ability to think things through from the POV of the staff really enabled her to shine. While her skill as an artist as well as that of a leader within the company was undeniable what served to make Kaori such an effective member of the company was not only her skill at management and directing staff towards working towards the bigger picture but also in recognizing that as a company they must be able to continuously evolve in line with the tech advances made in both software and hardware or risk being left behind a sense of forward thinking that I believe would be invaluable to the company.However, the most crucial contribution that Kaori made to the narrative in my eyes was her education of Konoha where in conjunction with Meiko she served to provide her with not only an effective foundation by teaching her how to make use of software and techniques that were native to Kaori’s own time period but in doing so enhance Konoha’s own desire to not only learn more about how games were created but also make her realize that despite the ease that tech can bring when brought into games development overreliance of this would only serve to take away the precious moments that comes from being able to create games with like-minded peers. For without the laughter that comes from creating characters and working so hard to meet deadlines that you are downing energy drinks constantly and sleeping in the office then the creation of games may as well just be a hollow exercise that can be done with AI. Kaori’s efforts in making Konoha realize the importance of these precious memories contributed well in her crusade to make Bishoujo game development fun and relevant again.AmvAnimation wise I felt that the series overall animation was really well done that in conjunction with the time leaps that were prevalent within the narrative allowed us to see not only what Japan looked like back then but also the kind of tech that was used back in the heyday of Bishoujo games. Being able to see how characters were created back then using first gen computers and graphics software and seeing how these changed as a result of both new software and hardware as well as that of AI really was an insightful experience. In terms of character design while the standard designs for the cast did an excellent job of showcasing the cast the time leaps served to further enhance this by not only showing how the existing cast matured physically in the case of Mamoru and Touya but also reflecting how the company changed over the years via the inclusion of new staff members with the best examples of this being the twins of Mari and Senri that brought not only new skillsets to the company but a new sense of atmosphere to the company via their personality as well. Though only used in one arc within the series one of the standout animation moments within the series was the Echo arc that featured a surprisingly good pairing of science fiction and comedy that while giving Mamoru his own doze of what Konoha experiences regularly also created one of the most beautiful scenes I had seen in this anime in the form of the departure of Echo from this realm.Music wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme in the form of 65535 that was performed by Shoko Nakagawa and Link~past and Future ~ that was performed by Konoha’s assigned seiyuu Aoi Koga. Both of these songs while very catchy and positive were ones that I felt conveyed a very different sense of emotions and feelings when used in conjunction with their visuals with the former conveying senses of nostalgia, frustration, new beginnings in a foreign time period and a desire to relive the glory days of the past and in doing so learn of not just how much is involved in creating the games but also how fun it was to build things you are passionate for alongside peers that share your passion. This opening theme as a final gift to its fans also featured a nice image of the core cast members drawn in a 16-bit style that was a perfect way to end the opening song with.The series ending theme Link~past and Future~ while serving well to provide us with some nice eye candy in the form of the female cast members in swimsuits had among its main theme the sense of nostalgia that was achieved through the visualization of both the computers that were the mainstays of Bishoujo games development back in the heyday as well as the floppy disks that allowed game companies to store their finished products on a sight that many a game studios production staff would have celebrated on reaching with high fives and tears in their eyes as a result of all their hard work that led to that point. Like the series opening theme the ending theme also featured a great homage to the era of gaming that serves as the main background for this series in the form of a next episode preview screen that takes the form of a PC menu screen drawn to represent the 16-bit computers that the cast made use of back then to create their games.Voice acting-wise wise I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or supporting characters. In particular I felt that Aoi Koga and Atsushi Abe deserve special praise for I felt that they did an excellent job portraying their assigned characters of Konoha and Mamoru respectively. While unfortunately used sparingly from the midpoint of the narrative onwards I nonetheless really enjoyed the portrayals of Kaori and Meiko by their respective seiyuu’s in the form of Ayako Kawasumi and Yui Horie respectively. Given their respective real-world ages both would have had opportunities to experience the golden age of Bishoujo games as part of their childhood and as such were excellent assets to bring into the series where their experience would had been useful to the writers and to Aoi Koga in helping the latter better prepare herself for this role. While used as mostly a support character I felt that Aya Yamane’s portrayal of the character of Touya Yamada was an excellent one that showcased well not just Touya’s development as a person both personally and professionally as she went from being a fan of Bishoujo games to that of a creator that made them.Overall conclusionIn overall 16 Bit Sensation Another layer I felt was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points its unique premise, strong and original narrative, well-designed and developed characters, excellent voice acting and its unique insight into not only the golden age of Bishoujo games but also the many kinds of roles that unknowingly are involved in the creation of such games that would no doubt surprise a great many people.While the series main subject matter admittedly would not be familiar to people that were either born after the golden age of Bishoujo games or had never actually played a Visual novel before for those who have such as myself the series insight into what goes on in the creation of such games was truly fascinating. On the surface when one were to look at VN’s which are by far the most common games that belong to that genre one wouldn’t think that they would need much in terms of either staff or specialist software and hardware given that the games in question were simple games that didn’t feature the kind of advanced graphics and deep immersive storytelling that modern games feature. But just because VN’s didn’t feature them doesn’t mean that it didn’t need skilled staff and software and hardware that was unique to them and in this I felt that the series served to provide us with a unique opportunity to see the kind of hard work that the artists and programmers put in behind the scenes with its fusion of time travel serving to further expand upon this by allowing us to see the kind of software, hardware and drawing techniques that were used in the years that made up the golden age of Bishoujo games and I have to say some of them truly were strange with the best example of this one being cling wrap scanning.While the drawing side of the process I felt was explained in great detail as was the look into both the kind of pressures that artists could be under when creating the games and the need to switch roles on the fly to ensure that the tasks are completed on time the series likewise did well to expand upon the often overlooked and unknown programming side of the process as well which I really appreciated. For even if the characters and art for a game were perfect if the backend that runs it in the form of the programming is not up to scratch and ends up causing individual scenes to freeze and crash the game then that would be a stain on the devs honour as creators and in the game industry and especially for smaller companies like Alcoholsoft reputation is everything and within the series was best exemplified by the importance that they placed on Mamoru as a staff member. The creation of a game whether it’s a modern-day Twitch shooter or a visual novel back in its heyday is a complicated process that requires all aspects of its process be it art, narrative, music, programming and final checks be completed and verified before the game can be released and in this 16 bit I felt did an excellent job at showing just what is needed to complete a game even if they’re not the triple-A titles that dominate today’s game charts.The time travel aspect of the series that was featured within the narrative in the form of the time leaps I felt was an interesting theme and vehicle that despite the risks involved in its implementation I felt turned out to be an excellent one that served to add a new dimension to the narrative that complemented its main theme excellently. While the aspect itself served as an excellent means to advance the plot by having Konoha leap through time periods the time travel aspect also did well to bring to the table its own contribution in the form of nostalgia both for those that were familiar with the Bishoujo games and those that experienced the tech advances that took place in those said periods in the form of the intro of the first versions of windows and its impact on society and through that the intro of large computer stores that dominated Akiba back in the day. On the other end of the positive and heartwarming aspects that came from being able to leap through time and work with your peers to create games that you all adored was the series own take on the butterfly effect and I have to say the kind of world that Konoha ended up creating thanks to her actions in the other time periods truly was grim for those that work in creating Bishoujo games and served as an excellent reminder for her and us that every action no matter how small has a consequence and overreliance of anything is a catalyst for potential disaster.As a final score, I would say that 16 Bit Sensation easily deserves a final overall score of 9/10 for it featured an excellent premise, strong story, characters, voice acting and a unique fusion of being not only able to experience the golden days of an admittedly lesser known game genre in the modern world but also by doing so realize just how much work went on behind the scenes in creating each of the masterpieces that Konoha so adored through the usage of a fresh new take on the classic Isekai formula by the usage of successive time leaps.But overall, this series I felt was an entertaining one that really showed well just how much work goes behind the scenes in the creation of games for even visual novels that can’t hold a candle to current triple-A games still require a lot of work to be done by limited amounts of staff and after watching this I can say for sure that I have a lot more respect for game devs now than before irrespective of whether their games are VN’s or triple-A titles. unique opportunity. An opportunity of a lifetime one could say for which she would be able to go back to the heydays of her treasured Bishoujo games in a Japan of the past and see with her own eyes how they were created from the very beginning.Just what would happen if our heroine were to take this opportunity and go back to a time where all she loved and admired about her games were still alive and kicking and start making her mark on history?But as they say the more ripples you create the bigger the potential storm. Just how big of a storm would this indulgence of hers cost her in the world around her?Taking its name from the 16-bit integers and memory addresses that formed the core of the much-vaunted PC-98 desktop computer to which our dear Mamoru was so in love with 16-bit sensation is a most unusual anime, to say the least. media, the series overall premise of a young adult being granted the chance to hop through time is not by itself an unusual one given its popularity within popular media what made it stand out in my eyes was its fusion with the dream of going back to the heyday of Bishoujo games and being able to see how artists, scriptwriters and programmers worked as they created the games that would to a generation of people provide the best entertainment and immersion that they had experienced to that point.As both a gamer who has an interest in how VN’s are created as well as being an avid fan of the visual novels that the Bishoujo genre of games symbolized this series was one that I felt resonated with me and was an easy pick to watch this season. And oh boy this one proved to be quite the ride.Konoha AkisatoKonoha Akisato is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the series’ main protagonist. A 19-year-old rookie illustrator who works for the Blue Bell game company in modern-day Japan Konoha from her initial appearances was shown to be a positive, cheerful, and spirited young woman who while young and relatively junior within her role was nonetheless a determined person and passionate about creating characters for games. However, despite possessing excellent skill at creating characters for the games that she is passionate about it can be seen that Konoha in the modern world was far from pleased with her role for despite working in a role that most girls her age would be proud off to Konoha this was anything but a job that she was content with for rather than creating cute girls for the Bishoujo games that she adored she was instead providing colour for the backs of male characters that anyone could do. But more than anything what frustrated Konoha the most was the fact that the Bishoujo games that she adored, and to which had inspired her to become an illustrator were no longer popular and in their place were mobile and Gatcha games that featured characters that were far from her cup of tea and were fast making her dream an impossible one. That is until one day Konoha were to have a fortunate encounter with a mysterious game shop whose games provided her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go back to her roots and see what it was involved in creating the very games that she adored by going back to their heyday.As the series progresses and Konoha gets the opportunity to hop through and explore different time periods, her personality gradually starts to change. While Konoha at the start of the series was shown to have great pride in her ability as an illustrator which served as her primary motivator in being able to fulfil her role this was offset by the fact that while she adored the older Bishoujo games that dominated her childhood she had little knowledge of what was actually involved in their creation. Despite this however thanks to both the opportunity to explore different timelines and being able to learn from veterans like Meiko and Kaori not only was this remedied but thanks to both their support and her own core personality traits of being hardworking and having a strong desire to improve herself Konoha was able to realize just how much was involved in the creation of the games that she adored. Though at first dismayed that her prized skill with drawing with the tablet was unusable in the various timelines that Konoha visited this act of starting again from scratch under the tutelage of her peers at Alcoholsoft I felt while having the effect of improving upon her knowledge of designing and bringing to life of characters using both software and techniques that she never would have been able to make use of in her own time also served as an excellent way for her to realize that the creation of characters is just one of many stages that were involved in the creation of Bishoujo games.This revelation, while shown well in the strong bonds that were forged between Konoha and Meiko and Kaori was perhaps shown best in the strong bonds that were forged between her and Mamoru. While their relationship had the most rocky of starts due to both their contrasting personalities and views on games this bond of theirs gradually served as the final piece of the puzzle for Konoha’s development as a character that allowed her to realize the true sense of joy that came from not just being able to create games that you were passionate about with peers that share your passion but also in the process being able to contribute in ensuring that it would survive in not only their hearts but the hearts of their fellow fans as well.Mamoru RokudaMamoru Rokuda is one of the main characters of the series and serves as both Konoha’s co-worker and eventual friend within the series. Initially serving within a small and little-known video game company named Alcoholsoft as its sole programmer Mamoru in his initial appearances was shown to be someone that while young being only 15 at this time was nonetheless someone that was intelligent, confident, and expressive to the point of being disrespectful to those that were his seniors. Despite his attitude problems and the unique bond that he shared with the company manager Mamoru was someone that was earnest, hardworking, and showed great pride towards both the field of programming and the programs that he makes for his peers which he views as being perfect. However, while his skills as a programmer were undeniable and were an asset to the team at Alcoholsoft his brooding and logical nature, tendency to do illogical things and his unusual fascination with the PC-98 computer were seen to create something of a barrier between him and his peers at Alcoholsoft.Mamoru’s life of acting as the company’s resident computer expert were to have a profound change one day when joining the company out of nowhere was a young girl who despite being clueless about game development nonetheless was one that while lacking in verifiable experience more than made up for it in her passion for drawing characters. Though the first encounters between Mamoru and Konoha were far from being a positive ones due to his personality, as the series progressed, and their bonds deepened this began to change. At the beginning of the series, unlike his peers at Alcoholsoft Mamoru did not have any interest in developing Bishoujo games and indeed was shown to only see them as a means for him to improve his skill with computers and programming. However, while the passion and dedication that he showed towards computers and to the PC-98 in particular created distances between himself and his peers as the series progressed this sense of passion was seen to become an important foundation for the company in the face of the many tech advances that we witnessed over the course of the time leaps. This sense of foundation however within the narrative was not limited to that of being the tech expert of the company though as in line with the time leaps Mamoru unlike Konoha was able to age and in being able to expand his life experience was able to realize not only how difficult management of a company was on the production side but also how much of a balancing act it was for the financial side as well.While Mamoru never saw himself as being the potential successor to the company the level of maturity that he gained from ageing allowed him to realize that for them to be successful as a brand they not only have to be cautious with their finances but also be able to work effectively as a team in order to get their games out. Whereas in the past Mamoru may had just done what was needed on the tech side of things I really liked seeing him get more involved in the company side of things by working with Kaori and the others as they learned to adapt to the new times and incorporate new tech and software into their arsenal. Though it was humorous to see him still try to create newer games on his prized PC-98s. While Mamoru never became as passionate about Bishoujo games as Konoha and the rest of Alcoholsoft did his experiences of working alongside them in the background as well as his unique encounter with Echo and his company I felt served to make him realize the kind of joy and satisfaction that can come from being able to work on something together and in releasing it contribute in keeping a genre alive. And while his dream of having his prized PC-98s conquer the world never came close to fruition this new understanding of his while serving to make him a more effective member of the company also served to make him an excellent partner for Konoha throughout the narrative as he possessed both skill with tech and the logical mind that can make sense of Konoha’s circumstance that I would daresay confuse the hell out of anyone else if they were to listen to her.As a character, I felt that Mamoru was both well-designed and developed which served as a nice contrast to Konoha throughout the narrative. While their initial personality, base traits, and beliefs on the topic of Bishoujo games were polar opposites in all regards the successive time leaps while serving an admirable job of advancing the story also served well to establish Mamoru as both an anchor for Konoha as well as that of a foundation to which she can stand upon while getting her bearings in the turbulent world of time leaping. This sense of leap-based development within the narrative I felt synergized well with the strong character chemistry that was established between Mamoru and Konoha throughout the narrative that allowed Mamoru to act as an effective anchor for Konoha where his sense of logic, intelligence, skill with tech and ability to adapt on the fly served as an effective contrast to Konoha’s tendency to get confused and do things without thinking of either alternatives or take advantage of assets that were around her a fact that Konoha was seen to be eternally thankful for within the narrative.KaoriKaori Shimoda is one of the main characters of the series and serves as one of Mamoru and Konoha’s peers within Alcoholsoft. In her initial appearances, Kaori was shown to be a kind, caring and polite person who was friendly and supportive to all she met and indeed behaved in a manner that was benefiting of both an elder sister and a sempai for Konoha within the company. While nominally a member of the company’s art department where she created the CG art alongside that of her best friend Meiko, she was also trusted by management to act in the capacity of a second in command when needed to which her confident nature, intelligence, and levelheadedness and more importantly ability to think things through from the POV of the staff really enabled her to shine. While her skill as an artist as well as that of a leader within the company was undeniable what served to make Kaori such an effective member of the company was not only her skill at management and directing staff towards working towards the bigger picture but also in recognizing that as a company they must be able to continuously evolve in line with the tech advances made in both software and hardware or risk being left behind a sense of forward thinking that I believe would be invaluable to the company.However, the most crucial contribution that Kaori made to the narrative in my eyes was her education of Konoha where in conjunction with Meiko she served to provide her with not only an effective foundation by teaching her how to make use of software and techniques that were native to Kaori’s own time period but in doing so enhance Konoha’s own desire to not only learn more about how games were created but also make her realize that despite the ease that tech can bring when brought into games development overreliance of this would only serve to take away the precious moments that comes from being able to create games with like-minded peers. For without the laughter that comes from creating characters and working so hard to meet deadlines that you are downing energy drinks constantly and sleeping in the office then the creation of games may as well just be a hollow exercise that can be done with AI. Kaori’s efforts in making Konoha realize the importance of these precious memories contributed well in her crusade to make Bishoujo game development fun and relevant again.AmvAnimation wise I felt that the series overall animation was really well done that in conjunction with the time leaps that were prevalent within the narrative allowed us to see not only what Japan looked like back then but also the kind of tech that was used back in the heyday of Bishoujo games. Being able to see how characters were created back then using first gen computers and graphics software and seeing how these changed as a result of both new software and hardware as well as that of AI really was an insightful experience. In terms of character design while the standard designs for the cast did an excellent job of showcasing the cast the time leaps served to further enhance this by not only showing how the existing cast matured physically in the case of Mamoru and Touya but also reflecting how the company changed over the years via the inclusion of new staff members with the best examples of this being the twins of Mari and Senri that brought not only new skillsets to the company but a new sense of atmosphere to the company via their personality as well. Though only used in one arc within the series one of the standout animation moments within the series was the Echo arc that featured a surprisingly good pairing of science fiction and comedy that while giving Mamoru his own doze of what Konoha experiences regularly also created one of the most beautiful scenes I had seen in this anime in the form of the departure of Echo from this realm.Music wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme in the form of 65535 that was performed by Shoko Nakagawa and Link~past and Future ~ that was performed by Konoha’s assigned seiyuu Aoi Koga. Both of these songs while very catchy and positive were ones that I felt conveyed a very different sense of emotions and feelings when used in conjunction with their visuals with the former conveying senses of nostalgia, frustration, new beginnings in a foreign time period and a desire to relive the glory days of the past and in doing so learn of not just how much is involved in creating the games but also how fun it was to build things you are passionate for alongside peers that share your passion. This opening theme as a final gift to its fans also featured a nice image of the core cast members drawn in a 16-bit style that was a perfect way to end the opening song with.The series ending theme Link~past and Future~ while serving well to provide us with some nice eye candy in the form of the female cast members in swimsuits had among its main theme the sense of nostalgia that was achieved through the visualization of both the computers that were the mainstays of Bishoujo games development back in the heyday as well as the floppy disks that allowed game companies to store their finished products on a sight that many a game studios production staff would have celebrated on reaching with high fives and tears in their eyes as a result of all their hard work that led to that point. Like the series opening theme the ending theme also featured a great homage to the era of gaming that serves as the main background for this series in the form of a next episode preview screen that takes the form of a PC menu screen drawn to represent the 16-bit computers that the cast made use of back then to create their games.Voice acting-wise wise I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or supporting characters. In particular I felt that Aoi Koga and Atsushi Abe deserve special praise for I felt that they did an excellent job portraying their assigned characters of Konoha and Mamoru respectively. While unfortunately used sparingly from the midpoint of the narrative onwards I nonetheless really enjoyed the portrayals of Kaori and Meiko by their respective seiyuu’s in the form of Ayako Kawasumi and Yui Horie respectively. Given their respective real-world ages both would have had opportunities to experience the golden age of Bishoujo games as part of their childhood and as such were excellent assets to bring into the series where their experience would had been useful to the writers and to Aoi Koga in helping the latter better prepare herself for this role. While used as mostly a support character I felt that Aya Yamane’s portrayal of the character of Touya Yamada was an excellent one that showcased well not just Touya’s development as a person both personally and professionally as she went from being a fan of Bishoujo games to that of a creator that made them.Overall conclusionIn overall 16 Bit Sensation Another layer I felt was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points its unique premise, strong and original narrative, well-designed and developed characters, excellent voice acting and its unique insight into not only the golden age of Bishoujo games but also the many kinds of roles that unknowingly are involved in the creation of such games that would no doubt surprise a great many people.While the series main subject matter admittedly would not be familiar to people that were either born after the golden age of Bishoujo games or had never actually played a Visual novel before for those who have such as myself the series insight into what goes on in the creation of such games was truly fascinating. On the surface when one were to look at VN’s which are by far the most common games that belong to that genre one wouldn’t think that they would need much in terms of either staff or specialist software and hardware given that the games in question were simple games that didn’t feature the kind of advanced graphics and deep immersive storytelling that modern games feature. But just because VN’s didn’t feature them doesn’t mean that it didn’t need skilled staff and software and hardware that was unique to them and in this I felt that the series served to provide us with a unique opportunity to see the kind of hard work that the artists and programmers put in behind the scenes with its fusion of time travel serving to further expand upon this by allowing us to see the kind of software, hardware and drawing techniques that were used in the years that made up the golden age of Bishoujo games and I have to say some of them truly were strange with the best example of this one being cling wrap scanning.While the drawing side of the process I felt was explained in great detail as was the look into both the kind of pressures that artists could be under when creating the games and the need to switch roles on the fly to ensure that the tasks are completed on time the series likewise did well to expand upon the often overlooked and unknown programming side of the process as well which I really appreciated. For even if the characters and art for a game were perfect if the backend that runs it in the form of the programming is not up to scratch and ends up causing individual scenes to freeze and crash the game then that would be a stain on the devs honour as creators and in the game industry and especially for smaller companies like Alcoholsoft reputation is everything and within the series was best exemplified by the importance that they placed on Mamoru as a staff member. The creation of a game whether it’s a modern-day Twitch shooter or a visual novel back in its heyday is a complicated process that requires all aspects of its process be it art, narrative, music, programming and final checks be completed and verified before the game can be released and in this 16 bit I felt did an excellent job at showing just what is needed to complete a game even if they’re not the triple-A titles that dominate today’s game charts.The time travel aspect of the series that was featured within the narrative in the form of the time leaps I felt was an interesting theme and vehicle that despite the risks involved in its implementation I felt turned out to be an excellent one that served to add a new dimension to the narrative that complemented its main theme excellently.

On the other end of the positive and heartwarming aspects that came from being able to leap through time and work with your peers to create games that you all adored was the series own take on the butterfly effect and I have to say the kind of world that Konoha ended up creating thanks to her actions in the other time periods truly was grim for those that work in creating Bishoujo games and served as an excellent reminder for her and us that every action no matter how small has a consequence and overreliance of anything is a catalyst for potential disaster.As a final score, I would say that 16 Bit Sensation easily deserves a final overall score of 9/10 for it featured an excellent premise, strong story, characters, voice acting and a unique fusion of being not only able to experience the golden days of an admittedly lesser known game genre in the modern world but also by doing so realize just how much work went on behind the scenes in creating each of the masterpieces that Konoha so adored through the usage of a fresh new take on the classic Isekai formula by the usage of successive time leaps.But overall, this series I felt was an entertaining one that really showed well just how much work goes behind the scenes in the creation of games for even visual novels that can’t hold a candle to current triple-A games still require a lot of work to be done by limited amounts of staff and after watching this I can say for sure that I have a lot more respect for game devs now than before irrespective of whether their games are VN’s or triple-A titles.', 'For the first episode, I quite liked this anime, although basically I was a little disappointed because I thought this was an anime with a male MC.But that\'s not a big problem, because I can still enjoy this anime throughout the episodes.I praise the design and workmanship of this anime, it has good graphic quality and beautiful characters, it is very pleasing to look at.But unfortunately I can\'t recommend this anime, because towards the end I had several questions about the storyline.First things, who is Echo?

The idea of a show being a tribute to an early part of the anime subculture, the early 80-90s doujin games is a good premise. However when it was executed, it felt weak. It is not worth watching.Animation wise, the show is fine. Konoha looks cute, Mamoru is quite handsome. The other characters are easy on the eyes and the show is fine on that regard.Character wise, the show is also fine. Konoha does love games of the era she is supposed to enjoy. Her passion is infectious and game development team as a whole feel warm and dysfunctional...yet competent enough to pass as something I would expect to see of an indie studio.The soundtrack is okay, I definitely like Link ~past and future~. The rest of the soundtrack is okay and does its job fine. Nothing stood out as bad soundtrack per-say.Storywise, this show fails on the last 4 episodes completely. The whole future being an incredibly bad butterfly scenario that has no rational reason, both using the show\'s logic and applying standard real life logic. This show is grounded somewhat in reality and the fact the villain is what it is kills suspension of disbelief very quickly. The rest of the show was just disappointing. I expected the show to go a lot more into game development not just have passion, dithering and voila you too can create your own ""Clannad VN"" or something. I admit my knowledge of 80-90s VN is bad, but I expected to learn a lot more from this show. I get that art is important to VN but shouldn\'t the routing have a lot more focus? It just feels like a generic create creative works series but the premise seemed to promise more.Overall, objectively, this show is fine. It looks nice, the characters match what the show is supposed to get at and a soundtrack is good. However, I wanted more, because a show that should be a passion project considering the creator of the show was from that era should have showed off more of their trade to create those games from that era. yet competent enough to pass as something I would expect to see of an indie studio.The soundtrack is okay, I definitely like Link ~past and future~. The rest of the soundtrack is okay and does its job fine. Nothing stood out as bad soundtrack per-say.Storywise, this show fails on the last 4 episodes completely. The whole future being an incredibly bad butterfly scenario that has no rational reason, both using the show\'s logic and applying standard real life logic. This show is grounded somewhat in reality and the fact the villain is what it is kills suspension of disbelief very quickly. The rest of the show was just disappointing. I expected the show to go a lot more into game development not just have passion, dithering and voila you too can create your own ""Clannad VN"" or something. I admit my knowledge of 80-90s VN is bad, but I expected to learn a lot more from this show. I get that art is important to VN but shouldn\'t the routing have a lot more focus? It just feels like a generic create creative works series but the premise seemed to promise more.Overall, objectively, this show is fine.

And that\'s super!""Apparently this plot of aliens and alternate dystopian realities is a...huge deviation from the source material, and was perhaps done as an attempt to be more topical as it briefly, bizarrely, and confusedly touched upon A.I\'s place in the game industry.The show\'s animation takes a huge hit in the later episodes, with a lot of static shots and crudely drawn background characters. The characters can be enjoyable, however the majority are barely two-dimensional and get little depth outside of protagonist Konoha and deuteragonist Mamoru, even if they seem like they\'re important to the cast.I enjoyed the chemistry between Konoha and Mamoru, which was ultimately the only thing that brought me back to continue watching each week. It would have been amazzing to see more about the visual novels being released in the 90s/00s, and the otaku culture rising around it, but instead was incredibly disappointing to see such a cool premise ultimately fail to fulfill any expectations it had, even for itself, and ultimately ending like a prolonged fart noise.4/10, and all 4 of those points are for the first few episodes.

There are some major issues with this show’s lame attempt at going back in time.So it’s about Konoha, a bubbly, cute, skinny, short-skirt wearing teenage girl who works in a software company developing eroge games. Cough cough. Yes that’s right- a 19 year old developing pornographic games. (take a deep breath- and I’ll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes)She loves vintage (90s)...eroge games (of course) and finds a charming shop run by an elderly woman who has a lot of suspicious knowledge of what games she’ll like, and sells her some from her shop- which mysteriously disappears the next day. It’s a really neat setup- despite how wrong it is for a girl that age to even be into such a thing, or how off it is for an old woman to be running a game shop- when Konoha opens one of the games at a cafe, she’s transported to another dimension!Upon waking up in a street- AT NIGHT- finds herself outside a dull looking building, and starts whining for help (her voice is very squeaky and loud and it will drive you nuts even if you get used to it) So they take her in and she finds a little office with a young kid and two other girls about her age, making eroge games. It’s the year 1992, and she’s gone back in time 30 years! And she's not interested in finding any people she might know, or her family home or anything, she wants to color ergo games! (How convenient!) It's interesting how she shows the people her Apple tablet to convince them she’s from the future, and the battery is dead; and how she tries to learn coloring with a mouse, pixel by pixel. Having done that very thing myself with 16bit graphics, it was interesting to see that portrayed. But for a time travel show- this feels really claustrophobic.All we ever get to see is what this one street in Akihabara is like- and tbh it’s very dull, and grey, and kind of boring. Maybe it was in 1992, but it STILL IS even when Konoha goes back to 1996, then 1999- there seems to be no real understanding of the outside world beyond the PC stuff.Everything around that computer is fully accurate- although I doubt the reach of 16-bit graphics was that widespread; and MS-DOS was the dominant operating system on most machines (even the slang “PC” was not really in use in 1992- when the first time-travel goes back to) but windows 3.0 had already come out by then. My own experiences with pc’s of that era were crappy 8bit graphics and yes MSDOS, but already by 1994 we had a Windows 3.1 machine… If Japan was that far ahead with graphics with their machines- they’d have already adopted windows by 1996- but in this show, they’re still using Dos? Okay, but the computer stuff is the MOST accurate stuff from that era they have- there’s a lot more problems here.Clothing: none of the characters dress in a way I would say is accurate to that era. Young men mostly wore white dress shirts and black pants. Girls wore long skirts and did not wear tight sexy cloths. And the ones who did- were KOGALS and kogal culture was taking off in the 90s, but none of the chicks in this resemble a kogal in any way.   I find that odd in a show that’s all about pornographic games. And the male characters all look like cardboard cutouts in baggy current day clothes. Apart from the guy with that libre mask, which is just lazy and makes no sense.At one point, Konoha is handed a grey cellular phone- which the character refers to as “here’s my other cell phone”… so he has more than one phone in 1999, not only is the phone’s reception perfect when talking, they literally proceed to send TEXT MESSAGES back and forth, and the phone vibrates and makes that sound like a 2020s smartphone.WHAT. THA. FUCK.You mean to tell me, you know all about a 1980s era computer to the most granular detail, but don’t even know what early cellular phones were like??? There was NO TEXTING!!!! There was no ‘vibrate’, there were no large screens. NOT. IN. 1999!!!There are a couple references to events of the time- like a recession, and “dot com” companies- but they don’t relate that Alcoholsoft became a dot com, which would have made some sense when the scandal comes down:Some guy who runs a couple boring night clubs talked the game company owner into investing in his business, promising to sell him a game console. Okay, but when the news breaks- he says he lost a billion yen in the scandal.WAIT. WHAT??? A BILLION? WITH. A. B? In 1999?A billion yen… and the characters are all standing around in the office late at night, moping about how great the company used to be and how fun the games were that they made. Keeping in mind these were porn games- and the majority of the staff are FEMALE (???)- that’s already way off- but NO WAY would they even still have an office to work in. That place would have been shut the hell down immediately, padlocked, all its equipment hauled off and the owner would be IN JAIL.How long could it take for the writers to have looked up how much money a billion yen was in 1999? How can they not know this?So what this anime amounts to is- some zoomer who is really into a 1990s computer decided to make an anime, with the only knowledge of the era being about… pornographic video games… And this is why ‘otaku’ is an insult in Japan.The graphics of this anime are really good, it was clearly made on computers- it’s obvious a lot of money was spent on its production, which is kind of a waste for something like this.

Go look somewhere else.Series got seriously cheap vibe and already on third episode it went from mediocre to ""quality"" filled. The classic ""quality"" that will get fixed on bluray release.Audio.Whoever decided to cast high pitched hamster for the role of main protagonist... dunno, it\'s just baffling. Soundtrack is bland, opening song is weak, ending one is skippable as well.Main plot: a young adult, or rather,...teen girl Konoha works as a sort of fill-in artist. Despite working at a game developing company, her work looks more like in-between animator job in animation studio.She is filled with tropes - wacky hair, fang, young and driven by her passion, somewhere between airhead and dense, trying to be shown as adorkable ""tehe"" kind of female lead.Her studio colleagues are background noise, and boss is classic stuck up ugly shorty.Her ""work"" colleagues after time skip are also band of tropes - guy wearing lucha libre mask, two identical flavorless girls being just classic nice, and accepting comrades, some other guys doing background noise, and a boy genius who suffers same condition as TWGOK protagonist does. And what a surprise? TWGOK author is the same person as author for this series! Which explains love and praises for the dating sims, especially older ones (and why the characters are same tropes).Other character introduced in third episode is a timid, megame, girly girl with massive bosoms.

Graphic input tablets were known in semi and professional graphic applications since mid 80s. Also, early graphic art, if not made with tablet, were mostly done with trackball as it provided better control and faster pointer scrolling than mouse.And Japanese programmers knew about other operating systems - many PC98 machines did run on MS-DOS or old versions of Windows (win 2.0 for example).And later it just gets worse when it comes to historical accuracy.Sure, someone may say ""it\'s just an series"" and I agree - it\'s just a (very bad) series. But with all of the modern era technology and knowledge being accessible within seconds, seeing so many mistakes, errors and factual idiocy is just baffling.

Ace wo Nerae! (1979),https://myanimelist.net/anime/313/Ace_wo_Nerae_1979,"['Ace wo Nerae! is without a doubt the most under-viewed and unappreciated film listed on this site.  At the time of this writing only 53 people have scored this?  Truly shocking as I found this to be one of the best sports themed anime I have ever seen.This movie serves as a recap for the television series from the early 70s.  Since I went into this movie not seeing the original series, I can’t compare how this film does justice to it or the original manga.  However as a standalone story it’s a very good one.  Hiromi Oka is a...freshman member of her high schools tennis club, which also happens to have many of the best players in the country.  On her first day a new coach is introduced and Hiromi is quickly picked by him as a top new prospect, though no one else seems to see this talent including Hiromi herself.  He pushes her with a brutal training regiment and slowly she becomes better and more confident leading up to the ultimate goal of making the national squad to compete internationally.The movie features great sports action and even though I am not particularly a fan of tennis, I found the action to be both realistic and exciting.  It also does a great job of keeping it simple.  Often movies, particularly recap ones, try to do too much and cram so much information in them that they end up not making a lot of sense.  That’s not the case here as we are given just enough background on the supporting cast to make you care for the characters.  While the focus of the story remains fixed on the tennis aspects, Ace wo Nerae does a good job of mixing in a little romance and some compelling dramatic plotlines.I really loved the cast and in particular the lead, Hiromi Oka.  She is a bit of your standard leading lady but I found her to be a very interesting and likeable character.  I can imagine that she has influenced many of the anime heroines that have succeeded her over the years.  The strict coach Jin Munakata, is your typically stoic man with a mysterious past.  Though his motivations are hidden from the audience for almost the entire film when they are revealed I felt that they worked pretty well.  The rest of the cast is good and the character  archetypes will be familiar.  Reika who is the best player on the team and is idolized by Hiromi, is aloof and tough on Oka because she doesn’t think she deserves what the coach gives her.  She’s a pretty good foil for Hiromi though you can’t really call her a villain.  Unlike a lot of sports stories where the rival of the hero or heroine is usually a total asshole, Reika doesn’t come across that way nor will be hated by viewers.  Toudou is the best male player on the team and is the love interest for Oka.  He’s a likeable character though the romance elements take a backseat to the sports action.For a movie from the late 70s, the animation holds up remarkably well to today’s standards.  The art and character designs are top notch and it is quite beautiful to watch.  The only thing that really is painful to view is some of the god awful hair styles and clothing.  The acting is very solid as well, though the music is typically 70s but neither particularly good nor bad.  There are some really great sound effects however, the tennis matches sounded exactly like they should.I strongly encourage everyone to go out and try to find a copy of this movie to watch.  Anyone who considers themselves a fan of anime should give this a shot.

The entire thing is an irrational, emotionally (and at times physically) abusive male coach unreasonably projecting his desires onto a teenage girl, working her until she throws up. You are not told what his motivations are for the majority of the movie, and when it's finally revealed it is some of the most insultingly inappropriate drivel I have ever had narratively pushed on me in film. The movie has the audacity to have the main character be grateful to this man for his abuse. This may even be realistic, I do not know how people react in...these situations. Realistic or not, it is disgusting for this to be portrayed as sweet, endearing, motivational, or inspirational narratively. The coach is a piece of trash, and truly how dare this film spend even a nanosecond portraying him as anything else.I understand that the context was different for the demographic at the time. A 70s shoujo manga about a hot older man taking a passionate interest in you above and beyond the other girls, feverishly driving you to be the best version of yourself because of his dark, traumatic past. Were I a japanese teen girl 35 years ago, no doubt this is would be quite captivating to me. Judge it in those terms if you wish, but for me, as an adult in 2021, this is absolute garbaaaage.Putting those issues aside, the pacing is poor and while some of the scenes are quite nice (Osamu Dezaki really shines in certain moments) overall the production is nothing to rave about. So take some pretty good direction, modest animation, and a fun enough main character and mix that with poor pacing and an absolutely garbage story and you get a 3/10 these situations.

A coach with a harsh training style, a tennis newcomer who will do anything to achieve her dreams, and her bitter rival bent on defeating her through skill alone.While nothing extremely deep (no, tennis does not reach to far into the psyche) Aim for the Ace offers a glimpse into what we all felt when we were younger, that our passions define our life."", ""Per my rating, I have mixed feelings on recommending this. I watched it hours after finishing the tv series.Starting off with the pros, the high budget is clear with beautiful shots and no off-model moments for characters (or at least I didn't notice any)In the 6 year gap between the series and the movie, Dezaki's directing became so much more refined and distinctly HIS style from the pastel still frames, the shots of birds taking flight, unique camera angles, and color palette changes in intense moments. It very much made the movie for me.Onto why I am mixed about this, the movie is...pretty much a recap of the series, with new content being at the very end. While some moments are changed slightly, the end result is pretty much the same. Some really important character arcs and moments are cut out too, like Kyoko Otowa's development and a lot of how Reika and Hiromi's bond grew and changed over the course of the plot along with Hiromi's improvement being less gradual, only shown through short training montages. I understand the reason being time constraints, but it still does hurt the film.Overall, if you're watching it for new content, it isn't really needed. However, if you are a Dezaki fan like me and enjoy his directing style, the film is eye candy and a nice watch.TL;DR: Probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a fan of recaps, if you want to watch it because it's a Dezaki work and to see his style in motion, go for it. pretty much a recap of the series, with new content being at the very end.

Animation Seisaku Shinkou Kuromi-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1797/Animation_Seisaku_Shinkou_Kuromi-chan,"[""Before falling into relative obscurity, 2001’s OVA Animation Runner Kuromi was the definition of “anime about making anime”. In a not completely unexplored field, with other renditions made by even the tenth episode of Paranoia Agent (Satoshi Kon, 2004) the indisputable champion in this area is nowadays Shirobako (PA Works, 2014), with also the advantage of covering this topic for two whole cours.Nonetheless, as opposed to the almost methodical approach Shirobako follows throughout its run, Animation Runner Kuromi’s is much more comedy-centered. And not only because it doesn’t have much time to waste (much like the animators doing their job there) but because the...whirlwind of a pace it follows constitutes the very core of its style.And to understand the comedy we need to have a glance at the Staff that created it. This OVA was directed by Akitarou Daichi, a pretty prolific worker of the industry that had his name in numerous series from the 90s and 00s, from whom we can highlight the likes of Kodomo no Omocha, Fruits Basket, Now and Then, Here and There, Nurse Angel Ririka or Bokura ga Ita. Also important to note the work of Hajime Watanabe, character designer for some of the aforementioned as well as other well-known shows such as Kaleido Star and School Rumble.Out of all those, Kuromi has a look and feel that resembles Kodomo no Omocha to a breathtaking extent. Definitely the hectic rhythm and unique slapstick work wonders with the new subject matter we are presented with.Ultimately, there’s an important moral to be learned here. Coordinating projects is not an easy task, no matter the type of activity in which you’re working. Both Shirobako and Kuromi depict problems in production, yet the former prioritizes a positive message built around the profession, almost like a love letter towards animation. The latter's message is even more fundamental, aiming for human understanding, hard-work and empathy.Every anime watcher needs to experience either of these to get to the bottom of production and unravel the actual human work that any project constitutes, how rarely anime is made solely by the efforts of one studio but by an extensive net of connections that goes well beyond what we first imagine.In this regard there are also documentaries and articles covering the different challenges of artistic creation within the industry. An example could be the one showing the crafting of Only Yesterday, with a highlight being how an animator spent an entire year drawing anything but safflowers. Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction, so one might be better off getting their first exposure to the whole picture with this hilarious, yet definitely introspective treat. whirlwind of a pace it follows constitutes the very core of its style.And to understand the comedy we need to have a glance at the Staff that created it.

Yes, I have seen this OVA after watching my beloved Shirobako, and after finishing I can say that Animation Runner Kuromi does enough to stand on its own, even leaving me with a smile on my face.The first thing I noticed was how over-the-top the show is, first in its rather dark humor depicting the harshness of the anime industry from the perspective of the production manager Kuromi.  We see her coming in as...a newbie, being dismayed by the comically impossible deadlines due to key animators not doing their jobs.  Through learning the ins and outs of the process itself, her interactions with other strange, exaggerated personalities to get them to work is rather charming.  The exaggeration serves in good effect both to convey that production managers have to cater to the artists as they are individuals, and also to just simply entertain as it is a comedy.  The jokes hit where they needed to, and although I didn't laugh out loud or anything, I still enjoyed it.  I'm glad the OVA didn't simply boil down to a sort of a wiki description that only happens to follow a story.Moving on to art and animation, I do have some comments.  Animation is very wild and energetic, which helped give off that impression I got of the OVA.  Characters motions are overtly exaggerated to help characterize them and get us to care, as there are only 40 minutes in the episode to work with.  If I had to compare it to a certain show, I'd say I got around the same vibe as FLCL in not the fight scenes.  Now on the art, it's pretty standard for a 2001 show, although it is digitally colored.  The styling is also a little dated, but characters are funky looking enough for them to stand out from the hundreds of other really generic spiky hair characters out there.Sound, I haven't got much to say.  In terms of OST, it felt like there were only three tracks played throughout the thing and on repeat.  However, I didn't get sick of them, so that's fine.  Voice acting, as far as the dub is concerned, is well done.  The VAs effectively conveyed each character's wackiness, so no complaints there.Overall, I didn't feel like I wasted my time on this and I even got some laughs all throughout.  If you're at all curious about the animation process, I recommend that you take some time off your day and watch this thing.  Even if you've already watched Shirobako.Overall: 7/10 -> B a newbie, being dismayed by the comically impossible deadlines due to key animators not doing their jobs.

Aoki Ryuusei SPT Layzner,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3079/Aoki_Ryuusei_SPT_Layzner,"[""Aoi Ryuusei SPT Layzner is Ryousuke Takahashi's fifth creative work and one that stands out among his other mecha works for feeling a lot more representative of the genre. While Dougram is a much more politically focused show with action that feels more comprised of guerrilla efforts than giant robots punching each other, Layzner is something that feels a lot more distinctively like a real robot show making it more derivative compared to his other contributions to the industry up to this point yet refreshing in its execution.Layzner tackles some very interesting concepts within the mecha genre. Taking place in an alternative history where the...Cold War continued for decades trust between nations is still very weak among the two main superpowers of the aforementioned war which maintained their political and militant prevalence. It's an era where all it takes is one askew action to set off a war and when an unknown alien force helms the charge of a battle on Mars, it was all it took to lead to a mass missile attack on both sides' military bases on the red planet. What's great about this premise is how volatile it can be. Trust between nations is tense after all so when word of a mass attack on a nation occurs each side assumes the other is the cause. In reality it's an entirely alien force known as Grados, humanoid beings very similar to earthlings who using this knowledge of tension declares this attack to make each side attack each other.The keyword is tension, as the first 24 episodes is very invested in this theme. Trust issues between different parties, the fear of being attacked by a superior alien force, the tension of trying to run from them. From the first episode there's a very clear air of bleakness, a sense of helplessness in an effort to survive a battle that can't be won. And in its execution it's damn good. The main cast comprises mostly of students from a club that were brought to Mars as a peace effort between nations and being thrown into the deep end with civilians that don't have any battle experience puts you in a similar position to them. You're witnessing and feeling the sense of dread they are as giant robots piloted by aliens destroy the one location that separates them from a planet with no atmosphere. It makes the characters feel boxed in, and by extension yourself, following them trying to find any possible survivors and a chance to make their way back home.That is with the exception of a wild card with the main character, Eiji Asuka. Eiji is the solace in this hopeless situation yet an explosive one that seems to help the civilian crew but given their situation have a hard time trying to trust him. It's a reasonable response as there's no reason for our heroes to figure that there's a coup occurring within an alien army that no earthling is even aware of. Eiji is the bridge that becomes the hope as well as the evidence that the alien adversaries aren't all evil. And it's an endearing experience watching him try to gain the trust of everyone.The cast of Layzner is really great, it's not going to be winning awards for being groundbreaking but everyone is personable and have varied, believable reactions to what's happening and in general have very likeable personalities. Every character slowly falls into serving a role in the story and it all feels natural. They all receive development that makes you really root for them and become concerned of their wellbeing -- or in some other cases, make you hate them. The further the story goes the more it feels like everything will work out for them. Even when the story does take a significant shift the characters remain who they are and continue to develop remaining true to themselves and not being adjusted to fit the new tone.I will touch upon the second part of this show briefly because I don't wish to spoil much. Layzner is somewhat infamous in circles that are aware of it for having a pretty drastic shift in tone after episode 24. It loses a lot of the drama and nail-biting suspense as it moves in direction that is a lot more  action packed and bombastic. Really, it almost feels like a completely different show. But I want to clarify that this change isn't weak, it's just very different to what came before. As far as individual episodes go I'd almost say it's as good as the first part of the story. The problem more lies in that it's a cancelled show. Layzner is one of the most unfortunate examples of a cancelled show as something that was clearly being created with the intention to be 50 episodes and around 35 episodes in got asked by the Sunrise executives to give it an ending. Narratively, it's not a graceful finish. However when it comes to what it offers within its episodes all the way up to the end Layzner does hold itself intact fairly well, albeit with a few hiccups with how it handles some of its secondary and main characters. Bear in mind as I say this that I did not watch the original TV ending and only viewed the ending that came in the OVA a few months after the show's airing.With that out of the way, I want to talk more about the positives which include the visuals. Layzner is a gorgeous looking show for its time. As far as TV animation goes for the era, Zeta Gundam's one of the only shows I can think of that looks as detailed and well animated as Layzner, and even then I'd say Zeta's inferior. And it's not just animation, the art is very detailed with mecha designs that are more complex than most in the era and mature character designs that are reminiscent of a softer, less gruff Fist of the North Star. Its storyboard and layout is very nice too, with shot composition that at times can evoke a lot of emotion. There were some visual moments in the show that really stood out to me that I had to pause it or go back and re-experience it.I also really enjoy the opening theme and animation. Among the fans that's not a unique opinion but it really is great sequence that's well choreographed. I love the change between the first and second openings when Eiji's running as it changes from a determined expression with less urgency in his face to a more aggressive expression that makes him seem at wit's end, running at full speed doing everything his body can handle to complete his mission. It represents well the shift in urgency from the first part to the second.Regarding the soundtrack it's also quite strong. The aforementioned opening theme is good of course but the soundtrack itself is varied offering a range from classical influences to pop to Aoki Nozomi-like orchestral jazz & rock. It's not a large soundtrack but unlike Dougram which fails in having strong themes Layzner actually benefits from this being able to make some tracks represent certain characters. When you hear certain themes you're a lot more likely to get excited or to react in a particular way compared to Dougram which with its tiny soundtrack and double the runtime ends up making its great tracks carry less weight to them.All in all, I feel like I could talk more about this show in greater detail but as a written review I'd much rather hit the bullet points and give you a taste of what this show offers. It's something that should be seen for yourself especially if you're a mecha fan. It does have its problems and has a very rushed ending but the content that comes before it and even the ending itself in isolation is highly entertaining. This was a show that came so close to being absolutely amazing, if it was given the chance to be complete it might've become one of my favourite mecha shows of all time. And to have that impression planted upon me despite its handicap is something to be worthy of note.

And to have that impression planted upon me despite its handicap is something to be worthy of note."", ""So yeah, this had no review up to now ( october 2020) and I think it deserves one to tell people if this anime is for them or not - yes it is not for everyone.Story: 6Well I like the fact that in a way the aliens are quite similar to humans, which is relevant to the plot, but it is kinda simple and the series try to cover it in mystery for way too long. Also certain events feel a bit forced to happen or simply doesn't make much sense, specially after the 3 year jump which happens at one point.Yet the same jump...makes other aspects better - more world building and some interesting plot twists.Also whenever they do those jumps forward they do so in the middle of climax letting us guess how that event or battle ended. While not horrible since you make up more or less what happened it kinda breaks the narrative.So it has nice structure, but becomes a bit random and absurd at times.Art: 9I am taking in to consideration the anime's age and the mecha genre as factors here. Mecha design is quite amazing, full of detail and they try to give as much dept as possible. Settings are also interesting and character designs are full of personality, specially over the 3 year gap when they look different.Combat scenes tend to be pretty cool and intense, be it on mecha or with characters fighting on foot.Sound: 8The music is great, opening can get easily stuck in your head for days xD Background music works just fine and adds to the mood. Sounds are your usual mecha anime ones and they work just fine.Characters: 6Well characters have a cool base and premise until they start making weird choices which won't fit them, like villains letting the heroes go off when they could pursue and terminate them.Main character is overly pacifist - I get it that he descends from both aliens and humans and sometimes he fights relatives or friends, it is hard to fight your sister for example. But he even avoids killing dangerous foes who he actually never met and had all reasons to despise, feels kinda like forced pacifism and eventually other characters fall to that as well.On the good side, secondary characters are kinda interesting and they get far better when they grow a bit after the 3 year fast forward.Enjoyment: 7There were points when I was so hooked that I couldn't stop watching one episode after another, others when I was watching and liking it, but sometimes the plot skipped forward or closed an arch and I left it untouched for a few days.So yeah, it is exciting in key moments, has some mysteries to make you wonder but has some boring bits here and there.Overall: 7So, is this for you? If you are into mecha, action and sci fi or if you want to know how a Gundam Like anime can mix with Hokuto no Ken, by all means watch this :3Ig not then well, there is better stuff out there with better characters and plot.Bottom line: Cool mecha show but slightly bellow average as regular anime. makes other aspects better - more world building and some interesting plot twists.Also whenever they do those jumps forward they do so in the middle of climax letting us guess how that event or battle ended.

The characters almost never feel safe, and yet are allowed brief moments of brevity that develop them from a group of victims into a family. While the main character Eiji is kept at a distance at first, as the show goes on he experiences peaks and valleys of being part of that ""family"", and being viewed as a potential aggressor. Even...when the characters make it to Earth and feel like they\'ll finally be free, the show throws us through twists and turns about the character of Eiji and the aliens who have served as the show\'s antagonist, as well as the true nature of the titular Layzner itself.  The show itself ends with a cliffhanger, Eiji rushing off to potentially sacrifice himself for the sake of humanity, and we are left in the dark about whether or not he succeeds, leaving the audience with a 10/10 masterpiece of mid 80\'s animation.Is what I wish I could say. Everything I just told you was about the first 24 episodes of the show. If you want to experience Layzner as a near perfect piece of anime, then watch the everything until the end of episode 24 and pretend that every episode you see after that is actually a result of a really bad joint you smoked prior to starting the show, a mere mirage.If you wish to ignore my warning and continue watching past that point, then Layzner will become drastically worse as a whole. The last 14 episodes are not wholly bad. Existing in a timeskip off of the cliffhanger from ep. 24, Earth has been conquered by the enemy aliens, and is currently under occupation. Bits of humanity still exist in a resistance movement, but their situation seems dire, as they don\'t have any weaponry that can compete with Gradosian SPTs. Despite how this synopsis sounds, the slow pacing and utterly oppressive atmosphere of part 1 is entirely lost, feeling less like Layzner and more like Fist of the North Star with badass robots. The only character to genuinely be interesting in this second part is the new main antagonist, Lu Cain, who is a fun and over the top villain that goes through legitimate development after learning about the nature of humanity and Gradosian relations (which were revealed to us back in part 1). Tragically, by the time they actually start making him an interesting character, its the end of the show.The actual end of the show is an OVA expansion of the final episode, turning the incredibly rushed finale into a 40 minute or so short film. In spite of all this new time, the ending still feels incredibly rushed. In spite of how rushed said ending was, the episode spends a lot of time focusing on the twist revealed to the audience back in part 1, treating it as new information. Layzner also gets an upgrade that looks and acts the exact same as regular Layzner, and also does not make sense, considering that humanity still can\'t make SPTs comparable to the Gradosian ones.If I were to rate the first and second halves of the show as their own separate programs, part 1 would be looking at a ridiculously strong 10/10, while the second part would be a nearly as strong 5/10. And so, sadly, by watching Part 2, it inevitably brings down the quality of the show itself. As said earlier in the review, if you want to watch SPT Layzner, finish episode 24 and pretend that\'s the end. when the characters make it to Earth and feel like they\'ll finally be free, the show throws us through twists and turns about the character of Eiji and the aliens who have served as the show\'s antagonist, as well as the true nature of the titular Layzner itself.

From its mature, deliberate narrative pacing that takes the time for characters to breathe and undergo more subtle and believable character evolution, to the quality and consistency of the animation. This was really pretty stellar most of the time.Every show has ups and downs, but Layzner seems to my eye to maintain keyframe level details throughout even subtle moments in the show, to...say nothing of the stellar action scenes.While it cannot be denied that the high quality (strongest in the first 24 episodes) dips in the last handful of episodes as the show was apparently abruptly cut short after one of the producers/backers left the project; the 3rd OVA (which replaces the original final episode as an extended finale and is included in the blu ray set from Discotek Media) served as a proper and quite satisfying ending to the show.While I *have* seen better, Layzner certainly deserves to be placed among the greats in the Sci-Fi and Mecha pantheons of anime. If you’re a fan of any of classic real robot, space opera, or sci-fi shows like Gundam, VOTOMS, LotGH and their like, check it out. There’s a lot to love. say nothing of the stellar action scenes.While it cannot be denied that the high quality (strongest in the first 24 episodes) dips in the last handful of episodes as the show was apparently abruptly cut short after one of the producers/backers left the project; the 3rd OVA (which replaces the original final episode as an extended finale and is included in the blu ray set from Discotek Media) served as a proper and quite satisfying ending to the show.While I *have* seen better, Layzner certainly deserves to be placed among the greats in the Sci-Fi and Mecha pantheons of anime.

Within the decade, director Ryosuke Takahashi’s other works prior to Layzner included VOTOMS, with its focus on a deeply rotten and outright malignantly corrupt military bureaucracy, while Dougram adopted a more domestic sociological perspective, examining the way common people were affected by the colonisation of space. As the most popular franchise within the mecha genre, Gundam would have been the most direct market competitor, with its own thematic and narrative elements broadly comparable to both of these shows, but there is one specific...area in which Layzner retains a distinct identity from either Takahashi’s other works, or Gundam, and that is in its tone. More so than any specific details of narrative development, Layzner emphasises and materialises a harsh tone and atmosphere within its world, creating a pervasive sense of danger and insecurity at every moment, without reprieve. Sometimes within the mecha genre, the inside of the cockpit is treated as a safe retreat, a position for the pilot to assert their own authority and retain a sense of self, while exerting that will upon others, other times it is within the domestic setting that comfort is found, but Layzner makes the distinct decision to avoid providing comfort within any location in its universe.In its approach to worldbuilding, Layzner is remarkably subdued, infusing its Cold War setting with an appropriate sense of realism, an aspect which also applies to its technological design, most prominently seen through items like computers and radar systems, missiles and ships, all of which have a consistent and uncompromisingly rectangular, blocky form. This effectively encapsulates the post-detente era and its indefinite extension as depicted within the story, and secondarily it is able to add to the plausibility of the situation, not just in the design of its mechs but in all aspects that inform them. With this in mind, Layzner is not directly concerned with realism, it is only the byproduct of an intelligently restrained use of its setting. On a narrative level, the robots are a mechanism used for achieving goals, not a means unto themselves, and the overarching goal that Layzner is principally concerned with is inducing a sense of pure terror. Not in the sense of the horror genre, which centralises its entire sense of fear and danger through a single character, consequently relying on profoundly stupid characters, and even stupider strings of cliches in order to function. Layzner moves a step in the right direction, by instead endeavouring to make the very environment itself outright hostile to its characters’ survival, with dust storms on the surface of Mars completely obfuscating any sense of direction or vision, and the complete absence of any organic life on the planet can hardly be viewed as a reassuring omen. The only inorganic life found on the planet would be human life, and considering that the only other people are already dead, killed instantly with no possibility of escape, this too compounds the predicament and does little for the fighting spirit.As a furtherance of this hostility, the robotic weaponry used for humanity’s survival carries its own first-person identity. Hiroki Azuma has invoked the idea that science fiction anime depicts a classic philosophical grand narrative within circumstances that make its realisation impossible, and likewise, Layzner’s pursuit of scientific achievement, predominantly done within the context of geopolitical conquest and great power games, builds a universe in which this pursuit of scientific perfection is initiated, but with inherent qualities that make perfection an impossibility, and with far-reaching consequences. The computers that control the mechs within the series have their own thinking processes, giving information to the pilot, and recommending specific courses of action, with the unstated caveat that they are programmed in such a way that their decision making is deliberately limited and biased, at times counter to the pilot’s intentions, making the specific mecha on which humanity entrusts its own survival, unreliable and untrustworthy for that purpose. Found along this trajectory are the unmanned robots who hunt down the unarmed survivors of humanity, which only exemplifies the pure hostility inherent within the machinery. The unmanned robots (whose designs are inarguably the absolute coolest thing within the series) are not used to support a squad, they offer no tactical advantage, they are only used out of pure genocidal hatred, to kill unarmed survivors in the depths of the underground. Naturally, this sort of genocidal hatred is not limited to robots, in that respect the most deranged behaviour is found within the select few who infuse their organic bodies with wire and metal a la Giger, an option only accessible enough to those psychotic enough to accept their own destruction because they value the death of others more than their own sense of self. Christopher Bolton suggested that the fear of integrating with technology eroding the essence of humanity is one of the main concerns exhibited within the science fiction genre, but the character of Gosterro disregards that idea, outright enthused in himself when he says “I’m not even sure how much of me is human at this point”, spoken through a visage that lacks the elegance of Robocop, looking more like if an IED were a person, with metallic armour smashed into his face and eyes, with other parts of tissue and wire exposed openly as they contort in purely inhuman ways.This generally applied use of technology as a means to invoke its warlike terror is present throughout the entirety of the series, as it moves from Mars to the alien occupation of Earth, as the survivors begin a resistance movement in New York City, which has since been reduced to a deprived slum, with its black skyscrapers looking condemned and its citizens living in abject misery – aliens haven’t erected a giant pyramid outside Yankee Stadium yet, but apart from that they did accurately capture what it’s been like since Rudy Giuliani retired as mayor. Since the 1980s, which happens to be when Layzner was aired, the notion of high concept film has permeated the industry globally, and it is much easier to find something that fits into the concept of high concept than the opposite. In that respect, it’s difficult to truly find an area in which Layzner could be considered high concept, as it lacks the purely adrenaline-driven emotionally charged protagonists of other action franchises, nor the sort of deep examination of minutiae and internal lore that is designed to appeal to dedicated otaku. Layzner has one thing to its credit, and that is its tension and atmosphere, which is unrelentingly carried across each of its episodes. It may not be a popular thing to have such an uncompromisingly hopeless atmosphere, the lack of popularity of Takahashi’s later Blue Gender, which doubled down on injecting horror into a mecha setting would seem to corroborate the idea, although in this respect Layzner would be seen as ahead of the post-Lost Decade zeitgeist that facilitated that sort of narrative direction. It’s certainly not high concept in the manner in which it is typically understood, but Layzner, which may not have done much to help reassure or comfort any of its audience about their fears of MAD, did at least manage to orchestrate a poignant sense of insecurity within all that encapsulates its visual and narrative design and structure, creating an emotionally engaging piece that contrasts with the genre’s established conventions, and the asphyxiating pressure and fear that defines Layzner as a series is idiosyncratic and incomparable. area in which Layzner retains a distinct identity from either Takahashi’s other works, or Gundam, and that is in its tone.

Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33080/Brotherhood__Final_Fantasy_XV,"['""Brotherhood"" is a form of prequel to the as of now still upcoming game Final Fantasy XV.It\'s not a different form of telling the game\'s story, and therefor independent (sort of), but obviously held short, basically only long enough to spark interest for the game. It is not supposed to be a full length story anime.The episodes focus mainly on the dynamics and friendship of the group and the bonds between the main character Prince Noctis and his companions.Most episodes give insight on each character\'s backstory and purpose, doing greatly so.Each episode feels complete, and even if you didn\'t like this or that...character at the start, you might find yourself liking him a bit more after that character\'s assigned episode with well-written development.I sometimes find myself rewatching an episode or two, simply because it\'s enjoyable.As for the art and sound: It does its job. You won\'t be blown away - but that\'s not the point of this show anyway. Its focus lies elsewhere after all.Summary:An enjoyable mini-series with one clear purpose: character backstory. It\'s about the extent of what you can expect, but it\'s doing its job well. Being a fan of Final Fantasy is not required, since the episodes are basically complete on their own. character at the start, you might find yourself liking him a bit more after that character\'s assigned episode with well-written development.I sometimes find myself rewatching an episode or two, simply because it\'s enjoyable.As for the art and sound: It does its job.

Being a fan of Final Fantasy is not required, since the episodes are basically complete on their own.', 'Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV is a five episode short(special sixth episode limited to the special editions) that is supposed to be a treat for those like me who are anticipating the grand game. Now I have waited a decade for this beautiful game so seeing an animation short is pretty sweet. While I would like a full blown 25+ episode anime made for this game, I can see why this exists and its purpose. It\'s there to present the fans of the series who have been long anticipating this game to connect with the characters and build on them. The animation short does just that....It represents each character nicely. I find it to really deliver on that aspect. A prequel of sorts that tells the story from a more character-based perspective. This is really important as if we are going to be experiencing this game we would love to know more about these characters and who they are.The four characters have an episode of their own and each episode also shows their connections with each other. In particular, the episodes dedicated to characters other than Noctis always come back to showing their connection with Noctis.Story-wise, it does what it does. It tells the character\'s background story as an overhead of what is to come in the future. This requires them taking flashbacks to past moments in the lives of these characters, ultimately achieving the goal to present us with details on who they were before the present. And it is all done in a very sweet way. It certainly feels like ""an anime."" It\'s Final Fantasy XV in anime form. Characters all feel alive to me now after watching this.The art is gloriously beautiful. Honestly, I prefer the art in this to any of the stuff we have coming from the more established anime titles now(anime like Sword Art Online and Shingeki no Kyojin). It\'s just magnificent. Colors and lighting are just so flexible and vibrant. The vast detail in the scenes(especially the fight scenes) is perhaps where the animation and art is the best.Any music related to Square is an automatic 10/10. For anything related to Final Fantasy XV, it\'s beyond that. The music for this game was spectacular to begin with. Carrying over to the animated series just takes it even further. If there\'s one thing good about Final Fantasy XV, it\'s the music(although I love everything about it). The music is orchestrated divinely. Yoko Shimomura deserves a lot of credit for it.Overall, I have to say I extremely enjoyed it, as I do with anything related to Final Fantasy XV. If you are someone anticipating this game or are a newcomer to the franchise I recommend checking this out because it really lets you know the characters are alive. They have personalities and we have information as to who they are. It\'s not something you would watch if you are treating it like some seasonal anime, it\'s more like something for the fans to watch and understand.The characters won\'t have to be a worry for me while playing this beautiful game.

The animated short, for me, did a really good job at actually getting to know Noctis, Prompto, Ignis, and Gladio.', ""I have to admit, given Final Fantasy's bad record of anime/3D animation adaptations I wasn't particularly excited about these shorts. But when I heard the minor buzz that they were actually better than they had any right to be I decided to give them a shot. And I'm glad I did. While Kingsglaive shows off the effects and action that Final Fantasy XV is capable of these shorts focus more on the characters. And that gives them a tremendous advantage. Each episode is focused on a different character, apart from episode one which establishes the basics of their relationships. These shorts are only about fifteen...minutes long so they don't have time to show us too much and instead focus on one aspect of their personalities. The focus at all times is on their relationship with Noctis. Episode 2 shows how Prompto and Noctis became friends despite his being a filthy peasant, episode 3 shows how Gladio came to respect Noctis despite his being a bit of a spoiled brat, and episode 4 is about Ignis' attempts to educate/understand Noctis.

Noct is a moody brat, Prompto is a cheerful bishounen, Ignis is a wet sponge and Gladiolus is a big guy who doesn't know how to wear a shirt. All of them...just feel like a bunch of archetypes thrown together for the sake of variety rather than a proper company of friends who share a history. They go through a couple of pretty personal interactions but that's it, otherwise you could claim they met each other yesterday and it wouldn't feel much different, I feel like having some interesting banter and more real friendship moments could've helped to change that.Otherwise there's little going on in this story-wise, there are some plot points that might be relevant to the game but I don't know of them so pretty much all I got out of this is a short road trip filled with flashbacks providing insights for the characters and occasional glimpse of the world surrounding them. Each individual story was bit of a bland plot template with FFXV characters drawn on top so that wasn't exactly an interesting watch.All character designs themselves are painfully boring, I don't know why but everyone seems to be opposed to characters wearing something other than lame black outfits most of which reflect their personality in the most blatant way possible. Doesn't help that a lot of the time animation is underwhelming and stiff with character art eventually having a stroke thanks to designs being quite detailed and not animation friendly. One thing show does really well however are backgrounds, they're all quite nicely drawn and composed, almost to a point where I'd say it's worth watching just to look at how nice they are.To summarize it's a mediocre show with nothing going for it aside from the gorgeous background art. just feel like a bunch of archetypes thrown together for the sake of variety rather than a proper company of friends who share a history.

While I have some things to critique, overall they exceeded my expectations (by far) and served their purpose (i.e. got my hyped for the game).The story is what you would expect from a FF game/spin-off (or prequel, in this case)--but in my opinion, I personally like this story more than others from preceding games. It has a uniqueness I can't quite delineate--in fact, it might just be Noct as a character that draws me in, as opposed to, say, Tidus (lol citing basically the only other FF game I've invested any sort of time into). Despite the subtle cliché basis...that comes from FF as a whole, the fact that Noct is a character I've come so quickly to care about is enough to make the story feel, from what we were given, well composed.The art, while I have no complaints about it particularly (considering I normally prefer the hand-drawn style), was nothing to flaunt. I almost wish (and I know this probably wouldn't have been feasible) that these shorts were in the beautiful CGI style that the game demo advertised. Again, that's just my preference, but it was what I was sort of expecting (given that I did no research whatsoever before diving into watching these shorts).Overall, I'd certainly recommend these shorts to anyone planning or contemplating buying FFXV. After playing the demo I was already pretty excited for the release, but this little mini-series gives a lot more information as to our main characters in the game and their backstories. that comes from FF as a whole, the fact that Noct is a character I've come so quickly to care about is enough to make the story feel, from what we were given, well composed.The art, while I have no complaints about it particularly (considering I normally prefer the hand-drawn style), was nothing to flaunt.

I'm deep into FFXV now and I heard this series gives you a greater appreciation for the characters. Basically, it goes into some little vignettes in the past about each member of the party, but it doesn't really show anything major. Prompto loses weight as a kid, Gladiolus gains respect in training Noctis, Ignis gains respect in taking care of Noctis, Noctis gets revenge on a lamia thing that killed his mom. Out of the four, Noctis' story is the most interesting as something of consequence actually happens. It would have been cool to see further into...the other 3's backstories but I'm guessing this is either explored in the game or will be explored further. Overall, a decent show that will give you a little more appreciation for the characters you play as, as the game does kinda throw you right in expecting who these characters are. the other 3's backstories but I'm guessing this is either explored in the game or will be explored further.

It does well in what it sets out to do, which is to serve as a supplement to the game.Story: 5/10 MediocreThe central plot itself isn\'t very exciting, Noctis is to be married as some sort of peace agreement with Niflheim and must go on a long road trip to meet up with his bride so they can protect the fate of the world. The majority of screentime is devoted to banter and bromantic moments...between the main cast  ( I mean what else do you get when you send four hot guys on a roadtrip). There are some fight scenes where you get to see the awesome weapons the guys have but they are short and only exist to create an actual plot in between the character interactions. For 3 out of the 5 episodes something happens to one of the main characters which triggers a flashback on how they become friends with Noctis and the entire episode is spent in that flashback. Not saying this is necessarily bad but its very clear that the central plot exists just to tie the flashbacks together and create a story.Art: 7/10 GoodAll the main characters are designed to be good looking and are enjoyable to look at. The backgrounds are beautiful and diverse and the animation is fluid enough. However nothing about the art in this series is above average. The main characters do not get much expression and at times appear stiff. As a result I found the characters rather bland compared to other anime I\'ve watched. I tend to enjoy more over the top expressions but some may prefer the more scaled back emotional displays. The art is solid and is no way bad enough to hinder the viewing experience but is nothing special either.Sound: 6/10 FairFirst off I have to say the video games OST is much better than the anime\'s but that\'s to be expected with the anime only being 5 episodes. I\'m a sucker for piano music so I enjoyed those bits quite a lot (the main theme is my favorite out of the soundtrack). I am by no means a music genius so take my opinion in this section with a grain of salt, but I didn\'t find much of the music to really enhance the scenes for me. It had the classic danger music when an enemy appeared but no songs that had me thinking to myself ""this is awesome"". The voice acting was good but average, I like Prompto\'s voice the most. The majority sounded like the typical anime male to me.Character: 7/10 GoodBrotherhood is all about the characters. The goal of this series was to provide background information about the characters relationship with one another and in that they succeeded. It is almost crucial to watch this anime if you have any interest in playing the video game because it gives much more depth to the characters relationships than what is provided in the game. The game sort of just plonks you down on a roadtrip with these four guys with little explanation. It made me care much more about the characters after seeing the anime. Prompto is the most interesting character in my opinion and his episode was my favorite. However all the characters seem to fall into a stereotype. Prompto is the happy go lucky comedic relief, Ignis is the serious silent one,  Gladiolus is the gruff but caring older brother type and Noctis is the distressed pretty boy. They are still enjoyable but if you\'re looking for unique characters you won\'t find them here.Enjoyment: 6/10 FairI started playing Final Fantasy XV and heard about the anime and figured I would give it a watch. I\'m glad I did so because it let me appreciate the characters and gave me an actual sense of why I was on a road trip with four hot guys who screamed bromance. Prompto\'s backstory made me laugh and was the best episode in my opinion. The others were interesting enough to keep my interest and enhance my experience. One thing the anime did right was the length, the episodes put together equal about an hour. So whether you enjoy it or not, it doesn\'t waste much of your time.Final Verdict: 6/10 FairIf you plan on watching this anime by itself I don\'t think you would enjoy it very much. There is no ""ending"" that leaves you satisfied since its basically a prequel to the video game. In order to enjoy this anime the most I would watch it as a companion to the video game.

Choujigen Game Neptune The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16157/Choujigen_Game_Neptune_The_Animation,"[""It’s one thing when you are a fan of a video game that all of a sudden has been confirmed to have an anime adaptation and feel nothing but contempt and frustration in the reasoning why they would bother. However, when your game is already one that acts like an anime, you think to yourself that this will already be a slam dunk based on how it was born to become an anime show in the first place. So likewise, I was in the same mindset going into this. What I got in the end for Neptunia the Animation was nothing but partial disappointment that...can only be described as a wasted potential for a series that had a lot going for it in terms of comedy and parody.Neptunia plays off as your typical moe show with cute girls in suggestive positions. I can understand people passing it off as another generic moe show—not knowing that the Neptunia games themselves are parodying those types of moe tropes. The parody included in this adaptation is just as charming and lovable in portraying the girls as consoles of past generations. However, given how the Neptunia games have endless hours of non-stop comedy in their fun dialogue, understandably, the show is limited due to its 13-episode running time. This points to the show’s main problem: It doesn’t go as far as the games in terms of quality comedy.It is nice to see the girls in full animation instead of just slightly animated portraits on-screen in your typical Visual Novel fashion. Still, sadly it doesn’t come off as underwhelming and average at best. When you compare the art to the show and the original game’s art done masterfully and beautifully by Tsunako, it’s not what you would call a great transition. The show's art can almost compare to Saturday morning cartoons where the colors look too bright and hardly have any excellent lush drawings like in the games. Calling the art to be “horrendous” or “terrible,” on the other hand, would be a stretch because, for what they’re worth, the fighting scenes are done relatively decent, and there are some moments where the art indeed does add to the humor.As any fan of Neptunia can all agree, every single character is funny and charming to look at and listen to their witty dialogues with one another. Neptune is an absolute joy to listen to, as always, with her hilarious and sarcastic personality that initially annoyed me. Eventually, I grew fond of it after a while. The tsundere princess herself, Noire, has some great laughs in her hilarious attempts to hide her side. One scene involving her stalker and showing many pictures of her alone was enough to send me howling on the ground and laughing. Our other main CPU, Goddesses Blanc and Vert are great together in how they always argue over such silly things. The side characters, which are the CPU candidates, have equal enough screen time to bolster some memorable scenes together, though really, could they have at least given us more of Rom and Ram? And finally, Plutia and her rather exciting alter-ego once again never fails to be as sadistically hilarious as usual with her perverted antics. You can’t go wrong with Hanazawa mixed with sadomasochism.This department has one crucial problem with the gushing about the characters themselves. There are hardly any other characters in the Neptunia universe that either don’t appear or aren’t shown very often. One of the best characters in the 2nd Neptunia game was NISA. Unfortunately, she is nowhere to be found, not even in a cameo appearance which is quite unfair considering that at least 5pb is shown only twice. The only reason for this is that they wanted to hold them off for a sequel because they haven’t appeared chronologically where the show is adapting, right?The plot for the show follows nearly every single game that has come out. The writers honestly try to put different spins on it by placing characters in various roles that they were initially suited for another one, i.e., Neptune doesn’t get transported to an extra dimension like in Victory. Yet, she still falls on Noire amusingly enough, and this time Plutia gets transported into their world instead of the other way around. At this point, it’s clear that the writers didn’t want to put their time and effort into fitting all 300+ hours combined of all three of the games and wanted to make one show that isn’t trying to be a point to point adaptation but instead represents the entire series as a whole in spirit. So with this in mind, many plot points in previous games aren’t shown or bothered with, which isn’t bothersome considering how some aren’t needed. Unfortunately, there are some points in the show where the rushed plots could’ve worked for the better.What makes the Neptunia series addictive and fun to play and experience? If you ask any fans, including myself, it sure isn’t for drama or profound moments in any of the games. Not only did they have the will and power to make a show into anything they wanted based on the core concept, but they decided to put in their effort in putting two or three episodes devoted to those two aspects I mentioned before. First off, the drama wasn’t very well-handled anyway in the previous games before Victory, which is by far the least serious of the bunch. Second, if you want to put drama into your moe comedy show, at least try to put more effort into making it believable and somewhat endearing. Granted, the episodes devoted to this aren’t that many, but it can leave a sour taste in your mouth regardless of the quantity of uninvolved drama thrown into you and expects us to be invested in it. Hell, there aren’t that many newly added comedic scenes that have not been seen before in any games, with only a select few that are somewhat amusing.Thankfully, all original voice actresses from the games are here and fill in their respective roles with the same amount of chemistry as in fun. Amai Isumi, once again, never fails to embark into dangerous territory in becoming the next queen of Tsundere voice acting. Rie Tanaka has perfect charisma whenever she works as Neptune and successfully fulfills Neptune as a larger-than-life character. With our two leading ladies getting out of the way, our supporting cast consists of Yui Horie, Kana Asumi, Rina Satou, Yui Ogura, Kaori Ishihara, Kana Hanazawa, and Eri Kitamura. All of them make for a terrific ensemble cast. You couldn’t have asked for better casting than all of them combined.To conclude my thoughts, Neptunia the Animation isn’t a terrible show to sit through. It’s one of the better video game adaptations out there, whether or not how much you care a lot for the medium in general. It is not something you would recommend to your friend if he wanted to get into the Neptunia universe firsthand. They’ll most likely think of it as nothing but pure moe pandering at its purest if they aren’t into that whole thing already. It is nothing more than pure fan service to the people who play the games to see the static portraits come to life before their eyes, even if the result isn’t as mind-blowing as previously expected. If you are a fan like me by chance, you could probably try to see what is in store and how it is taken in animation. You’re better off just firing off another new game, plus my fellow Neptunia brethren.Grade: C can only be described as a wasted potential for a series that had a lot going for it in terms of comedy and parody.Neptunia plays off as your typical moe show with cute girls in suggestive positions.

The only reason for this is that they wanted to hold them off for a sequel because they haven’t appeared chronologically where the show is adapting, right?The plot for the show follows nearly every single game that has come out. The writers honestly try to put different spins on it by placing characters in various roles that they were initially suited for another one, i.e., Neptune doesn’t get transported to an extra dimension like in Victory. Yet, she still falls on Noire amusingly enough, and this time Plutia gets transported into their world instead of the other way around. At this point, it’s clear that the writers didn’t want to put their time and effort into fitting all 300+ hours combined of all three of the games and wanted to make one show that isn’t trying to be a point to point adaptation but instead represents the entire series as a whole in spirit. So with this in mind, many plot points in previous games aren’t shown or bothered with, which isn’t bothersome considering how some aren’t needed. Unfortunately, there are some points in the show where the rushed plots could’ve worked for the better.What makes the Neptunia series addictive and fun to play and experience? If you ask any fans, including myself, it sure isn’t for drama or profound moments in any of the games. Not only did they have the will and power to make a show into anything they wanted based on the core concept, but they decided to put in their effort in putting two or three episodes devoted to those two aspects I mentioned before. First off, the drama wasn’t very well-handled anyway in the previous games before Victory, which is by far the least serious of the bunch. Second, if you want to put drama into your moe comedy show, at least try to put more effort into making it believable and somewhat endearing. Granted, the episodes devoted to this aren’t that many, but it can leave a sour taste in your mouth regardless of the quantity of uninvolved drama thrown into you and expects us to be invested in it. Hell, there aren’t that many newly added comedic scenes that have not been seen before in any games, with only a select few that are somewhat amusing.Thankfully, all original voice actresses from the games are here and fill in their respective roles with the same amount of chemistry as in fun. Amai Isumi, once again, never fails to embark into dangerous territory in becoming the next queen of Tsundere voice acting. Rie Tanaka has perfect charisma whenever she works as Neptune and successfully fulfills Neptune as a larger-than-life character. With our two leading ladies getting out of the way, our supporting cast consists of Yui Horie, Kana Asumi, Rina Satou, Yui Ogura, Kaori Ishihara, Kana Hanazawa, and Eri Kitamura. All of them make for a terrific ensemble cast. You couldn’t have asked for better casting than all of them combined.To conclude my thoughts, Neptunia the Animation isn’t a terrible show to sit through. It’s one of the better video game adaptations out there, whether or not how much you care a lot for the medium in general. It is not something you would recommend to your friend if he wanted to get into the Neptunia universe firsthand. They’ll most likely think of it as nothing but pure moe pandering at its purest if they aren’t into that whole thing already. It is nothing more than pure fan service to the people who play the games to see the static portraits come to life before their eyes, even if the result isn’t as mind-blowing as previously expected. If you are a fan like me by chance, you could probably try to see what is in store and how it is taken in animation. You’re better off just firing off another new game, plus my fellow Neptunia brethren.Grade: C"", ""Have you ever wanted to wake up in an anime world? Ever thought of going to a world where there's cute girls, cool technology, and having fun nearly all day every day? I'm not talking about dreaming about it but rather going into one. If I had a choice to journey to any world, it would be Gamindustri, a futuristic world where the fun almost never ends. Well, that's all fiction but there's one thing that came to reality...and that's the fact Hyperdimension Neptunia finally gets its own anime adaptation!The anime is based off of the game of the same name that debuted in 2010...as a role-playing game developed by Idea Factory. Apparently, it takes place in the world of Gamindustri where its land is dominated by cute girls who are able to transform into gorgeous young ladies in order to fight off enemies to their homeland. As for the series itself, it is composed of mainly a female cast with all sorts of character designs and personalities.The series takes place in Gamindustri that is divided by four regions - Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox. Apparently, there's a region goddess that rules its region. There used to be conflicts between each region but lately, they have reached a truce and now settles for peace. Yes, that means goodbye to war and hello to happiness.The show's title follows a main female character named Neptune (same name as the planet of the Solar System). She is the goddess of Planeptune. However, at most occasions, we see her as a cute and innocent child that is quite cheerful with her friends. At other times, she is also naïve, clueless, and seems to jump straight into action without thinking. In other words, she's the type of girl who rushes into action without a plan. (usually) Her transformation as Purple Heart though gives more much more mature appearance both physically and mentally.That's just one quarter of the iceberg though.There's also the tsundere Noire (Black Heart). Representing a more independent character, she often hide her cute side when people are not watching. And furthermore, she represents perhaps a perfect tsundere with her personality throughout the show. There's also Blanc as someone whom possesses a short temper with a foul mouth. At many occasions, she seems to only care about what's going around her but deep down truly does care about her friends. Finally, last but not least is Vert, a guardian of the land Leanbox whom is considered more of a mature lady. She can be seen as calm as well as being polite to many people. As now we have the four Goddeses in check, they are the central characters that makes Gamindustri as what it is today. As they are now at peace, their relationship are much better than what is assumed previously. The slight problem here might be what happened in the past that seems to be omitted from the series altogether. I have not played the games before but it would be nice to get a deeper insight on the planet's origins and backgrounds. However, the show makes it up with its lighthearted humor and relationships. Among its many characters, there's a sense of sisterly bond. Despite the fact that many of the characters sometimes gets into fights over pity things, it's clear that they deeply care for each other at important situations. A clear evidence of this is seen in the aftermath of one of the earlier battles and more so later on against more dangerous adversaries. Although most of the characters are appealing, they lack any sort of progression. The character interactions feels real though but sometimes leaves it off in ways that are too simple.Choujigen Game Neptune: The Animation follows more of a fantasy format so expect fantasy elements like the various creatures involved throughout each episode. Some of them are simple child's play while other brings more of a threat to the main characters. This can be seen in the earlier episodes when the Goddesses finds themselves in a complicated situation. Everyone tries to be a hero but not everything goes according to plan at first. Sometimes though, they have to rely on the younger generations to get them out of that sticky end. Even though some of these conflicts are presented as dangerous to the characters, there's also a sense of parody that crosses the line in them. This can be interpreted by the positions the characters gets stuck in with their lascivious figures shown at various camera angles. One other episode involving a 'torture' like scene can be viewed as a parody as one of the Goddesses gets a taste of her worst nightmare.The story involves the main characters but often times follows no direct linear story. There's some episodes connected together as a form of mini arc but most of them gets resolved rather quickly. Perhaps the pacing is a problem here at only 12 episodes but it often feels like the show is rushing into ideas. These ideas involves the girls doing battle against enemies, having fun, and interacting with one another mostly in a playful manner. After all, war between the regions are over and it's all peace now.As the series is dominated by a female cast, there's that sense of fan service coming in. Even the younger characters gets their own spotlights. These usually comes from the transformation scenes. The transformation sequences are designed and animated as being plastered with fan service. The scenes usually depict the girls torn to their underwear with their bodies glowing as their curves are focused at various camera angles. The aftermath of the transformation presents an outfit with much skin showing in a dangerous way. Of course, shows like Neptunia isn't the first show to follow these type of style in transformation sequences. Other series such as Sailor Moon, Tokyo Mew Mew, and Shugo Chara also follows a similar format in which young girls are destined with a gift. Just be aware though that if you're coming into the show fresh, get ready to be showered with fan service. It's not pervasive but can definitely raise some eyebrows.Surprisingly enough, some of the action scenes are impressive in the beginning. Perhaps this could involve the the threat of a certain antagonist in its earlier stages. However, this doesn't last too long because what follows later are a more degrading level of what originally was presented. Here I thought villains gets stronger and more dangerous in fantasy shows. Otherwise, the show traces this a bit backwards. The action itself in the show has some intense movements though. It's clear to see a large gap in power difference between the girls' regular selves and their transformation versions. The way they fight shows that they are capable of defending themselves and protect what they treasure. Each of them seems to have a different ability that matches their characters. Even the younger characters are capable of displaying their own powers with a dangerous outlook. It tells a story of 'don't judge a book by its cover'. In this case, that story comes true especially when the younger girls plays on the role of heroines themselves.Being labeled as a parody, expect plenty of comedy. There's the various cosplays, the humorous dialogues (some of them refer to a more suggestive way of speaking), and other gags. Fourth walls are also sometimes broken here and there. There's also a feast of moe and cutey moments involving the younger characters. A certain character in the show also has a cute hobby that she tries to hide from others but is discovered later on involving references to other shows such as Steins;Gate and K-On tracing back to the idea of various cosplaying. There's even a case of food feeding that can be seen as both humorous and also a bit erotic. The ending of almost every episode plays on a parody for a entertaining way of previewing. And as previously mentioned before, prepare for fan service as the series doesn't omit the beach episode complete with the curves and swimsuits. Overall, expect parody on top of parody like pouring ketchup.The animation gives off a very fantasy like theme. Gamindustri is designed to look futuristic and is exactly as that with its technology. The beasts and lands are colored with rich visuals and often or not makes it seem like a dream to be there. As this review mentioned before, I wouldn't mind going into this world and live out such a dream. The character designs are also created to give each character a different outlook of diversity. Furthermore, the characters after transformation presents that mature way in which we can instantly see after going through the sequences. Although everything looks and fits right, the series' craftsmanship in the art department feels quite generic and not too stable.If you have headphones, I would only plug them in for battle scenes and more touching moments. Otherwise, the OP song fits too much for a girly tone. Then, there's the various shutouts throughout some episodes. I find some characters' voices a bit itchy to the ears with their high pitched voices. Additionally, the OST of the comedy scenes sometimes is looked past with the repetitive comedy itself. However, do enjoy the battle OST though as they give a more intense sequence. The ED song can also raise some eyebrows with its animated scenes.Ultimately, Neptunia is a show that can attract you in an odd way. What I mean though is in a way that makes you want to forget but sometimes come back to remember what you've watched. There are occasions during the show where I hope to forget what I just saw but then later realize how fun it is. However, the repetitive comedy and fan service sometimes becomes a dull to watch. Furthermore, the story itself can turn down some folks if they are into a more concrete written plots. But still, if entertainment is your aim, then give Neptunia a shot. For me, this show is a fun ride; not an entirely memorable ride but had its fun moments. Ah, I would like to buy some ticket to a space rocket to fly to Gamindustri someday.

If only...."", 'As a big, humungous, obnoxious fan of the Hyperdimension Neptunia video games, I was overjoyed to hear that it was getting an anime adaption.Studio David had us believing that they were going to do pretty well by this adaption. And in the first few episodes, that’s the impression you get. But from there on, it all goes downhill. It’s unfortunate, but the end product turned out to be a bit of a rushed mess that only captured a fraction of what was so loveable about the games.The first thing that’s noticeably off about this adaption is the character designs. Tsunako, the original character...designer, is practically the master of detailed and attractive moe character designs. These designs don’t translate too well into this anime. The designs just don’t look as good as Tsunako’s. There were even some shots where the characters looked sloppy, uneven, and oddly proportioned. To be fair, it can be difficult to adapt designs from a game into an anime using a completely different character designer. But it isn’t as if it’s impossible. The anime adaptions of Tales of the Abyss and Persona 4 are two in particular that succeeded in looking very close to their original character designs. And AIC did a much better job of adapting Tsunako’s designs in the Date a Live anime.The animation is not bad, but nothing spectacular. There are some flashy transformation scenes that we’re treated with that are never to be seen in the later episodes. The backgrounds are bright and colorful, fitting with the spirit of the series. The fight scenes are very minimal, not serving as much excitement in terms of action.Another gripe I had with this adaption is how they portrayed the characters. The girls of Hyperdimension Neptunia are loveable and hilarious. There’s a girl out there for everyone to love: the tsundere, the yandere, the genki girl, the little sister character, the rich girl, and much much more. It’s true, they are typical anime archetypes that we’ve seen time and time again. But what made them fun was the comedic banter and playful interactions between the characters. In the anime, these interactions aren’t always as fun or funny as they were in the game.Not only that, but Studio David literally shoved two games worth of characters into a twelve episode anime. Yes, over twenty characters had to duke it out for screen time in an incredibly short show. So to remedy this, they gave the most popular characters, Noire, Neptune, and Nepgear the most screentime, while neglecting and sometimes outright ignoring other characters. Fans of the three most popular characters won’t mind at all, but it sucks for those of us who are bigger fans of the other characters.In the game, the girls may have been typical archetypes but they rocked it and even made fun of it several times. There’s no self-awareness in the anime so they just seem like generic characters, and to make it even worse the anime sometimes wants us to actually take it seriously. What is this sorcery!?The Neptunia games have always been about jokes, good fun, parody, and humor. But here we go with the melodrama in this anime. Cringeworthy melodrama at that. The Neptunia games have never been about being serious. Even in moments that seemed serious, someone would crack a joke or do something silly to remind us “Hey! This is a parody you know!” The melodramatic moments aren’t handled well, and they stand awkwardly next to whole episodes that involve silly humor and jokes. It’s off putting and it’s just not Neptunia.Here’s a fun fact: One possible ending in the second game was one that was incredibly shocking, dramatic, way too serious, and a bit disturbing. The fans hated it so much that Compile Heart chose not to include anything like it in the third game. Okay. So it’s been established that the fans don’t like that sort of thing. So what made Studio David think it was a good idea to put seriousness in the anime as well?My last gripe with this adaption is the overall execution. It’s a mostly original story, only loosely following the events of the second and third game while adding some new scenarios. This gave the story an enormous amount of potential. Unfortunately, as stated above, this story had no flipping clue what it wanted to do with itself. It jumps from serious to silly at the drop of a dime. It can’t decide if it wants to be an action anime or a slice of life anime. Characters are severely neglected to give the three most popular characters screen time. In turn, we get characters who we meet for one or (if they’re lucky) a few episodes and then quickly forget about, such as CFW Trick, Linda, Abnes, and Anonydeath, who were hilarious characters in the game. Their origins don’t resemble what they were in the game; in fact, they are sometimes not even mentioned at all. So they appear then disappear and we aren’t supposed to care or even notice. Good god, I could have directed this anime while drunk.Now despite my harsh criticisms, I did enjoy this anime a little bit. And it does have some redeeming qualities. The voice acting is as good as it’s ever been, with most of the voice actors reprising their roles from the game. The soundtrack is a mix of original tracks with the splendid music from the game.  The transformations, though only appearing a few times in the beginning are flashy and much nicer than the simple transformations they introduced in the second and third game.There is a small sliver of the Neptunia spirit in the episodes that focus on parody and silliness. The video game references and jokes are still there and although the animation is subpar, it is nice to see your favorite Neptunia characters up and at ‘em. After all, the cutscenes in the games were mostly visual novel-esque scenes.Overall, this adaption is not good but not terrible either. It’s hard to recommend this to anyone who isn’t already a diehard fan of Neptunia. One who is just being introduced to the series through the anime might not have a positive impression of the series at the end. The second and third games would be an ideal starting place if you’re looking to get in to Hyperdimension Neptunia and experience it in its original, silly, over the top glory. If you’re going to watch the anime first anyway, it’s imperative that you keep an open mind and not write off the entire franchise due to this anime.

(mk-2 & Victory)I LOVE this anime, i think they did a great job mixing the plots of the games together to create a comprehensive story line for an anime that i believe is probably only ever going to have this one season.  The art is beautiful and vibrant, and the character designs are as close to the game as possible without Tsunako doing the...animation alone. The sound quality is great and it\'s very funny and entertaining.As for the drawbacks, there are only 2 that really stand out to me. This is NOT a series you can just pick up just because....because the characters personalities and the humor don\'t make a lot of sense without playing the games.The second Drawback is the English dub....at least for me, as a fan of the games. Because, They replaced 4 different characters actresses, and they chose to do an English dub for a song, which is one of my pet peeves when it comes to anime.  the fact that that song also happens to be  the song for the opening sequence of one of the games, makes it even more annoying to me.And lastly, the first thing i thought when i watched the English dub of the anime was ""wow, i just noticed that the more Purple Heart talks, the less cool she sounds."" Because in the games, she doesn\'t talk all that much, and when she does, she\'s usually doling out either a good passive-aggressive insult, or passing on a few words of friendship and wisdom. So hearing her talk so much in the anime took some getting used to, but i understand why she talks more, it would be boring if The main character who by all standards, in her human form, is a regular chatty Cathy, were to stop talking when she transformed into her Goddess form.Altogether, i give it a 9/10 for fans of the game, and a 8 out of 10 for others. animation alone.

Now, I'm not even going to start by sugar-coating things: Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation is a dirty mess. Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation represents everything you shouldn't do with an anime that's supposed to be lighthearted and cute. It tries so hard to succeed and please that it ends up setting itself to being a failure.There is little to no plot in this show. The basic premise is that four young girls...are goddesses in a planet called Gamindustri, and each of them rule over a country (all of them being really blatant parodies of video game companies). We follow these girls and their little sisters and friends going through adventures to solve whatever kind of weird thing is troubling Gamindustri at the time in mini-arcs that usually last between one and three episodes.One thing I do need to praise is the parody aspect. If you are at least a little familiar with anything video game related, you are bound to catch a few of them, since they range from subtle to blatant - in one of the episodes, the girls go to a theme park in the country of Lowee that is pretty much an interactive Super Mario game. The fact that every single character personificates a video game developing company from their design to aspects of their personalities, making Gamindustri a gigantic parody of the real life game industry, is original and pretty clever.In fact, Hyperdimension Neptunia would have been good if it focused more on that instead of spending 90% of the time in a maze of indecisiveness. The show simply jumps from cute slice of life activities to dramatic teary scenes to a full-detail shot of a girl being tentacle raped by... Anything that can possibly tentacle-rape someone. These changes are so abrupt and unbalanced that it confuses the viewer, and we end up in confusion, not sure if we should be taking what we are seeing seriously or not.It doesn't help how extreme Neptunia is in every single thing it tries to approach. The slice of life scenes are moeblob-ish, saccharine segments with boring humor that could easily be part of a bad children's show if it wasn't for the fanservice. The drama is out of place and forced. The ecchi is extremely vulgar and sometimes downright disgusting - the girls are trapped in ropes half-naked, and for some reason moaning and blushing with their asses shoved on the screen, in their sexy, mature goddess forms? Well don't worry, conveniently enough they can't keep their transformations for too long so you get to see them in their lolilicious human appearences in the same situation! There isn't a single tasteful fanservice scene to be seen. The parody aspect is swallowed by this huge mess.As if to complement this, the characters are... Extremely poor. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that they exist only to fanservice purposes and to be moe in an extremely obnoxious and forced manner. The four protagonists especially are just literal blobs of moe without anything else to them. Forget character development, look at how moe-moe-kyun-kawaii Neptune is! Forget personality, look at how big Vert's boobs are! They're so forcefully cute that sometimes it's unbearable, to the point of me watching half of an episode on mute due to one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen (Peashy) getting a bigger amount of screen time. The villains are also all annoying and flat, with the exception of Rei Ryghts, the only one of the bunch with a decent motivation and enjoyable personality.But are all, literally all of them that bad?, you ask. No, they aren't. Two of them in particular stood out for me: the goddess from another dimension, Plutia, and Neptune's caring little sister, Nepgear. They actually felt genuinely cute. Plutia was really entertaining to watch in action, and Nepgear was very likeable and had the best character development in the show. The goddesses' little sisters also surprisingly display some growth, even more than our protagonists.The character designs are honestly where the show truly excels. Not an exaggeration to call some of these my favorite character designs ever; all of the girls LOOK absolutely adorable and unique in their own way, and they also nicely embody which video game company they represent. The goddesses' transformed designs are pretty fanservicey, but they look neat as well. The animation is also pretty crisp and beautiful. It kind of saddens me that all of this went to waste on such a poor show. Sound was ok, some good BGM tracks, a catchy ED song. The VA cast was top notch, but most of the voices were too forcefully cute to be truly appreciated.In the end, did I actually enjoy Hyperdimension Neptunia? Well, sometimes I did. But do I enjoy watching lolis as shallow as a teaspoon of water walking around doing forced stupidities for the sake of moe? Do I enjoy gross, raunchy fanservice pushed towards my face every ten seconds? Do I enjoy the things that composes 90% of this show? No. So I didn't for the most part. You might if you're into this kind of stuff, but I can think of at least ten shows that did whatever Neptunia tried to do much, much better.I hope we won't see much more shows like Hyperdimension Neptunia: The Animation coming out anytime soon. Because they aren't whole series, but more like aberrants that tried to build itself with parts of others, but in the end, couldn't get to stand up.Scores/tl;drStory: 4/10 - Plot divided in smaller arcs, all stuffed with forced slife-of-life, moe and ecchi, tossing the parody aspect aside.Art: 9/10 - Gorgeous character designs, fluid animation. Sound: 6/10 - Pretty fair.

And excuse this long post/rant, I need to get it out of my system. =__=""Choujigen Game Neptune, the only anime that has really made me disgusted and pissed off (Since the 2nd half of Sword Art Online). I had to even drop this anime, because I seriously could not handle it.I don\'t even mind getting mindf*cked by something like RahXephon or Evangelion (Which totally don\'t...make sense by the way).There are so many gripes I have with this anime, it\'s not even funny. Seriously.I\'ve been hearing positive reviews about the game, sayings it\'s great and funny, however this \'anime\' adaption, is just really pathetic.Am I watching some sort of super censored hentai? Because what happens a lot, is that the characters are so pathetically weak, that they make \'iiyaah\' cries like every 5 bloody second. Why?It tries hard to be a comedy, but I couldn\'t even smile at any of it, and I was watching this anime with moderately high expectations, was expecting an anime that was comedic, fun to watch, and something that wouldn\'t annoy the \'shaizen\' out of you.Also the characters, why the hell does so much damn drama need to be in an anime about these \'happy go round\' looking girls? And Neptune? Oh Christ, she is one of the most annoying characters I\'ve ever seen, it\'s like,""How on the planet Namek, did you become a Goddess?""Isn\'t this an anime about 4 \'Goddesses\' trying to maintain the treaty for peace? I understand that there has to be some form of enemy for plot, but come on! They didn\'t have to do the anime the way it is.Like that one scene where they are trapped in some form of \'Anti-Magic\' pyramid, was it really (REALLY REALLY) necessary to pose them in some what of a sexual position?I will make a comment on the art however, it is pretty to watch, vibrant, many nice looking colours, and yet, with all this visual appeal, it was so disappointing. I really do like the art, I really do, and yet even with a pretty exterior, it cannot hide how hideous it really is.Let\'s do a Character summary shall we?Neptune - The annoying lazy one, can make you go insane. Could of been portrayed better, in my opinion. Nuff said.Blanc - Her character to be both \'quite\' then \'loud\' was really poorly executed, and I\'m thinking it was her character personality design flaw, or just maybe her voice actor.Vert - She was some what okay, was mildly surprising she liked Online Games. She\'s an alright character.Noire - In all honesty, Noire was the character I didn\'t mind watching the most, surprisingly. She did not seem annoying, nor did she make me want to throw a rice ball at a fish.Forget the little sisters and the \'Villain\'.In all of this, seriously, don\'t watch this, it\'s not all \'cutesy\' as it seems, there is a lot of unnecessary drama, and a lot of \'iyaa\' type screaming.And I know I am bashing this anime, a lot. I don\'t care.I\'d give the game a go, just to see if this is the anime the  game needs, but being a Japanese Title on PlayStation 3 (and with pretty much 100% expectancy to not come to the English speaking audience), I would have absolutely no clue on what is happening.Sorry again about the rant.

(-__-)', '*This review comes from a fan of the video games.*When an anime of Hyperdimension Neptunia was announced, I got excited. I’m a fan of the series (except for the first game; that game was terrible) so naturally I was really looking forward to the anime. The games played well, the dialogue scenes had great graphics, and the characters were likeable for the most part. Depending on if you’re a fan of moe or not, you can even say the voice acting is a strong point.  However, the gameplay is what truly kept me playing the games. Western reviewers even praised the RPG gameplay of...the latest game, Victory, when Western reviewers are usually very critical of Japanese RPGs.  So how would the anime turn out without one of the core aspects? What we got was what the fans wanted, but it may alienate those who are unfamiliar with the series.Story: The series itself is a parody of the video game industry. There are 4 goddesses who rule over 4 countries: Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox. Those countries represent the video game companies Sega, Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. With the exception of Sega, these companies fight the modern day “console wars”. The console wars formed the basis of the first Hyperdimension Neptunia game, but in the anime, they chose to focus on the second game, mk2, and Victory, the third game. At the start of the anime, the 4 countries sign a peace treaty that prevents the taking of Shares (the source of power in the world) by force. So you can say that the story of the anime is split into mk2’s arc and Victory’s arc. Story has never been the game’s strongest point and, unfortunately, the same goes true for the anime. The series is at its best when its being what it’s supposed to be: a parody. So drama does not fit well into the series and that’s where my problem with the story lies. At times, it’s too serious when it really shouldn’t be. A couple of times the drama does work, but for the most part, it really doesn’t fit in. The series is actually at its best when there is no story and the characters are just messing about and making references to the video game industry. The overall story the anime tells is half-decent but it’s certainly not the best story ever.Characters: The characters can either make or break the series. Depending on taste, you can love the cast, or hate it. The 4 main characters: Neptune (Planeptune), Noire (Lastation), Blanc (Lowee), and Vert (Leanbox) are the goddesses who rule over their respective countries. The three former goddesses have younger sisters who are also a big part of the plot. The main characters don’t get a ton of character development in the games and the same runs true in the anime. If you don’t like them at face value, then the chances of them growing on you are pretty low. The characters who actually get the most development are the aforementioned younger sisters. The series’ most popular characters are Neptune, Noire, and Nepgear, Neptune’s younger sister. It was clear that they focused a lot on these three characters throughout the show while putting the other characters aside. Although Blanc and Vert are main characters, they get less screen time than Nepgear, who’s a supporting character. Standout characters from the anime are Nepgear and Plutia/Pururut who make big impacts in the show. The other characters are hit or miss depending on what kind of characters you like.Art: The art style is an appropriate moe type. The characters are well-drawn and designed. The games do look significantly better though. I was initially disappointed with the art style but it grew on me over time. The animation is average for most of the show but more focus is put on the action scenes.Sound: The soundtrack does a decent job in being appropriate in their scenes. There are a couple of standout tracks like “Ryuusei no Bifrost”, which played during the fight scene of the first episode, and “Kirihirake! Glazy Star!” which played at the beginning of the third episode. These two themes are the openings from the first and second game respectively. The series is known for its great opening songs and “Dimension tripper!!” does a good job living up to expectations. The voice acting cast is quite prestigious, featuring big names like Rie Tanaka, Yui Horie, Eri Kitamura, and Kana Hanazawa. You may or may not like their performances though; it all depends on how much you like moe voices. If I had to choose standout roles, it would be Asami Imai as Noire, Yui Horie as Nepgear, and Yuu Kobayashi as Rei Ryghts. They handle their roles appropriately and are believable. The sound effects are nothing too special for an action anime.Enjoyment: How much you enjoy this anime will likely depend on if you like moe, have knowledge of the video game industry, and if you have played the games. If you said yes to all three, then you’ll probably like what you watch. That’s the best way to get the most enjoyment out of this show. One thing I do need to point out is that this series does contain quite a bit of fanservice throughout. Fanservice is old news to fans of the games but seeing them animated instead of CG scenes gives them new meaning. Fanservice is something you need to factor in as well.I tried to be as unbiased as possible when I wrote this review. This is not the perfect adaptation of the games that I was hoping it would be but it represents the series faithfully. It was still an enjoyable watch for a fan of the series even without gameplay. As a fan of the series you’re going to see a different score on my list. But this is the score I’m giving for this review.Story: 5/10Characters: 7/10Art: 8/10Sound: 8/10Enjoyment: Dependent on a variety of factors.

Personally: 8/10Overall: 7/10', 'Before I start this review, it should be stated that I was already a notable fan of the video games beforehand.When I heard that my favorite video games which had a few credible names working on them: Keiji Inafune and Nobuo Uematsu with the Earthbound Papas, I was thrilled! The only immediate problem for someone walking straight into the anime is that it makes no effort re-introducing a newcomer to the lore and characters of Gamindustri. That was probably done for several reasons, one such being to not keep any newcomers from the video games. Still, I fear it can cause some confusion and...avert the attention of someone who might\'ve been interested in the show.On the other hand, one might be able to catch on to who the characters and their respective countries are supposed to represent. For the reader to get the gist: the different countries of Gamindustri (pronounced ""Game Industry""), are satirical representations of Sega (Planetune), Playstation (Lastation), Nintendo (Lowee), and XBox (Leanbox). The story of the anime does a clever mix of each of the video games\' stories. The ultimate plot being an enigmatic force working to take revenge on the countries of Gamindustri.The anime was very well done and for those who enjoy seeing transformation sequences, humor, and every now and again a touchy scene will definitely enjoy this show. Again, the story was scored slightly lower on account of no detailed explanation of Gamindustri\'s universe. If you ignore that or are already a fan of the video games, the anime is very enjoyable. The art is true to the games and the sound is as well. The opening sequence changes in terms of animation at some point, but still has the same amazing song that adds to my pride as a programmer. The characters are always fun to watch and the show itself is a good time.One might not appreciate every aspect of the show, but it depends on your tastes. It\'s not the world\'s greatest masterpiece either, but it\'s probably not intended as such. That being said, this show come highly recommended. avert the attention of someone who might\'ve been interested in the show.On the other hand, one might be able to catch on to who the characters and their respective countries are supposed to represent.

It\'s not the world\'s greatest masterpiece either, but it\'s probably not intended as such. That being said, this show come highly recommended.', 'I\'ll be honest here, If you haven\'t played the game(the anime is based of a game) for this series then odds are you wont like it. The story isn\'t deep, there little to no character development and somethings are just plain wacky.Then why did I give it such a big score? If you played the game then you already know what your walking into. The game doesn\'t even take itself seriously, it continuously breaks the 4th wall and its just one huge gag while it tries to be funny.For people like me who have played the game then this anime is the best thing...ever because we get to see the character animated and moving around, not just a picture of them talking on screen. This is why the people who have played the game give it good scores, because it gave us what we wanted out of the series we already know. If you haven\'t played the game then don\'t take it seriously. If your where looking for a silly anime then you just found it.The story is centered around Neptune and her younger sister Nepgear as they try to save gamindustri alongside there friends. Its a pretty normal plot with a faction trying to conquer the world while the heroes tries to stop them. The story is just arcs from the game animated into a couple of episodes with a few changes. We get most of the characters ranging from the second game(MK2) to the third(victory). It was fun seeing Linda(underling) and pirachu walking around.""Even villains can use the power of friendship!""Things like this are what makes this series so enjoyable. It ranges from phrases like that to trying to get they\'re friends naked on the beach to trying to defeat killer foods. The neptunia cast is pretty large having a punch of different characters that accompany the protagonist through her journey. Some characters appear throughout the series that really get your hairs up if you know them from the game. You probably wont feel anything if your just watching the anime.Another thing you would notice if you played the game is that they incorporated the game\'s music and themes into the soundtrack for the anime. It was great hearing those catchy tones again. it really set the mood for the anime. Yet again one would feel indifferent towards this if they haven\'t played the game.The art is a 10/10 with no question. Sure there are far better animations out there but thats not whats important. Just seeing the characters speak and move around, have their hands and just be themselves is enough. Thats the prime reason why I watched the anime.The anime to me was like icing on the cake for the game. If you played the game then this is your dessert. if you only watched the anime then your just eating Icing alone. Not that fun. If you are thinking of getting into the neptunia world then start of with the second and third game of the series. Overall I found this series to be great, a fun watch. ever because we get to see the character animated and moving around, not just a picture of them talking on screen.

Overall I found this series to be great, a fun watch.', ""I've always been kind of interested in the Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise, though I never checked out the games. There were people I knew who stood by them as fun and entertaining games well worth exploring, but the abysmal critical reception the series received virtually everywhere in the west made me reticent. Ultimately I decided to put my gaming budget toward what I perceived to be surer things, but I have long wondered if I'm missing out. That's why, when I heard about Hyperdimension Neptunia the anime, I was rather excited for it. I figured it would be a good chance to get a glimpse of...this series and finally see what it was all about. Having followed it for a while, I'd say it's hardly terrible, but at the same time I'm not really sure it'd be fair to make any conclusions about the series of games based on what we have here.Neptunia comes to us from David Production, a fairly young studio who I have almost no familiarity with at least when it comes to main production credits. If this show is any indicator, they do pretty solid work. The show looks good. Art is strong, animation smooth. The action is appealingly slick and the characters are well detailed. Sound is good too; it's got a great voice cast who all turn in solid enough performances. The opening theme teeters on the brink of being overly sugary for me, but retains enough charm that I don't often skip, and the ending theme is pretty fun. All in all, I can only think of good things to say about the production.The problem for Neptunia comes in the story and characters. The characters, really just aren't very well established. I know this is a game tie in, and I'm sure it expects that a majority of the audience will know and love the characters already, but still it could have done a better job of introducing everything for newcomers. Characters are introduced suddenly and sometimes it's not really clear who they are or why they're relevant. Only after watching for a while do you get a sense of who the characters are, which makes it hard to connect with them. The characters on their own are a distinctive enough bunch on their own, I guess. it's kind of hard to judge them, but they're likable and most of the designs are pretty sharp and appealing. At the same time, going strictly by what the show covers, there's nothing really especially memorable here character wise.The story is equally frustrating. The world the characters occupy is not very well defined just going by this anime. Evidently it's all supposed to be an allegory for the gaming industry, as some names make especially clear, but the meaning of what unfolds and how it relates to anything is hard to determine. The story sort of feels simultaneously lightweight and impenetrable and just isn't ultimately very compelling. I'm kind of really not sure what to make of it. It's passable, I guess, and I don't feel like its insulting my intelligence or anything, it just doesn't really do much of interest.All that said I can't say I disliked the time I spent watching Neptunia. No, it's well made and kind of fun. It can be funny and charming at times, which really helps make it a more enjoyable experience. It'll depend on personal taste of course. This anime is all about moe and ecchi anime girls, so if that kind of stuff usually makes you roll your eyes with contempt, I can't imagine you'll have much use for this at all. Again, I imagine this show is much better for fans of the game, and not being familiar with it is probably where a lot of my problems with it come from. At the same time, I strongly believe that anime series should be able to stand completely on their own just fine regardless of the source material. This anime doesn't fully do that, which takes away from it all for me even if it can often be a relatively fun watch. As such, the best I can give it is a seven, and only a mild recommendation for those interested who aren't already fans. this series and finally see what it was all about.

They are solid games, albeit with some issues, and their Lily system is one of the best things in any video game. Seriously, more games need a system where yuri makes the characters stronger. In 2013 there was an anime version, separate in storyline from any of the games. It was handled by David Production, the same studio behind Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure. It\'s only the second anime I\'ve seen where they were responsible for the main production. How well does it hold up?Story:The Console Wars are coming to an end in the great land...of Gamindustri as the four Goddesses, Neptune, Noire, Blan and Vert, sign a treaty of friendship that will prevent their nations from taking Shares from one anther by force. Thereby allowing all of them to work for the betterment of their own nations. But all is not well. During a joint excursion with Neptune, Noire is forced out of her HDD form by an unknown force. Meanwhile, an activist named Kiseijou Rei is trying to stir people against the Goddesses.Actually, the narrative blends elements from several different Neptunia games, mostly the second and third and that\'s the biggest problem with it. The games themselves took several hours to flesh out events that get glossed over in one or two episodes of the anime. As a result, the anime feels like a watered down version of those two games. The story would have worked better if they\'d stuck to one game plot or done something completely original. The anime also has some uncomfortable moments surrounding its usage of the character, Trick. Which is kind of a weird choice both because he is needlessly gross and since, in the game, he\'s part of a group of four and the other three never appear in the anime. It would be a bit like Marvel having the Human Torch appear in a big comic event where the rest of the Fantastic Four are neither seen nor mentioned.To the series\' credit, it does maintain its light-hearted aesthetic fairly well and there are a lot of good comedic moments. I will also give it credit for doing a decent job of tying the two game plots together and it mostly deals with the events that it lifts from those games decently enough, in spite of the more limited time frame. While they were much stronger in the games they aren\'t at all badly done here.Characters:The character portrayals are actually really faithful to the games. Neptune, Noire, Blanc, Vert, Nepgear, Uni, Rom, Ram, Compa, IF, Plutia, Peashy and the villains are all recognisable as themselves, even though you spend less time with them. I do respect that they left out some of the side characters instead of trying to cram all of them into the series just for the sake of having them. There are also a lot of well done character moments. I do like the idea of the younger sisters being ready friends while their elder sisters have to move past old hostilities. Even though it could have been handled better.That isn\'t to say that the characters are done perfectly, however. There are some moments that just don\'t make sense, like Uni blaming Nepgear when their sisters are in trouble. In the actual game it made sense. In the anime the justification for it is really flimsy. There\'s also a plot point about Nepgear, Uni, Rom and Ram being unable to transform into their HDD forms yet and having to overcome their own inner struggles first. With Nepgear, we see her actual struggle and the way she overcomes it. It actually works pretty well. The other three just start transforming with no real explanation because... they discovered the true meaning of yuri, I guess.Art:The only real problem with the art is that it gets really fan-servicey at times. To be fair, that\'s also a problem that persists in the games and the art here doesn\'t look that different. I will also give both the anime and games credit for having the good sense to keep the fan-service scenes limited to the older characters. The anime looks very similar to the games\' cut scene animations with the same vibrant, colourful style and character designs. I have to give it credit there. It mimics the game\'s style very well. I will give the anime credit for having really well done action sequences, too.Sound:Tanaka Rie, Imai Asami, Asumi Kana, Satou Rin, Horie Yui, Kitamura Eri, Ishihara Kaori and Ogura Yui all return as their respective Goddess and Goddess candidate roles and they all do really well. Really, the series has no weak performances. The actors from the games return to voice their respective characters and the result is some really strong acting. The music is really good as well. It largely has the upbeat style that you expect from Neptunia. I will say that the music for more serious moments isn\'t as good. It isn\'t bad, but it is kind of standard.Ho-yay:There\'s quite a bit of underlying yuri in the series, but the two biggest examples are Compa & IF and Vert & Nepgear. Especially Vert and Nepgear. Compa and IF come across as a married couple in this, or at the very least like two people who have had a long romantic relationship. Vert and Nepgear really get homo-erotic. There\'s a scene where Vert brings an archway covered with lilies to Planeptune so that she can cuddle up with Nepgear on a bench underneath it. She also tries to get Nepgear to refer to her as sister, used in the yuri sense obviously. When Neptune sees it she gets annoyed because they\'ve apparently been doing this every day lately. Vert also refers to Neptune as her sister in law. Yeah, Vert and Nepgear raise their Lily rank right past five and into Red territory. Although I\'m sure Red would be happy to see her ""wifeys"" getting along if she was in this. But they decided to save her character for the spin-off anime Choujigen Game Neptune: Red\'s Grand Adventure, coming Spring 2016. I say that in jest, but I would really love to see that as a real thing.Final Thoughts:This is one of those anime series based on a video game that\'s definitively for fans of the games. If you aren\'t familiar with the Neptunia franchise then the pacing is going to seem even more ridiculously hectic and you probably aren\'t going to have much investment. If you are a fan of the franchise you\'re going to figure out exactly what to expect from the plot very quickly but, to its credit, it does have its share of good moments and it features strong art in the exact vein of the games and superb performances. If you are a fan of the games, you\'ll probably like it fine for those aspects in spite of the predictable narrative. For myself, I give it a 6/10.

For those of you unaware, Neptunia is basically game consoles as girls. And that\'s basically it.Really, just like the games, there really is nothing to this anime. There is no plot to this. Most of the anime is just fanservice that\'s just there to pander to the audience, and aside from that there\'s nothing special about this. Fight scenes are so-so, VA is passable (Compa\'s is terrible as usual), ""serious"" scenes are cringe-worthy and some of the jokes are just unfunny.So, is this anime worth watching? If you took a look...at my ""Favorite Anime"" list on my profile, you\'d see this anime listed right smack dab in the middle of it. Yes, go watch this anime. I highly recommend it. Now this isn\'t me being sarcastic, there\'s just something about this anime that I enjoy to it.It\'s not easy to describe. Maybe it\'s how cheerful and lighthearted the general atmosphere is; Maybe it\'s the appeal of seeing Iris Heart going S over everyone; Maybe it\'s Vert\'s Gainaxing; Maybe it\'s fun to see the cast transform. I dunno, this anime does all the major things poorly but does all the little things so well. I don\'t care why no males aside from one guy seem to exist in the universe, I don\'t care how the logistics of the universe works. Just turn off your brain and enjoy what is quite possibly the best ""So Bad, It\'s Good"" anime I\'ve seen in years.A definite guilty pleasure of mine.3/10 (Biased score : 8/10)Also Rei is just a great character. at my ""Favorite Anime"" list on my profile, you\'d see this anime listed right smack dab in the middle of it.

I also was a little turned off by the fact it was all female cast, and I mean ALL female, to the extent of which it...looked like a matriarchy.Art:7The art was pretty good, definitly could have been better but it had its perks.Sound:9The sound was probably the best part of the anime in my opinion, with a really good intro as well as outro, which I liked listening to.Character:6While the attitudes and phrases the characters said, like ""an arrow to the knee"" and other video game references were awesome, I did notice that some of the character designs weren\'t all that original per say. Theres the rich girl, the hyper girl, the sisters, the brats, the funny perverts, as well as many other ones I fail to mention. I gave this section a lower ranking though because of the...well here it is, lack of male characters. I do get that this is a female based show with focus on the female cast, however this anime takes it way beyond that and has you wondering where the hell all the men are at. Throughout this entire anime, and I was looking XD, there was not a single male human character. There were some other characters who were male, however the closest hint we got that there even was the idea of a male human was on a cover of a manga that was made by one of the characters. However, the game designer made it like that, and I can\'t blame the anime producers for the script that was in front of them.Overall:7Overall, I would have to give this anime a 7. While it certainly lacked male characters which took away from my personal enjoyment, I won\'t ignore the fact that it did well in other areas as well, which it did. looked like a matriarchy.Art:7The art was pretty good, definitly could have been better but it had its perks.Sound:9The sound was probably the best part of the anime in my opinion, with a really good intro as well as outro, which I liked listening to.Character:6While the attitudes and phrases the characters said, like ""an arrow to the knee"" and other video game references were awesome, I did notice that some of the character designs weren\'t all that original per say.

The game and the anime adaptation is meant to be a parody of the game console wars that took place many years ago and still today. While Hyperdimension is meant to be comedy, parody, sci-fi series, it does has it moments of seriousness and tense moments. With saying that, it slightly falls flat due a fair and mediocre story line.Story: 6.5/10When I watched the first episode, I honestly did not understand what the main plot was. It was only through reading what...the game/anime is, I realise that it is based of the console wars. It took me a bit longer it was based on the competition with the Wii (Lowee), Leanbox (Xbox), Lastation (Playstation) and Planeptune (Sega Neptune). While some people may pick this up really easily, I personally did not realise this until sometime later.With that in mind, the story of Hyperdimension is fair. There are moments that are funny, but also have gags that are not so. I particularly liked how Neptune blatantly states one of the episodes is a fanservice episode. While I do not mind at times, flat comedy, some many be put off the bland comedy. Furthermore, the story is not exciting and does not make me cringe for the next episode. Despite this, it does have some dramatic moments and for me personally, almost a tear jerking moment at episode 10.  Overall, the story line is decent but not excellent.Art: 9/10I am super biased in this area. The sole reason I decided to pick up this is the cute art design. Each of the characters look really cute and appealing and it is pleasing to watch. While the colours may be a bit vibrant for some and the animated fight scenes a bit lackluster, the moe and cuteness factor wins for me. However, if you are a kind of person who does not care about this, the art many not be good as I say.Sound 7/10The OP and ED songs are catchy. Not the best but still nice to listen. That is if you like really poppy girly music. The VA are nicely voiced but some may be annoyed with Neptune's voice as it can be irritating at times. The OST is decent but not particularly memorable. The OST in the action scene do bring out the intense moments. Overall solid effort in terms of sound.Character: 7/10For a comedy, parody, sci-fi genre, the characters are not going to be development as much as a drama anime. Nevertheless, the characters are decent but a bit cliché. During the first half of the series, it mostly focuses on the sisters development as they grow and learn to trust in their own abilities. Later on it builds up  Neptune's relationships with certain characters. Characters are mostly likable with some minor characters annoying me at times. Nevertheless, characters are made fairly solid.Enjoyment: 8/10I personally enjoyed  Hyperdimension a lot. It does not take itself very seriously and is mostly funny at times. While it does have its dull moments, it  mostly picks itself back up with some humorous moments or intense fight scenes. However, if you are kinda of person who can be easily bored, it may not be as enjoyable.Re-watch factor: HighI would personally re-watch it again. While I won't watch it back immediately, I definitely pick it up again when i start running out of animes (that is if I run out).Is this anime for me?Depends. If you are person who does not easily get bored, enjoys a comedy, sci-fi, parody anime and can handle a fair to mediocre plot, then sure why not. Hey I don't even mind a second season (depends if it is popular enough). the game/anime is, I realise that it is based of the console wars. It took me a bit longer it was based on the competition with the Wii (Lowee), Leanbox (Xbox), Lastation (Playstation) and Planeptune (Sega Neptune). While some people may pick this up really easily, I personally did not realise this until sometime later.With that in mind, the story of Hyperdimension is fair. There are moments that are funny, but also have gags that are not so. I particularly liked how Neptune blatantly states one of the episodes is a fanservice episode. While I do not mind at times, flat comedy, some many be put off the bland comedy. Furthermore, the story is not exciting and does not make me cringe for the next episode. Despite this, it does have some dramatic moments and for me personally, almost a tear jerking moment at episode 10.  Overall, the story line is decent but not excellent.Art: 9/10I am super biased in this area. The sole reason I decided to pick up this is the cute art design. Each of the characters look really cute and appealing and it is pleasing to watch. While the colours may be a bit vibrant for some and the animated fight scenes a bit lackluster, the moe and cuteness factor wins for me. However, if you are a kind of person who does not care about this, the art many not be good as I say.Sound 7/10The OP and ED songs are catchy. Not the best but still nice to listen. That is if you like really poppy girly music. The VA are nicely voiced but some may be annoyed with Neptune's voice as it can be irritating at times. The OST is decent but not particularly memorable. The OST in the action scene do bring out the intense moments. Overall solid effort in terms of sound.Character: 7/10For a comedy, parody, sci-fi genre, the characters are not going to be development as much as a drama anime. Nevertheless, the characters are decent but a bit cliché. During the first half of the series, it mostly focuses on the sisters development as they grow and learn to trust in their own abilities. Later on it builds up  Neptune's relationships with certain characters. Characters are mostly likable with some minor characters annoying me at times. Nevertheless, characters are made fairly solid.Enjoyment: 8/10I personally enjoyed  Hyperdimension a lot. It does not take itself very seriously and is mostly funny at times. While it does have its dull moments, it  mostly picks itself back up with some humorous moments or intense fight scenes. However, if you are kinda of person who can be easily bored, it may not be as enjoyable.Re-watch factor: HighI would personally re-watch it again. While I won't watch it back immediately, I definitely pick it up again when i start running out of animes (that is if I run out).Is this anime for me?Depends. If you are person who does not easily get bored, enjoys a comedy, sci-fi, parody anime and can handle a fair to mediocre plot, then sure why not.

I am now playing the games.Its basically like the dead pool of anime with an insane amount of references to anime and video games.This is how a short anime that acts as an advertisement for your light novel/manga/game series should be. It is self contained story that had a beginning AND an end! Giving you a feel for the world and characters of the Neptunia universe.The voice actors for the games seem to be largely the same as for the anime which is a nice touch.I...would recommend this even if you had no intention of playing the games would recommend this even if you had no intention of playing the games', 'This is probably one of the most outdated reviews ever for a really unpopular show. But recent events got me into a neptunia phase so I felt like writing this review. Bear in mind that I only re-watched a few episodes before writing this review because I\'m lazy and I have not played many of the games. Let\'s start the review.First off, people have called this anime a not so great adaption to the video games. But what anime based off a video game is? (I can\'t think of any) Even for anime standards it is not so great. Little to no story, no fleshed...out characters, terrible villains e.t.c. And yes, I will agree to those statements. But why am I giving it such a decent score? In the words of Sokka ""This is the wacky, time wasting nonsense I\'ve been missing!"" (ATLA, Season three, The Fire Emblem Players) And this is exactly what this series is; wacky, time wasting nonsense. Every week I would look forward to watching because of the crazy jokes in this series.Story-5I would give this part a lower score for the fact that there is basically no story. But how it set itself up was good. So I will keep it at this score. You can read what the story is at the synopsis and that is really all there is to it. And the four goddesses and their sisters working together to protect the lands and stuff like that after signing the treaty. Now I am making this sound like a random mess of events but it\'s not. *cough*cough*Pupa*cough*cough*. The episodes progress with each other like any other standard anime but you won\'t feel like there is a story to their overall actions, and everything will lead up to some pointless climax. Which is true. But the enjoyment will be in their actions.Art-8I\'ll keep this brief since I suck at reviewing art.The ArtThe characters are well drawn, and the scenery looks really nice.The AnimationNice bright vibrant colors. Nice animation effects.Sound-7Not much to say here. The opening is nice. The ending, not so much. The background music is fine. It blends in very well with the scenes which makes it good, but unnoticeable since it blends in so well.Character-6There are a lot of characters. And for a series that focus on the four goddesses, we see more development within their sisters. We do see that the goddesses have a personality develop throughout the series, what they like, dislike and what peeves them off. But for actual character development, the goddesses sisters get the most development. We see their sisters gaining power and unlocking their powers. Even though it was done early on and there will be almost no character development afterwards, I felt like it was done well. Somewhat cliche, but done well.Enjoyment-9This is where I felt this anime truly shines. But this is also where it boils down to personal preference. The crazy, random comedy in this show never failed to put a weird grin on my face. But the comedy is also quite stupid and cliched. The characters all had a surprise to them that made me gawk for a few seconds. Again the characters are flat, in more than one way, and are there to fulfill their stereotypes.Overall-7I used a less harsh scale to rate this anime, that is why the scores are so high. But if I used my regular scale, this thing would fall flat on it\'s face, and it would not be that accurate. This anime is a parody series. Never expect much from parody series. The score is much higher because my personal enjoyment weighs a little more than the story, characters e.t.c. Now. I would never recommend this series on  a normal basis. But if some person was bored of the action packed, intriguing stories of normal animes, I would totally recommend this. This is literally just wacky, time wasting nonsense. And then the nonsense just boils down to personal preference. I am not recommend this to any of you who are reading this. But, if you are bored of normal animes or maybe just need something to get back in the anime mood, by all means go ahead and watch this.

I want to apology if there are any mistakes on my grammar and spelling in this review.At first, this anime look like a let down for newcommers. Because of the:1.)fanservice (it is not that much)2.)video game adaption, nuff said3.)bad introduction/ first episodeBut, it is actually very good. Actually I recommend for people that like parody series, lighthearted story, and moe.Story/ comedy(10/10); better than many other animes (in my opinion). The story is very good for a video game original story (even the concept is the same as...the second and the third game). I like lighthearted story, so it is a plus point for me. Because this series is a parody series, I do not really care about the story (same goes to the anime like: Baka to Test, Danshi Kokousei, Nichijou, etc.).Personally liked how they handled many character in just 12 episodes.Art (9/10); The art is better than many other animes,though the game\'s art is superior than the anime. Nothing notable here.Sound (10/10); The songs are enjoyable and great to hear.Character (9/10); The character in this anime can describe many characteristic from the game. From the start, I do not really hope for all of the character\'s uniques are being shown in 12 episodes. It is too many. Even in this 12 episodes, all of the CPU and the candidates EXE Drive (finisher) have not shown. One thing that bug me off is that Rom\'s skills are mostly buff and heal. She better showed backing up ""the party"" than attacking with Ram. Putting that aside, the character development in this anime is better than the game. This anime is made for fun, not for seriousness, so I am not really think about the character development.Enjoyment (10/10); Really enjoy this series, even the anime has many flaws. But it still great. All of the comedies are rarely used in other anime, that makes the anime look fresh. Liked the interactions each character, how the story goes, and the character development.Overall (10/10)//(48/50) Maybe I look like a person that rate this anime biased from the game, but this genre is my personal favorite.

Yet, this anime of made off from one of my favorite video games and off the manga and deserves a review from me as a fan of it. I'll try not to add spoilers and such and I'll try not to rant about how this anime shouldn't have even been made into such a confusing fan serviced mess.Story: 2 | 3Now, this anime tries to combine three games all together which does not work at all. I understand this anime if basically for the fans of the games/manga, based off...some of the lines that the anime stated; 'Oh, this is a fanboy episode' or stating that there was an 'anime' only character and that she was bland compared to the franchise based characters. It did 'somewhat' go through with the game's story yet it had so many different filler episodes that left the story cluttered for me personally.The person I watched this with was totally unknown to the games/manga and they were totally lost with what even was going on with what this anime was suppose to be about. So I wouldn't recommend anyone who hasn't played the games or read the manga not watch this or else you would end up with a bunch of questions. I just wish the anime gave more of a background to what the goddesses are as CPU's or at least give the newbies more of an understanding as to what is going on with Gamindustri and how it works than just assume only the fans will be watching it.Art & Sound: 6Now, the art style for the anime was almost the only thing pleasant. They got the looks right. Yet, they tried censoring out as much as possible, giving Uni a one piece suit for her CPU outfit instead of the two piece. And yet they made the famous fan-serviced beach episode more skin like it was nothing? I just found it a bit absurd yet each to their own. The visuals were rather good  through the fighting scene, I was pleased with the animation quality.As for the sound, it was alright nothing special. The openings didn't really appeal to me but the songs were a good fit for the anime. Along with 5pb.'s singing, the sound left a good impression this was for the anime of Hyperdeminsion Neptunia.Characters: 3The character development of the characters were rather lacking to me. It literally focuses on Neptune, Nepgear, and some of Noire. Blanc, Vert, and everyone else basically gets pushed to the side and only show off their top traits.  There are plenty of different types of characters though; tsundere, yandere, lolli, etc. Yet...they focused on the airhead (Neptune), the tsundere (Noire), and the popularly loved shy girl (Nepgear). As a Blanc fan, I was utterly disappointed not to see her more as the violent, foul mouthed yandere she is.A main hit point is that the antagonists that are against the goddess' are not really doing much, like even resorting to using eggplants to defeat them...yes, eggplants. I felt that just made the antagonists into just dumb scum that are weak and are easily defeated, unlike how they really are as fellow game players know.This part of the review is the one that disappointed me the most since the anime had so much potential and yet they focused on the popular girls of most of the fans. Fan service for the lost, here.Enjoyment: 4My enjoyment was actually great in the beginning, I was excited to see how the beloved video games would be turned into an anime. Yet as the episodes--actually felt more like fillers--continued, I started to get more upset with what they have done. Some episodes were not needed and that killed my enjoyment. It was rather tough to finish this to the end and even do the ova, knowing that the anime continued to get worse later on story wise.Final Thoughts/Overall: 5My overall thoughts were that this anime was poorly done for the fans and fan service. As a huge fan, I was not happy. Maybe because I'm a girl or that the anime was more attracted to the male fans, but I just felt this anime did not need to be made. It crushes the franchise a bit with how badly done this was made. Anyone new to this would be very confused until the end and would just lead them to think everything about Hyperdimension Neptunia is like this mess.  If you are a fan and you are expecting something fantastic, I'd consider you do not because the anime lacks in a bunch of things. It's nothing like the games; not that funny, the character's personalities don't shine as much, and it just felt...off. some of the lines that the anime stated; 'Oh, this is a fanboy episode' or stating that there was an 'anime' only character and that she was bland compared to the franchise based characters.

It strays from the games in a way that should work but it wastes it time not developing any of the characters or the world they live in, basically assuming you already knew who they are and what makes them tick. If the Warcraft movie is any indicator, alienating new audiences who have never played the games is a TERRIBLE idea.Plus the Ultra Dimension mini-arc was terrible and super rushed like they realized ""oh shit, we were supposed to give this show an actual plot and now it\'s nearly too late!"".Really goes...to show that David Production should stick to adapting manga.Story: 3/10Art: 7/10 (about what you would expect of DP)Sound: 6/10Character: 4/10Enjoyment 5/10Overall: 4/10 to show that David Production should stick to adapting manga.Story: 3/10Art: 7/10 (about what you would expect of DP)Sound: 6/10Character: 4/10Enjoyment 5/10Overall: 4/10', 'Choujigen Game Neptune: The Animation is one of those animes that is based off a game and is solely targeted to those who have played it. So beware new comers who are trying to get into the Choujigen Game Neptune franchise, you will be sorely disappointed. This is definitely by all means a niche target audience, so fan boys and girls raise your hands high for a multitude of cuteness, fan service and the light hearted mundane story line (slice of life) it brings with it.Choujigen Game Neptune begins on a decent note that could have been have either set the tone for the whole...entire series, but rather they chose to make everything as cute and light hearted as possible.

Nothing is memorable about this. The jokes in the series are actually very bad. It\'s literally ""HEY GAMERS, YOU LIKE VIDEO GAMES? HOHAHEHU""Jokes from the show include""The last of us in uncharted territory"" This joke is not funny, there\'s barely even a punch line, and it\'s literally just a way to reference names of video games.The story isn\'t that interesting in anyway. Characters never change. The one singular message of the show is ""Trust"" which could literally be solved in one episode. In even a kids show. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS I DON\'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT GUIDELINES...BECAUSE YOU CAN\'T REVIEW A SHOW VERY WELL WITHOUT SPOILERS) The characters in the beginning all sign a peace treaty to not fight. Neptune at the end cancels the treaty saying that they can all trust each other. This moral did not need to take 12 episodes to show.Art is generic. Not bad, but nothing really spectacular.Sound design, as I remember, was not terrible in the show, although I cannot remember any themes from the show other then the main theme, due to it beginning at each show.Characters learned nothing. Really. The only one that learns something is Neptune. She learns the aforementioned Trust thing. I remember that Iris Heart also was fighting Neptune about her lying to herself about saving the world when she knew she wasn\'t so iris beat her up. It only took 5 minutes for that change. And I think Blanc once learned not to be mean to her sisters Ram and Rom.

The art is good in general, but I can't feel the sadism on the face of Iris Heart, that's a bad point of the art. The musics and sounds are good. Plus, being able to see all the main characters of the games gather together is cool too.Certainly this is just an average anime, however, since I love the game, I love anime, more importantly, I got to see Blanc moving around, that's dream comes true to me, so I'm going to make an exception and give this...anime 10/10 :) anime 10/10 :)"", ""Welcome to me review of Choujigen Game Neptune The Animation!(Story - 3/10)The story of the Anime was the one part I wasn't very satisfied with. For a 12-episode long Anime with an OVA, the stories should have been thought and planned out. Yet, while watching the Anime move along, I felt that some of the stories took way too long to pan out. There were also ones that ended way too quickly as well. As you can see, there's kind of an imbalance there. The progress overall felt too rocky and not properly paced out.(Art - 7/10)The art of the Anime is one of its...plus points. Being in a fantasy world, one would expect the use of vibrant colours and effects to help enhance the art of the Anime. It did. The art was well done; fight scenes were beautifully animated  as well. Also, this is an extra point, but for an Anime with so much fan service, the art definitely helps out there.(Sound - 7/10)The sound of the Anime is another one of its plus points. Being action-packed and having several fight scenes, proper and adequate sounds are definitely a must. During the fight scenes you could tell what was going or which action was being executed at that particular time by hearing the sound in addition to the animation.(Character - 5/10)The characters of the Anime had pretty decent development, from being Goddesses of different states who were wary of one another at first to being  friendly in the end. Despite the unbalance in the story, the characters themselves had decent development, both in their power and their relationship with one another. From the start to the end, you could witness their growth at a steady pace.(Enjoyment - 6/10)The enjoyment that I got from this Anime was Fair. While watching through the episodes one by one, there were times where I felt different emotions such as sadness when Peashy got kidnapped. It was somewhat lifted later on when they got her back but her memories did not. It shot way back up when Peashy remembered Neptune later on.(Overall - 6/10)On overall, I'm giving this Anime a 6 out of 10 score for the amount of enjoyment that I got from it. This Anime is a good watch if you're someone who enjoys fantasy scenes with a lot of fan service. Give it a go! plus points. Being in a fantasy world, one would expect the use of vibrant colours and effects to help enhance the art of the Anime. It did. The art was well done; fight scenes were beautifully animated  as well. Also, this is an extra point, but for an Anime with so much fan service, the art definitely helps out there.(Sound - 7/10)The sound of the Anime is another one of its plus points. Being action-packed and having several fight scenes, proper and adequate sounds are definitely a must. During the fight scenes you could tell what was going or which action was being executed at that particular time by hearing the sound in addition to the animation.(Character - 5/10)The characters of the Anime had pretty decent development, from being Goddesses of different states who were wary of one another at first to being  friendly in the end. Despite the unbalance in the story, the characters themselves had decent development, both in their power and their relationship with one another. From the start to the end, you could witness their growth at a steady pace.(Enjoyment - 6/10)The enjoyment that I got from this Anime was Fair. While watching through the episodes one by one, there were times where I felt different emotions such as sadness when Peashy got kidnapped. It was somewhat lifted later on when they got her back but her memories did not. It shot way back up when Peashy remembered Neptune later on.(Overall - 6/10)On overall, I'm giving this Anime a 6 out of 10 score for the amount of enjoyment that I got from it. This Anime is a good watch if you're someone who enjoys fantasy scenes with a lot of fan service. Give it a go!"", ""This review has the inclusion of the OVA which is more of just a 13th episode.Very rarely are ports from games into shows or movies done well and this is no exception. Or at least for the most part. For those that haven't played the game, its a decent anime with a few things in it that you would not see in any other anime. Such as a robot drag Queen for instance. However for those that played the games first. This anime can be rated fairly low in comparison.With a story line of a few key villains that add up to a final stand,...Neptunia the Animation seems to have played itself rather well despite its large tangent from the games. With even the fan service episodes having major key points, it really does make a serious habit of making a fool out of itself but seems to make up for itself in a few a scenes that can tag at ones feels even slightly.Art when matched with the game, falls into place almost exactly, 3D game models aside. But when pitched on its own in the anime world, it's extremely bright and cheerful for the most part and only gets dark and gloomy when a situation goes really bad, which most time leads to easily predictable scenes if a sudden twist isn't added.Music is the disappointing factor, with only a few songs, including the opening and ending, used many times throughout its short lived season. Although despite these are well made, the constant use gets a little boring. The few original pieces that are played are so dulled out into the background its hard to appreciate them without loosing out on what happening in the anime. Sounds are however this sections redeeming factor as the sheer amount of unique sounds for each and every object is not something that often seen in a short anime.Character development outside of Peashy's character, is the one part both new watchers and players of the game, can agree in saying there is almost no character development as it opens, plays and ends with them all on the same terms with one another with only minute wavers to each others relations during the anime.Overall enjoyment was quite lacking as while it had a few suspenseful moments, they were all short lived while the rest of the anime left nothing to be desired. The few scenes that poke at your feels can seem redeeming but they just get ruined again in the next episode with the animes own way of ruining its own lead up. The one part that can be heart crushing is the first scene of the OVA to those that played the games. The game players will know the OVA all too well. While everyone else is left wondering what the hell the story line is doing. Neptunia the Animation seems to have played itself rather well despite its large tangent from the games.

Reading that it would be adapted, after those 3 years, has left me excited! And here I am, reviewing it right now!{STORY - 2/10}After many years fighting for the Shared Energy, the four godesses, each one representing a different nation (those being related to particular real-life  gaming consoles), decided for peace between them, under the Friendship Agreement. This would cease their battles and prevent possible wars in the future.A few main events happen during the anime, but...the focus in here is upon Neptune. She has to learn how to act more like a source of hope to her people, in order to recover her Shared Crystal\'s stability, which gives power for her to transform into and maintain the HDD form, just like with the three other CPUs with their crystals.{ART - 8/10}The same style was used and this adaptation became really close to the original game on this matter. Overally gorgeous and amazing, the unique and futuristic theme featured in here is something to be glazed at, for sure. An wide set of distinct outfits and hairstyles are keep us from mistaking characters and the every nation\'s scenario has its own characteristics, some of them intentionally added as a reference to the most known makers from gaming history.{SOUND - 9/10}We shouldn\'t expect less from it. A fine and matching backgrounding, abusing from lots of different SFX and music, combined with a brand new opening song and two other ending ones take it to the next level! Maybe the strongest point, since effects used on every battles were very well chosen and the original voice casting was used!{CHARACTERS - 6/10}I may warn that this is an anime restricted to female characters. Absolutely no male protagonists (not even secondary). However, the outstandely huge variety of girls featured in here really make up for it. I guess that\'s what makes it so different when compared to other similar animes...From what I saw, all characters\' personalities remained intact, authentical when related to the video game. Neptune, always cheerful, doesn\'t care for important issues, like other the other CPUs. Maybe she was created to represent conventional gamers, who are unable to worry and try to run awah from everything by playing. Despite that, Neptune can turn into a real mature woman on her HDD form, capable of acting and thinking with more caution, showing a confident and reliable posture.Noire is more of a tsundere (to-ta-lly). A sharp tongue and the way she always hides her true feelings are some reasons of why she\'s so incapable of relating to people and even with her little sister. Blanc didn\'t got much screen time, so making a profile about her is tough. Main points include coldness and an ""easy-to-piss"" attitude. She ends up being more mad than anything else. Vert is a true otaku, collecting stuff like posters, manga and games. Tender and sweet best describe the way she behaves among others and BL is one of her personal tastes (as many common girls, I believe).The entire original cast made its appearance, including even Compa (Compile Heart) and IF (Idea Factory), both related to the developers, as well as CPUs\' little sisters, who debuted on Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2 and even 5pb!{ENJOYMENT - 7/10}At first, it was kind of weird to watch an animation based on a game. This is new to me so, like with Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka, I had no idea from what to expect. At the end, it was enjoyable, despite the huge amount of fanservicing (almost the entire anime), which is not much on the video game.{OVERALL - 6/10}It\'s about gaming. Everything relates to consoles or even computing matters, so it\'s nice to see a personification from the most famous systems nowadays. Also, every nation\'s scenario relates in some way with the respective device under its name and that just makes it more original. Nothing too special and you\'ll get a better experience from the games, but watching this is nice to get deeper into Neptunia series! the focus in here is upon Neptune.

Nothing too special and you\'ll get a better experience from the games, but watching this is nice to get deeper into Neptunia series!', 'For those of you who are looking for a good anime with a deep plot, amazing characters, and total mind screwing, turn away because this is the exact opposite of what you’re looking for.Some anime watchers have those days where they just want to get away from the real world and would happily jump into an anime without any second thoughts. Just as a “by the way,” Hyperdimension Neptunia is one of those anime where it seems that males do not exist. If there are, they certainly don’t want to show themselves. The show itself has no real over-arching plot, but that’s the point. Now...let’s get onto the review. Keep note that due to the formatting this show does, I will be comparing some aspects to the games.Story (5)- There is only so much you can do trying to put two games into a 12-episode show and when you make everybody friends right from the get-go the conflict between the nations are gone. Even though the first arc was important, I was turned-off by the “fan-service” that is wires acting as tentacles. The second arc isn’t that spectacular either. With my main problems out of the way, let’s get into what I liked about it. The fact that there is no real plot is the main point of the show. To really enjoy this show, you have to just not take it seriously at all. I also found it humorous that goddesses could be little girls as well as do absolutely nothing and get away with it.Characters (5) - I’ll be frank… I LOVE ALMOST EVERY CHARACTER. None of them are dislikable with the exception of CFW Trick (whom I have nicknamed Lickilicky) and a few others. While the characters are cardboard-cutouts of clichéd personalities, I rather enjoyed them.  The four goddesses each represent some trait in people whether they are lazy, hard-working, hot-headed, otaku, etc. The main reason I like them so much is because of the way they act and how each voice actor portrays them (even the English voices for the game is among some of the best I have heard for JRPGs). While the characters are mostly goofy, I found that I also enjoyed the serious sides of the characters towards the end of the series where the “real plot” kicks in.Sound (7) – The opening and the ending is extremely cute and fits with the show very well. The rest of the soundtrack is entirely forgettable with the exception of one or two during the whole plot with Eden. Another factor of the sound I enjoyed was the voice actors. The voice actors in Neptunia are amazing! I especially enjoyed Rie Tanaka’s (Neptune/Purple Heart) and Kana Hanazawa’s (Plutia/Iris Heart) performances since they portrayed their characters so well. Everyone is great; there is nothing more I can say about it. Since the game was also voiced in English, I will also quickly say something on it: one of the best game dubs I’ve heard in a long time.Animation (7) – Animation isn’t my forte, but I found the art style almost identical to Date A Live. If you enjoyed Date A Live’s art style, you will most likely enjoyed Hyperdimension Neptunia’s art style as well.Enjoyment (6) - When an anime adapts a game in which the game is a parody of the video game industry, it loses a charm that the game has. If there is one thing that the anime makes fun of that the game cannot, it is the making fun of censorship that is not subtle (see episode 8). Since I watched this anime as it was being aired I found it is just great to sit down each week and watch something that was completely stupid and nonsensical. I recommend this to any fan of the game, but I would also tell them not to expect too much from it. let’s get onto the review.

I recommend this to any fan of the game, but I would also tell them not to expect too much from it.', 'Hyperdimension Neptunia is one of the few ""based on a game"" anime series that I really, genuinely enjoyed. That being said, you may not enjoy it as much if you\'re not at least a bit familiar with the game series (the creators seem to assume that you are). For clarity, I\'ll break this into the standard 6 sections.Story - 7/10While this anime is based on the game series, this is essentially a standalone plot. The characters and villains are the same, but this is NOT a direct adaptation of any of the games.It\'s largely episodic, with a few longer story arcs spanning multiple episodes. This...all flows quite well if you\'re familiar with the series and the characters; otherwise it might be a bit of a struggle to follow at times. They had a LOT of canon material to work with, and while the pacing was good, there were a few episodes that left me asking ""oh, is that it?""It\'s primarily a comedy series, though towards the end it gets a good bit more serious and dramatic. This is a notable departure from the games, which tend to be lighthearted fluff all the way through (the only real tension in the games comes from the anticipation of an upcoming boss battle). The dramatic elements are done very well and contribute significantly to character development (which I will get into in more depth in the ""Character"" section). There are several moments that are quite emotional, which, again, is a departure from the normal tone of the series - if you\'re going into this expecting it to be exactly like the games you\'re going to be a little put off.The last several episodes seemed to rush up to the climax pretty quickly, but overall it was a satisfying ending with no real loose threads.Art - 7/10The art in this show is pretty true to the games - the characters\' outfits are spot-on, the backgrounds are done well in the familiar Gamindustri style, and the animation is for the most part fluid and good-looking. It\'s in a pretty standard cutesy magical-girl genre style, so if you like similar styles (KyoAni comes to mind, though their animation is quite a bit nicer) you\'ll probably like this.The character designs are wonderful - though they\'re essentially identical to the designs from the games, so this anime isn\'t breaking any new ground here. I suppose the creators get points for keeping things exactly on-model. The characters are all distinct and memorable, and really, you can\'t go wrong with cute anime girls.Sound - 8/10Important to note for this section, I watched the English dub. This is because I previously played the games in English and I quite enjoyed the English VAs. This series has all the same VAs as the games (except for IF, who has a different voice - at first I didn\'t like that it was different but her VA does a good job with it and I came to enjoy it by the end of the series). They all do an excellent job and capture the spirit of the characters perfectly. I haven\'t watched this series in Japanese so I can\'t comment on that part.The music in this series is very good, it\'s a combination of original music and tracks from the games. It\'s your standard video game techno-fantasy style music, it\'s well-written and suits the mood of the series.The opening and ending songs are fantastic and extremely catchy. I quite often find myself humming the main riff from the opening, or singing ""GJ my sweetheart"" from the ending.Character - 9/10Full disclosure, I am a ginormous fan of the Neptunia series and I love all the characters to pieces. That said, I realize that not everyone will share my enthusiasm for them, so I will try and remain objective.As stated above, while the story is an original one based on the universe, the characters are all direct ports from the games. The four main characters and all the side characters have been faithfully reproduced and are pretty well perfect analogs of their game counterparts.Most of the characters remain pretty static personality-wise throughout the series, but it\'s the main character (Neptune) that undergoes the most character development. At the beginning (and throughout most of the series to be honest) she\'s a bit of an airhead, she\'s lazy, she\'s got pretty much zero impulse control... but by the end, she becomes much more responsible and dependable.The catalyst seems to be the story arc between episodes 8-10, and Neptune\'s interactions with Peashy in these episodes. I\'ve seen people criticize both these characters for various reasons; while Nep is quite annoying at first in these episodes, Peashy was perfectly written - she looks to be about 5 years old and she acts exactly the way you\'d expect a 5-year old to act. By the end of the arc they both go through quite a bit of development and the whole thing comes to a satisfying conclusion.Enjoyment - 10/10I loved this anime so much. It definitely seems like it\'s not for everyone, but for fans of the series (at least, those going into it with the appropriate expectations) it\'s a complete delight. It\'s great to see Nep and crew in fully-animated glory, as the cutscenes in the games are mostly static portraits (though the characters\' expressions change and they move around a bit, it\'d be a stretch to call them ""animated"" cutscenes).A warning - this series is full of cliches and tropes of all kinds, so if that\'s not your thing you may not enjoy this one as much as I did. It\'s also full of fanservice - in fact, the characters explicitly refer to episode 8 as ""one for the fanboys.""That\'s the other thing about this anime, and the series in general - there is pretty much no fourth wall. The characters all seem to realize they\'re in an anime and they\'re all pretty genre-savvy, so expect a good few laughs based around this.I will absolutely be watching this one again - I preordered the DVD/BD combo pack and I\'m gonna have a hard time waiting the 2 months before it releases (I streamed it on Funimation\'s website this time around). It\'s fun enough that I will probably get the same level of enjoyment out of it the second time around; I\'ll probably laugh, and cry, as hard as I did the first time.Overall - 9/10I absolutely recommend this to fans of the Neptunia series. The characterizations are great, the art is wonderful to look at, and the story is thoroughly enjoyable (especially for superfans like me who crave more content than just the games provide). If you\'re not already a fan, it\'s still worth a watch, but you may want to read up on it a bit beforehand. As I mentioned above, there\'s a lot of lore that goes unexplained, and the way some of the characters act might be a little off-putting unless you realize that that\'s just the way they are as characters.If you\'re willing to give this series a chance, I think you\'ll be highly satisfied. all flows quite well if you\'re familiar with the series and the characters; otherwise it might be a bit of a struggle to follow at times.

Though not quite a female version of Lord of the Flies, the world\'s history is littered with battles between CPUs competing for a shiny, mysterious energy source known as ""share energy"". However, rather than setting us up for a massive battle, the story begins with a truce between all four factions and the ensuing nichijou that follows. Neptune is a barely-comedic action show with a lot of barely-clad, transforming female beings acting like preteen girls. If that turns you on, please...see a psychiatrist immediately.I convinced myself to venture into this expecting something like a mix of Strike Witches and Kampfer. Actually, what really sold me was the well-designed website (http://www.nep-anime.tv) and the mind-boggling list of veteran VAs. However, I felt like the show spent all their funding and time on the website and the VAs as the actual plot is abysmal at points and the characters are thin and shallow. In summary, this is probably a show for fans of the wildly popular game (now apparently on Steam), who actually have more background information on the setting and characters. For me, it was a very predictable filler show with some occasionally nice visuals. Recommended for fans only.Animation:There\'s not much to complain about in this category. Neptune has a fairly saturated color palette with average levels of character and background details. The entire show has a unique, computer-based theme with CPU\'s eyes drawn like PC start button icons and many characters named in computer-like lingo. There are quite a few characters in this show, almost overwhelmingly in the beginning, that are introduced in rapid succession. What makes it even more confusing is that the CPUs have two forms (normal and HDD mode) where their appearance is different (more so than your typical mahou shoujo transformation). For example, the protagonist, Neptune, looks like a carefree preteen in her normal form but transforms into a tall buxom in CPU form. Most of the CPUs also have similar-looking sisters, which further complicates the character-matching in the early episodes. The antagonists, on the other hand, are easily distinguishable and rather conspicuously drawn; they might as well have been drawn with a giant arrow saying ""I\'m an antagonist, please beat me up"" above their heads.Despite the supposed truce at the beginning of the show, there is a bunch of fighting where you\'ll find lots of special effects and, occasionally, ugly CGI. This really does feel like it\'s meant for younger audiences as apparently all the CPUs have Strike-Freedom like shields that protect them from most battle damage. Fodder opponents also disappear into thin air when defeated. Each CPU has a special weapon such as beam-powered swords, axes, and rifles. Expect average choreography and mild levels of battle intensity. As for the fan-service aspect, there\'s a lot of boing and a lot of girl-girl fondling if you\'re into that. The CPUs\' HDD form leaves them scantily clad, perhaps so they can ""punish"" villains accordingly?Sound:The show starts with a energy-packed pop/rock song with a fair melody and painful lyrics (if you have any knowledge of computer science). The show\'s primary ED is playful but not particularly catchy. Much more interesting is the ED in episodes three and four, which features a nice, down tempo melody while also showcasing all the girls in the nude. There are also a few fair insert songs sung by Nao. The BGM is fair, supportive when necessary though overall pretty forgettable.The VA cast, as mentioned above, is incredible. I can\'t remember the last time I\'ve seen this many huge names working together as primary characters. The four CPUs all have much deeper voices in their HDD form (which the younger sisters don\'t have). I haven\'t heard Rie Tanaka in a while, but she still proves very capable as Neptune. Kana Hanazawa is as recognizable as ever as Pururut, but also in a sadistic way in her HDD form. The list goes on, a great performance from all given how shallow the underlying characters are.Story:Share energy, a mysterious energy source gathered by citizens\' happiness and directly channeled somehow to the CPUs, is forbidden from being obtained through force in the truce that starts this show. Thus, for the first time ever, the CPUs now work together to address global concerns including various antagonists who want a coup. The story moves around quite a bit as it focuses on various characters through the progression. There are multiple arcs with their own rising action, climax, and conclusion. The majority of these are resolved through very cliched battles with extremely agonizing lines like ""I won\'t let you have your way!""Though there are plot ""twists"", the overall tonality of the series feels very light, and you never feel convinced that anyone is ever in any danger- I mean come on, what do you expect when your antagonist looks like a tentacle-monster straight from a hentai. I use quote fingers around twists to point out the fact that real plot twists exist for a reason other than resetting the plot on a completely new tangential path. Furthermore, the entire setting is never explained in any depth; the viewer just assumes that share energy allows CPUs to fly and shoot energy beams at each other. It\'s also questionable how Neptune runs her nation when she\'s only shown goofing off and eating pudding. Did I mention the antagonists? Their goals are so shallow and laughable that anyone with sense would immediately know that they are destined to fail.In summary, the story in Neptune is a chaotic mess that is patched together to give some semblance of progression. While there is some artificial tension in the final episodes, I would wager that a lot of viewers would not even make it that far. Even if you happen to make it that far, you may find yourself asking ""Really? They\'re going to try that?"". I can\'t help but feel that this story is targeted for very, very young audiences.Character:Despite having incredible talent behind them, the characters of this show are very shallow. Though they have semblances of personality, there\'s just not enough time spent on development and growth. Expect static development and lackluster relationships throughout the show. The only thing more disappointing are the antagonists, which are portrayed as such cliched villains that it becomes painful to watch. Given that the CPUs EACH rule a quarter of the world, I find it appalling that they can barely hold off attacks by idiots while working together. It doesn\'t help that the majority of the characters act so immature. Just way too much concentrated estrogen for me.Value:If you\'ve played and liked the games, this might be a good watch for you. If otherwise, I implore you to avoid this show. Despite the impossibly good VA cast and spiffy website, the actual show is not worth your time. The work is marred by a very weak and predictable plot line, enough plot holes to render a bucket useless, and a group of cliched, uninteresting antagonists. Given the strength of the season in which this was released, there is no real good reason to watch this over other works. see a psychiatrist immediately.I convinced myself to venture into this expecting something like a mix of Strike Witches and Kampfer. Actually, what really sold me was the well-designed website (http://www.nep-anime.tv) and the mind-boggling list of veteran VAs. However, I felt like the show spent all their funding and time on the website and the VAs as the actual plot is abysmal at points and the characters are thin and shallow. In summary, this is probably a show for fans of the wildly popular game (now apparently on Steam), who actually have more background information on the setting and characters. For me, it was a very predictable filler show with some occasionally nice visuals. Recommended for fans only.Animation:There\'s not much to complain about in this category.

The amount of random and nonsensical exposition being dumped on the viewer in the first episode should be enough to fry the brain of the most hardened weeb, and none of it is even relevant to the story as far as I know.

Send your raging fanboner emails to Icantcareaboutyouropinionasmuchasyoucareaboutmine@gmail.comI came into the Neptunia train a little bit late. During the Steam 2015 summer sale, I picked up Re;birth 1 and Re;birth 2. After...playing through the first, I fell in love with the series even though the game itself was filled with a mediocre plot, mediocre gameplay, and 1 dimensional characters - regardless, something about it\'s severe mediocrity crept into my mind and soon I found myself obsessed with this outstandingly bland JRPG, so much so I went out, bought a Vita just so I could play the other games that have yet to come to PC.I\'m not here to review the games, but unfortunately it\'s sort of the games themselves that help lend a hand to why I see the anime as such a great show. So let me just do a quick cap on things about the game that I feel like the anime improved on:Writing in the games was daft as hell. Every video game reference felt forced and awkward and gave no baring to what was happening. Sure it\'s parody or whatever of other anime genres might be well off, but, hell, my story and reading comprehension scores according to my SATs says I\'m retarded, so maybe I didn\'t grasp the ""finer points of moe"".Speaking of writing: wow, the characters in the game have such a predictable response to every situation the comedy went from self-aware to grating. Hyperdimension? More like single dimension, if you get what I am saying.Story? Goodness, well if this wasn\'t the summary of a Saturday Morning Kids WB cartoon, then I don\'t know what is. The main antagonist jumped in at every opportunity to awkwardly explain to the crew of WAY-TOO-MANY-UNNECESSARY-PARTY-MEMBERS of what exactly her motives were.Well, christ on a cracker, the game (mind you, I still loved it, dumped 100 hours and 3 playthrough in) was a trainwreck of mediocrity...and then the anime came in.The writing front was fixed, so much so. Characters showed progression over time, having their own internal struggles that they overcame, which meant when struggles arose between them, there was far more impact to them. The Eden arc of the anime comes to mind.Even though the goddesses and their respective candidates remained largely the same in personality, they received a bit of a face-lift in in character depth. This is probably largely thanks to clearing out the clutter of unnecessary characters that filled the Neptunia game.The references, while still prominent, were far more tolerable and less abundant thanks to them trying to make it feel like a coherent part of the story, instead of ""Hey, this a game reference. Wasn\'t that funny? HEY, Laugh with me! It was funny, because video games, LAWL!""As for the main villain? I think the writers were aware of how much of a Saturday morning cartoon villain she was and successfully parodied that in the anime. The fact that every encounter with her seems so tongue-in-cheek, it\'s just self-aware of how silly she was in the the first game and used that to their advantage.I see people complain about about how 12 episodes (plus the OVA which is another beast of it\'s own that I won\'t be tackling in this review) just wasn\'t enough to fit 3, 40+ hour games into. I beg to differ. Sure, to an extent, if you want to copy and paste the game stories from all 3 into an anime, yeah, 12 isn\'t enough. But I\'ve rewatched this series multiple times now, and never once has it come off as ""We\'re just making that game\'s story way more animated"" - to me, it comes off as, ""This is how we want to tell the story"" - It\'s a standalone experience separate from the game, and I think it is actually better for doing that. On top of that, as much as I just YEARN for more of this anime, I realize that the 12 episodes made such a special experience because everything was wrapped up nicely in those 12 episodes.

The problem is in the process after translation. The content translates smoothly, but there’s just too much of it and the creators can’t make sense of it.They did make some brilliant decisions. The anime jumps headfirst into the story without exposition. It doesn’t need to. Introducing characters is pointless. If your characters are developed enough, just show them walking around, talking and doing things. We will learn about them as the plot goes on.That movie is brilliant and works. The cast is wonderful. Most of them are archetypes, but they’re deliberate....The key to making these archetypes work is how they relate to their environment. Blanc is your flat-chested stoic girl, but in a happy-go-lucky world she sticks out. Vert’s breasts are an extension of her motherly persona, which sticks out when everyone around her are children. Neptune is the embodiment of the franchise and, in a satirical way, the audience. She’s a lazy airhead who just wants to play games and can’t take anything seriously.Even when characters are similar to each other, there are differences. Uni  is a tsundere like Noire, but she doesn’t have her position of power. So she’s more friendly and easier to get along with. These personalities constantly clash and interact. Although the anime throws all kinds of external challenges at our cast, it never feels like they drive it. Every line of dialogue, every act is modified by the personalities.That’s why the move to more serious ground isn’t stupid. You don’t need realism for effective drama, but characters who feel real enough. The cast of Neptunia is strong, but the poor pacing throws drama way too early.As developed as they are, we still need some time to get to know the cast. There are about 8 characters so, and you can’t make the audience know them in just 6 episodes (especially when there are plenty of action scenes). Already around episode 5 or so, we get dramatic scenes, the world on the brink of extinction and nobody laughing.The drama is ineffective both because of its placement, and how it’s handled. The drama is too serious for its own good. The creators forget they’re dealing with a world inspired by gaming consoles. It’s not like the introduction of seriousness also comes with extra thematic depth. If your drama doesn’t add any depth, just make it as over-the-top as the show itself. It also appears too early, way before the viewer can get a basic understanding of these characters.A departure scene later in the series is great, but that’s because it doesn’t rely on the characters being serious. By the time it arrives we know the characters much better. We saw them on various adventures and learned how their relationships work. It’s also more subdued. The previous drama scenes were overly serious but not over-the-top. Since this one is more subdued by nature, it can tone the ridiculousness down without losing any effect.The franchise’s premise doesn’t sound like it’ll be friendly with tonal shifts. Still, it’s easier to make you care about a bunch of weirdos than it seems. The pacing is too brisk though. The show keeps throwing events and interaction and jokes at you and there’s never time to take it in.There are no build-ups. The story doesn’t build towards a single conclusion. Rather, it follows a collection of arcs that end with the a Huge Dangerous Object. If the series built up towards that conclusion, then the fast pacing would have been easier to take. Since the arcs aren’t really connect, it’s like a show is constantly on fast forward, jumping from one idea to next and showing only beginnings and conclusions.The brisk approach also works against the aesthetic. Neptunia‘s style is cutsie and bright, sometimes too much. The voice actors, especially Neptune’s/Peashy’s/Abnes’ are trapped with a pitch that’s too high. Their performance is suited well to the characters, but plenty of times I wished they’d put on some effect to lower the pitch. It was too much on the ears. Blank and Plutia are a blessing just because they speak in a calmer manner. If the series was a little slower, then the voices wouldn’t feel like an assault. It does get better in the second half though.Despite this small bump, the aesthetics are still one of the franchise’s strong points. The character design is astounding. Every character looks distinct. Even characters who are meant to be similar have their clear and subtle differences which make them unique. The show is moe, of course, but it finds so many variations on it.There’s also the aspect of fanservice. While there are a few uncomfortable moments, the fanservice is well-integrated most of the time. The character design is beautiful, and but the series rarely slows down just to remind us that. It always constructs scenes and shots that both advance the story/characters and let us enjoy the view. It’s also never too profane. The sexuality is elegant, never shoving itself in your face. The characters just happen to look good. The ‘fanservice episode’ is a great example how they do it, and also of the self-aware humor.One thing the anime lacks, compared to the source material is the self-aware humor. It surfaces occasionally and it’s always better than expected. The fanservice episode was great, poking fun at tropes but integrating the personalities into the humor. There isn’t enough of it though. I understand the fear of breaking the fourth wall. It can easily slip into trying too hard. Just look at Deadpool. Neptunia doesn’t have Deadpool‘s macho bullshit, though. It never pretends to be cool (It disregards coolness completely. That’s why everyone is feminine but also sexualized), so it can run wild with the self-awareness. It’ll just be a part of the general absurdity.It’s a curious thing. Here in the West we want our heroines gritty and tough. We love Furiosa and Rey for how macho they are. They scream at men to stop holding their hand and don’t wear skirts. Yet here we have Neptunia, which is a big franchise where all the heroines are unbashedly feminine. There are no apologies here. How can they create a diverse cast of females with both great looks and great personalities while Hollywood directors struggle with one heroine? It’s so pathetic to praise Black Widow when we have the whole cast of Neptunia.The anime is fun, but it feels like there’s more to do with the franchise.3 plushies out of 5 The key to making these archetypes work is how they relate to their environment.

The ‘fanservice episode’ is a great example how they do it, and also of the self-aware humor.One thing the anime lacks, compared to the source material is the self-aware humor. It surfaces occasionally and it’s always better than expected. The fanservice episode was great, poking fun at tropes but integrating the personalities into the humor. There isn’t enough of it though. I understand the fear of breaking the fourth wall. It can easily slip into trying too hard. Just look at Deadpool. Neptunia doesn’t have Deadpool‘s macho bullshit, though. It never pretends to be cool (It disregards coolness completely. That’s why everyone is feminine but also sexualized), so it can run wild with the self-awareness. It’ll just be a part of the general absurdity.It’s a curious thing. Here in the West we want our heroines gritty and tough. We love Furiosa and Rey for how macho they are. They scream at men to stop holding their hand and don’t wear skirts. Yet here we have Neptunia, which is a big franchise where all the heroines are unbashedly feminine. There are no apologies here. How can they create a diverse cast of females with both great looks and great personalities while Hollywood directors struggle with one heroine? It’s so pathetic to praise Black Widow when we have the whole cast of Neptunia.The anime is fun, but it feels like there’s more to do with the franchise.3 plushies out of 5', ""I enjoyed this anime because its has well made characters that make the series very enjoyable to watch and the English voice actors suited the characters very well.Another good aspect of this series is the relations between the main protagonists, they have very refreshing personalities and have very comedic ways of doing things.The art style is very unique with the way they design the characters and how they design the areas in the anime. From episode one I got really into this anime and couldn't stop watching because of the endings of each episode drawing me in to watch more.Overall I would...recommend this series to comedy lovers and people who like cute anime girls with weapons that fight monsters. recommend this series to comedy lovers and people who like cute anime girls with weapons that fight monsters."", ""Now, I wrote a review of this anime on my Humming bird so, if you want a full synopsis of the plot in my own words, go check it out. My username is MatyPatty. Anyway, Hyperdimension Neptunia The Animation was a pleasant surprise but, also a huge guilty pleasure for a gamer such as myself.Story Rating: 6This is definitely an original but, odd plot. Simply imagine your video game console as a cute, anime girl. You'll basically have this anime in a nutshell. If you plan for a lot of explaining and backstory, you'll have to play the games to get it because this...anime does not explain. So, make sure to study up before watching this.My major complaint, and it's pretty common with this anime, is the amount of drama it wants to show. While action drama, I don't mind, drama between characters is the most annoying thing in any entertainment form. You know they'll have a falling out, they get back together and it's like nothing happened. It gets old, pretty fast and you just want them to get back to the comedy, which is where this anime shines through.While, it can try too hard at times, I do like the small little references and jokes they make throughout. Like the names of the CPUs countries rhyming with the console they represent, how clever is that? Of course, that's not why you're watching this anime.  No, no...you're watching it for TITS, TITS, AND MORE TITS! :D Yeah, there's a lot of fan service in this anime but, if you look up the title on Google images, what are you really gonna expect? So, if you're not a fan of ecchis or fanservicy animes then, definitely steer clear from this one cause, every episode you're gonna see their magical girl forms and their breasts will just POP out of the screen and smother you!Animation Rating: 7Thankfully, the animation looks nice and appealing. Of course, it's nothing special and it looks kind of generic at times but, I definitely like the color palette. Nice neon colors and pastels really fit this anime perfectly. The character designs are cute too. Yeah, it's really weird to see your Playstation as a tsun but, hey, they looks flat out adorable. Even when they're in their goddess forms, can't lie, DAMN they fine. And before you ask, no, I am not a 30 year old man looking at lolis. You're looking at a pure, swing both ways female, baby and I ain't afraid to admit half these girls became my waifus! NO REGRETS! We'll get to them later though.Sound Rating: 8God, the soundtrack in this. It's one of those animes where I can listen to the OST and play a few games of League of Legends, it's that good. While the opening and endings are catchy, they're not desk palming, stuck in your head for years catchy. Which is good, cause the last thing I need is a happy go lucky moe opening crammed into my brain again. There's not much to say about the songs themselves so, let's leave it at, they're good.Also, choosing on the sub or dub. I'm gonna have to go with the sub. While i'm sure the english voice actors did their best with what they had, it just didn't sound right to me. Only a few characters managed to sound good but, to spare some of the mediocre acting and voices, I say stick with the Japanese.Character Rating: 8While some of the characters can be kind of annoying and mellow dramatic, it's not to the point where they're unlikable. (expectforonemaybe). However, let's look at them all individually, or at least, the CPUs and their sisters.Neptune is the Goddess of Planeptune and represents the Sega Neptune...yeah, the console that never showed the light of day is our main character. Accompanied by her sister Nepgear, who supposedly represents the Sega Game Gear. They're both cute in their own ways both design and personality but, Neptune kind of goes through an angst fest near the end of the series and it's so annoying. Mostly because it just feels out of character when we saw her in the previous episodes, she wouldn't become so down right distraught over something so, what the f**k.Next is Noire, Goddess of Lastation and if you can't tell, she represents the Playstation 3. Not as clever at the other names, obviously. She also has a sister, Uni, who represents the PSP. They're both the biggest tsun you'll ever meet but, while Noire has a likable personality and funny scenes to back it up, Uni comes off as more annoying and bratty. Yeah, the CPU sisters don't get a lot of screen time which also makes Nepgear look helpless a lot but, the twins weren't annoying at all, I liked them a lot. So, what's the big deal with these two. Ah, whatever.Then there's Blanc, Goddess of Lowee and representation of the Nintendo Wii. Along with her sisters, Rom and Ram, the twins I mentioned, representing the DS. Blanc is one of the more funnier characters, while not looking like it, she has the worst mouth out of the other three and she has a good amount of funny scenes. She's a good character, along with her loli party, who are just as adorable as they look. (What the hell did I just write?)Finally, Vert, Goddess of Leanbox, representing the Xbox. For some reason she doesn't have a sister. I guess it makes sense, Microsoft has yet to make a portable system for the Xbox and I pray TO GOD they don't. Anyway, off topic, about Vert. Oh...how does one describe Vert. Well, one thing's for sure, she's definitely a goddess in my book. Just...ooohhh....MAMA! *Cough*...Sorry.As you can tell, Vert is my favorite. She has the most likable personality out of all of them. While she has signs of maturity and dignity, she's also a freakin' nerd. That's right, Vert's an otaku. While it's not explored much in the anime, in the games she's your basic Fujoshi. Which, I just love so much, makes her so much better and probably the goddess i'd follow in a heartbeat.Enjoyment Rating: 7 While, there were a lot of scenes that made me annoyed or groan at how really fanservicy it was, I found myself laughing and giggling through out most of it. While also 'awww'ing a lot. Call this a complete guilty pleasure but, Hyperdimension Neptunia was definitely a nice surprise. While, not perfect, it was short, sweet, and entertaining.Overall Rating: 7 Now, do I recommend this anime. That's up to personal preference. It's one of those animes that you really just have to watch the first episode and see if you can handle it or not. As a comedy anime, I wish it made more jokes and less drama but, overall, this was definitely a decent anime. If you don't mind big tits bouncing all over your screen, go ahead and watch it. Root for your game consoles and see if they're all what they're made up to be! anime does not explain.

It’s honestly a good anime to watch dubbed if you’re into those. The VAs give emotion to the characters and interject plenty of humor, but also can really give the serious moments depth.Admittedly the first half is...a tad melodramatic, but the second half manages to strike the perfect balance of action, humor and serious moments that make it a beautiful series. I do believe my perception of melodrama could be due to coming in with the expectation of an over-the-too parodic gag anime, but by the Peashy arc that expectation left and I could enjoy it for what it was.The art is beautiful, but I have to deduct a point for the use of CGI, because while it’s not often noticeable, in episodes 3 and 11 they draw attention to it and it is rather atrocious. For the most part, CGI is relegated to faraway shots that are harmless, though. Regardless, it does not mar my enjoyment of this ride through the world of Neptunia, and it’s a great impetus for me to try out the games. Looking at the anime as a stand-alone though (have not played any neptunia games yet) it is good enough to warrant a high score from me. a tad melodramatic, but the second half manages to strike the perfect balance of action, humor and serious moments that make it a beautiful series.

So it might be contrary to your opinions.Honestly, the most I like about this anime is the character, all characters starting from Neptune, Nepgear, Blanc, Noire, Vert and their little sisters made me fall in love at first sight.They are all goddesses who guard their respective regions. Aside from his heavy obligations as a goddess, it turns out that the characters have unique and funny qualities when...they are behind the scenes. they can look very elegant and authoritative when they have to stand as a goddess in front of their people. But beyond that, they are like a teenager who likes to play and has a cheerful nature.The character design is also one of the main reasons I like this anime. The whole thing has a cute and funny style, even the monsters don't look scary at all.The voice actress is very compatible with the nature of each character. Starting from Neptune as a one-san who is a little childish to Nepgear as an imouto who loves her one-sanAltogether, i give it a 9/10 for anime Hyperdimension Neptunia they are behind the scenes. they can look very elegant and authoritative when they have to stand as a goddess in front of their people.

One thing I will say, and I\'m not sure how popular of an opinion this is, but I could really have cared less for their whole ""Goddess"" forms and the like. Yeah they were cool, but I much prefer their base...forms.So in closing, it was fun overall. And Nep DID make me laugh with her antics. That\'s something I can\'t say for too much else these days.

Hope it helped a little.', ""Sadly I am not one of the people who played the game, and not one of these people who watch an anime looking for my potential waifu, so this anime loses points pretty much as quickly as it starts.   Watching it looks like it is there to appeal to guys who like cute anime girls, and girls who want to see girls as heroines in scenarios.As the anime moves on we see the failures of different CPUs from gaming, laziness, disorganization, etc.   As none of the CPUs are perfect.    As the show goes on, we see how they...have to work together to survive and fight the forces trying to overthrow them.   We also see the friction as events happen that are perfectly avoidable, but as they are girls you know it will be make-up and smile at the end of it.The storyline is only different in the CPUs not being adventurers, and the anime to me is looking mainly at promoting the loli hunters and pre-loli who like young girls, especially during goddess transformations.   In general, it is just the same old derivative Isekai/mecha we see so often, people have to go up against a bad guy, but of course, let the bad guy like the mouse cross borders without being stopped when on all wanted lists.Add to that with the goddess mode OP, it means your dealing with 4 OP characters not just 1, like normal Isekai/fantasy/magic animes which kinda makes it lamer to me.   This then increases again, as their little sisters transform.  Also, stupid things when at risk of death, they are asking for wifi, thinking of gaming, etc, it just feels like cheap tropey trash, especially with the sailor moon style transformations.   Some people like that, I don't.   Neither did i find it generally particularly funny with the mismatched pairings and the forcing of them together, even though they don't want to be.The dialogue is poor, the story is poor, the sound and art are mediocre at best with the ecchi moments your Funimation style breasts and groins, with no nipples to not offend people,  but the fact is the enjoyment and overall for me, all reflective of a poor story, poor dialogue, derivative anime, with generic characters and it not being an anime, with any target at me, any anime which is an all-guy sausage fest, or all-girl fish fest, just does very little for me,   As making an anime all one sex, or dominating one sex, just feels like trash to me. it also takes from methods in the story, and avenues.Add opponents who can become gods/CPUs too, just defy any logic with some of their enemies.   If share = power, then someone with no share as a god would have no power being the previous idea, which is quickly ignored in the same episode it states.    Add that too when characters stand around as a teammate is beaten, just the idea of showing a transformation, sucked as just slowed things.   Would you let someone potentially die that way? it may be used as a need to transform tropey Goku/Frieza style, but just sucked.Add vert and nepgear feeling almost loli-yuri time. or how some stranger in your house rips up your power lead, plays up coz, not dinner time, etc. Add to that, not killing boss enemies like the witch type woman, screams crap plotline, as is waiting for someone to come back again the same way.  With the eggplant episode there for boy fans in my mind,  however, it stayed as a poor anime.So after 7 episodes in, I give up on the show as there's a level of boredom and annoyance, trope and ecchi with no story that even I won't watch.   It doesn't try and hide what it is as a pile of crap either, from letting pishi run riot and be a brat, then ganging up on the person attempting to discipline her and alter the behavior, to announcing it is a fanboy episode.

But you're not here for the story. You're here for cool character designs, action, great seiyuu cast, nice visuals and moe.

Especially with character designs this good (if we disregard fanservice that is). Music is also good. And that's pretty much everything positive that can be said about this.Story absolutely sucks, but sometimes it's also a bit entertaining in it's suckage. Other than retarded unnecessary fanservice, by far...the worst part is the portrayal of the gay robot character. As well as the portrayal of the final antagonist, her personality and motivation. I mean it's not bad, it's so fucking horrible that it's not even funny. If that happened in first episode rather than last I would've dropped this right there and then.
