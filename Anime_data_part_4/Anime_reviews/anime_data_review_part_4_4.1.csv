Starmyu in Halloween,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36537/Starmyu_in_Halloween,"[""Reason for Watching: The main series is rather fun, I am kind of fond of this show, this OVA looks interesting too.TL;DR; OVA is a fun story that showcases the characters outside of their school curriculum which has no impact on the main series' story.Well, Art and Sound have similar standard to the main series, so I won't elaborate any more than that the Halloween themed musicals are entertaining.Story and Character-Story-wise, this is a fun, interesting story about Halloween that is like a little peek into the characters' life outside of their school environment. Is refreshing to see how they interact with each other...and the fun storylines also bring out their connections with each other really well. There main mix here is definitely Comedy and Slice of Life. The lightheartedness of the OVA presented the characters with more familiarity, where they acted more like the kids/young adults that they are. There is of course no character developments here, but the insight of the characters' bonds are amusing to watch. and the fun storylines also bring out their connections with each other really well.

Shin Hokuto no Ken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1357/Shin_Hokuto_no_Ken,"[""Okay, I know a lot of people out there think that Fist of the North Star is a fantastic series with tons of ultra-violence in it.  Well, at least that's what some people told me about it however, after this little run-in I have to say, I'm never going to be watching any series like this again.Story:  Well, the story simply put is bad, close to unwatchable.  It's set in a post-apocalyptic world in which people beat the living crap out of each other with martial arts.  Our hero, Kenshiro, is the greatest martial artist on the block because he knows...the Fist of the North Star and therefore cannot be injured.  Very very weak plotwise.The beginning of the first episode is where it all starts to go downhill in a hurry, you have to listen to the dialogue which is terrible.  I watched the dubbed version so maybe the sub is better but I doubt it, it's hard to take crap and make it into something good.However, it must be said that the second and third episodes are distinctively better in the story category but not by much. (1000 times 0 is still 0.)  So really, you don't want to pick up this anime for a good story.  No, people out there watch Fist of the North Star for violence, which I've got to say, isn't very good either.Kenshiro is an unstoppable brick wall and every fight, besides the last, is over in a matter of seconds.  He hits a pressure point on their head and then they blow up sending blood and guts everywhere, not much for fighting.  Even when they actually do have a real fight, it is still ridiculously unrealistic and it turned me off.Art: Well, the art's pretty good.  It matches the art of the manga and tweaks it a little bit making it look prettier and more full of colors, except when they go into the 3D look.  I don't know what it is with animators wanted to do things in both 2D and 3D but it turns me off, Fist of the North Star is no different.Some shows seem to be able to pull off bringing the two worlds of 3D and 2D animation together, but this is not one of them.  Everytime it shows the landscape it's nothing but poorly rendered sand and nothing else, I know that they are in a Post-Apocalyptic world but there would be at least something to break up the monotony every once and a while.  However, the makers of this series did a cop out on the 3D so there's nothing to really see.It's truly depressing because without all the 3D that they threw in, I might've given this series an 8 or 9 in the animation department but since it had it, and it clashes so badly together, I had to drop it down.Sound:  The sound is right next to being completely and utterly terrible.  The opening theme is alright and the soundeffects of people's heads exploding are well done.  But the voices are hideous, mainly because of what they're saying, and there's really no music whatsoever throughout the series.  Every once and a while a heavy guitar rift will start playing in the background of a fight scene but these always seem to be timed badly and are few and far between.Character: What character?  The characters are severely lacking in the personality department.  It's almost as though they reached into a bag of over-used anime cliches and handed them out to the characters like candy.  Kenshiro is the badass strong silent type, who never gets hurt.  Sara is the buxom healer.  And I can't even mention all the stupid but powerful henchmen that proliferate this anime.  But the list goes on and on.  It made me sick.I guess the character designs are fairly interesting but the characters themselves could have used quite a bit more personality.  Throughout the series they just acted like robots, and annoying robots at that.Enjoyment: If you can't tell, I did not like this anime.  It had a lot of potential for being good but the writing and everything else just tore that potential to pieces.Overall:  I'd say stay away from this anime unless perhaps you've seen the other Fists of the North Star, then you might enjoy this one.  Your average anime fan however I think will hate this anime almost as much as I did.  I guess that if you really have absolutely nothing better to do on a rainy day you could check this one out, although you probably won't enjoy it at least you get to see people's heads explode. the Fist of the North Star and therefore cannot be injured.

Basically story is post-apocalyptic with martial arts being the main defense/offense for all rogue citizens. There are certain martial artists that practice Hokuto style which is the ""creme of the crop"" the type of martial arts that can debilitate, kill or heal others with a single touch. A wandering traveler, Kenishiro meets and decides to help save a country from a false leader.Story: 8/10- it\'s a classic, straight up action martial arts anime with a simple to follow story line and lots of violence.Art: 9/10- A great thing about OVAs is...that animation is always brought up a level, with a lot of detail and clarity involved.Sound: 9/10- I love Gackt (which is the intro & outro songs) plus who doesn\'t love ""Watatata!!!""Character: 7/10- Not a whole lotta development for characters, but they\'re still likable and you want Ken to succeed in all he does.Enjoyment/Overall: 8/10- I love this story, action and strength of martial arts, so its an enjoyable OVA for me. that animation is always brought up a level, with a lot of detail and clarity involved.Sound: 9/10- I love Gackt (which is the intro & outro songs) plus who doesn\'t love ""Watatata!!!""Character: 7/10- Not a whole lotta development for characters, but they\'re still likable and you want Ken to succeed in all he does.Enjoyment/Overall: 8/10- I love this story, action and strength of martial arts, so its an enjoyable OVA for me.', ""Throughout the years, when long time anime fans in my group would get together with intentions on discussing some of the most brutal, and violent anime titles to ever exist. Fist of the North Star aka Hokuto No Ken was one of the titles that would always come up. The series and movies were the very definition of gratuitous violence. The New Fist of the North Star continues to follow that bloody path packing a little more depth than the original movie. There is a small amount of substance to be found, and the subject it does hit on can be frightening.The series does have...a stable plot overall. At least one of the characters fill his role in pushing the story and delivering a very realistic plot twist. The main character Kenshiro, even though he's the hero of the story is kind of overshadowed. Kenshiro is mainly present to deliver final justice, by engaging in some uninspired hand to hand battles. However, he is still very easy to cheer for. Kenshiro appears to almost be an antihero with his merciless streak, but when looking at the crimes committed by the villains; their very gruesome and painful deaths are well deserved. He also delivers some pretty good lines before delivering execution. The second main character named Tobi proves to be the most interesting with his transition that I refuse to spoil.This is a very violent series, this is a point that must be driven home for those whom shun these type of shows. For those that love it brace yourselves, because it maintains the brutal tone almost completely throughout. Fist of the North Star knows what it wants to be and the comedy is kept very low. The fight scenes are very well detailed with its gore. You practically get the whole nine yards: decapitations, bodies chopped in half, brains and guts exploding out of people left and right, brutal deaths by various weapons with lots of blood. I believe this series is a gore hounds wet dream. Plus you get quite a bit of fan service.The original movie gave some detail but this series somewhat paints a better picture of the misery taking place in this world. The rulers are very evil and abusive to the weak. Plus, you see the negative effects taking place with the people and how it influences their behavior.The apex of the series to me is the depiction of people's belief in a higher power. I believe this is the most over looked point of the series. The writers hit the mark to me by displaying the fanaticism in a higher power when people have lost all hope, and their only salvation is to believe in a god; the thing that helps this theme work better is the fact there is a god they can actually see, which helps give them the will to fight and die, because they believe they're going to end up in god's hands. This makes their fanatical ways all the more believable.Animation and artwork is a mixed bag here. As the series went on I noticed a decline in both. The character designs are very good, especially with the women(but then again isn't it always?), but I did notice it wasn't consistent. Sometimes characters would appear bigger than what they really were, and there wasn't too much variety in generic characters. The animation was hurt badly with the use of CGI which ruined some of the backgrounds.The characters also seemed too stiff and lacked some movement, especially during the fights. The animation didn't really flow well at all. There are also a large use of stills and some reused scenes. As always, music is subjective but I didn't find the rock soundtrack to be anything special.The New Fist of the North Star could have been a very well above average series but several other things dragged it down; such as the ending and the female lead Sara. She served a small purpose, but I found her personality at the end to be too unrealistic. This also goes for Kenshiro as well. I will also mention that there is a non too graphic rape scene.Overall, I don't find the series to be bad. It's good if you're looking for some gory fight scenes. As a matter of fact, along with fans of the franchise, those are the only people I would recommend this to.Highs: Lots of action, plot twist, interesting and realistic themeLows: Gratuitous violence will put off some, weak ending, sub par animation, missed potential a stable plot overall.

There's pretty much no animation in it. Not worth the few minutes it takes.The plot is the same as any of the plots used throughout Hokuto no Ken. Bad guys enslave innocent villagers, innocent villagers try to find peace and get slaughtered, Kenshiro avenges them by painting the walls with the innards of the baddies. I watched all the episodes in the original series, and it really was just that over and over again, just with a new, more powerful main villain to replace the last.I think the only...real reason people watch Hokuto no Ken is to see people get axed in the back, showered with arrows, slashed apart, and to see heads explode... And I suppose you'll find that here. Senseless, excessive violence with a weak plot.I don't know exactly how long it's been since the world ended (or if it was mentioned, I forgot), but it's probably been at least 10 years judging by Lynn's age... Kenshiro's name spread across the lands and instilled fear in gangs everywhere. He defeated every great power. I really don't get why they'd still dare try to mess with peace when they're guaranteed certain death. Really, he defeated the baddest of bad in Hokuto no Ken 2. I suppose what these OVAs are saying is that the series will never have a true ending.Well, it's kind of entertaining to watch.

В итоге эмоции в конце одолевали больше чем какой-нибудь Kanon, или Elfen Lied. Что же мы видим тут:•\tСэю, главный сэю упущен, да они взяли хорошего сэю, но он вообще не подходит Кену.•\tСюжет, создатели абсолютно забили на все что мог Кенширо в конце второго сезона, да даже в середине первого.•\tМузыка, какой то невнятный метал, который как бы ни идет Hokuto no Ken•\tПлохое 3д, если не умели в него, так зачем пихать.В итоге это хуже...заурядного эпизода первого сезона, никому не рекомендую смотреть.In EnglishHokuto no Ken is one of the first (if not the first) ""pretentious"" titles, the plot there was not important, the characters were important, how they behave, and under what music, they behave.

What do we see here:• Sayu, the chief seya was missed, but they took a good seya, but he does not fit Ken at all.• The plot, the creators absolutely scored on everything that Kenshiro could at the end of the second season, and even in the middle of the first.• Music, some kind of indistinct metal, which no matter how it goes Hokuto no Ken• Bad 3d, if you did not know how to do it, so why shove it.In the end, this is worse than the ordinary episode of the first season, I do not recommend anyone to watch. заурядного эпизода первого сезона, никому не рекомендую смотреть.In EnglishHokuto no Ken is one of the first (if not the first) ""pretentious"" titles, the plot there was not important, the characters were important, how they behave, and under what music, they behave.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------OKAY THEN. I accidentally refreshed the bloody page while writing this review, so here it goes again.First thing I have to mention that this Hokuto No Ken is essentially very different one. Rather than sequel, imagine it as alternative universe one. It\'s has very grim, depressive, dark and very heavy atmosphere around this tine. In a sense similar to another anime called ""Zettai Karen Children"" which also has dark spin-off. So rather comparing it to main series I\'ll have to review it as standalone.Before I\'m going to...overall comments and the good things about Shin Hokuto No Ken, I\'ll have to get off my chest 2 things I did\'t enjoy in this piece of work. First would be the ""Mad Max"" thematic (obviously post-nuclear world filled with deserts, punks, bikes and punkish machines were around in first season as well, but here it felt more in my face), which I was not fond of. Second would be CG, if mad max video game would be done by second-hand developers in early 2000\'s. That\'s how it would look like. Camera spans and scenery was acceptable to some extent. But cars and bikes were bloody ugly. Character art or battles were quite great.So, to the main dish now. I absolutely loved the dark, grim and depressive atmosphere it had going here. I\'m sucker for such types as I\'m depressive myself, heh. So in my opinion it was presented in a really satisfying way.Story I did like for most part. It was more mature yet still cliched (I like stereotypes, cliches, fanservice, tropes, traditional genre combinations ""generic"" if done the way I like or well ""clicks with me"") Story gave you Ken\'s adventure and as always he helps someone, but this time around we get to see some naked tits and pseudo-violation along side that AMAZING gore. Gore was bloody beautiful on this one. There was also a specific scene in this anime that I don\'t wanna mention because of the spoiling to some extent. But it can be found on my MAL entry under (more). That specific scene was absolutely satisfying and epic. Felt as time really has passed from Ken era. Yet still, story felt quite western\'ish and weakest aspect of this 3 hour Hokuto.This part also brings me a little funny thing about the story. I found it a bit silly how post-hokuto no ken martial arts have surfaced as if tens of years had passed after season 2. But that\'s why I said it\'s better to imagine it as alternate universe.Characters. Ken was quite a silent badass this time around, he definitely had this oozing aura of power as well. (not that was literally shown, but the general feel). Quite an opposite to a failure of 2nd season. Aside that, we had the usual thugs, some absolutely ""celestial ruler"" stereotype wimp and a rogue martial artist who does not abide the code. Fights were minimal but quite cool overall. This time it felt battles focus was shown in general method rather than Ken specific. Again, gore was great. Main villain felt like a very evil stressball who really ""held back"" his emotions. Doing something against his nature. In a sense at least, his motivation or backstory was somewhat silly, but for most part he was okay character.Music and soundtrack I did not particularly enjoy, not my cup of tea. It was some sort of hard-boiled  samurai-esque.So in overall I must way it was good 3 hour experience. And simply because it hit my ""sweet spots"" I praised it with my final score. Not sure if forgot anything important to mention, but that\'s how my reviews toddle along. overall comments and the good things about Shin Hokuto No Ken, I\'ll have to get off my chest 2 things I did\'t enjoy in this piece of work.

He is a self-righteous individual who plays the role of a vigilante that punishes those that are evil. Why do I compare him to a God? Because once you have challenged his fist and if you have angered him then your fate is sealed. And that fate can only be death. Aside from Kenshiro and his main enemies, the plot is not that interesting and although gore, violence, and bloodshed can be seen throughout these three episodes, nudity or sexual abuse was left out. Even the scene in which Sarah loses her virginity is left...out due to no apparent reason other than the spectator has no wish to see other dirty facades of that reality. If you are going to build a realistic dystopia then do not leave out details that might reveal once more just how hopeless is the world in which Kenshiro resides. out due to no apparent reason other than the spectator has no wish to see other dirty facades of that reality. If you are going to build a realistic dystopia then do not leave out details that might reveal once more just how hopeless is the world in which Kenshiro resides.', '""Shin Hokuto no Ken"" was probably the coolest thing ever for the fans of the series when it released in 2003, but in the current year, it holds up worse than the original series. Animation would have been great if they stuck just with 2D, but for some reason they mixed in 3D and that mix doesn\'t look all that good for the most of the time.Takehito Koyasu does his best as Kenshiro, but can\'t hold a candle to Akira Kamiya and Kenshiro as a character feels more detached from the rest of the characters than he ever did in the past. He\'s reduced...to a simple shounen protagonist.The actions is admittedly cool, but I\'m still not sold on showing the violence instead of stylizing it like in the original series.

Thermae Romae,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12321/Thermae_Romae,"['It’s not every day you run into shows that are just plain eccentric, especially one that\'s centered on baths. Well, that’s exactly what happened to me, thanks to a little TV special I stumbled upon called Thermae Romae, based on Mari Yamazaki’s award-winning manga of the same name. It may seem like just another low-quality show with no point whatsoever, but Thermae Romae is a fairly humorous show that has a surprising amount of depth to it. Set in ancient Rome, it follows the bizarre, time-trotting adventures of public bath architect Lucius Modestus to modern-day Japan.Despite the seemingly dumb premise, Thermae Romae’s story is entertaining...in its own right. Using time travel as a plot device is a pretty unique and comical way to teach people some casual, though intriguing facts about both Japanese and ancient Roman cultures. What’s great about Thermae Romae is that it doesn’t beat around the bush and gets straight to the point in exploring the similarities and differences between Roman and Japanese baths.What’s the most enjoyable about Thermae Romae are Lucius’ reactions whenever he periodically has glimpses of a different and significantly more advanced society than his own. You could say the show indirectly addresses the issue of how a foreigner would react in a relatively unknown land, due to the extreme culture shock they’re experiencing, and vice versa. From generating your voice through an electric fan to having an exaggerated reaction to eating not-so-instant ramen for the first time; somebody’s bound to do one of these things or something similar when they’re put in the same situation as Lucius. Hell, I haven’t been to Japan yet, but I bet my first time will resemble the latter. Like something trivial as being astonished with voice-operated toilets or bidets…and the Japanese natives would just look at me like I’m crazy. It’s moments like this that make watching Thermae Romae amusing.From a distance, it’s easy to dismiss Thermae Romae’s animation as terrible, but the show is more concerned with the method it presents itself. The flash animation style could be compared to other similar shows like it; FX’s Archer comes to mind or basically anything from Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim, such as Sealab 2021 or Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Also, the variations between the character designs is as deliberate as they get, serving to denote the physical, cultural disconnect between Japan and Rome. And probably, on a smaller note, poke some fun at the different drawing styles used by various animation publications.Thermae Romae’s notable style fits the light-hearted, intentional tone it’s going for, I think. The classical themes help with that as well, and the appropriate one plays at just the right time. Some noteworthy ones include Richard Wagner\'s ""Ride of the Valkyries"" and Tchaikovsky\'s ""Nutcracker."" Chatmonchy’s ED song, “Thermae Roman” sounds excellent as well. Sure, the animation looks stilted. Environment’s not detailed enough. It looks unappealing. But, the animation does succeed in producing its intended comedic effect, which I think a show like this can definitely get away with.Thermae Romae is one weird anime; probably the weirdest I’ve seen in a long while. It’s one of those shows that, at first, is difficult to pinpoint whether it’s amazing, awful or even both. Still, I enjoyed it for what it was, and what it lacks in animation, it certainly makes up for in substance. I can’t exactly recommend this type of show to everyone, though if you want to take a break from the more self-serious, dramatic type of shows, Thermae Romae is a good though surreal change of pace. I’m willing to go so far as to say that Thermae Romae has got heart, and you’re more than welcome to try it out to see if you have the same reactions as mine. Besides, 3 episodes (or 6-part, 10-minute chunks if you prefer it that way) couldn’t hurt, right?On a slightly related note, I simply can’t wait for that live-action movie adaptation they’ve been talking about. in its own right.

The story is pretty simple but who could hate that. It's short and sweet, straight to the point. There aren't many characters really but the main one is great.

There is no hiding that fact at this point. This is one of the reasons I\'m so drawn to anime and always will side with anime over American comics. Believe it or not, American comics used to have detective stories, horror, romance, and categories besides spandex wearing super heroes back in the 1920s-1940s. The diversity of American comics was murdered forever in 1954 with the passing of ""The Comic Code"". It was decided by the Eisenhower Administration  that comics should only be for little kids and comics aimed at older audiences would make Americans gay! Thanks Ike!...All genres besides the costumed hero were instantly banned. The costumed heroes became more kid friendly and we got the ""golly gee willikers"" bullshit  known as The Silver Age. By the time the code was FINALLY  lifted in the  1980s, those other genres had been gone for so long that it was decided they weren\'t worth bringing back. That\'s why every American comic to this day is basically the same fucking thing with only a couple exceptions.Japan never had the same problem. Manga and anime can be about absolutely ANYTHING! A medieval merchant and a Wolf goddess team up to teach economics. A bunch of Germans in space hold lengthy political discussions in a boardroom. Girls transform into fucking WW2 battleships and fight each other. This is all fair game in the world of anime! This brings us to today\'s ABSURD topic.Story:Thermae Romae is a story about an ancient Roman architect who designs bath houses. One day, he gets sucked through a drain and winds up in current day Japan. Our Roman hero is amazed by all the technology, but is also comforted by the similarity to Roman bath houses. This is a comedy anime all about comparing Roman bath houses to Japanese bath houses. A continuing theme is that Japan is the only country in the modern world that still really loves bath houses. In a way, this makes Japan the successor to Roman Civilization and makes Tokyo the 3rd Rome. I just felt a huge disturbance in the force! It\'s as if 147 million people in Eastern Europe cried out in anger and were suddenly triggered.Characters:Our main hero is the Roman architect Lucius. He is very serious all the time and dismissive at first towards non-Romans like the Japanese. He is a dutiful citizen of the Roman Empire and extremely dedicated to his craft. His overly serious nature and ""fish out of water"" status is the basis of virtually all of the series\' comedy.Art:The art is flash animation and as pointed out by previous reviewers, it looks like Japanese Archer. Seriously.Music:The entire soundtrack is lifted classical music. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t use this music quite as effectively  as Galactic Heroes does. The selection often seems completely random. I\'ll be watching a scene and think ""Hey it\'s Verdi\'s Requiem! I love that piece...but I don\'t know why they\'re playing it at this time.""Overall:Dmitri: Vladimir Vladimirovich! Urgent news! I have discovered anime that claims Japan is only country that loves bath houses and is the cultural successor to Rome.Vladimir: Blasphemy! Moscow is 3rd Rome! Those Japanese savages don\'t know how to bath house! They don\'t even beat the shit out each other with tree branches! How can you have a bath without branch beatings! This will not stand!

The storyline compares and contrasts Japan and ancient Rome in regards to their bath culture. I applaud the attempt to make the subject matter interesting but I am also glad this lasted only the few episodes that it did. The two flaws in the story line are the fact that it is repetitive and the fact that despite the fact it makes the subject some what interesting I doubt very few people are going to remember that many historical facts from the show.I loved the style of the artwork but hated how this...whole thing was animated. The animation made it seem like they did cheep tracings from the original material and story boarded it without any real smooth transitions. One thing I liked was how certain characters showed up in different places and the humor was enough to help me finish this series despite how short it is. I think my favorite part is the ending music though and music tends to not stand out for me.Thermae Roma is a show that I don't think I'll pick up again unless I am showing it to a class for educational purposes. It is also an Anime that I don't think is for everyone. There is plenty of historical fiction out there that is more interesting. The blame doesn't lie with the subject matter because I've seen “Hanasaku Iroha” and I felt like I had more fun learning about Japanese inns by watching that. I also feel like I'll remember what I learned for a long time.I also had a problem with the characterization in the show. The main character seemed really dumb yet he was supposed to be a major architect in Roman history. I can't place my finger exactly on what bothered me other then that. whole thing was animated.

It slowly progresses in scale of bathroom implementation, HILARIOUS subtle jokes and wonderfully relaxing calming tone.The art, out of the hundreds of animes i've seen. This is truly my favourite art, during the first episode it felt awkward and rigid to get used to. But by the second episode i really really...liked how it complimented the story and it just felt comical and calming at the same time.The music in this anime was 10/10 and did something that has never been done before for me. It made me enjoy classical music. The calming violins in the background, the running commentary and the visualization of that music through setting was spectacular. It made me feel like i was drinking a hot drink and calmed my mind. I had a headache before watching this anime and now it's gone, though I have no idea if these two things are related but i'm pretty sure they are.The portrayal of the characters in this movie was splendid. The running commentary between how the main character interacts with secondary characters in Japanese society and Roman society. Adding a sort of mystery towards the background of people and focusing more about the current content as to how they would engage with ridiculous circumstances.I feel so happy just watching this animeit makes me smile.There's no other masterpiece like it.10/10 for everything liked how it complimented the story and it just felt comical and calming at the same time.The music in this anime was 10/10 and did something that has never been done before for me.

The amount of background gags and non sequiturs they snuck into these three episodes is astronomical. Is it as good as the remake? Absolutely not, its too short to adapt much of the manga, and this lack of time means that the adaptation cannot delve as deep into Lucius\'s imposter syndrome and despair, and cannot spend as much time legitimately teaching the audience about Japanese bath houses and bathing culture.In general I don\'t care about the sub vs dub debate, they\'re cartoons, so it generally doesn\'t matter.

It revolves around the love between Lum and Ataru, who amidst all their fights and perils against each other, are still married and accompanied by a wide variety of supporting characters, Ataru\'s classmates, Megane, Perm, Shinobu who tell Lum of a red piece of string that bonds lovers together. The gang then all go to Tomoniki land, a newly opened theme park in the fictional town of Tomobiki. Lum and Ataru explore their newfound environment as the...rest of Ataru\'s friends go explore the more supernatural elements of the park. They are all soon invited to a magic show, where Ataru then volunteers himself to one of the Magicians tricks. Amidst the Magicians performance, he suddenly vanishes leaving Ataru exposed as a pink hippo. The rest of the film follows around Ataru\'s friends, Ms. Sakura, Cherry, Ataru\'s parents and Lum all trying to find a way for Ataru to return back to normal, whilst Lum defends her husband and disembarks to fight off the mysterious shape shifting magician. Urusei Yatsura 3: Remember my Love is a tale of love and adventure, a twisted reality of all things abnormal and wacky, which fits into tone of the Urusei  Yatsura series. It has its humorous bits and darks bits, but most importantly it has the wide array of characters from the Yatsura franchise, all with their wacky and miscellaneous personalities. Remember my love is the series standard of all Yatsura films, which you would typically expect out of the Urusei Yatsura franchise. This doesn\'t mean its the best nor worst film in the series, but a solid film on its own and one that holds testament under the Urusei yatsura name. The only thing I slightly disregard about the film is that I do think that the ending was quite weak, not to spoil it for a 35+ year old anime movie, but I do think that you the viewer should come to your own conclusions about it. So my recommendation is that if you love the Yatsura franchise or enjoy a classic anime film from time to time, this film alongside Beautiful dreamer is what I would recommend watching.A very solid 7/10 from me rest of Ataru\'s friends go explore the more supernatural elements of the park.

The only thing I slightly disregard about the film is that I do think that the ending was quite weak, not to spoil it for a 35+ year old anime movie, but I do think that you the viewer should come to your own conclusions about it. So my recommendation is that if you love the Yatsura franchise or enjoy a classic anime film from time to time, this film alongside Beautiful dreamer is what I would recommend watching.A very solid 7/10 from me', 'Urusei Yatsura Movie 3: Remember My love is a decently excecuted movie. The story takes place around 1985 and this time it centers mostly on our lovely alien girl Lum instead of our womanizer Ataru.As far as the story goes, it was okay. The plot felt a bit boring in the first half since nothing major happened, but things started to become interesting in the second half. A thing this movie missed out on where the amount of jokes they could have done. If you are familiar with the series, you would a expect lot of jokes, however at certain situations in this movie instead...of making a lighthearted joke, you would see a somewhat dramatic moment. Also there were some moments that were rather anticlimatic such as the defeat of the antagonist or how Ataru\'s problem was resolved instead of maade full use of in the movie to advance the plot. But the movie doesn\'t only have downsides, there were some rather well good parts such as the concept of losing a good friend was rather well executed.The art as far as it goes, is probably the strongest point of this movie. This movie has some great visuals such as the chasing scene and the scenes at the festival. As for the sound, there were more english songs than I would have expected but I must say they somewhat fitted the movie.Quite a lot of characters made their appearances at the first half of the movie and almost each had their own moment to shine, which I found rather good. Lum got the spotlight, where we also get some scenes to see of Lum as baby and child which were adorable.I did enjoy this movie even though the first half made the movie seem like a stretched out episode, but the second half made that up by revealing some plottwists that were unexpected and some interesting moments. The visuals also helped a lot as the great visuals were pleasing to see.Even though this movie isn\'t as good storywise as the first two Urusei Yatsura movies (""Only you"" and ""Beautiful Dreamer""), It was pretty decent. However this movie has in my opinion almost no memorable scenes which will make this easily forgettable compared to some of the other movies.Considering it was the movie after the second movie which most people view as one of the best movies, this one still holds its own spot as a decent movie in my opinion and is not overshadowed by any means. of making a lighthearted joke, you would see a somewhat dramatic moment.

In terms of plot, this is definitely the weakest of the three movies I\'ve seen so far. It doesn\'t have much going for it, and I would say that the first film is better than this one, but only slightly. Minor spoilers in this review. In 1967, a wicked witch who was connected to Lum\'s family wasn\'t invited to see Lum\'s birth. This, for some reason, makes her furious. So in return, the witch creates a curse on Lum that will always cause her misfortune in love....She will never find happiness with her true love. The curse was placed into an orb, and many centuries later, it was discovered by a young boy. The specific year was 2267, just in case you were curious.Come to present day, present time 1985. The town of Tomobiki creates a new amusement park called ""Tomobiki Marchenland."" Lum thinks it would be an excellent idea to bring her piece of human garbage darling, Ataru Moroboshi, along for a date. Lum is such a sweetheart. Everyone else in Ataru and Lum\'s class come along as well even though none of the supporting characters have no significance to the overall plot whatsoever. Enter the new antagonists, Ruu and his servant Oshima. Two characters who both have weak and strange character motivations that are explained later in the film. Things do take a turn for the worse when Ataru volunteers for a magic trick and is transformed into a pink hippo. It\'s later explained why this happens, but the entire conflict between Ruu and the main characters is pretty lame and underwhelming. The stakes are not that high in this film.I would compare Ruu to Mujaki, the antagonist of the previous film, except Ruu is not as powerful and not as well written. They do have similar abilities of altering time and space, but Ruu\'s powers don\'t mess with your mind as much. The only thing in this film that I believe is worth mentioning is the chase scene between Lum and Ruu. They go all over the town of Tomobiki. They go inside of a Fun House and the mirrors surrounding them look great. You see the both of them in so many different angles and positions. They end up flying downtown and the scene was beautifully drawn and animated. That\'s the only thing noteworthy about this film. It\'s a pretty generic film and after watching Beautiful Dreamer, it was just disappointing and not entertaining. I can\'t be too harsh, because it\'s Urusei Yatsura, so if you love the series enough you\'re going to watch this film, regardless. I\'ll admit, Hideaki Anno did a superb job animating some of sequences, good job on his part. The music is good. ""Born to be Free"" is probably my favorite song in the soundtrack. The other songs are pretty mediocre. This movie gets a 6 out of 10. I would put it below the first film, but the difference in quality is not that big.Movies: 3 < 1 < 2Story: 4/10Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Character: 6/10Enjoyment: 5/10Overall: 6/10 She will never find happiness with her true love.

Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase,https://myanimelist.net/anime/343/Tsukuyomi__Moon_Phase,"[""This series is for those who prefer their vampires to be cute as kittens more often than they are dark and brooding. The mood of the series, like Hazuki's personalities, tend to alternate between the two, although it generally works better when emphasizing the moe aspects, which it does a lot. That said, people with an aversion to cat-eared girls and little-sister types are advised to stay far away.The plot tends to switch between stretches of seriousness and levity: the first two episodes deal with Hazuki meeting Kohei and escaping the castle, then settling into a silly daily routine before dealing with more villains a...few episodes later. The story has some difficulty balancing character and relationship developments with plot progression unless it separates such things into different episodes. Perhaps this is why, despite several of the tragedies that various characters suffer, there is little emotional draw to them. Also, as with many adaptations of unfinished manga, a number of plot threads are left untied with the series conclusion, although the series does conclude solidly enough.The cast are entertaining, although some people may find a number of the younger females straddle the line between adorable and irritating. Hazuki starts off as a stubborn and slightly spoiled little girl, but grows into more of a kinder, caring person over the course of the series. Kohei is the typical kind-hearted and honest but unimpressive boy with an unusual ability/curse that you've seen in so many other series. The supporting cast brings a bit of liveliness to the show. Haiji brings a bit of humor as Hazuki's cat-like pet, frequently scolding her master's servant Kohei. Seiji brings a bit of class as the cool-looking and talented relative of Kohei. The best characters, though, are probably Ryuhei and Elfriede, who regularly tease the lead characters, but also connect to each other on a deeper level and share some of the most tender moments in the series.One can't really talk about Moon Phase without mentioning it's stylistic quirks. As with pretty much any work directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, one should expect interesting and different uses of light and color in many scenes throughout. The typical depiction of the house were much of the story occurs is also diplayed much like a dollhouse, opened up so as to see in all the rooms at once. Also, infamously, yellow washpans are known to come crashing down on various characters for comedic effect.Designs for the characters are crisp, and backgrounds are appropriately detailed. Action scenes may not be breath-taking, but they are more than adequate for the task they mean to achieve. While the initial television episodes did have a few problems during important scenes, these were all rectified in the DVD release.Voice work for both languages is well done, although Monica Rial can't quite match the level of cuteness that Chiwa Saito attained playing Hazuki (a minor issue). Background music for the episodes is chosen appropriately for the scene, although it is at times a little overbearing. The dark scenes are supported by haunting and gothic-sounding tones, while the cheery moments are punctuated by spunky and playful tunes. The most catchy song (for good or bad) is absolutely the opening theme, &quot;Neko Mimi Mode De&quot;. It's particularly surprising when it drastically interrupts the gloomy introductory scene of the first episode with it's bubbly, sugary tune, simplistic lyrics, and bright colors. The song is devastatingly appropriate for the show. A couple of episodes have an alternate opening song, &quot;Tsukuyomi Mode&quot;, that is less syrupy and not so overly energetic, but similar. The closer, on the other hand, is slightly melancholy and more subdued, but leaves little lasting impression.Moon Phase sets out to be a vampire series built around the concept of &quot;moe&quot;, and it largely succeeds.

It focuses on the relationship between a human and a vampire, which can become pretty interesting if it can deliver it well. Every anime has its villain, and the bad guys really make the story interesting.______________________________________________________________Art: The art isn't the best, and it doesn't appeal to the audience. The majority of the anime consists of dark colours, and in some...parts the characters and the background look very sketchy. However, the art is still viewable and can still give the audience an entertainment throughout the anime.______________________________________________________________Sound: Alright, the OP and ED doesn't really suit the whole idea of a relationship between a photographer and a vampire or the battle between a good and evil. There aren't many sound effects that enhance the overall anime but that doesn't really kill off the entertainment.______________________________________________________________Character: Tsukuyomi -MOON PHASE- has it all, from jealous twins, perverted grandpa, cute vampires to evil villains. The character development between the cast is at a good standard but what was a big let down was the relationship between the two main characters. Their development starts off pretty slow, and doesn't have a 'climax' in their relationship, which basically means; their relationship never becomes an up and down one, but rather a steady but repetitive one.______________________________________________________________Enjoyment: The whole idea of vampirexhuman gave a pretty good impression on me, but the anime didn't portray it well enough. Most of the things that were shown felt repetitive and boring. Also you can clearly predict clich&eacute; moments. However the anime is still 'watch able', but starting from the middle of the series, I just went: &quot;End already, I have better things to watch.&quot;______________________________________________________________Overall: Overall, Tsukuyomi -MOON PHASE- isn't necessary a bad anime but nor is it a good one, if you want to watch good and deep romance anime, I would suggest you keep away from this.

Girl has multiple personalities and is a vampire. Boy brings girl home. Story unravels there.Story: The story was actually decent in my mind. It was creative and it included everything one would ask for in an anime. DRAMA, ROMANCE, ACTION, and COMEDY. It although, lacked a decent ending and left a minor amount of questions un-answered, the story fell into place and connected to the next scene of the story. I have nothing really to complain with the story.Art: The art was the noteworthy thing about...this anime. The art was detailed yet cute. The characters were nicely drawn. Well, the girls anyway. The guy characters were plain and dull while the girls stood out. The art for the characters however, in my opinion started to go downwards. Either the artist felt lazy or tired, they just stop putting in the effort they did in the beginning. The characters ALL started to look dull. But the scenery and backgrounds, i felt, were very good.Sound: Nothing really to complain about, yet nothing worthy of an overall compliment. The music and voices of the characters were decent. The theme song started out odd, unique, and annoying but as the anime went on, got catchy. [Well, at least to me anyway. I was singing it.]  Again, nothing to complain about and nothing too great to mention.Characters: Ah, i felt they lacked character growth. I mean, the characters had a history and they grew physically, but it didn't show the depth of what it could of been. The male character is just like any other romance/comedy guy character. It's generic. He's a clutz, weak, and nerdy guy who becomes a total hunk for the girl. The female lead was annoying yet cute, but really annoying in my opinion. she was the main focus of the whole thing, and she just didn't attract me. I felt like she should've spoken lesss. haha. just my opinion. of course, most could feel different. The other characters didn't get much. They were there as people who stood with the mains.Enjoyment: I started off enjoying this quite a bit. But as it went on, i started to feel annoyed and just all together, found the anime tedious. Usually, as any anime watcher should know, an anime should leave you wanting more and/or thinking: wow, perfect/great ending. I don't even REMEMBER the ending of this anime. And when i found out there was a special, i didn't even want to watch it. I did enjoy the comedy and the action part. I'll give it that.Overall: If you're looking for an anime that is alright enough to keep you busy, this is it. You may end up loving it and you may end up like me, disappointed. We all have different opinions. I've given mine. I'd only say that this anime just was forgettable. Don't expect to be &quot;WOWed&quot; this anime. The art was detailed yet cute.

There are already plenty of those. Instead I just wanted to share my final thoughts about something usually overlooked about Moonphase. Moonphase/Tsukuyomi is a very strange show. I don\'t just say that because of its reputation for loli level moe. What I mean is, the series as a whole is hard to summarize. Moonphase is easily the kind of show that can give the somewhat misleading impression of ""typical"". By no means is it some amazing original masterpiece, but the point I\'m going to make isn\'t meant to slam it or demonize it either. In fact, the sole purpose...of this ""review"" is merely to elaborate on the one thing I did find interesting about it. For the most part Moonphase is a very average show in every way. It\'s not very exciting but it can be very amusing and endearing (or uncomfortable) depending on your tastes. Mostly it\'s the ending portion of the show that I think deserves some credible mention.The show starts off generically enough. Annoying/cute young female character, awkward/clumsy older male character, and fairly familiar supporting character archetypes. The first 13 episodes adhere pretty closely to a story about watching the daily antics of a boy/girl and human/vampire relationship. This is where the show brandishes most of its cuteness and comedy (whether you find any of it funny or cute is another matter). Along the way a plot gradually develops with the climax involving defeating the first major villain. This all develops very slowly mind you, so you should not be watching Moonphase if you are expecting fast paced (or a lot of) vampire action.Everything about the show is still only slightly interesting and mostly mediocre up to this point. Nothing\'s unforgivably terrible, but there\'s also nothing new or noteworthy. If you didn\'t like the show at the beginning, you wouldn\'t like it any better yet either. It\'s somewhere after this though, particularly around episode 17, where things really start to change. Like really change. It doesn\'t become a completely different show or throw in some crazy plot twist, but the overall atmosphere takes a complete change in course.The setting changes, for one. The previous situations and conditions you may have grown used to change as well. Even the general tones and styles change. Ending themes get new animation, comedy gags get a little more bizarre and random and characters interact in a more straightforward and developmental way. If you liked the show as it was, this is probably the point in the show where you didn\'t like it the same anymore. The cuteness theme is toned down and the story gets a little more serious. Or perhaps I should say a lot more serious? Where as the first half of the series was very laid back and casual, the latter arc starts to resemble an actual dedicated plot. New villains are introduced and the regular cast adopt more meaningful roles. The story progresses steadily and is now at the forefront of the show instead of in the background. So the whole look and feel of the last third of the show is significantly different than the rest. By the end it is obvious that there is still more story that could be told but everything that could be wrapped up neatly is, and that\'s really all one can ask for. I thought the show was actually genuinely funnier and more entertaining, so much that it made me wonder if some new director took over halfway through it.The funny thing about Moonphase is that I originally watched it because I had very, very low expectations and wanted to bear witness to just how creepy or moe it really was. Although elements of both were present that were a little weird/disturbing, it wasn\'t nearly as bad as I had been led to believe. So like I said before, it\'s not really awful, but it is awfully average. It\'s a shame because I kind of liked what the show had become, so if the whole series began the way it ended Moonphase would\'ve probably been much more well received.There were some interesting artistic choices, like the whole dollhouse point of view, and the dubbing was good for what they had to work with. The opening/ending themes grow on you, if you can bring yourself to watch more than a few eps. Definitely not for everyone, and I wouldn\'t recommend to anyone who doesn\'t really like overly cutesy or silly anime, but there are worse things you could watch... of this ""review"" is merely to elaborate on the one thing I did find interesting about it.

It\'s a shame because I kind of liked what the show had become, so if the whole series began the way it ended Moonphase would\'ve probably been much more well received.There were some interesting artistic choices, like the whole dollhouse point of view, and the dubbing was good for what they had to work with. The opening/ending themes grow on you, if you can bring yourself to watch more than a few eps. Definitely not for everyone, and I wouldn\'t recommend to anyone who doesn\'t really like overly cutesy or silly anime, but there are worse things you could watch...', 'Story - 10 - The story is about a human who love a vampire. A world ful of action, comedy, adventure and love. The story revolves around hazuki and kouhei in romantic comedy way, the people who protect hazuki and the world that they choose for being with each other..Art - 10 - I can say that the anime was really realistic and the fact that the images changes in the story plot. It was really good and I really like the animation..Sound - 10 - Oh boy, the music in this anime was really good.. I like the theme song that they are...using when kouhei first saw hazuki..=)Characters - 10 - I really like hazuki and kouhei together.. They blend pretty well. As for the other characters, some of them didnt blend with the story like a vampire with elepant costume or a beetle.. dunno why they are designed like that..Enjoyment - 10 - I watched this a couple of times and it really makes me laugh. It was really a good anime. I definitely recommend it to everyone..Overall - 10 - The best anime so far..=) using when kouhei first saw hazuki..=)Characters - 10 - I really like hazuki and kouhei together..

It is one of the few I have actually watched twice.The thing about this series is that it is almost more interesting as a survey of the Japanese Occult than for the story itself.The story is about Kohei Morioka who is a photographer for hire.  He investigates a castle in Germany but while there, becomes ensnared with Hazuki, a young vampiress.  She bites him and tries to make Kohei her slave, but something goes wrong with her magic and she cannot control him, a fact that enfuriates her.  In fact, he takes pity on her and...tries to help her, unaware of the bigger mysteries behind how she came to be a vampire.It takes time to develop a liking for the two main characters - Kohei and Hazuki.  Kohei is way too over-patient with his impetuous and willful charge Hazuki, and Hazuki is a pretty selfish girl.  But as the two adventure together, slowly a connection is made which becomes key in the final episodes.  It is cute and humorous, and an enjoyable watch, but not necessarily the best there is in this genre of anime.  Definitely an enjoyable watch though. tries to help her, unaware of the bigger mysteries behind how she came to be a vampire.It takes time to develop a liking for the two main characters - Kohei and Hazuki.

Definitely an enjoyable watch though.', ""Sometimes anime really does get on my nerves hard. Anime can take an old concept and add in a few twist which gives it an original feel. In addition, provide a pretty good story for a brief period. Then just completely ruin the whole damn fuckin' thing robbing it of almost all value. Moon Phase so falls into this category to the point where I can run into my corner and cry.I'll begin with the features that immediately grabbed my attention: the animation and artwork. Visually, Moon Phase is outstanding. It displays a great deal of color combinations with a dark and gothic setting. The...backgrounds and landscapes are incredible. The character designs are just as attractive. The animation team went through quite a bit to even provide some of the characters with a change of clothes. The animation during some of the battles is good, but it does contain a slight use of reused cels and jumpiness. The battles are mainly psychic attacks consisting of magic in the form of energy attacks.Moon Phase also features a very good soundtrack with some great background music, and two very good end theme songs, which are Kanoshi Yokan and Just For My Love. On the flip side, the opening theme has to be the absolute worst I have ever heard. The lyrics are absolutely ridiculous along with the tunes, and the opening itself is just too gothic lolicon for me. The voice acting is very good with the English language being the most fun to me. Some of the dialogue in the first half had me cracking up.The first half of this series was great. In fact, had the series continued in this vein or ended right there. Moon Phase could have very well been the best vampire anime I've ever seen. Everything flowed well from go; the characters were being developed with careful precision, and they actually seemed headed towards some type of growth. Interesting plot devices were well used and provided a great deal of suspense, plus a very good final battle with the first lead villain.This battle is among the best vampire battles I have seen in just about anything vampire related. I'm talking an excellent and well thought out battle with a very powerful, and crafty vampire named Count Kinkel. This character is ruthless, and is exactly everything that makes a great antagonist. In addition, the drama and comedy always hit the mark, and was a welcome addition each time. Unfortunately, after episode 13 to be exact, Moon Phase begins to take the biggest dive I can remember.A good portion of the story centers around the building relationship of Kouhei and Hazuki. They begin with the typical shonen personality: two characters whom don't want to admit that they are in love. The first half did a good job handling this. The second half handled things very poorly. Even the new villains introduced appeared to be nothing more than filler characters.The series never regains its former glory in my view, and has about as much balance as a three legged cat. Plot devices are poorly used in every angle, and the comedy overplays itself heavily. Plus, it clashes badly with the action, drama, and romance, to the point where it could no longer be taken seriously. I almost thought this was Elfen Lied.There's a comedic gimmick that takes place that I don't want to spoil. In the beginning, it worked out well considering what was taking place at the time. Towards the end, it happened constantly at all of the wrong times. I really don't know what was the writers intentions.When the series headed towards the end each and every last one of the battles were way below average at best, with the final battle being cheesy beyond all belief. I honestly couldn't believe I was watching the same show. The story is wrapped up before the final episode. At least one question is left hanging and I really didn't mind it at first, until I saw just how worthless the final episode was despite having its funny moments. Without adding a spoiler, I'll just say the episode could have been better used.Despite how I feel about the series overall. It's very hard for me to completely hate it, because numerous times the comedy along with the drama worked. The first half was too good. However, the series really did lose its focus and it was very clumsy while it dabbled between comedy, drama, and romance. Had Moon Phase been a straight comedy at heart, and never attempted to take itself too seriously, the second half would probably be forgivable; but the series takes steps to push it further towards a drama even more, and the genres begin to clash all over. This is the reason why I'm so disappointed overall, and in all honesty, I didn't like the second half at all.Moon Phase has its good moments, and also has characters that are easy to like; but someone whom demands a lot from their anime will more than likely come away from this feeling burned. I definitely felt burned when this was over. In the end, sloppy writing held back material with classic potential, and that's all there is to it.Highs: Very nice visuals and soundtrack, excellent first halfLows: Rotten second half that jumps the shark very bad backgrounds and landscapes are incredible.

When I first looked at this I thought ""oh probably another fan service type of anime"", but I completely misjudged it. In fact the most fan service it had were the neko ears.Story: I can\'t say the story was outstanding, because if it was I wouldn\'t be craving for more. In fact I would be quite satisfied with the ending results. I\'m not saying it was bad or that it left...alot of loose ends, but they could have maybe stretched things out more. (it felt like a cliff hanger) But overall it was honestly good and it had the perfect right amount of everything.Art: I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to art. I don\'t care how great the story is. If they don\'t look good then I\'m not watching it. Because of this, it was obviously pretty satisfying to the eyes and therefore wasn\'t a eyesore.Sound: Okay to get started with this one I\'m just gonna say that I watched the English Dubbed ones and they were just perfect! None of the voices were annoying and everything was as clear as a bell! That\'s all I got to say ;)Character: The characters could have had more depth, but sadly the character had a limit to how much they were given. It showed a little something about all the characters, even the supporting ones. The main characters though were brought out quite perfectly to the point were I loved them all. Talking about is a tricky thing, but I\'ll just be blunt with you. If you are able to imagine what they are feeling then they will be considered perfect to you. (of course they won\'t be flawless)Enjoyment: Ah, yes I think this one helps the least for people with different taste. Hmm well I put it into groups.If your the type that like a good anime that has many genres then this will be quite enjoyable to you.If your the type that likes to be totally amazed and blown away into a freaking twilight zone then YOU my friend are gonna have to continue looking!If your the type that are into super-serious-need-tissues-type then neh this is not for you.Either way I was enjoying this anime to the point that I finished it in one day. And that says alot.Overall: IT WAS AWESOME TO WATCH! HOPEFULLY THEY WILL MAGICALLY DECIDE TO MAKE A SECOND SEASON!Well that\'s all I got to say. ;) alot of loose ends, but they could have maybe stretched things out more.

In this day and age where we have so many serious vampire series, it\'s good to see one that doesn\'t take itself too seriously.This series can move slow at times, and the near-constant arguments between Kouhei and Hazuki can be annoying from time to time.  I enjoyed the latter half of the series immensely, but it took me forever to get through the first half because of these.In the end, I found it to be a...very entertaining series and the climax - and total randomness of the last 2 episodes after the main arc is resolved - is not to be missed and worth slogging through the first half of the series to get to. very entertaining series and the climax - and total randomness of the last 2 episodes after the main arc is resolved - is not to be missed and worth slogging through the first half of the series to get to.', 'Being a fan of vampires and the gothic all my life I had to check this anime out when I heard about it, and while it is far from a classic, it’s an enjoyable romp of an adventure for sure.Moon Phase is at its heart an adventure/romance/comedic anime and it mostly works very well in all its fields and while the series may look light and fluffy on its surface (And most of the time it is quite light) it holds some dark settings and events which will surprise you.The central story is engaging enough and develops well at the start, yet as it progresses...it starts to feel a little hollow, especially near the end of the series when things speed up in pace but lose a lot of substance and things go haywire in terms of plot. In addition to that, the story feels far too stretched for a 25 episode series and even by then there is a lot left in the plot that needs to be solved which I found frustrating!Despite these drawbacks fans of the gothic and vampires stories will find a lot to enjoy, I was surprised at how deep they made the shows mythology, even thinking up a brilliant way of how Vampires can deal with the sun which I have yet to seen in any other vampire lore. The show also dose well at showing an interesting and engaging love story develop between the main leads.The cast of characters is great with quite a bit of verity. Hazuki makes for an entertaining lead and it’s good that we see her grow from this annoying spoilt little brat in the first few episodes to something more by the end. Kouhei is your average male lead and is average at best during the series run, but he gets some surprisingly big developments near the final stages of the anime which helps add a little more to his character.The supporting cast is fine too but most have little development apart from the brilliant Elfriede who is given a surprisingly dark background and a sweet relationship with Kouhei’s grandfather Ryuuhei. The villains are a particularly joy to watch and they nicely range from the vile, if slightly camp, Count Kinkel to the innocent looking but deadly Artemis.The animation is mostly very good, with some stunning scenes of beautiful gothic imagery and countryside landscapes but it fails a little in the city scenes which can be quite bland and feel limp compared to the beauty of the rest. The main characters are well animated but the crowd scenes annoyed me (They are just paper stick figures!) and it would have been nice to see more verity in the various monsters that appear as they seem quite plain and not well thought out. The fights scenes are normally fun to watch but can also be a little bland and unengaging as time comes by.I have only watched the series of the Dub so far but they do a good job with a nice cast but it’s nothing very special. The incidental music throughout the series is very nice and atmospheric. The opening team itself is very jolly and fits Hazuki’s personality perfectly while the ending song is very moving and has a far more gothic feel to it which I like.All and all, if you want something a little bit different, a little bit gothic and a little bit mad then this is a good choice. Tsukuyomi -MOON PHASE- is a fun if sometimes empty anime but one which deserves a watch and another series (Even if it’s just to sort out the lose ends!) it starts to feel a little hollow, especially near the end of the series when things speed up in pace but lose a lot of substance and things go haywire in terms of plot.

My reviews aren't really spoilers so much as the context of the content you should expect.There is a storyline and it's reasonably interesting however this series is ultimately dominated by the conflicting emotions of the two main characters. The first two episodes will draw you in and depending on your tastes will either be the best thing since sliced bread or a disappointment.I enjoyed the art and it was definitely above average in my opinion. There were no cheap budget gimmicks...or at least any that I noticed. I can't really comment on the sound though I have no criticisms in my experience.The characters are truly a mixed bag. Elfriede (the vampire from Germany) and the grandfather Ryuuhei Mido are definitely the highlight support characters in the series while Seiji Mido is the guiding voice in the series; however they are all ultimately supporting characters. The trouble with the main characters is that they are wallowing in their own sea of emotions. Granted they don't know exactly how each other feels though their inability to communicate their emotions makes up way too much of the time spent watching the series. Essentially the potentially interesting events and plot take a back seat to something that will ultimately appeal to emos which is gravely disappointing because this series had a LOT of promise.Ultimately this series while having a decent storyline and supporting characters is dominated by emotions. If wallowing in emotions is your thing then this series will rate high when including it's other aspects for you however if you prefer the main protagonist to be a strong character (besides *just* his sense of morals) then this series will leave you feeling conflicted.In the end I dropped the series because even if the destination / final few episodes would be great sitting through 10 minutes of self-pity and whining in most episodes when the feelings of all the characters has been reasonably established between the characters themselves was not something I found to be entertaining. Moon Phase is ultimately an example of even if a series with a lot of potential relies on cliches especially emotions for content the appeal is ultimately limited.If you watch more then two episodes of anime a day and have a high tolerance for emos then this series may prove to be worth your time.If your time for watching anime is restrictive and you do not care about watching a character wallow in a single emotional state for ten minutes straight in half the episodes then look elsewhere. or at least any that I noticed.

The comedy and drama to the series comes from Hozuki adjusting to living life outside her castle while Kouhei puts up with her antics and Kouhei's family trying to protect her from other vampires trying to drive her back to the castle. The comedy was mostly lackluster for me since it relied on many of the same gags such as Hozuki's obnoxious tsundere...character and waterpans randomly falling on the cast for whatever reason during both mundane and serious moments. It also occasionally gets in the rather annoying habit of pandering to the audience as some scenes in the series only serve to feature the younger cast members of Moon Phase striking cute poses, having their idiosyncrasies and wearing various clothes or costumes.The drama to the series is just as underwhelming. It does offer a decent amount of character development with Hozuki and Kouhei with the former learning to better interact socially with others while searching for her mother and Kouhei wanting to protect her from vampire threats, though the majority of secondary characters and villains don't get as much fleshing out limiting how much one could care for them. There is emphasis on strategizing against vampire threats with Kouhei's family as they are spiritualists, but these are mostly pointless as each vampire threat gets conveniently dealt with through whatever random power upgrade that Hozuki or Kouhei gain. The romance that Moon Phase also tries to play up between Hozuki and Kouhei (along with his two younger female cousins) may make some viewers uneasy considering their younger age as Kouhei is a young adult and the girls in question are barely teenagers, with their character designs making them look even younger. Even when not factoring this possibly uncomfortable fact, I am not a fan of our two leads as a pairing due to Hozuki's rather obnoxious tsundere character.Visually, Moon Phase is rather average for a mid-2000s title. Scenery and character designs have a good amount of detail and shading to them. The animation isn't too heavy on fluid movements like KURAU Phantom Memory or Paranoia Agent, but depicts enough to move the anime along. Shaft fans may be surprised to know that this is one of the acclaimed studio's earlier works they did without having a joint production with other animation studios, considering the studio's rep in recent years for creating highly detailed and avant-garde visuals with works like the Monogatari franchise, Madoka Magica and the two TV anime adaptations of ef.Nonetheless, I wouldn't really find myself recommending Moon Phase due to having a number of flaws to its comedy and drama, as well as seeming like it was trying too hard at points to pander to its audience. Either stick to the studio's more recent works or if you want a vampire series, try hunting down more better quality titles like Blood+ or Hellsing Ultimate. character and waterpans randomly falling on the cast for whatever reason during both mundane and serious moments.

Either stick to the studio's more recent works or if you want a vampire series, try hunting down more better quality titles like Blood+ or Hellsing Ultimate."", 'Story:I really enjoyed Tsukuyomi ""Moon Phase"" I watched when I was younger,so I didn\'t understand the whole concept of moe all I knew was that It had my two favorite things Vampires and Cats,even now I still enjoy it and I\'ve watched a lot of animes and it is still one of my favorites.I also enjoyed the opening,most of the time I tend not to like cutesy songs that repeat over and over but when I first saw it I fell in love with the song I also like the little details that change in very opening and the things that fall on the characters...heads,overall if you like cute things,vampires and neko mimi you should watch it.The end of the anime personally left me with some questions,but it was an acceptable ed still felt like more things could happen,but then I had to take in account that the manga isn\'t finished just like with the series of Full Metal Alchemist.Art:Okay at the start of the series the art gives you a sort of misterious feeling,after the first two episodes the art is quite the same but now it can be felt more relaxed,give the eviroment,the misterious feelig given to the art is only or mostly shown when the villains of the story.Music:I love the music many different songs for everything happy and sad moments,the music is well put out with the mood of the scenes,don\'t expect anything extraordinary,but it does have good music.Characters:I thought the characters were quite original imo,mostly because in animes with girls telling the boy thay are their slave,the boys are weak and sucumb,but in this anime the boy just keeps saying that he doesn\'t belong to her,which makes for really funny arguments between Kouhei and Hazuki.The characters also mature,well mostly the Hazuki and Kouhei,so you can see development,not a great one as such in Junni Kokuki,but still some. heads,overall if you like cute things,vampires and neko mimi you should watch it.The end of the anime personally left me with some questions,but it was an acceptable ed still felt like more things could happen,but then I had to take in account that the manga isn\'t finished just like with the series of Full Metal Alchemist.Art:Okay at the start of the series the art gives you a sort of misterious feeling,after the first two episodes the art is quite the same but now it can be felt more relaxed,give the eviroment,the misterious feelig given to the art is only or mostly shown when the villains of the story.Music:I love the music many different songs for everything happy and sad moments,the music is well put out with the mood of the scenes,don\'t expect anything extraordinary,but it does have good music.Characters:I thought the characters were quite original imo,mostly because in animes with girls telling the boy thay are their slave,the boys are weak and sucumb,but in this anime the boy just keeps saying that he doesn\'t belong to her,which makes for really funny arguments between Kouhei and Hazuki.The characters also mature,well mostly the Hazuki and Kouhei,so you can see development,not a great one as such in Junni Kokuki,but still some.', ""Boy meets strange vampire girl with lots of enemies.... thats about all there is to it.

She moves between precious, vulnerable, cute, annoying and sweet so many times in an episode that you really feel sorry for Kouheii (the main male character). The supporting characters are what makes this interesting, there are quite a few and each adds their own bit of spice to what is a reasonably predictable anime.I enjoyed the anime more than the manga, I felt the anime made a bit more sense and was fleshed out better....The Neko-mimi-mode theme song seems odd, but listen to it a few times and you are hooked! The only really  disturbing thing I found were the odd pictures at the end during the end theme, some were grotesque, and I did feel that trying to make Hazuki into some adult clone did not really work well.Voice work was great, I felt Hazuki's voice really suited her, and Haiji was really cute.Its not a great anime, but its an OK one.

"", ""For me, this show should have gotten much higher scores than I gave it. The first two episodes absolutely blew me away, and I couldn’t wait to continue the series. Then I hit episode three, and the show changed so quickly I felt like I had gotten slapped across the face. Tension of a romance brewing between a 14 year old girl and a grown man became the major focus. Normally in anime the girl looks mature enough that her age is basically forgotten, but Hazuki cannot ever seem anything but a little kid. It irritates me every time I see it.Though it is a...big one, that is really my only complaint. Wrapped around it is a very fresh and different take on vampire mythology. And when the sexual tension isn’t being forced in as the major focus the plot line is actually very good.There are many great action scenes and several climaxes that keep you on the edge of your seat for episodes. Overall a good watch, but it makes me want to cry when I see how the writers trashed what should have been an easy 9 or 10.As for the tangibles, the show's artwork was very detailed and color was well used for the darkness and shadow that is always an element. Music was good too, especially at the very beginning of the first episode and during the most dramatic moments. The opening theme is really silly and kinda irritated me, while the ending was beautiful, different, and fit pretty well. big one, that is really my only complaint.

I actually really enjoyed some episodes individually, but as an overall experience though from start to finish I\'m not sure I can recommend it.The first thing we see in episode 1 is a gothic castle, shrouded in mist that really sets a creepy, atmospheric tone that I found pretty enchanting. By the 3rd episode the tone completely shifts and we\'re getting cutesy arguments between the tsundere main vampire girl, Hazuki, and Kouhei, her unlikely rescuer. It\'s actually hard to believe it\'s even the same show at that point, and the...series continues to flip-flop between these two tones. The episodes vary greatly: comedy, drama, slice-of-life, romance, and action.The plot of the show tends to come to a stand-still when the show is tackling more lighthearted themes, but I think these are actually probably the best episodes. These are the episodes where we see Hazuki and Kouhei develop as characters the most, and they were the ones I found myself the most emotionally invested in. The side characters are mostly good too, with Hazuki\'s guardian spirit, Haiji, stealing the show (though I\'m sure some people will find her extremely annoying). None of the side-characters are ever developed very much though, unfortunately, and because of that I found myself massively preferring the episodes that centered on Hazuki and Kouhei.The ""plot"" episodes tend to be more focused on action and are... not so good. There is very little explanation of how magic works in this universe, so the viewer is mostly left in the dark on what the hell is actually happening in any given fight scene. The show also has some problems with consistency. Characters randomly gain and lose abilities, and rules that are made early on for combat are later broken. The story is pretty nonsensical in general though, certain plot elements are never explained properly, and it was hard for me to get invested in it.As far as romance goes, there is VERY little. Hazuki and Kouhei mostly have an older brother/younger sister type relationship. Though they do toe the line on a couple instances. It\'s a bit awkward since Kouhei is older and Hazuki is like 14.The comedy is hit-or-miss. There are a couple of pretty funny moments, but it massively overuses random objects (usually wash-bins) falling on characters heads.The worst part of this show is after episode 16/17 though. The last 8 episodes are extremely bad. Characters make decisions that border on nonsensical, villains randomly appear and then disappear, and there is a whole lot of extremely forced drama. The ending is extremely unsatisfying and leaves massive plot holes and unanswered questions. There are also none of the lighthearted episodes we previously saw in the series in this last batch. I actually wish I had skipped these ones because they left a bad taste in my mouth about the series overall.The art is pretty okay for an anime from this time period, and I massively prefer the art-style of the anime to the manga. The music is actually pretty great. It\'s suitably creepy when the atmosphere demands it, and whimsical when something comedic is happening. The opening, ""Nekomimi Mode,"" will probably be hit-or-miss for most people.  I personally don\'t like it but it is extremely memorable at the very least.Overall, it\'s an OK show, but I\'m not sure I can recommend it.

Animation isn't in general as good as I expect from Shaft, and the show is peculiarly fetish-y. As well, I'm heavily reminded of _Bakemonogatari_ and _Kure-nai_ - and not necessarily in a good way. (I wish I remembered why I decided to watch it.) The episode where they drive to the confrontation with Count Kinkel was visually beautiful & stylish, comparing well with other series like _Tatami Galaxy_. But the story... I was right in my first comment, it's basically _Kure-nai_ with vampires - cute high-class purple-eyed loli who battens onto good-hearted nebbish with special ability who will...protect her against the mean creatures who want her back. And of course, with plenty of cheap story-telling moves (oh, grandpa & Elfriede & Seiji are actually alive! Oh, Hazuki is a day-walker and can act exactly like a cute loli who drinks blood just once a month! Oh, Kouhei is actually the most powerful psychic around, it was just sealed away!) with a roughly status-quo ending.The humor did grow on me albeit the over-use of teakettles/washpans grated, and I appreciated the fairly unique cinematography of a far shot of a cut-away section of the household, which worked very nicely and kept things more comprehensible than most interior shots do. Reading through the ANN reviews of the series as I like to do *after* watching something, I agree with the ANN reviewers - the Kinkel arc was decently suspenseful (for what is a predetermined outcome of course), the animation style kept my interest, and the later fight scenes in the final arc were likewise interesting. Likewise, I agree the dub didn't do Hazuki any favors, and Hazuki actually turns out a better character than I had expected, the odd lack of combat on her part side (she's supposed to be a powerful vampire who can even withstand the sun, daughter of the most powerful vampire/entity in the world!) - I wound up liking her more than I did Murasaki in _Kure-nai_. (The creepy loli aspect was mercifully toned down after the first 10 episodes or so.)So, leaving it at 7. Somewhat funny, somewhat dramatic, but nothing particularly memorable in any respect, although not mediocre enough that I regret watching it. protect her against the mean creatures who want her back.

World Destruction: Sekai Bokumetsu no Rokunin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4415/World_Destruction__Sekai_Bokumetsu_no_Rokunin,"['The biggest problem with adapting a game is that all too often the reason for doing it has come from the marketing department rather than any desire to truly retell the game\'s story. Because of this, no effort is made to improve on the source material, and the whole thing becomes nothing more than a glorified advertisement for a game that probably isn\'t selling as well as the producers had hoped.Part of the problem stems from the fact that the original storyline is normally standard RPG fare, the kind of generic sword and sorcery tale that seems all too common in the games market and...normally involves saving the world from ""the ultimate evil"" - which usually involves running around in circles while you try to pick a fight, levelling up, exploring the ""world"", levelling up, going into the homes of total strangers and stealing their possessions and money, more levelling up, etc, etc, etc. It\'s pretty obvious that the people who dream up the various plots and story lines for these games aren\'t really pushing the boundaries of imagination.Unfortunately, the same is generally true for their anime adaptations, and World Destruction is just another example of a generic RPG spawning a generic fantasy anime. The only difference is that this time the anime was released before the game.The story is set in a world where humans are ostensibly slaves serving the various races of beast men known as Ferals, and follows the adventures of Kyrie Illunis, who somehow winds up travelling with the notorious human Morte Ahserah, the leader of the ""World Destruction Committee"", a group whose sole purpose is to destroy the world.Doesn\'t sound too generic does it? Well, aside from the obvious comparison to Planet of the Apes, the idea of humans rebelling against their non-human masters isn\'t a new one. The problem though, is that World Destruction tries to be unique by throwing in the idea that the only way to save the world is to destroy it. Unfortunately this doesn\'t really work as, aside from the obvious ""World Salvation Committee"" getting the way (seriously, who thought up these names), the plot itself relies on generic methods and devices to move the story forward.The simple fact is that while the pacing and flow may not be that bad, the reliance on storyline stereotype is pretty obvious from the outset. That\'s not to say that the story is bad though, but aside from the whole ""destroy the world"" aspect, most of the plot has been done before (in one form or another), and done better.Now given that this is a show by Production I.G. one could fairly expect some decent animation and visuals, and for the most part the series delivers. The only problem is that because this is a game adaptation/advertisement, the design of, well, pretty much everything, was already done beforehand. Because of this, there is very little scope for any advancement in the visuals as the last thing Sega wanted was for the anime to look better than the game it was supposed to sell.That said, the animation is pretty good throughout the series, and there are some nice visual effects used in various scenes. The character design leaves a lot to be desired though, in particular because Sega made no effort to step away from the altar of genericism when making the game.World Destruction has a pretty solid cast, but like so many other game adaptations, this does not automatically equate to great acting. Once again the issue lies with the plot itself, in particular the fact that the game is constructed in a particular manner, and thus the character interactions are already defined in a certain way. The anime manages to flesh out various points, however there is nowhere near enough depth in the story to bring out the best in the seiyuu.The acting isn\'t bad, but it\'s not great either.As far as the music goes, it\'s pretty standard fare throughout the series. The thematic music is decent, however the overall effect on the atmosphere of a given scene can sometimes be disjointed. This is also reflected in both the OP, ""Zero"" by AAA, and the ED, ""Kaze no Kioku: To the End of the World"" by Aimmy. The former is a strange blend of dance music that doesn\'t really suit the style of the show, while the latter is a ""bittersweet"" ballad.To be perfectly frank, the music is just a little bit overdone, and a bit too ostentatious for my liking.It should be pretty obvious by now that World Destruction is pretty generic in its approach to fantasy, and this is reflected in the characters as well. The two leads are decent enough, however the show, like the game, doesn\'t really develop the characters as much as one would like. Granted there are efforts made to allow some growth, but in the end the generic characterization and the number of episodes precludes any substantial development.Now, one would think after all of those points that I didn\'t enjoy World Destruction, however I found the show to be watchable, and at times enjoyable. The problem is that there is a very disjointed feel to the series, and the generic nature of the show doesn\'t really help as it only makes the flaws more obvious.The main issue though, is that this show is nothing more than one of many adaptations that are nothing more than an attempt to make more money, and because of this there is no effort to make the anime more enjoyable for the viewer.

Also, episodes 1-8 don't advance the plot very much; so, I suggest watching the first episode, and asking yourself, &quot;Do I like these characters enough to stick around until episode 9?&quot;  Once you get that far, the anime actually gets really good."", ""“Sands of Destruction” turns things around. Instead of being the guys who are saving the world, the main cast are the one trying to destroy it. This might lead you to believe that this is going to be a dark show, after all they are the “bad guys” this time. That couldn't be further from the truth. Almost nothing in the show is taken seriously, making the show a very carefree experience.The premise plays out like this. A group of 3 people are trying to destroy the world, these 3 people are appropriately call “The World Destruction Committee”. The plan to destroy the world is...to use, what else, the “World Destruct Code” witch happens to be an easy to carry pocket size black ball. Only one problem stands in their way, they have no idea how to use it. In actuality 2 out of the 3 don't really want to destroy the world, they are only along for the ride because the government thinks they are part of the “The World Destruction Committee” and can't go back to their old lives. Even the 3rd person seems to spend more time trying to convince people that she wants to destroy the world then actually trying to destroy the world. The group apposing “The World Destruction Committee” is call, of course, “The World Salvation Committee”. These are the bad guys, but they are the ones trying to save the world so how bad can they really be. The whole thing is absurd, but it is absurd in a hilarious and good way.The show doesn't spend a lot of time developing the story. For the most part they seem to go around not getting any closer to the goal of destroying the world. The show does give reasons why they go from place to place but for the most part it is just them wandering around for 10 episodes. However it all comes together at the end and out of no were manages to pull off a really good ending. A pleasant surprise to a show that otherwise didn't have that strong of a storyline.Even though this show is mainly a comedy it manages to throw a few action scenes in it. No a whole lot but the couple that make it in the show are entertaining. Many times it actually ends up being more comical then action but still fun to watch.The characters really work well together. Morte, Kyrie, and Toppy make up “The World Destruction Committee”. Morte is a hot headed female and the one who is trying to destroy the world. Plus she has this cool giant blade thing has her weapon of choice. Kyrie is a laid back male lead. His biggest concern most of the time is were his next meal is coming from. He tries to convince Morte to not destroy the world from time to time but not because he actually cares if the world is destroy it is just that the whole thing seems like a lot of trouble to him. Lastly there is Toppy, an adorable yellow teddy bear with an eye patch. He hates when people call him a teddy bear so Morte and Kyrie call him it all the time. On the other end “The World Salvation Committee” is made up of Lia and Naja. Yes thats right the world is in danger of being destroyed and the army sends 2 people. Lia's solution to everything is to punch people first and ask questions later. Naja spend most of his time convincing Lia to not hurt people. Both teams manage to play off one another personalities for a lot of comical moments.The animation is sufficient. The colorful art style is appropriate for the mood of the show. Nothing is wrong with the animation it just fails to impress.“Sands of Destruction” is a nice easy going show.  It never takes itself serous enough to try and push morality on you. An absurd but entertaining story line and a cast that can hold your interest. Just a fun little comedy. to use, what else, the “World Destruct Code” witch happens to be an easy to carry pocket size black ball.

World Salvation Commitee(WSC).The action is awesome did I tell you there\'s a lot of action!!!?,the enjoyment is worth it but will you be able to watch the whole  show? I did becuase I wanted to see if my predictions were or are going to be correct.Seems to...me it kind of was.The art is really creative and the creater\'s world is really well done I love the show wished it had more episodes because all the good stuff were solved in the end and it just ended to me a cliffhanger, I would love to see more of their world and more of ""Someones"" powers !!!This show started of Very Good then turned out to be really good.In the end you get attached to the characters and would like to know more just like I do. maybe I should get a DS and play the game.The opening and ending songs are awesome!! me it kind of was.The art is really creative and the creater\'s world is really well done I love the show wished it had more episodes because all the good stuff were solved in the end and it just ended to me a cliffhanger, I would love to see more of their world and more of ""Someones"" powers !!!This show started of Very Good then turned out to be really good.In the end you get attached to the characters and would like to know more just like I do. maybe I should get a DS and play the game.The opening and ending songs are awesome!!', ""Story:A predictable storyline with lots of mini-stories in between. Even though I say that, I quite enjoyed myself in this one. It was funny in some parts, action-y in others and it left me with a good feeling inside after I completes it. The way the story goes may be a bit strange, but remember this was based off of a rpg game.Art:I really liked the art. I gave off the whole rpg game character feeling and the characters looked nice. The beast men could have been worked on a little more creatively though. They were all pretty humanoid and their style were pretty simple....It would have been better if some were more beastly or something. It just seemed like the beast men weren't really taken seriously when trying to draw up the characters.Character:The characters are kind of under developed but I came to like them pretty much. Morte is funny in a violent way, Kyrie is funny in a pathetic way, while Toppi is funny in a cute, heroic but tiny way. They turn out to be a pretty nice trio, although Morte is a little cold to them. It would be nice if they had more about Toppi, Kyrie, Lia and Naja's pasts because they mainly focused on Morte. We don't ever really get to find out more about them, which is disappointing.Sound:I liked the voices of everyone and the music. The voices fitted pretty well with everyone's personality, although I guess the -kuma part at the end of every sentece Toppi says was kind of annoying (but kind of funny and cute at the same time). Uh... I guess that's all. I was kind of surprised to find out that Kyrie was Miyano Mamoru in the process of watching. I was having a OHSHC fad just a while ago. I think that's also one of the factors that made me like this anime more.Overall, I give this a 8/10. This is a good watch for anyone into RPG games, adventure, fantasy, and short animes. There are a lot of filler episodes (episodes that have nothing to do with the plot) so I don't reccomend it to someone who wants something with a fight in every episode or not fast-paced animes. ^^ Anyways, sorry if this is a really bad review but I'm a noob at this so go easy on me.

Thanks for reading."", 'In the distant future, with the concept of recorded time itself having become irrelevant, the world as we know it has changed.  The land is a vast desert, society has been pushed to the brink of existence, and mankind is no longer the dominant species.  As the result of a great war, the world has been taken over by beastmen, a race of humanoid creatures that range from beings who look like normal humans with random animal features, to full-bodied anthropomorphic bipedal animals of varying heights.  As wacky as that idea may sound, the oppression of the human race is anything but,...as humanity has been designated a race of second class citizens, with some settlements killing us on sight, others enslaving us or simply refusing to acknowledging us, and the areas where we can exist as equals being few and far between.  On top of all this, the world’s oceans have somehow vanished with time, replaced with a literal sea of sand, where aquatic creatures have adapted to swimming through the earth itself, and terrestrial life forms having to ride boats across the vast sandscape.The wars between mankind and the beastmen have left countless casualties in their wake, but none have had as much impact as the death of the idealistic Revi, a young man with a vision to create a world of harmony and prosperity.  Upon his death, however, his older sister Morte manages to come into possession of a legendary device called The Destruct Code, a device with the power to end the world.  Mourning her loss and wishing to end the unfair world that took Revi’s life, this one girl will set out on a quest to find out how to use the Destruct Code to make her own desire a reality.  On the way, she’ll team up with a nomadic human cook named Kyrie and a strong willed Dwarf Bear beastman named Taupy, with the three of them unwittingly adopting the moniker of The World Destruction Committee, officially labeling them as enemies of the people, highly wanted criminals among beastmen and humanity alike.  With their epic quest unfolding, and the mysteries of The Destruct Code unraveling, who the fuck are we supposed to be rooting for here?Visually speaking, this show isn’t anything special to write home about.  It’s not terrible looking, but it’s also not great looking.  The only thing noteworthy about it’s animation is that it was produced by Production IG, whom I used to have a really high pinion of before I started taking a closer look at their resume.  They’ve put out a ton of great looking titles throughout the years making up a cozy majority of their output, but there are a few clunky looking titles peppered throughout the list.  From what I can tell, it looks like they don’t allocate high budgets to any project that they don’t think people are going to pursue for their visuals...  Titles like Cromartie high school, which is mostly renowned for it’s comedy, and Chevalier D’eon, which would mostly be popular for it’s writing and sophisticated Elizabethan tone.  They must have thought the same about Sands of Destruction, with their assumption being that since it’s based on a video game, it’s market would only extend to fans of said game.I’ll give them this, from what I’ve seen, none of their anime titles have looked bad over-all, even if there have been some bad looking moments in them.  Sands of Destruction definitely looks cheap, though, and it doesn’t take a lot of viewing to pick up on this.  At worst, there are a couple of moments in the first few episodes where they ran into frameless action or just had really long scenes involving still character images talking to each other, but thankfully moments like this aren’t the norm.  I’d honestly say the worst thing about the visuals is the setting, as in accordance to the premise, a huge chunk of the series run time is spent with the cast riding their boats out on the sand sea(which I never got used to), which granted the animators an opportunity to feature long, static talking and interaction segments against an easy to manage background, which was no doubt a huge budget saver, but for the audience, the novelty of seeing that sand sea in the first place was the only thing visually interesting about these scenes.Different areas that our cast visit and their interiors have a much more interesting look to them, which is kind of a give-away when you consider that they’re traveling from area to area, like the cast of One Piece.  The different settlements across their home land are highly diverse and offer a lot of diverse set pieces, so that even if the characters are just talking to each other without doing much moving, you can still enjoy the surprisingly detailed artwork that serves as their backdrop.  There’s a massive library in one episode, and while the plethora of books don’t look incredibly diverse, the shadows and cobwebs still give the area a sense of identity as an old, worn down family business.  Right in the first episode, we’re introduced to Taupy as he drinks in a bar, and what a bar!  The background in that scene is beautifully lit, offering a surreal glow around those standing in front of it.  Also, I mentioned that the sandy backgrounds didn’t offer much to be desired, but the creatures inhabiting the sands, when you get to see them, are pretty cool.The character designs were taken straight from the game, as I understand it, and they seem competent enough.  Most of the main cast is designed to type, with certain elements of their aesthetic informing their personality, like how Kyrie’s ruffled hair is just wild enough to maybe be a main character, but at the same time just subdued enough to be written as a sidekick, with his blonde hair and friendly, innocent eyes painting his good nature that the very act of altering them slightly could set up a more sinister change.  Morte, the heroine, is red-haired and busty, with an outfit that carefully straddles the line between conservative and fetishy, and of course, one of their enemies has long white hair.  More interesting are their friend Taupy, a dwarf bear, who looks like he was created by a pirate enthusiast at Build a Bear Workshop, and then you have Lia, whose design fits her as the most interesting and entertaining person in the show, as she’s just overdesigned enough to suit how funny she is.  What I actually found disappointing was the race of beastmen, who you’d think would be the epicenter of imagination and possibilities, but they’re just anthropomorphic animals and people with animal parts.  Princess Tutu did more with animal/human hybrids than this show does.The music in Sands of Destruction is way cooler than it has any business being, and far more fun to listen to on it’s own than as a part of the series.  Yoshihiro Ike is a seasoned veteran in the field of anime music, and I honestly don’t think this series deserves his talent, but since they were able to land him, I’m glad they put him to such good use.  honestly, it kind of depresses me that with the show being as obscure as it is, nobody’s likely to hear it a solid decade later.  Even outside of instrumentation and tune, the sound quality alone is beyond impressive.  Most of you reading this probably won’t ever watch Sands of Destruction, but at the very least, look up the track Yoru no Houmonsha, for a taste of just how rich and complex this music is.  Having said that, the opening leaves something to be desired, as it’s visuals are a bit clunky and jarringly inconsistent, and the tune...  Particularly the sting at the beginning...  Create a promise of edginess and grit that the series fails laughably to follow up on.The English dub is a Funimation effort, and since it came out around the turn of the decade, it makes sense that they went with two of their safest options for the lead roles.  Everybody loves Luci Christian and Todd Haberkorn, especially when they’re doing their normal shtick, right?  They’re recognizable voices, usually strong performers, and they’re both really popular, so it made sense to put them here.  And yeah, they do solid jobs, so I can’t really take anything away from them there, even if their casting doesn’t feel inspired at all.  Luci has a lock on playing strong female characters, especially ones who have red hair...  Has anyone else noticed that?  She’s able to dial up the necessary drama and tragedy, and even the occasional comedy, whenever she needs to.  I’ve never really understood what people see(Or hear, I guess) in Todd Haberkorn’s nasally voice, but when he raises his pitch, he can play likeable little-brother type characters really well.  And like I said before, he’s a solid actor in general.Leaving the human characters for a moment, there are two actors who had to play tough, hardened warriors in the form of small Teddy bears, and the fact that they were able to do this without cracking up or breaking character is a testament to their professionalism and dedication to their craft.  Christopher Sabat may have only appeared in one episode, but lending his growling, deathly serious tough-guy routine to the tiny Yappy instantly elevates him to the top of the pack, at least for this show.  Robert McCullom, who I don’t think I’ve ever talked about before, takes a slightly lighter approach to the main character Taupy, also a tiny bear, but where his old friend has turned from the path of justice, Taupy still carries a touch of innocence inside of him, which his actor is great at bringing out.  My favorite performer in this dub is probably Trina Nishimura, who plays Lia, a descendant of Dragon beastmen, and since her character is an overzealous and easily angered loose canon, she has way too much fun with her.  Beyond these names, the cast is saturated with well known Funimation names, and it’s an okay dub in general.It’s not overtly obvious throughout the series that it’s based on a video game, but once you do hear that piece of it’s background, it does explain a lot.  I’ve never played Sands of Destruction for the Nintendo DS, but from what I’ve heard, it’s the kind of final Fantasy inspired game that starts off promising, but eventually loses it’s focus and crumbles under it’s own weight.  to be fair, that does seem like something the anime went through, but only at the very end, and to it’s credit, it only happens very briefly.  More to the point, it’s video game origin does explain a lot about it’s story structure and pace, as it’s a show about a small party of misfits from different walks of life who travel all over the map to accomplish  a vaguely stated goal relating to the end of the world.  There are times when it does feel like a video game speedrun, except with all the grinding, random encounters and puzzle-solving cut out to tell just the story on it’s own merits, and while it’s not impossible to tell a good story like that, there’s a good reason why not many franchises ever try it.For one thing, the most important element of any game is the actual gameplay, which is where the majority of the focus during production should go.  Gameplay isn’t just a string of endless fights and challenges, it endears you to characters.  It gets you invested in them.  It drives the story, as the character’s struggles become more personal to you.  Free exploration is a fantastic way of developing lore and dumping exposition, things that are difficult to do in scripted media.  With the element of gameplay removed, media based on games has been almost universally bad to a laughable degree, even in regard to some anime adaptations, and when a game has as little actual depth as Sands of Destruction, that lack of gameplay is a compensation to make.  Thus, this series is puddle deep even at the best of times, being incredibly shallow in both it’s story and it’s characters, with no real themes or ideas to play around with, nothing really engaging going on at any given time, and it’s few flashes of emotional resonance being exactly that...  Nothing but the briefest of  flashes.All of this could have been a huge issue, making it a dull, boring slog the likes of Ragnarok the Animation, if it was to make the mistake of taking itself seriously, but thank God, Sands of Destruction was able to dodge that bullet.  I’m not going to say this series doesn’t try, or doesn’t put in any effort, but it’s extremely light-hearted, which is a life-saver in terms of watchability.  It embraces it’s weirdness, explores the ramifications and implications of it’s universe in ways that are straight forward while at the same time delightfully tongue-in-cheek, and it plays the ‘sea of sand, how bizarre is that’ card at every opportunity.  Very early on, I thought about how darkly funny it would be to see one of these sand ships get stuck under...sand, with the crew having to face the threat of drowning in sand, and while I was just being a dick at the time, you better believe they actually go that route in one episode.  No character is ever allowed to point out how ridiculous these kind of occurrences are, but the audience is highly encouraged to try and wrap their heads around it, and I respect that kind of approach to weirdness.But the biggest asset that Sands of Destruction has is it’s cast of characters, and the dynamic between them.  To be clear, none of them are any deeper than your common golfing divot, but our heroes, our stock characters and even a few of the villains are still all fun and interesting to some degree.  As I alluded in my plot synopsis, the main cast is on a quest to destroy the world, which almost instantly makes their enemies likeable, as they’re on our side, trying to save the world.  Even our heroes, in spite of this, are still effective because of their motives.  Morte has a reason to want to end the world, and while it doesn’t make much logical sense, it makes perfect sense from an emotional perspective, and of course she grows to be conflicted as she nears her goal.  Her friends stick with her because...  Well, they’re her friends.  They’ve been lumped in with her as criminals through circumstance, and they really have nowhere else to go, so they support her, they stick with her, and they just kinda hope she’ll change her mind.And I think it’s this sense of camaraderie that keeps me coming back to the series.  Despite the apocalyptic premise, I like seeing this collection of friends on their journey, all of them genuinely caring about and supporting each other, even though one of them wants to inadvertently kill all three of them.  And while the tone of the series may be entirely laid back, there are still several touching scenes and moments, from the conclusion of the cherry blossoms episode to Morte’s temporary connection to the beastmen working in his family’s bookstore, it has the ability to pull heartstrings, at least on a small scale.  It does sort of foul this up towards the end, with a series of huge reveals taking the story in kind of an unnecessarily dark direction, but like I said before, it’s brief, and it ultimately builds towards a fairly decent conclusion that only flirts with pretentious misanthropy, instead of going all the way with it like Morte’s character kind of suggested it might.  It’s a lighter, looser kind of adventure, and I suggest checking it out at least once.Sands of Destruction is available from Funimation as part of it’s SAVE collection, which makes it really easy to find and really cheap.  I’m afraid I can’t say the same for the game it’s based on, as even a used cartridge, on it’s own, can run you around thirty dollars.  The manga, by ASCII Media works, is not available stateside.I wish I could say that this anime’s obscurity is unjustified, or that it’s some forgotten gem that must be seen and appreciated for it’s brilliance, but I can’t.  It doesn’t honestly have that much to offer outside of some weird spectacle and an all-around pleasant and inoffensive experience.  I definitely like it, but I could also definitely live the rest of my life without ever seeing it again, sad though that may sound.  At the very least, it’s surprisingly good by the standards of video game adaptations...  I mean, it’s a much more enjoyable experience than something like Xenosaga the animation...  So it’s kind of a miracle in how it stacks up to other titles of it’s ilk, but as an island, it’s a pretty forgettable show.  If you’re looking for a cheap, light-hearted and easily digestable action show, you could do a lot worse.  I give Sands of Destruction a 6/10. as humanity has been designated a race of second class citizens, with some settlements killing us on sight, others enslaving us or simply refusing to acknowledging us, and the areas where we can exist as equals being few and far between.

Even outside of instrumentation and tune, the sound quality alone is beyond impressive.  Most of you reading this probably won’t ever watch Sands of Destruction, but at the very least, look up the track Yoru no Houmonsha, for a taste of just how rich and complex this music is.  Having said that, the opening leaves something to be desired, as it’s visuals are a bit clunky and jarringly inconsistent, and the tune...  Particularly the sting at the beginning...  Create a promise of edginess and grit that the series fails laughably to follow up on.The English dub is a Funimation effort, and since it came out around the turn of the decade, it makes sense that they went with two of their safest options for the lead roles.  Everybody loves Luci Christian and Todd Haberkorn, especially when they’re doing their normal shtick, right?  They’re recognizable voices, usually strong performers, and they’re both really popular, so it made sense to put them here.  And yeah, they do solid jobs, so I can’t really take anything away from them there, even if their casting doesn’t feel inspired at all.  Luci has a lock on playing strong female characters, especially ones who have red hair...  Has anyone else noticed that?  She’s able to dial up the necessary drama and tragedy, and even the occasional comedy, whenever she needs to.  I’ve never really understood what people see(Or hear, I guess) in Todd Haberkorn’s nasally voice, but when he raises his pitch, he can play likeable little-brother type characters really well.  And like I said before, he’s a solid actor in general.Leaving the human characters for a moment, there are two actors who had to play tough, hardened warriors in the form of small Teddy bears, and the fact that they were able to do this without cracking up or breaking character is a testament to their professionalism and dedication to their craft.  Christopher Sabat may have only appeared in one episode, but lending his growling, deathly serious tough-guy routine to the tiny Yappy instantly elevates him to the top of the pack, at least for this show.  Robert McCullom, who I don’t think I’ve ever talked about before, takes a slightly lighter approach to the main character Taupy, also a tiny bear, but where his old friend has turned from the path of justice, Taupy still carries a touch of innocence inside of him, which his actor is great at bringing out.  My favorite performer in this dub is probably Trina Nishimura, who plays Lia, a descendant of Dragon beastmen, and since her character is an overzealous and easily angered loose canon, she has way too much fun with her.  Beyond these names, the cast is saturated with well known Funimation names, and it’s an okay dub in general.It’s not overtly obvious throughout the series that it’s based on a video game, but once you do hear that piece of it’s background, it does explain a lot.  I’ve never played Sands of Destruction for the Nintendo DS, but from what I’ve heard, it’s the kind of final Fantasy inspired game that starts off promising, but eventually loses it’s focus and crumbles under it’s own weight.  to be fair, that does seem like something the anime went through, but only at the very end, and to it’s credit, it only happens very briefly.  More to the point, it’s video game origin does explain a lot about it’s story structure and pace, as it’s a show about a small party of misfits from different walks of life who travel all over the map to accomplish  a vaguely stated goal relating to the end of the world.  There are times when it does feel like a video game speedrun, except with all the grinding, random encounters and puzzle-solving cut out to tell just the story on it’s own merits, and while it’s not impossible to tell a good story like that, there’s a good reason why not many franchises ever try it.For one thing, the most important element of any game is the actual gameplay, which is where the majority of the focus during production should go.  Gameplay isn’t just a string of endless fights and challenges, it endears you to characters.  It gets you invested in them.  It drives the story, as the character’s struggles become more personal to you.  Free exploration is a fantastic way of developing lore and dumping exposition, things that are difficult to do in scripted media.  With the element of gameplay removed, media based on games has been almost universally bad to a laughable degree, even in regard to some anime adaptations, and when a game has as little actual depth as Sands of Destruction, that lack of gameplay is a compensation to make.  Thus, this series is puddle deep even at the best of times, being incredibly shallow in both it’s story and it’s characters, with no real themes or ideas to play around with, nothing really engaging going on at any given time, and it’s few flashes of emotional resonance being exactly that...  Nothing but the briefest of  flashes.All of this could have been a huge issue, making it a dull, boring slog the likes of Ragnarok the Animation, if it was to make the mistake of taking itself seriously, but thank God, Sands of Destruction was able to dodge that bullet.  I’m not going to say this series doesn’t try, or doesn’t put in any effort, but it’s extremely light-hearted, which is a life-saver in terms of watchability.  It embraces it’s weirdness, explores the ramifications and implications of it’s universe in ways that are straight forward while at the same time delightfully tongue-in-cheek, and it plays the ‘sea of sand, how bizarre is that’ card at every opportunity.  Very early on, I thought about how darkly funny it would be to see one of these sand ships get stuck under...sand, with the crew having to face the threat of drowning in sand, and while I was just being a dick at the time, you better believe they actually go that route in one episode.  No character is ever allowed to point out how ridiculous these kind of occurrences are, but the audience is highly encouraged to try and wrap their heads around it, and I respect that kind of approach to weirdness.But the biggest asset that Sands of Destruction has is it’s cast of characters, and the dynamic between them.  To be clear, none of them are any deeper than your common golfing divot, but our heroes, our stock characters and even a few of the villains are still all fun and interesting to some degree.  As I alluded in my plot synopsis, the main cast is on a quest to destroy the world, which almost instantly makes their enemies likeable, as they’re on our side, trying to save the world.  Even our heroes, in spite of this, are still effective because of their motives.  Morte has a reason to want to end the world, and while it doesn’t make much logical sense, it makes perfect sense from an emotional perspective, and of course she grows to be conflicted as she nears her goal.  Her friends stick with her because...  Well, they’re her friends.  They’ve been lumped in with her as criminals through circumstance, and they really have nowhere else to go, so they support her, they stick with her, and they just kinda hope she’ll change her mind.And I think it’s this sense of camaraderie that keeps me coming back to the series.  Despite the apocalyptic premise, I like seeing this collection of friends on their journey, all of them genuinely caring about and supporting each other, even though one of them wants to inadvertently kill all three of them.  And while the tone of the series may be entirely laid back, there are still several touching scenes and moments, from the conclusion of the cherry blossoms episode to Morte’s temporary connection to the beastmen working in his family’s bookstore, it has the ability to pull heartstrings, at least on a small scale.  It does sort of foul this up towards the end, with a series of huge reveals taking the story in kind of an unnecessarily dark direction, but like I said before, it’s brief, and it ultimately builds towards a fairly decent conclusion that only flirts with pretentious misanthropy, instead of going all the way with it like Morte’s character kind of suggested it might.  It’s a lighter, looser kind of adventure, and I suggest checking it out at least once.Sands of Destruction is available from Funimation as part of it’s SAVE collection, which makes it really easy to find and really cheap.  I’m afraid I can’t say the same for the game it’s based on, as even a used cartridge, on it’s own, can run you around thirty dollars.  The manga, by ASCII Media works, is not available stateside.I wish I could say that this anime’s obscurity is unjustified, or that it’s some forgotten gem that must be seen and appreciated for it’s brilliance, but I can’t.  It doesn’t honestly have that much to offer outside of some weird spectacle and an all-around pleasant and inoffensive experience.  I definitely like it, but I could also definitely live the rest of my life without ever seeing it again, sad though that may sound.  At the very least, it’s surprisingly good by the standards of video game adaptations...  I mean, it’s a much more enjoyable experience than something like Xenosaga the animation...  So it’s kind of a miracle in how it stacks up to other titles of it’s ilk, but as an island, it’s a pretty forgettable show.  If you’re looking for a cheap, light-hearted and easily digestable action show, you could do a lot worse.  I give Sands of Destruction a 6/10.', ""World DestructionThis anime is not too long and it doesn't take too long to watch it.It's not a real serious anime, but it's quite funny and the characters are fun.The story is good, but it couldn't go on forever because it would become boring.I can only say that I like it, because it's funny, it has a good story and it's not too long.A lot of people, including me, don't want to watch a enormous long anime like one piece.I think anime like those are better because they are shorter, so it doesn't take too long, but the story of longer animes is better...and you see more about the character.So I gave it an 8.It's a good anime. and you see more about the character.So I gave it an 8.It's a good anime."", 'It took me until about episode 8 or 9 to really warm up to the series, just as others had mentioned.

I enjoyed this sort of, but some parts the anime goes by pretty fast and doesn't really let you feel story.

Tad of romance, comedy, and action."", 'In 2008, Sega published a ""good, but not great"" game called Sands of Destruction. Just as had happened with Sonic the Hedgehog, Panzer Dragoon and Shining Hearts, they felt that what it needed to promote the game was --- an anime adaptation.This anime, entitled ""World Destruction: The Six People That Will Destroy the World"", is set on a planet where the seas are made of sand and humanity is inferior to the Beastmen. How either species keep hydrated is never touched upon.STORY (3/10) --- Now, an average boy named Kyrie Illunis is forced to go on a journey with the enigmatic Morte Urshela after she...inadvertently exposes his identity as a human. A journey to where? There is no answer to this question. Morte wants to destroy the world using an orb she calls the Destruct Code. Apparently, this involves a large amount of hiking. Along the way, a Beastman bear named Toppy joins them.The group, known as the World Destruction Committee, are being chased by the World Salvation Committee, made up of a half-human Naja and Lia, who is descended from dragons. They are not so much a threat as a plot device to keep the WDC moving. That is, until Lia is provoked.The story is rather disjointed for the majority of the series, with each episode featuring the World Destruction Committee getting stuck in some situation. Kidnap is usually the reason given, but it is as if the characters are simply wandering around waiting for these things to happen. Naja and Lia are always just behind, obtaining information they could have no way  of knowing and generally just trailing along in the WDC\'s footsteps. Fortunately, the last few episodes of the series break away from this tired formula to present a climax that was almost good.CHARACTERS (5/10) --- Overall, Kyrie is mostly useless for the vast majority of the show, serving only to interact with his more interesting companions. Morte and Toppy may just be able to redeem the series. Morte is an interesting character with an unconventional mission and is the focal point of the few emotional scenes, and Toppy is certainly likeable and provides some comic relief without diminishing his character.On the other team, we have Naja and Lia. Naja is a calm intellectual, while Lia is a hot-headed centuries-old woman with a tendency to attack first and ask questions later. While they do not seem to be an actual threat to the WDC, Lia and Naja\'s scenes contrast well with that of the trio.Aside from the main five (who\'s the sixth who will destroy the world, I hear you ask?), there is an average size cast. We have a smuggler, Morte\'s deceased brother, and an antagonistic alligator. All of these fail to interest, although Morte\'s brother does prove himself to be important in terms of plot, and as the driving force for Morte.In terms of character development, there is certainly some emotional journey that occurs alongside the mindless mountain-trekking and countless kidnappings. Morte\'s past and coming to terms with it is an important aspect that plays a large role in the climax. The three main characters, who are thrown together and forced to work as a team, truly grow close to one another. Lia gets her five minutes of awesome towards the end, but Naja is much the same person throughout the series, making no notable change.ART (6/10) --- The art is not particularly worthy of its own section. The characters vary very little from their game counterparts, and scenery is decent. One quarrel I have is with the design of the Beastmen. Their designs are uninspired and uncreative. Everything else is perfectly... average.MUSIC (6/10) --- The music is not distracting nor inappropriate (a la Mars of Destruction). In fact, at the end, you\'ll be wondering if there was any music. The opening credits feature ""ZERØ"" by pop band AAA. While it is good in partnership with the opening, it does seem out of place with the actual content of the series.DUB (10/10) --- The English dub has no faults that I can find. Strangely, Toppy\'s use of the word ""kuma"" at the end of just about every sentence does not get irritating.HEAD SCRATCHERS --- If the world is at stake, why is it that only a dragon and a half-breed are sent? How is the world kept hydrated? If there are rivers, where do they all flow to? How do sand whales survive and move in sand? Why did it take so long for Kyrie to ask the question the audience was dying to have asked --- why does Morte want to destroy the world?IN CONCLUSION--------------------World Destruction is little more than something thrown together to promote a game published by Sega, a shadow of its former glory. No new themes are presented and the story is largely routine for an average fantasy series. The first seven or eight episodes do not drive the plot forward at all, simply providing another twenty-odd minutes for the WDC to run around and get captured. When the climax comes, it\'s a case of too little, too late.But despite everything that\'s been said, there are things far worse than World Destruction.  I wouldn\'t recommend it for those looking for storyline, but its vibrant main cast and weekly misadventures make over four hours of mindless entertainment.Kuma. inadvertently exposes his identity as a human.

I picked the series up only cause I am a lover of the action/adventure/RPG anime.The anime is based on the Nintendo DS RPG game by SEGA, released in Japan July, 2008.The world is split between beastman and humans, with beastman being the stronger ones and humans being afraid of them. The 2 races obviously don\'t get along well.The story follows a young boy named Kyrie who wants to become a hero but by an accident gets recruited to join the ""World Destruction Committee""by a girl named Morte.

Xi You Ji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32230/Xi_You_Ji,"['Note: this review is about the original Chinese release in 1999, not the English dub / edit.This show was key in introducing my childhood self to ancient Chinese mythology, culture and literature. It made one of China’s “Four Great Classical Novels” extremely accessible to a younger audience. I swear China has at least one new modern adaptation for “Journey to the West” every year (what can I say – we all love it!), but this cartoon remains one of the best. The original story remains a huge influence for modern media, from Dragon Ball, to RWBY, to League of Legends.This review will be a blend...between my impression of this show as a young child first experiencing it and as a young adult revisiting it.______________________________________________Story: 9/10It’s a classic story that works really well for adaptation purposes: it has a huge expansive world, a wide cast of characters firmly cemented in something the audience already knows (in this case, classic Chinese mythology), a tale of unlikely friends banding together to achieve a great goal, dynamic and round characters who all have their own extensive past, a huge variety of obstacles and villains to conquer, etc. These are the hallmarks of great adventure stories, and are common elements in successful stories today as well.The story structure is familiar; there is one big overarching adventure with a huge goal that the protagonists slowly approach, and smaller arcs with different antagonists and supporting protagonists. It’s a narrative structure that has withstood the test of time, and one that is used by modern stories (like shounen) over and over.Now that I’m older I can recognize and appreciate these themes, but honestly as a little kid I just had a blast feeling like I was a part of the adventure and friends with the characters, defeating all those who stand in our way and being badass. When you watch this, you can read into it deeper and delve into some Chinese myth, history, and culture to enrich your experience, or just enjoy this as an easy-viewing fun filled adventure. Both work well for this show.______________________________________________Art/Animation: 10/10This is something I couldn’t really appreciate as a child, but watching the cartoon recently, I can see the limitations in traditional animation from the 90s. Keeping that in mind as the basis of judgement, I think the quality is wonderful. The character designs really captured the personality the cast. The way the characters move also represents their personality. The background art is beautifully coloured and detailed. The animators did a wonderful job of translating traditional Chinese art into a modern cartoon – not only representing the fashion and architecture of the time, but also drawing inspiration from classic Chinese paintings.This story is filled with action, and the fight scenes are dynamically animated. You won’t find any lame freeze frame character glamour shots with a blurry background whizzing behind them here. The characters move fluidly and the hits have weight. Due to the nature of the character’s powers, the fights are especially flashy.______________________________________________Sound: 10/10The opening and closing themes are absolutely iconic. I still know them by heart after almost two decades. The background music is great at communicating different moods, particularly comedy and tension.The voice acting is solid and all the actors sound exactly the way the characters should. After over 50 film/television adaptations of this story, there are specific voices people associate with the cast, and this cartoon does all of them very well. (Note: I have only ever seen the Mandarin version. I only just found out there is apparently an English dub, though I’ve never managed to find it. I recommend trying the Mandarin version with subs. I checked out a bit of it and the translation seems to be as accurate as a Chinese to English translation can get.)______________________________________________Character: 8/10This show begins with the origins of Sun WuKong, establishing him as the main focus of the show. I think WuKong might be the original “overpowered protagonist”. Out of the main cast of 4 (or 5 if you count the horse), he is without a doubt everyone’s favourite. One of the simplest pleasures of life is watching a lovable character become stronger and stronger, and outsmart and defeat their enemies in spectacular ways. The other characters also have interesting pasts that are depicted in the show (even the horse), but there is no doubt WuKong is the star. He has been many people’s childhood hero (including me for sure).A lot of WuKong’s personality and powers can be seen in modern shounen anime (Goku and Naruto for example). He is the original lovable hotheaded but trustworthy and playful guy with incredible skills who is always fighting for what’s right and defending his friends. Without a doubt, Journey to the West has been a huge influencer of Eastern culture and media. Because this story draws so much from Chinese mythology, I could recognize characters from other stories I’d heard, and connect everything in my mind to form a richer narrative. Foreign audiences may lose this layer of detail, but the characters are strong enough on their own that this won’t detract much from your experience.______________________________________________Enjoyment: 10/10I was completely enamored with this series when I was growing up. I would watch the whole thing endless on repeat with my box set of DVDs. One day recently I was feeling particularly nostalgic and watched it again for old time’s sake. I wasn’t completely mind blown and rendered motionless by pure wonder like I was as a kid, obviously, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. There’s a surprising amount of detail and subtlety that I realized I had missed as a kid, which makes me believe that an older audience can enjoy it as well.______________________________________________Overall: 9/10If I was still 5 years old I would give this show an 11/10. Nostalgia often clouds people’s vision when judging something they loved as a kid, but I genuinely think this is an unbiased review. For this one show that I loved as a kid that I still love now, there are dozens of other shows that I have tossed out of mind.Watching this show at my current age, I can see how the animation may feel outdated, or how the plotline and characters may feel too simple for a more mature audience. Its also very possible that someone with no background in Chinese culture or mythology will find some parts of the plot or characters harder to understand. This story is built upon a lot of established myths and deities, and doesn’t always explain things in depth. A significant amount of cultural significance is lost without this background knowledge, but even without it, a foreign audience can still appreciate this show and perhaps even use it as a starting point to learn more about Chinese culture. The fantasy world this show builds is strong enough on its own to stand as an independent work of art.This cartoon or “dong hua pian"" is still viewed as an example of great classic Chinese animation, and it has played a role in being the predecessor of the all the successful elements of adventure stories. Of course, it\'s also just good fun to watch, and easy to take in. between my impression of this show as a young child first experiencing it and as a young adult revisiting it.______________________________________________Story: 9/10It’s a classic story that works really well for adaptation purposes: it has a huge expansive world, a wide cast of characters firmly cemented in something the audience already knows (in this case, classic Chinese mythology), a tale of unlikely friends banding together to achieve a great goal, dynamic and round characters who all have their own extensive past, a huge variety of obstacles and villains to conquer, etc. These are the hallmarks of great adventure stories, and are common elements in successful stories today as well.The story structure is familiar; there is one big overarching adventure with a huge goal that the protagonists slowly approach, and smaller arcs with different antagonists and supporting protagonists. It’s a narrative structure that has withstood the test of time, and one that is used by modern stories (like shounen) over and over.Now that I’m older I can recognize and appreciate these themes, but honestly as a little kid I just had a blast feeling like I was a part of the adventure and friends with the characters, defeating all those who stand in our way and being badass. When you watch this, you can read into it deeper and delve into some Chinese myth, history, and culture to enrich your experience, or just enjoy this as an easy-viewing fun filled adventure. Both work well for this show.______________________________________________Art/Animation: 10/10This is something I couldn’t really appreciate as a child, but watching the cartoon recently, I can see the limitations in traditional animation from the 90s. Keeping that in mind as the basis of judgement, I think the quality is wonderful. The character designs really captured the personality the cast. The way the characters move also represents their personality. The background art is beautifully coloured and detailed. The animators did a wonderful job of translating traditional Chinese art into a modern cartoon – not only representing the fashion and architecture of the time, but also drawing inspiration from classic Chinese paintings.This story is filled with action, and the fight scenes are dynamically animated. You won’t find any lame freeze frame character glamour shots with a blurry background whizzing behind them here. The characters move fluidly and the hits have weight. Due to the nature of the character’s powers, the fights are especially flashy.______________________________________________Sound: 10/10The opening and closing themes are absolutely iconic.

Of course, it\'s also just good fun to watch, and easy to take in.', 'Journey to the West is one of the oldest action adventure tales as well as one of the oldest examples of the five man band trope (yes, the horse counts) but this incarnation of the tale still holds up as a highly original work in a landscape saturated with action-adventure shows inspired from it. The most prominent of these is Dragon Ball Z, and I\'m just going to come out and say it: Xi You Ji walks all over Dragon Ball Z even when I remove my nostalgia glasses. Yes, it\'s still mainly an action-adventure series aimed at kids so there won\'t be much intellectual...substance, long, complex story arcs, deep characters, nor emotional drama. It doesn\'t reach for these things either, as its tone, visuals, and music indicate that it\'s an honest attempt to tell fun, episodic adventures, and its plentiful charm allows it to succeed in this. Whereas Dragon Ball Z\'s 2 episode long constipating contests, poorly handled power creep, and corny hero-villain dialogue make it inaccessible to viewers who didn\'t grow up with it, Xi You Ji\'s charm holds up for both kids and adults just like Tom and Jerry\'s childish slapstick comedy is timeless.(Edit: To say that Xi You Ji has nothing to say of substance would be inaccurate. The Journey to the West is about the individual\'s journey to cultivate the self. Wukong represents the mind, Tripitaka represents the heart, Pigsy represents our base instincts, and Sandy represents our common sense. We need to balance all these aspects of the self and in order to do so, we must go through numerous tribulations. Tripitaka\'s compassion and spirituality leads him to be too trusting towards demons and lands him in trouble and that\'s why he needs Wukong\'s cunning intellect, practicality, and ability to do what needs to be done. Wukong on the other hand, suffers from lack of self-restraint and spirituality. Compassion and spirituality must be tempered by logic and practicality. When Wukong decides to leave Flower Fruit Mountain and continue his journey, his monkey subjects beg him not to leave. They tell him that if he goes, he will suffer numerous hardships whereas if he stays, he can enjoy being king and having everything at his disposal. Wukong replies that he must go, because going through the 82 tribulations is honing his soul and his character. )Most of this charm comes from the mandarin voice acting itself (which is fantastic, especially in the delivery of the comedic moments) and Son Wukong\'s personality. Mischievous, clever, persistent, and rebellious, Son Wukong stands up for what he believes is right, with a particular disdain for pompous authority figures. Moreover, he can back it up. His journey from a monkey born out of a giant rock to Monkey King, to Great Sage Equal to Heaven, is equal parts empowering in the way he takes on all of Heaven and wins.Endearingly humorous, he answers trickery and connivery with clever wit and even greater trickery stemming from his monkey mischievousness. Here is what separates Xi You Ji from most other action-adventure series/shounen. The action conflicts are not simply bouts of who is more powerful or who is more intelligent; yes, Wukong is more powerful than his enemies most of the time, but he prefers to use his ability to transform into anything and deception to play with his enemies (monkeying around, if you will), making for some really fun sequences. As a result, it doesn\'t have to rely on power levels to get viewers invested in the fights, and each fight is unique and creative.It\'s really hard to describe (and that\'s a good thing) so it\'s best you look up clips on Youtube to see what I mean. For now, I\'ll give an example. In one episode, it seems Wukong has finally met his match in Erlang Shen. In most series where two rivals fight, they try to hype it up with insane feats of power from both characters (Oh my god, they\'re both moving so fast we can\'t see them! Woah, he\'s so strong! Wow, I can\'t believe how he predicted that move!). Here, Wukong and Erlang Shen do compete to see who can grow the biggest, but then they both reach their limits and they start arguing about who should grow smaller first. Later, Wukong tries to flee so he turns into a sparrow, so Erlang Shen turns into a raven to chase him. In turn, Wukong turns into a hawk and chases Erlang Shen, who then turns into a condor, etc, etc.In general, the villains are also charmingly villainous. Most of the time, they\'ll just be demons doing demon things, saying ""We\'ll eat Tripitaka and gain immortality!"" and they\'ll sound cute and diabolical at the same time. Objectively, many of the villains are repetitive, just like how in this 52 episode series some of the episodes may start to feel boring and drag due to the lack of much of an overarching plot and sparse character development. Still, the decent stories and villains are well distributed throughout the series. The fact that each of the villains are defeated in a different way, often requiring Wukong to come up with a creative solution, especially helps reduce the wear from the episodic story structure. However, it is also clear that Wukong is too overpowered for the story\'s good and some episodes will depower him to create conflict and use deus ex machinas to defeat the villain. Another thing to note is that though this series is supposedly for children, there is an ample amount of violence. Wukong has no problem killing his enemies with a big thump of his Ruyi Jingu Bang (and the show makes it clear people are dead), in case you\'re worried the action is too childish.Even though I did say that there aren\'t any deep characters, Sun Wukong is still a great lead character unlike any other whose charisma keeps him interesting all 52 episodes. Zhu Bajie (Piggsy) is one of the best comedic characters out there, whose lovable lust, gluttony, and selfishness rivals Sun Wukong\'s lovable mischievousness, cleverness, and rebelliousness. Sandy\'s just there most of the time to play the straight man and is pretty weak in a battle unless it\'s in the sea. Tripitaka is the damsel in most of the episodes and often comes off as pious and self-righteous, making Sun Wukong\'s devotion to him somewhat unbelievable. And yet, the bond between teacher and student does provide for some emotional moments throughout the show, bolstered by the great soundtrack.From a technical standpoint, Xi You Ji might not be anything special compared to anime from the same time period, but it should be noted that the Chinese animation industry was crippled for decades by communist censorship and what Xi You Ji has achieved in spite of that should be given high praise. The backgrounds are beautifully drawn and the art is shows a unique Chinese touch without leaning on the style of the much more mature anime industry. As I said, the music is exceptional as well. The opening song tells of the legend of Wukong with powerful dignity, conveyed by a vigorous male voice that puts most generic rock OP\'s to utter shame, while the ending is a catchy children\'s choir song.Not only is Xi You Ji a significant cultural work drawing on the last remaining vestiges of Chinese civilization that have escaped communist depravity, but it is the best kind of children\'s story- the kind that will make you rediscover and cherish our youthful monkey nature. substance, long, complex story arcs, deep characters, nor emotional drama.

Faithful and so fun to watch adaptation of the classic Journey to the West literature."", 'Disclaimer: This review will be based on my memories as a child when I was watching the Chinese dub version of the show. Also, I watched this without any English subtitles and I did not watch an English dubbed version.Considering this was an adaptation to one of the four greatest Chinese literature (Journey to the West) it did an outstanding job to make it accessible for a young audience (i.e. children) to watch and enjoy the show. I remember watching this and always enjoyed the fight scenes and the magic (fa shu) used by the characters in the animation.Story-wise I believe most of the characters...are present (if you exclude the main gang: Sun Wu Kong (monkey), Zhu Ba Jie (Pigsy), Sha He Shang (Sandy), and Tang San Zang (Tripitaka)) to give a coherent story from beginning to end on how the Journey to the West came about. Although considering the style of the show has the ""monster of the week"" trope and there are 52 episodes altogether it might not add up to the total tribulations that Tripitaka has to overcome. However, it is enough to keep you entertained in terms of character development and the dynamic between the three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Underworld. I will add that there is some simplicity in the story where you can say ""Isn\'t it just good guys beat bad guys?"" and I will say yes it does feel like that but for a young audience it does make sense. If you are interested in each of these ""monsters"" and want to understand why they became the way they are then it may be better to read the original literature and read from there.Art and Sound are impressive considering it was from the late 90\'s that it was produced. Of course, it will not compare to current animation production but at the time it was good enough to get you hooked into the series especially the many fight scenes present.Characters are very enjoyable and unique in their own way - though, considering the tribulations had to be unique it makes sense. There is the repeat of saving the monk or helping a stranger since their close friend/relative was kidnapped scenarios but the way the characters resolve each one and the reasons why these mishaps happened are unique in their own way. Moreover, the series does it quite well to show the impacts of one character\'s actions (in one episode) do have consequences, in the long run (like 5 episodes or more), where it will come back to bite them.Overall, this is a very enjoyable show that simplifies the story of Journey to the West in a well and understood story. A simple beginning, middle and end with little to no complications that could confuse the story. (I might be biased here considering that I am doing it from memory rather than actually rewatching the whole thing).SIDE NOTE: Remember this was meant for a young audience to watch so the language used will be very basic with little complications. Therefore, they will not go into too much world-building nor would they try to explain all the mechanics for using magic (fa shu) that the characters used. So if you were hoping for a deeper, in-lore about the ancient gods and the reason why they act as they do then you may need to do a little bit of research yourself (or watch some Chinese tv dramas) to get this information. are present (if you exclude the main gang: Sun Wu Kong (monkey), Zhu Ba Jie (Pigsy), Sha He Shang (Sandy), and Tang San Zang (Tripitaka)) to give a coherent story from beginning to end on how the Journey to the West came about.

Characters are changed and highly simplified, new pairings are made for no really valid reasons and nothing interesting is added, erasing what was already well done and making this childish and uninteresting.All the drama and love is taken out, leaving a really poor and simplistic story. And the final episode is a very poor substitute to the beautiful end the original El Hazard has.Funny is I saw this one first, and...that made me look for the other iterations of this series, for the images I saw were not matching this anime.I added a real masterpiece with El Hazard: The Magnificent World...About Wanderers....I advise to stay away from it. that made me look for the other iterations of this series, for the images I saw were not matching this anime.I added a real masterpiece with El Hazard: The Magnificent World...About Wanderers....I advise to stay away from it.', 'With 2010 coming to a close, I decided I\'d end this year in reviews by talking about one of my favorite anime television series of all time that\'s just as equally frustrating. If one anime franchise has been the very definiton of a mixed bag for me, it\'s been the El Hazard series, spin-offs, and sequels. Brought to us by the same production studio that brought us the Tenchi franchise, another show I\'ve been indifferent about for almost 20 years, might have something to do with it.To start, I\'m a huge mark for both the TV show and the Magnificent World OAV (El Hazard...2 was mediocre at best and I really hated Alternative World a lot) and I have no problems accepting their differences. Most of the changes made for The Wanderers I would assume is because a lot of material from the Magnificent World wouldn\'t fly on television (the profanity, nudity, lesbian titillation), so I was very confused when I began watching the OAV after finishing the TV show first some 14 years ago, buying the VHS tapes from Funcoland (later called Gamestop, there\'s one on every corner now).For the most part, I thought the changes were very clever and ultimately put to good use for Wanderers. I really enjoyed Ifurita as a bumbling air head as opposed to the nearly emotionless robot from the OAV. Her cold demeanor in Magnicent World made it way too predictable as to what would happen with her and Makoto near the climax. I called it way back then and I still think dark Ifurita is the glaring weakness from the OAV and put a damper on the experience for me. There are other very major changes made that affects the path of the plot to the point of a script overhaul, but seriously, if you accept the differences, you can enjoy both in their regard.Even with comparisons aside, The Wanderers is one of the best (if not the best) fantasy anime TV series I\'ve seen. I used to be a fan alternate demonsion-based stories until Fushigi Yugi ruined everything, and El Hazard\'s universe is vast with vibrant colors, other-worldly monsters, unique settings, and a fun cast of characters.Man, do I love the character\'s. It follows the Tenchi protocol of harem syndrome (one doofy guy and some hot girls), but this formula worked well in the 90\'s, as every joke doesn\'t have to be perverted to a ridiculous degree. The three priestesses are all still the same, the rivalry between Shayla Shayla and Afura Mann is a little more fleshed out, Miz I think is a little wackier in this version, but it\'s still played for laughs. Alliele, Fatora\'s lesbian lover, is toned down consideralby and reduced to being a guide for Makoto and co. and has adopted a more ""big sister relationship with Nanami"". Makoto himself is still one of the most original male characters in a harem-ish themed show, as he actually DOES stuff and is very scientifically inclined. His brains adds a great deal of personality to him and keeps him from being ""every guy"" that populates harem titles. And I strongly accept a relationship with teenage shy girl Rune Venus rather than Plank-O-Wood Ifurita.One character that stays virually the same, regardless of the version your watching, is Katsuhiko Jinnai, and thank the heavens for that. Jinnai is my all time favorite anime villain and he is a blast to watch. Petty, vindictive, psychotic, manipulative, greedy, selfish, and meglomanical, Jinnai is everything a successful franchise needs in a good villain. It\'s like if you took Team Rocket, combined them with Light Yagami, added a dash of Dr. Wily, and garnished it with the Ginyu Force. And that bloody laugh, man I love it! It seems like the only thing he\'s missing is a Snidley Whiplash handle bar moustache to twirl! I can gaurantee that anyone will get a kick out of this guy, even when babysitting the brainless Ifurita! He\'s the glue that holds this series and it\'s incarnations together.IN CLOSING: Not many OAV to TV show transitions go really well in anime, but I think this is one of the better offerings. It seemed to be handled with a certain amount of care and detail and all the changes were overall pretty good to build a substantial television program. Even if the plot has a mild overhaul to it, I still really enjoy this version of El Hazard a lot, and while it\'s not quite better than the OAV, it does a few things that I really like more, and in part, keeps both of them fresh and entertaining in their own right without running too similar to one another.STORY: 8ART: 7SOUND: 8CHARACTER: 8ENJOYMENT: 9OVERALL SCORE: 8 out of 10PROS: Great story, a fun, diverse cast of characters, pretty darn funnyCONS: Some changes might anger fans of the OAV, this really shouldn\'t have been a franchiseP.S.

Obviously, most anime is produced with children in mind, but much of it can provide something extra that adults can enjoy. This doesn\'t, at least not for me.I TRIED so HARD to get into this anime. I saw some of it when I was younger from Hollywood video, and wanted to see the whole series, but it felt more like I was forcing myself to sit through it. It was very dull, like watching filler episode after filler episode, the plot was boring, the characters un-interestting. The worst thing an anime can be is...boring or nothing. I just didnt like it at all.this is to the orginal, what Tenchi Muyo, is to Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-Ohki. It\'s less original, simplified, contains more filler, and, in general aimed at a narrower, and much younger audience.

It's nothing too special, but it's decent - an interesting, feel-good adventure harem story. I was entertained much of the time, even if I knew there was nothing too unique about this show. It follows Rein, a beast tamer who is incredibly OP but in denial about it. It follows his adventures and as he keeps binding cute beast girls to himself, his harem, strength, and popularity grows. It's a silly and generic show, but hilarious at times, and surprisingly wholesome entertainment. There are clear plot arcs, so viewers will be engaged, even...if it's a fairly predictable show.The opening/closing music is great, as well as relatively peaceful and sweet. There is enough fodder for a season 2, and much worse shows have gotten renewed, so I think this deserves it. All in all, if you have extra time to kill, want to watch something where you can shut off your brain, and want to follow a simple storyline with good visuals and music, then you can give Beast Tamer a try. if it's a fairly predictable show.The opening/closing music is great, as well as relatively peaceful and sweet.

I don\'t want to discourage anyone from watching this anime, I simply want to share my thoughts on it, so if you like it that\'s great! Also, spoiler warning I guess. With that out of the way, I\'ll talk about the first 3 episodes.Rein is a beast tamer and part of the Hero party, set on defeating the demon king or someting. However, he gets fired by his teammates and now has to find a new occupation. That\'s the basic premise of the anime. Firstly, I find it odd that it took six months for the unapologetic hero...party to kick Rein out. Apparently they have found him useless for a long time but it took them this long to make a move, suddenly becoming aggressive towards him, but let\'s keep going.Set on becoming an adventurer, Rein is in the middle of his guild entrance trial when he finds a cat spirit named Kanade being attacked by a ferocious monster. He tries saving her but she ends up saving herself, as cat spirits are apparently a very strong ""ultimate species"". At this moment I didn\'t understand how and why Kanade was even in trouble in the first place, since she was the one that got herself out of it. Why was she weakly sitting on the ground if she can easily defeat the monster?Following this, Rein and Kanade immediately become acquainted and best friends, to the point where Kanade suggests being tamed by Rein, which he does. This moment along with the following episode tell us that, apparently, Rein is a surreal beast tamer, one of the best there\'s ever been. Taming a cat spirit, an ""ultimate species"", is no easy task after all. Then why was he kicked out of the hero\'s party? How come THE heroes that are set on saving the entire realm from the demon king and Rein himself aren\'t able to understand that Rein is so powerful? Why did he never even attempt to tame high level monsters if he supposedly can tame the strongest types of beasts?Another thing I disliked was how quickly Kanade fell for Rein. I understand this is a wish fullfilment anime, and the MC is supposed to be the viewer\'s self insert, with the various girls filling an harem where they are in love with him or whatever, but I can\'t get over how in mere minutes Kanade decided to form a very serious life-long contract with a tamer she knows close to nothing about. In the 2nd episode she watches him beat up a bunch of dudes and she is just blushing and falling for him. I think these moments are very forced.I just skimmed through the 3rd episode, but Rein builds his harem with a new Dragonoid girl, a tsundere this time, and that\'s enough for me.I also want to mention that the animation is very subpar. The action scenes we got were very poorly animated, with many still frames and cuts. There are several cringeworthy attempts at comedy where Kanade is trying to be cute, but that for me just reinforced the wish fullfilment.I don\'t personally recommend this anime but I feel like some people could enjoy this. I just felt like sharing why I disliked what I watched and thus serving as a warning to those who might want to give this show a chance. party to kick Rein out.

It\'s exactly what you think it is. So why am I recommending it? Because it\'s exactly what I thought it was. Unlike every other review apparently. I didn\'t expect it to be a really unique and interesting show, I knew it was going to be a generic fantasy harem slice of life show.Is it a fantastic show? No, I\'m giving it a 6/10, but it fills its niche exactly how it should. It\'s not some terrible show by any means because it makes no attempt to hide what kind of show it is. It\'s completely whatever and I don\'t fault...it for that at all. It\'s by design. I don\'t know what people were expecting when they went into a show called ""The Beast Tamer Who Got Kicked Out From His Party Meets a Cat Girl From the Superior Race"" but the show I watched was the exactly like the image my mind conjured up when I saw the name. I can enjoy it for what it is. It\'s a power fantasy slice of life. it for that at all. It\'s by design.

It\'s a power fantasy slice of life.', ""‟Oh man another fantasy anime in which the MC uses their power to create a shitty sex slave harem” -Someone, maybe ?It seems that a few people has this opinion about this anime, and I have no idea where they get the shitty harem and the MC just taming girls to do lewd things to them. Sure, the tags and the description makes it seems as a generic anime in which you TAME BEASTS and a bunch of sinful things, maybe that's fair. But I wanna say that it's not that, it's just a very wholesome anime, of the best ones that I've seen this...year, where you see an interesting, pretty basic true to that, but made in a very chill way, the harem part itself not really being used as a gimmick to have hot womans (and lolis) wanting to approach the MC, just as a gang of friends having fun together with nice story progression and character development, what else would you want ? To add to that, Rein isn't even making servitude, actually he even gives freedom to slaves in the anime, I think he is a pretty cool dude actually.To start off, the story is about Rein Shroud (I wonder if he's goated at CS:GO) being a beast tamer, someone who can make link with animals and tame them so they follow their orders, in the infamous hero team, the hero team goal is to kill the demon-lord and save the world, very epic and generic. But the important part to know is that Rein got kicked out of the hero team because he's only a useless beast tamer taming foxes and bears to carry shits around, he is kinda seen as the worst class in a MMORPG. The whole idea of this anime is that Rein tries to find a goal in his life, have fun and prove to the hero team that he isn't a useless piece of shit. In the story, he finds out that he's fucking OP and the best Beast Tamer in this world, able to tame superior species, which in this anime are a bunch of very cool waifus. In the span of 13 episodes that this anime composes, Rein gradually tames more waifus to his harem of some sort and become stronger, trying to kick the ass of the hero team who rejected him, and are actually dealing with a lot of problems on their side. It's all about the gang of Rein with his waifus VS the shitty egocentric hero team, the dynamic of the whole anime is pretty good following that. The story isn't rushed, every few episodes we meet another waifu and all of the inbetweens of the very important story arcs are filled with wholesome moments and nice discussions with Rein and the girls, finding out that Rein is just a normal and chill dude making friend, a fully sane human that isn't filled with thoughts of lust and power or world domination with shitty edgy sex jokes humour like a bunch of other anime.Everything about this anime is neat, sometimes great. Like the Opening sang by MADKID, it's pretty fucking good, while the ED is pretty chill and nice, what you'd expect for any ED from any anime that isn't called Chainsaw Man. The visuals are a very solid 8/10, always looking great in any situation and it's rushed or full of outsourcing in between, I don't have anything to complain about it. I already said how nice-guy Rein is, all of the other 5 waifus are also great, they vary from energetic, mommy (yes) and serious, loli twins with a desperate and a joking one and a shy girl. A great mix that gets better every episode, this anime can be cute, pretty funny and also pretty tense and epic when a big event is happening.To summarise up, if you want a classic anime, not breaking any boundaries of the same genre, but is chill and qualitative without having ANY ECCHI OR SEXUAL THOUGHTS (except literally one time and it wasn't sexual), then this anime is for you ! Join the Beast Tamer enjoyer gang, appreciate how much cool the gang is and how the hero team are a piece of shit in a well paced anime full of cool waifus, because at the end we are all anime degenerates that craves for them.A season 2 to this could be cool, pretty please. year, where you see an interesting, pretty basic true to that, but made in a very chill way, the harem part itself not really being used as a gimmick to have hot womans (and lolis) wanting to approach the MC, just as a gang of friends having fun together with nice story progression and character development, what else would you want ?

Throw in some action and fun combat scenes, count me in.But one area I just cannot get into is when the animation is so focused on Fan service and ecchi that is borders on the line of no plot and could have just been a hentai.This specific anime is once again with your OP MC that started out being concidered weak and dismissed from his party, to finding a super op anime girl that kicks ass for him, and loves him. Rinse and repeat for every episode.Some people love this genre, for me, they just dont make...it fun to watch. it fun to watch.', 'Not sure where the hate is.  It\'s like people were expecting either an erotic isekai beast-harem, or some epic world-spanning adventure tale.  This show doesn\'t advertise itself as any of that, and it\'s none of them.  It is EXACTLY what it advertises itself to be, a fun semi-sweet little romp of someone discovering they have worth while making a family of waifus.  It\'s mostly done in an innocent sweet way.  The art is pretty good, the animation standard, decent voice acting and the subs are fine.It\'s not high art or super-great anime, but it\'s not bad.  I give it...an extra half point taking it from 6.5-7 in in my book because it doesn\'t pretend to be anything it\'s not. It\'s not laying claims to high-fantasy, or insane story.  It\'s not trying to be an erotic tease show with way to much fan-service.

No. Is it a ""must see"" of the anime line up? No.  But If it\'s your type of show than you\'ll probably quite enjoy it.

This show has nothing. The main character is the most obvious Mary Sue I have ever seen. It’s somehow worse than Kirito because at least in SAO they attempted to make him edgy. In Beast Tamer this dude (I still don’t know his name) may as well be Jesus with how unbelievably perfect he is (without the charisma of course). He does not have a personality. And the girls are no better....They are all just one-dimensional cliches. You have the peppy happy girl who likes him. The snarky but kind girl who likes him. The nice and blunt twin loli duo who likes him. The tragic shy loli who likes him. And literally in the last episode how about we add the found family maid who likes him. It is so bland it hurts. It’s all smiles and ‘Oh *insert characters name* *insert laughing track*’. This dude gets a whole ass house for cheap because the real-estate agent likes him. That’s some bullshit. All of the characters are just raving about how nice and kind the MC is. Any problem that arises just gets solved instantly. Any male adversary is a super evil scumbag with no motive and any female adversary is just someone to add to the female companion list. The MC has a tragic past that's apparently supposed to be sad but he’s just like ‘yeah it’s a sad past’ and that’s it. Everyone is overpowered so much so there is no conflict. Literally these girls are supposed to be the strongest in the world and this show still pulls off misogyny. Like these girls act as nothing but the male MC’s accessories to compliment him and tell him how great he is. To dedicate their life to him and to fall in love with him. Which brings me to the Taming part. … It’s slavery right? I mean every other animal he tames obey his command without hesitation until he breaks the spell, so when he tames these girls doesn’t that mean the same would happen to them? Why are they so happy about it? He never asks anything they don’t like because he’s a Mary Sue so I can’t say for sure but it certainly seems that way. Anyways the climax was laughably terrible and stupid. This demon attacked this innocent town and literally no one got hurt (I’m talking civilians here but the main team as well). The new knight guard captain and her loyal followers (female of course) got rid of the evil bad man captain and every corrupt knight (all males) so now the town is defenseless (but not like that’s an issue apparently despite them being in a war(which has no bearing on the plot)). This show tries so hard to make the females strong and powerful but it is so obviously misogynistic that it hurts. They are all just one-dimensional cliches. You have the peppy happy girl who likes him. The snarky but kind girl who likes him. The nice and blunt twin loli duo who likes him. The tragic shy loli who likes him.

The MC has a tragic past that's apparently supposed to be sad but he’s just like ‘yeah it’s a sad past’ and that’s it. Everyone is overpowered so much so there is no conflict. Literally these girls are supposed to be the strongest in the world and this show still pulls off misogyny. Like these girls act as nothing but the male MC’s accessories to compliment him and tell him how great he is. To dedicate their life to him and to fall in love with him. Which brings me to the Taming part. … It’s slavery right? I mean every other animal he tames obey his command without hesitation until he breaks the spell, so when he tames these girls doesn’t that mean the same would happen to them? Why are they so happy about it? He never asks anything they don’t like because he’s a Mary Sue so I can’t say for sure but it certainly seems that way. Anyways the climax was laughably terrible and stupid. This demon attacked this innocent town and literally no one got hurt (I’m talking civilians here but the main team as well). The new knight guard captain and her loyal followers (female of course) got rid of the evil bad man captain and every corrupt knight (all males) so now the town is defenseless (but not like that’s an issue apparently despite them being in a war(which has no bearing on the plot)). This show tries so hard to make the females strong and powerful but it is so obviously misogynistic that it hurts."", 'Preface/Intro:---- All right, we know why we\'re all here. Cute anime girls = good time. So boom, I was in my AP Physics class and was like, ""this blows fat dick"" so I decided I\'d rather watch some anime. Let me say, the cover art did not disappoint.Art:---- The characters are all well-designed and artistically developed including the main character (who is not just a random guy with black hair). The waifus are attractive and are able to become waifus. There is minimal CG and the CG is not bad.8/10Plot:---- MC is betrayed by a bunch of dicks from the hero\'s party so...he gets a fuck ton of beast girl waifus and becomes stronger because of said waifus. Enough said.7/10Characters:---- Attractive beast girl waifus that do silly and goofy things. No they do not have the motivations or development like someone out of Death Note but that is not necessary to enjoy them. \'7/10Personal Enjoyment:---- The cute anime beast girls were exactly what I was asking for when I clicked on this anime. Beast girls are better than normal waifus and that is a fact. Also if it\'s not your cup of tea, there are a couple of fairies that come into the show later that pretty much look human, but I have not met a singular weeb who is not dtf for a cat girl, so yeah.8/10Overall:Good anime.

As many of the more negative reviews have pointed out, there isn\'t much original here. The setting is pretty generic, the heroes are good people, and the antagonists, like the ""Hero\'s Party"" are obnoxious for the sake of being obnoxious. It\'s not really a story about characters, it\'s a story about archetypes. If you just want to see some cute monster girls hang out with a chill dude that\'s nice to them without much in the way of drama, this is your show.

If the following aspects of the series do not bother you then, it might be worth giving the series a try.First the story is about how the main unappreciated character is kicked out of the ""Hero\'s party"" for seemingly no good reason other than the fact that they didn\'t see him as being exceptionally strong. The ""Hero\'s party"" is portrayed as being very unappreciative , somewhat cowardly and amoral. Like most stories with this setting, the ""Hero party"" realizes over time how important the main character...is.The main issue of the series that some people might find frustrating is that the main character is constantly being portrayed as ""Mary Sue"" character.  The main character is pretty much shown to be flawless in everyway.. He is kind, compassionate, heroic and ridiculously strong compared to everyone else. Of course, one the key factors of this trope isn\'t just his or her abilities but how everyone else perceives the character. Just being a flawless character wouldn\'t be that bad of a problem in the series if it wasn\'t compounded by the fact that he is constantly being recognized and reaffirmed as being such a great, strong, and amazing person. The main girl who accompanies the main character is pretty much always expositioning on how freakishly amazing the main character is. Everyone the main characters meets is pretty much completely ""wow\'d"" by how strong the main character is.In this aspect, the story feels like it\'s supposed to appeal to those who feel underappreciated from society, whether it would be with work, family, etc. . The anime feels like it\'s a fantasy of the people who are constantly thinking ""if I weren\'t here, you\'d realize how important the things I do are"".Another aspect of the series that seems weak to me is the main heroine of the story. Her trust and devotion to the main character feels very undeserved. It\'s one of those scenario where in anime, everyday basic bare minimum human kindness intereactions are treated as ""saintly acts"". Series usually try to heighten these basic acts of kindness by making everyone else the main heroine has met as selfish monsters. The main character pretty much just feeds her when she\'s hungry, and unintentionally shows off his amazing beast taming powers, and the main heroine decides that he\'s the best human being in the world.  Anotehr aspect about the main girl that might not be a problem to a lot of people is that her main personality is that she\'s ""kind"". As mentioned before, the main heroine, half of the time in the story is just expositioning on how amazing everything the main character is doing.  Personally I\'m not too fond of these types of characters. To me, the ""bad"" girls in the ""hero party"" are way more interesting because they have the opportunity to develop and change.I want to say the series would be way more enjoyable without he constant ""wanking"" by everyone else of the main character but unfortunately it\'s tied to the whole story. Tied enough to the story to say that being ""unappreciated by people you know from the past"" when in actuality you are ""a special amazing star to most other people"" is the main and reoccurring theme (so far).The animation isn\'t much to say about. Even one of the first scenes that shows that the main character is actually proficient at fighting is shown in ""still frozen shots"" of the main character fighting many armored enemies with the main heroine commentating on how strong he is.I know I\'ve mentioned lots of negatives about the series so far but despite that, the series isn\'t so bad. If you don\'t mind the main character being a ""mary sue"" and aren\'t bothered by the constant accolades and commendations the main character receives with ever thing he does, then the show is at the very least a decent fantasy ""pokemon-styled"" harem series.To me, there are potentional interesting scenarios in regards to the ""asshole"" original hero party. The male leader of the hero team is depicted as being almost irredeemable but the rest of party seem potentially likeably. The female members of the party seem like they are slowly coming to the realization that they made the incorrect decision to let the main character go. If I were to continue the story, it would be to see the interactions between the main character and ""heroes party"" after the main character has proved himself more. is.The main issue of the series that some people might find frustrating is that the main character is constantly being portrayed as ""Mary Sue"" character.

All of the introduced heroines seem to want nothing more than to be property. As soon as the protagonist introduces himself and solves whatever mildly inconvenient issue is bothering the girl in question - like a switch they become extremely familiar. It doesn’t stop with simple gratitude, nor does it stop with friendship or even infatuation. The girls meet the protagonist over a period of hours and want him to own them. Why everything has to be mirrored with...these fateful encounters, and why they cannot just co-exist like regular adventurer parties (as he once did with his previous party), is confusing and feels artificial.Some of the antagonist might as well be background characters with the label “menacing knight #5”. An antagonist is described and introduced by one of the heroines, and as soon as the explanation is finished it cuts to the protagonist immediately fighting with the antagonist. Within a minute the antagonist is defeated and no longer relevant; no personality, no motivation, no meaningful tie-in with any form of plot. But what we did get is another two girls, this time with indoctrinated prejudice and hatred towards humans (one of which he only met after the fight) also wanting to be the pets of a human out of absolutely nowhere.The hero's party's disdain for the main character doesn’t quite make sense. And once again their emotions are flipped like a switch for the convenience of the plot. If they made his expulsion from the group a bit less cartoonish, it would make the budding rivalry between the groups feel more natural and grounded.As a whole the social interactions feel like they are written by an alien.Animation is watchable, but the fight choreography and cinematography is jarring. Although I wasn’t expecting much, the choreography shouldn’t look like Dragon Ball Z animation created back in 1989.Everything else is as expected I suppose, not great but an easy watch… until some of its nonsense has me calling it a day; only to return when out of all forms of procrastination. these fateful encounters, and why they cannot just co-exist like regular adventurer parties (as he once did with his previous party), is confusing and feels artificial.Some of the antagonist might as well be background characters with the label “menacing knight #5”.

It's true, though it's very generic and similar to other Isekai Harem genres. Regardless of what the critics say, you can still have a good time because of it.And here's my opinion about this. Yes, I did enjoy watching this anime all the way to the end, and of course, I was anticipating what might happen because I, too, had watched a genre like this. This particular genre happened to be appealing at the time. The story and characterization were fine as they were, but what you were...anticipating was what was going to happen next in the story. anticipating was what was going to happen next in the story."", 'This is an anime that easily could\'ve been a 7/10, but due to it\'s horribly made antagonists and abysmal pacing, it makes this an obvious 5.5/10 due to it being so immensely bland that it isn\'t worth your time.Then you may say ""why did you mark this as a not recommended, instead of a mixed feelings?"", this is simple to answer.The answer is, it\'s bland and is cookie cutter levels of basic, with no real personality, but doesn\'t do anything inherently bad or good enough to be positive. As such, it just ends up to be immensely frustrating for how much potential it has...but doesn\'t do anything with it, causing this to be utter trash.- More precise reasons why this isn\'t good, and some positives down below -Reasons why this absolutely sucks:1. Way too many characters in the harem, which I mean it has 4 extra members that it really could do without. Being more specific, Kanade and Tania are good enough for this series, they have enough energy and comic relief, that this anime would be just fine with them only. When you get past these two members of the harem, it vastly decreases their screen time, and these two characters are by far the least annoying of all of the other MCs.It would be interesting if the MC ""Rein"" could combine his beast followers, so they could get a mix of the personalities and character of these beasts that he adds to his harem. I say this because it could get rid of the many characters in the harem that feel like a baseless add-ons, and makes the characters be more interesting with more unusual skills. Alas, this story doesn\'t do anything interesting like that, and just makes a lot of side MCs that follow the MC around like Pokemon to it\'s trainer.2. The episodes (especially late season) have horrid pacing. This entire season, could\'ve been put into 9 well organized episodes because most of these episodes have useless stuff that happens and takes away a lot of time that can be put towards actually improving the story and characters.3. The personalities of the MC is so generic, that you cannot even see any reason why the harem characters would even like him. He is the equivalent of a side character in any other anime, yet here he is portrayed as an MC, when he has zero personality. Not to mention, he is so unrealistically positive every moment something negative happens, that it makes him more generic and more dislikable.4. The antagonist hero\'s party is so unbelievably stupidly crafted, it\'s a wonder how they once stood on their own merits. This anime went with the most generic way of making an antagonist just unrelentingly hate the MC for having some skill, and doing so, it actively makes the anime much worse. A case with this can be the fact that we never even see the party actually get anything done, as such, how is the hero\'s party even supposed to have any notoriety, or have a semblance of helpfulness, to have these reputations. If the viewer could see a sensible reason why the MC can be disliked by the antagonists, it improves the story massively, and can show some personality for both sides.Reasons this has very good parts, and the reasons it doesn\'t help enough, plus what it misses:1. The MCs Kanade and Tania are really well done, probably the best in this anime, the problem with this is the fact that no other characters get the same level of characterization, even Rein. This ends up just make you start to feel the rush of the show pushing more characters in your face every other episode that do not have the same interesting personalities that the first two beasts had. This makes it become more frustrating as the series goes on, and there is no progression for the MC and his original two beasts that he had tamed.2. The way this anime flows should\'ve had a more ""Spice & Wolf"" esque story, where the MC just completely leaves his old party behind, and meets two beasts that he tames, then travels across the lands. This would fix 70% of the issues with this anime, like personalities, they would just get expanded on as the show progresses and the MCs would gain likability. For characters, they would be shortened down to the two main MC beasts and Rein, which would fix the issue of having far too many characters crowding up the story.3. The potential for this anime is immense. These issues I have pointed out, can easily be fixed in another season, though I doubt they would cut down the number of beasts, and get a more defined focus. However, this is not to say that most of the pacing issues and characterization issues cannot be easily fixed in another season, these wouldn\'t take much to clean up the story by far. If another season came out, I would probably have low hopes, but I would still recommend giving it a try if a future season ended up above a 7.1+ rating on MAL, then this season might be more worthwhile to watch through.All in all, this is mid. I wouldn\'t ever re-watch this, and probably wouldn\'t watch a future season unless it got good reviews and a 7.1+ rating.🗿 Kinda Mid, 5.5/10 🗿 but doesn\'t do anything with it, causing this to be utter trash.- More precise reasons why this isn\'t good, and some positives down below -Reasons why this absolutely sucks:1.

Every character, line of dialog, and story beat serves to remind you that the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. At no point will you be left conflicted over a character\'s motive - they will, instead, be spelled out for you three different ways four different times all in the same episode. The main character is selfless, while the villain(s) - the main character\'s old party of ""friends"" that cast him aside one minute...and thirty seconds into the first episode - are rude, obnoxious, and annoying. Every other character only exists to remind the viewer that the main character is the exact opposite of that despite the implication being that they were universally seen as a loser before being abandoned by their comrades.Naturally, the unshakable and enterprising main character sets out into the world and begins collecting women who love and cherish him unconditionally within the same scene they\'re introduced. This is all thanks to the incredibly contrived concept of ""beast taming"", whose name might suggest it only works on beasts, but luckily applies to a subset of attractive women with various animal-like features called ""ultimate species."" By the end of episode one, the main character has resolved nearly all of the conflict introduced thus far, making it clear the viewer will never need to worry about keeping track of complex story arcs or inter-episode character development. What little conflict does exist never survives more a few minutes, and is almost always resolved by something unexpected and underwhelming. If the hero appears to be losing a fight, you can bet his nebulous ""tame"" ability will have been secretly triggered earlier in the battle to harness the power of a conveniently-placed group of wildlife that sweeps in to save him. This, however, doesn\'t happen often because the main character and his harem happen to be composed of the most power creatures in existence who easily wipe out seasoned swordsmen and god-like mages without issue.There are no redeeming factors to consider on a technical level or otherwise. Much like the writing, the characters, world, and art are carbon copies of every other vaguely medieval world with endless green pastures and happy blue skies. The monsters are flat, the fighting is limp, and the animation for anything other than the main characters is equivalent to a keyframed PNG moving around the screen.3/10. and thirty seconds into the first episode - are rude, obnoxious, and annoying.

I seriously want to know, Is this the kind of person that Japanese men aspire to be, because if it is they are in serious trouble. Just the dialog of this show is unbearable enough, but the story is something right out of a elementary school kid's notebook.

Summarizing the plot of this show would take too much effort, when it deserves so little; basically this boring asshole named Rein gets booted from a party of annoying one-dimensional asshole adventurers who do nothing but bitch and moan about literally everything (everyone in-universe hates them too because this show lacks subtlety), since his incredibly useful and niche Beast Taming power isn’t strong enough to reach their specific standards (even though they recruited him in the first place, I’m not sure why it suddenly became a problem after what seemed to be years of companionship because the show doesn’t explain anything about any of the characters’ reasonings) and he goes from place to place using his talent to pick up chicks to add to his harem-party. They all happen to be unfathomably overpowered too, so they all team up to fight monster designs traced from a middle schooler’s How to Draw Manga book. Then they meet the boring asshole heroes again and predictably beat the fucking shit out of all of them in the least cathartic fight ever “animated”, I’m talking 5 FPS here, and after being defeated they offer Rein his position back like a bunch of NPCs and he predictably says no, because who would give up crushing monster girl pussy every day for a bunch of the writer’s high school bullies personified? They fight a demon at the end of something too. They have another Microsoft PowerPoint battle, Rein uses some dumb new power to save the day, they meet a new ghost girl, everyone still hates the asshole heroes, and nothing else happens to meaningfully change the status quo.

They’d probably lose the will to live upon seeing how far anime has degraded as an artform. I might sound a little defeatist here but it’s hard not to when the medium you’ve loved for years has become almost unrecognizable, just a corporate-controlled springboard for mediocre writers to keep regurgitating the same content for years instead of trying to hone their talents. 90% of anime looks like this now, and even then not many other forms of media are faring well either. Art used to be about constantly challenging yourself to create something only you could make; but now it seems like anyone could make half the stuff you see on tv or in theaters. It’s not hard to imagine why so many people are even more depressed and unfulfilled than ever; all their routes of escapism are slowly becoming homogenized and boring, and art only exists to tick off boxes on a checklist to appeal to the stupidest kinds of people. I fucking hate Beast Tamer, I hate that it’s getting a second season, I hate “web novels”, I hate isekai, I hate what the anime industry has become. It’s just the same goddamn thing every month. If any aspiring writer picked up a pen one day and made something genuinely special, something that doesn’t fit into any preconceived molds and fills others with inspiration, one that an AI couldn’t replicate with minimal effort, it’ll render corporate-approved swill like Beast Tamer completely worthless.

In a sense, you could call Shield Hero the prototype of this style of narrative development.Beast Tamer is not the first of its kind,...but it’s the first I’m watching, though I suppose Chillin’ in My 30s technically meets the criteria, if not explicitly. The show is just about as artificial as they come. The warm candy-colored palette, the valium-induced smiles on all the good characters’ faces, the Dick Dastardly-type evil grin on every bad guy’s face, the straight-forward, simplistic nature of the conflicts, it all makes the anime feel like a moving painting you would find in Harry Potter’s Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop.It’s a self-contained sugar bomb for the soul, nothing more, nothing less. Does it seem extraordinarily convenient and not overly coherent that all these cute cat girls are just lining up to be “tamed” by the protag for no real reason? Does it seem a bit abrupt? Does it seem stupid? That’s because it is. Don’t burden yourself with unnecessary thoughts. This isn’t that kind of anime. Why does everything work out for the MC so easily? Why is everyone so readily sucking his dick? Why do the cat girls want to be “tamed”? Because the author wants to fulfill his cat girl harem fantasy. It comes down to nothing more than that. It’s as deep as a puddle.That said, the action animation has some surprising moments of brilliance. Are we talking Spike vs. Vincent levels of amazing martial arts animation from the Cowboy Bebop movie? Not by a long shot, no, but a ways better than most of what is coming out of the medium these days. Besides, as jaded as I may want to profess myself to be, I just couldn’t help but find the characters attractive. It’s not even that the designs are the result of any virtuoso insight or clever way to weave the characters’ identity into the way they look. They were just really nice to look at. I could especially not really take my eyes off the 2nd waifu – no, it’s not because of her breasts.Meru Clewis, a writer for the Anime Feminist website (don’t get me started), makes the bold claim that the show wants you to believe that being able to communicate with animals is uncool. “But whether you were a Horse Girl, a Cat Girl, a Dog Girl, or like me in my AFAB youth, a Bat Girl, you know that this is wrong: you know, instinctively, that actually, being able to be an animorph without the PTSD and horrific animal transformations (that is, being able to relate to animals) is hella cool. It’s the dream come true: how many times have I wanted to grow my own bat wings and take to the night? How many times did I want to echolocate? Let me tell you, it’s a non-zero number for sure, and a part of me still gets a bit giddy at the thought of being able to join bats in their soaring, night flights. The child in me still loves that.” I will skip the cancer of the more uniquely feminist critique, because I don’t want to waste my time. Let us simply focus on this singular point.The confusion is simple. The show doesn’t want you to believe that communicating with animals is uncool. The show is simply aware of the fact that most people think it is uncool. Yes, I understand you think it’s “hella cool”, I get it, you wanted to be a bat in your “AFAB youth” (again, do not get me fucking started), but do I really have to explain how that is not a typical experience? I don’t think anyone is laboring under any kind of delusion that any kind significant subset of children dreams of being bats. Why was Aquaman the butt of every superhero joke for the past half a century? Because people thought being table to talk to fish was uncool. I am not suggesting it actually is uncool, nor is the show doing that. We’re merely pointing out that in the eyes of the general public, it is. The whole point of Beast Tamer is to show how that’s a mistaken prejudice and how being able to communicate with animals is in fact “hella cool”, as it were, so the criticism is pretty fucking far from fair.Ultimately, the contention of our esteemed academic hailing from the hallowed halls of Anime Feminist intelligentsia, and that of so many other critics of her ilk, is that the show is mediocre. Why? What’s so mediocre about it? Which one of the things it actually sets out to do does it handle poorly? Sure enough, does it compare favorably to Legend of the Galactic Heroes or Vagabond? No, but it would be ridiculous to judge it by those standards, because that’s not what it’s trying to be. It makes no sense to judge all media against some kind of arbitrary universal standard, because not all media has the same universal goal. You might say that Citizen Kane is better than Legally Blonde, and there’s a case to be made for that, but that does not make Legally Blonde a bad movie, because the comparison is fundamentally myopic. They are wildly different works of art that aim for wildly different things, and as far as they both achieve what they set out to do, they’re both good. Which is why I argue that judging any work of art against what it’s actually trying to be is the most logical thing to do. You might think Transformers is bad because it’s all just giant robots and explosions, but if the goal was precisely to deliver giant robots and explosions in the first place, because that’s exactly what the fans wanted, then it’s good.I would seriously posit that Beast Tamer is an unironically good show because it knows exactly what it wants to be and achieves its goal with flying colors – a cute little wholesome harem story about girls with animal ears. “Oh, but please, think of how much more the author could have done with the concept of beast taming, the protagonist could learn the view the world through an animal’s eyes, could gain animal attributes, could learn to transform into them, and all we get instead is him rizzing a cat girl.” Yes, and I’m sure that if you had written your own story about a beast tamer, you would have written it in the way you wanted, with all that interesting stuff and no cat girl rizz. Seeing as though you did in fact not write it, the author wrote it in the way he wanted, and he wanted to write about cat girl rizz. Deal with it.If you personally don’t like harem shows just by virtue of the fact that they feature harems, that’s fine, to each their own, but you can’t just write off a show as objectively bad or mediocre just because you take personal issue with the content. For instance, I am not overly fond of horror, myself, but I can still recognize a well-made horror movie or show when and if I see one, regardless of how I feel about the genre. As such, all of this talk about how Beast Tamer is insubstantial exhausts me. Fuck off. It’s got all the substance it wants to have and, indeed, needs to have.If I were to compare it to anything, I would posit that Beast Tamer looks and feels a lot like BoFuri (#155), though I’ll admit that the latter felt like it had more soul. I don’t know if that’s really due to BoFuri being of legitimately higher quality, or if it’s just a consequence of the fact that Shied Kirito was a cute girl, and (mostly) virgin loser weebs are more likely to be forgiving of a cute girl’s self-indulgence, but that’s neither here, nor there. All of this is to say that Beast Tamer is a transient experience that is pleasant for the heart and easy on the eyes – light entertainment through and through. The characters are uncomplicated and the narrative does not ask much of the viewer, while still managing to stay gratifying enough to be engaging. You could do worse in terms of media to soothe the soul at the end of a difficult day.If that tickles your fancy, go right on ahead. You’ll have a nice time. I sure did.P.S.: Here’s to another fantasy anime that isn’t an isekai. Cheers!P.S. II: Tania is my wife.

People are too pretentious when it comes to watching anime and measuring their qualities. It feels like everyone need to one up each other in snarky language and criticism.Beast Tamer is exactly what it promised to be. It\'s a light hearted straight forward story of a protagonist gathering a monster girl party and eventually (it makes sense plot wise even if we\'re not there yet) defeating the demon king. It has no ecchi moments (there is one moment that can be categorized as such, but it\'s mildly ""erotic"" and most characters are deliberately...entirely blurred below faces) and it has no romance or sexual theme whatsoever. It\'s about a party bonding with each other in a cutesy way while overcoming obstacles.The pacing is good, it doesn\'t waste time and all the stories involving those monster girls are rather fun.Jokes and the delivery are quite solid, they did manage to create some rather fun puns the way they used the art style in the show.I believe with a bigger budget and additional work put into the story, can make this into a pretty decent show in the future.It was entertaining and fun without pretending to be the next messiah in the genre and creators had fun with it.I\'ve said this before about Shield Hero and some other shows like Arifureta, some of which managed to improve like Arifureta did with some going downhill like Shield Hero was in the last season.This show can grow and I\'ll have fun with it as it does. entirely blurred below faces) and it has no romance or sexual theme whatsoever.

In my opinion, this show is basically ""Banished From The Hero\'s Party, I Decided To Live A Quiet Life In The Countryside"" (a show I dropped after 9 episodes since it was too cringe), but better. Both MCs got kicked out of the hero\'s party and does their own thing afterward. They both were actually OP/valuable, so the hero\'s party suffers for kicking/treating the MC as trash, which is well deserved. What makes it better? The plot seems more open to adventure than the other anime and it always shows glimpses of the...hero\'s party and how they deal with losing a valuable teammate.I don\'t mind OP MCs as long as the show is not trying to take itself too seriously, which the other show tried to. On the other hand, this show is just a light-hearted show about an MC who makes his own adventure, which is always fun to watch if done correctly.  And the characters have just enough of a unique design to make them not too basic (although the cat girl is pretty basic looking lol). This show also nails the nice guy MC without it being cringe or unrealistic, which so many shows fail.Overall, I don\'t recommend it to anyone who doesn\'t like generic isekais, cliches, and OP MCs.

But after about 4 episodes, it's just the girls or the head pats that will keep the audience and we all know they are the minority.Plot (4/10)It does not even try cmon, each plot arc is just a setup for rein to either encounter a new girl or to confront his past, the initial episode fights were somewhat okay, but after his fight /Conquer of Tania, he is just another OP protagonist who steamrolls through every opponent albeit with a few gimmicky battle tactics. Most of the plot tries to establish what a good boi rein is or how trash the hero party can be and are. the Girls are strong and adorable for the most part but it is the softcore fanservice that happens with them that made me go all the way through with this show. I can at least acknowledge the fact that More often than not his harem is actually USEFUL rather than damsels.Characters(5/10)Rein is a goody-two-shoes morality boi who is surprisingly meek when it comes to his own self-worth, he likes to shove his big old morality stick down under everyone who is not a girl. most relevant and dialogued characters happen to be girls (Minus the dwarf guy since in fantasy anime dwarves can only be guys!). The bad part of the knights is all male, but the good knights all happen to be busty and ripe girls, MARVELLOUS! The girls are okay IG but mostly are personality archetypes.Art and animation (6/10)Art is as good as can be expected from an anime of this kind, they put extra effort into the character design of the girls you could say but their outfits are, rather plain (minus Tania), for an anime that has the girls as its main selling point. The animation is bad, with most fights being speed lines and excessive shouting rather than eye candy.Sound and VA (5/10)Nothing out of ordinary, but nothing that stands out either, they just have enough sounds to work with that at least they don't seem overused, and the music in the ED is pretty okay too, VA does a standard job but nothing special, or noteworthy, maybe since most dialogue is pretty much just cringe or uninspiring.Not worth your time if you are looking for a high-quality experience, but if you can tolerate cringe and love fantasy escapism maybe an episode or two cannot hurt just to try it out. a loser but always gets pushed in the right direction by a bunch of lovely ladies.Like the ED says, please don't let this dream never end,Beast tamer, knows its audience and knows that they require escapism, and it does a pretty decent job at it. But after about 4 episodes, it's just the girls or the head pats that will keep the audience and we all know they are the minority.Plot (4/10)It does not even try cmon, each plot arc is just a setup for rein to either encounter a new girl or to confront his past, the initial episode fights were somewhat okay, but after his fight /Conquer of Tania, he is just another OP protagonist who steamrolls through every opponent albeit with a few gimmicky battle tactics. Most of the plot tries to establish what a good boi rein is or how trash the hero party can be and are. the Girls are strong and adorable for the most part but it is the softcore fanservice that happens with them that made me go all the way through with this show. I can at least acknowledge the fact that More often than not his harem is actually USEFUL rather than damsels.Characters(5/10)Rein is a goody-two-shoes morality boi who is surprisingly meek when it comes to his own self-worth, he likes to shove his big old morality stick down under everyone who is not a girl. most relevant and dialogued characters happen to be girls (Minus the dwarf guy since in fantasy anime dwarves can only be guys!). The bad part of the knights is all male, but the good knights all happen to be busty and ripe girls, MARVELLOUS!

The plotline sucks, the characters are generic as possible, and this show follows in the footstep of others. However, the way that the show presents itself is put forth in such a way that it becomes entertaining. The interactions between the characters are so nonsensical that it becomes a great ""popcorn show"". The whole premise of the show itself is trash which helps elevate the show past the realm of trashiness itself. While, in reality nobody is going to be putting this show on their top ten list anytime soon its still worth...a watch. a watch.', ""Here is my review of this anime in 2023!Story (10)The story is about a man which is a beast tamer who's in the hero's party but lately, He got kicked out since He's useless.

He HAS flaws, he ISN\'T perfect. And if you payed any iota of attention, the MC has a pretty good backstory. If I\'m being honest, as much as I think this is so far...a great adaptation of the manga, the manga is better as it goes into more details (Which is common).This isn\'t some OP Fantasy anime where all the main character never go through any problems or issues and breeze through everything destroying their enemies with no personal issues or problems. Far from it. It\'s not at that point yet in the anime, but I\'ll let you know right now that the whole ""Kicked out of the Hero\'s party"" thing runs deeper in this anime than it does in others. It torments Rain for almost the entire series, whether it be emotionally or the hero\'s party themselves. I don\'t know if they will get that far in the anime, as it\'s only going to be 12 episodes and the manga IS still ongoing as it just came back after a long hiatus due to the author getting Covid.But if your going to take anything away from this review, is that just give it a chance. And if you still don\'t like it after it finishes, I highly recommend you read the manga. It is better. Now I\'ll get into the nitty gritty of how I think of the anime adaptation so far.Art & Animation: 7/10The art isn\'t fantastic, it isn\'t groundbreaking. There are times where the animation can seem janky and low budget, but for the most part it holds itself together. The backgrounds and scenery are very pretty to look at, and the characters themselves look pretty great and are 1:1 from the manga as well. The visuals also remain consistent and never really ""Drop"" in quality. The visuals in the OP are also fantastic. Again it isn\'t great, but it\'s not nearly the worst I\'ve seen with anime in this category.Sound: 9/10I\'ll say it now, Madkid doing the OP For Beast Tamer was probably the best decision the could of made. That OP is a bop and I never skip it, for that and the visuals in it and it fits the theme of the anime and Rains motives perfectly. The BGM is pretty to listen to, each scene has appropriate BGM associate with them and none of it sounds bad or immersion breaking. They make use of a lot of piano and cello in the BGM\'s, which makes them really nice to listen to it. The music used while fighting/adventuring sounds very fantasy like, so it works and fits the tone of the anime. The VA\'s are also fantastic and fit each character perfectly. Especially Kanade, Waki Azumi does a fantastic job of voicing her very Cat like personality, as was the perfect choice. Each character is expressive in their voice acting and responds appropriately to match each scene.,Characters: 9/10Now hear me out, these aren\'t the BEST characters in any anime ever, but they are fantastic, fleshed out and well developed characters that each get their own respective stories/arcs. They each go through their own separate conflicts, whether that be externally or internally (or both). They each have unique and very great designs that aren\'t overly sexual like you\'d see in other Fantasy anime that revolve around harems and each of them have very different varying personalities that really balance out the cast. Supporting character are fine, they are your typical side characters like the nosy Inn lady, Guild receptionist, etc. etc. But they don\'t overstay their welcome at all, so it doesn\'t detract from the plot in any way. I hope the anime does shine light on each characters stories, but with only 12 episodes slated, it doesn\'t give me TOO much hope, that or they will rush it.Overall Preliminary Rating: 8/10So far, only 4 episodes in, it\'s a very great adaptation. Very little has been lost of cut out from the manga so far, save for some side scenes here and there that don\'t really detract from the plot. My rating is high because I know what this series actually is worth based on the manga. But this rating can/will change based on what they do with the rest of it. If this does well enough, they may give a season 2 since the manga is still ongoing. But again, if you aren\'t liking the anime, and REALLY don\'t want to give it a chance till it\'s finished.

The story writing, in my opinion, is not well thought out and shows evidence of laziness, leading to questionable mini-arcs, particularly those involving the introduction of new characters.The character concepts were poor.  Many of the characters displayed their traits to such a degree that they were absurd; this included the overpowered MC that was perfectly moral, perfectly oblivious, and perfectly BORING.

It can be said that the plot offered is still quite mainstream and it is easy to guess where it will go. It feels like this anime will be very far from originality because in terms of plot it still imitates a lot and there are already many other anime that have the same plot. But at least the anime was executed very well which made me as...a viewer really enjoy the storyline given. The main character here at least has a strong enough background to drive where this story will go. And for the side actors, it is very unfortunate because there is no background story that supports or can provide a new atmosphere in the story. But fortunately the story told by the main character is enough to carry the direction of this story. The character of the main character is not much different from the typical 'ideal' main character in that he always thinks about other people's interests above his personal interests. But at least this character has firmness and doesn't look so naive compared to other 'ideal' main characters. As for the supporting characters, if we talk about their character traits, they don't really stand out because the characters they convey feel monotonous.Talking about design, to be honest, personally I really like the appearance of the main character because the clothes he wears feel cool and the color execution also suits me personally. The other characters aren't that bad either, but there isn't much that can be criticized, at least the design given still fits the theme of the anime. As for the design of the anime setting itself, it seems like there isn't much that can be used as a point of discussion. The setting of a fantasy isekai world with the concept of quests and adventurers. What's interesting is that this anime always consistently conveys an adventure theme where their story always starts with a quest. An additional point from me personally. As for the visuals, this anime consistently provides visual quality that is slightly above average. Because in my personal opinion, the images presented are really nice to look at so watching it feels comfortable. Maybe there are several things that can be criticized, where at some moments there are scenes that feel like they lack the intention to be animated. But at least these moments don't appear too much to the point where they disturb your viewing comfort. Talking about the audio aspect, it feels like this aspect is one of the most prominent aspects of this anime. The most definite thing can be judged from the theme song sung in the opening and ending, which I personally think is very catchy and pleasant to listen to. The message conveyed by the song is still in accordance with the theme of the anime itself. The voice actors in this anime are also not that bad and play their respective roles very well. In terms of sound effects, unfortunately it doesn't have much influence on the delivery of the anime story. It's a shame considering that this aspect could actually be maximized so that viewers can enjoy the anime being presented more.In the end, this is not a really bad anime and can still be enjoyed as a distraction anime. Again, what I want to always convey is the importance of understanding the story weight of existing anime and providing a rational assessment according to the story weight of the anime concerned.

Maybe I got fed up with all the generic trash this year, maybe this garbage is just so bad I have to dedicate 15 mins of my life typing this rant, or maybe because THIS SHOW HAS A WORSE PLOT SETUP THAN REDO OF HEALER. But anyways we have another generic trash anime that have pointless plot points and unnecessarily evil people just to show how great the protagonist is. Nobody has any character development throughout the entire runtime, and the main conflict between the protagonist and the hero\'s party is so painful to watch...due to how one sided and full of plot holes it feels.Spoilers from now on but there\'s not much to spoil because there literally isn\'t anything to spoil.For a ""feelgood"" anime, the very first scene makes me feel disgusted. Sure, an evil hero trope isn\'t something new, but here comes the main plot hole of the series:""If beast tamers are universally understood as one of the worst class in this world, it should be common knowledge that the reason is other than being able to tame one or two animals MAX, they can\'t do much else. So why wouldn\'t they realize the protagonist\'s ability to tame literal dozens of animals at once is super special and overpowered?""There is NO WAY they wouldn\'t have known that fact unless every member of the hero\'s party is an amateur, they couldn\'t possibly not understand the importance of being able to scout ahead risk-free, knowing where the enemies are, being able to avoid traps or dangerous terrains, and FREE FOOD. Lack of knowledge aside, every member is just evil for the sake of being evil. There is no nuance to their personalities other than they are evil, unlikeable, greedy, and pretentious assholes. Even when the author hints at a chance where they might be just misguided decent human beings, things just revert right back the next scene of them being a bunch of unlikeable goons. It\'s as if the author doesn\'t know how to write a compelling villain, so they just resort to the ""evil just because"" trope which is overdone to death and not even good to begin with.Second, even bigger plot hole, is if the protagonist is so OP as seen throughout the episode, why the hell did he not use such powers while in the hero\'s party? And I don\'t even mean when he share the abilities of his harem, but when he displayed his ""normal"" abilities of controlling dozens of animals, insects, monsters, and even demons at will. Controlling an entire poisonous killer bee colony seems pretty OP to me, let alone being able to control monsters, demons, and ghosts. Why not just control something powerful like a bear?

As to why not just give it a ""slice of life"" treatment and rate it more generously? Because a slice of life doesn\'t make me feel like shit in the very first scene of the entire anime, and introduce either new plot holes or impossible to understand decisions the characters make in this pile of trash. Rant over. due to how one sided and full of plot holes it feels.Spoilers from now on but there\'s not much to spoil because there literally isn\'t anything to spoil.For a ""feelgood"" anime, the very first scene makes me feel disgusted. Sure, an evil hero trope isn\'t something new, but here comes the main plot hole of the series:""If beast tamers are universally understood as one of the worst class in this world, it should be common knowledge that the reason is other than being able to tame one or two animals MAX, they can\'t do much else. So why wouldn\'t they realize the protagonist\'s ability to tame literal dozens of animals at once is super special and overpowered?""There is NO WAY they wouldn\'t have known that fact unless every member of the hero\'s party is an amateur, they couldn\'t possibly not understand the importance of being able to scout ahead risk-free, knowing where the enemies are, being able to avoid traps or dangerous terrains, and FREE FOOD. Lack of knowledge aside, every member is just evil for the sake of being evil. There is no nuance to their personalities other than they are evil, unlikeable, greedy, and pretentious assholes. Even when the author hints at a chance where they might be just misguided decent human beings, things just revert right back the next scene of them being a bunch of unlikeable goons. It\'s as if the author doesn\'t know how to write a compelling villain, so they just resort to the ""evil just because"" trope which is overdone to death and not even good to begin with.Second, even bigger plot hole, is if the protagonist is so OP as seen throughout the episode, why the hell did he not use such powers while in the hero\'s party? And I don\'t even mean when he share the abilities of his harem, but when he displayed his ""normal"" abilities of controlling dozens of animals, insects, monsters, and even demons at will. Controlling an entire poisonous killer bee colony seems pretty OP to me, let alone being able to control monsters, demons, and ghosts. Why not just control something powerful like a bear? Or the enemy monsters he\'s fighting? Or anything useful other than squirrels and birds? And let\'s just ignore the fact that the protagonists only start to meet all these ""mythical furry waifus"" after leaving the hero\'s party, which is another convenient trope showing how uncreative the author is.

However, as I continued to watch Beast Tamer believing that was the anime’s name, the whole name and nothing but the name, and that it was based off a manga (thanks to MAL), it wasn’t until around episode 5 or 6 that I started to think “Hang on - this show feels a bit *gulp* light novelly.”For you see it is in fact based...on a 2018 light novel, and the full name of the series is, I shit you not, *clears throat, unravels scroll* “The Beast Tamer Who Got Kicked Out From His Party Meets a Cat Girl From the Superior Race”… Quite the light novel mouth full.I feel like if I knew the anime by it’s real title from the beginning my expectations and opinion of Beast Tamer would’ve been slightly lowered than they were going into episode one, but I’ve got to respect the marketing team at Crunchyroll or whoever gave them the green light to trim down the title for making me believe that this anime will be more than your average, disappointing *sigh* light novel wishful adaptation (the harem should off tipped me off to be fair). Just like how Crunchyroll renamed Harem in a Labyrinth of Another World conveniently leaving out “Slave” from the title, it’ll be interesting to see if this trend will continue with future adaptations of shitty light novels in order to try and entice more viewers who like me, have an overall bad impression of light novel anime.Anyway I just thought that was interesting. Now lets talk about Beast Tamer and how thoroughly average and disappointing it is.If you haven’t watched Beast Tamer here are the basics. Rein Shroud -the nicest guy ever- is kicked out of the hero’s party because his asshole teammates view him as useless and dead weight because he’s not good in combat, and all he can do is tame animals for scouting areas or situations in a matter of moments, carrying all their supplies, and even using them for their offensive abilities… wait- Anyway, after being kicked out and murdering a bunch of goblins so he can pass an exam in order to become an adventurer, he almost gets kill by a giant cat. Luckily he is saved by a smaller cat with big boobs and a mean axe kick who happens to be of a race of beings known as the UlTiMaTe SpEcIeS. After he pets her on the head and she praises him to high heaven for being such a nice guy, she then informs him that he is the only nicest guy who can tame her, thereby making him the super strongest by proxy, nicest guy in the land…When all is said and done this is just another juvenile, male power fantasy. One that is definitely not about a guy going around enslaving (of their own free will, to be fair) hot beast-women supermodels and sometimes children who do nothing but validate him all the time by telling him how great, amazing, nice, humble, and big penis-ed he is, now until the end of the season. It’s also definitely not weird how they all superficially fall in love with him shortly after becoming not enslaved to the nicest guy with confidence issues. Not in the slightest.I think I’ve explained enough about Reins personality for you to know that he’s a blank slate for the audience to project themselves upon. His beast taming magic can basically let him do whatever the plots wants him to do, and he can pull whatever stunt or new ability he decides out of ass for whatever situation. The world bends to him whim.If I were to say something positive, I actually really like Kanade and Tania (the reasons people actually watched the show). They actually have likeable personalities and character traits that made them clash yet rely on each other before they too just became background members of the praise Rein parade. Also, big titties.The first five episodes were actually pretty enjoyable too. Rein, Kanade and Tania actually have a great chemistry as a trio and they all brought something positive to there to the dynamic, making it enjoyable to watch their wholesome adventures. There was even like, good, well thought out and choreographed fights with above average animation that made them feel dynamic and impactful.Of course, this all doesn’t matter if the villains suck. The Hero’s Party is full of your typical, shit heel school bullies which makes it really satisfying to watch them get the snort beaten out of them, but apart from that they’re so outwardly, cartoonishly evil and stupid that you can’t take them seriously as a threat. The only other villain is a literal woman kidnapper, child abuser and possibly a rapist just so the show can emphasis how much of a nice guy Rein is.Also, don’t think I didn’t notice how all the uncorrupted knights not taking bribes and asking Rein for help just so coincidentally happen to be hot women, Beast Tamer. I know what you’re doing, and it’s weird to imply that men are the only ones who’ll sink low enough to take bribes.Beast Tamer or, “The Beast Tamer Who Got Kicked Out From His Party Meets a Cat Girl From the Superior Race” seems like a competent show when you first watch it, but the more you watch and the more you think about what you’re actually seeing, the more you realise that it’s just another vapid, empty, wish fulfilment, might-as-well-be-isekai, admittedly kind of wholesome, male power fantasy light novel anime with characters as bland as your grandfathers sock draw, performing in a story that even the animators gave up animating after like, episode 9.Also, Rein Shroud is a stupid name, and if I have to here his harem call “Rein, Rein, Rein, rEiN, ReIn, REIN, REIN!, REIN!!, REIN!!!” over and over again, I will go to the Crunchyroll headquarters and scream at upper management.4/10 Disappointment. on a 2018 light novel, and the full name of the series is, I shit you not, *clears throat, unravels scroll* “The Beast Tamer Who Got Kicked Out From His Party Meets a Cat Girl From the Superior Race”… Quite the light novel mouth full.I feel like if I knew the anime by it’s real title from the beginning my expectations and opinion of Beast Tamer would’ve been slightly lowered than they were going into episode one, but I’ve got to respect the marketing team at Crunchyroll or whoever gave them the green light to trim down the title for making me believe that this anime will be more than your average, disappointing *sigh* light novel wishful adaptation (the harem should off tipped me off to be fair).

However, as is common in isekai, the protagonist turns out to be the best in his field, though he remains unaware of it. On the whole, the series warrants a rating of 6/10.One of the most notable aspects is how the protagonist appears focused on helping others rather than taking the lead. While this approach might be refreshing initially, over time it can come across as somewhat passive and result in...a less engaging protagonist than what could have been.The development of female characters becomes a topic of discussion. Although they initially seemed to possess some complexity, this gradually diminished as the series progressed. The anime itself seems to toy with this idea, repeatedly introducing new divine beasts whenever a problem arises.

The animation quality overall is decent, though it notably declined during the crucial final battle, which is somewhat disappointing.One regret is the lack of further exploration into the fairy world, despite the intriguing guardians presented.

Los compañeros del héroe también presentan un tono ridículo que puede resultar más molesto que cómico.En genral es para pasar el rato.', 'i dont understand why everyone give this anime such a bad rating, they probably gaved redo of healer a 10, this anime is so good. people have the taste of a busyness man these days, its a bit like re:zero in some way, the main character get rejected by everyone but find out he has a unique trait and makes trong friends around the way. i would give it a 10 but i would have like him to make more friends and became even stronger, if theres a season 2 ill give the first season a 10 cause i would understand hes power because they...wanted him to be stronger in the season 2. wanted him to be stronger in the season 2.', 'Literally this anime is an OP Main Character with a Non-Human Harem.

However, it falls short of exceeding or outdoing those works. The saving grace is that it still manages to be a decent show by utilizing already proven ideas. My review is mixed because the anime production could have focused more on improving character design and other aspects.The animation is not groundbreaking, but it is decent enough and not a distraction. It gives the impression of being low budget or having an inexperienced FX team, as the magic circles look mediocre compared to those in other anime. The...main character, Rein Shroud, looks like a taller version of Bell Cranel or Falma de Medici.Regarding the harem of girls, in my opinion, there is a good variety, which is a positive aspect. The red-haired dragon girl is a tsundere similar to Eris Greyrat, so it deserves some credit. If we compare it to other anime with better quality, you may skip this one.

As the credits roll on the 13th episode I found myself surprised after letting out a good sigh and finally relieving the unnoticed stiff shoulders and lousy position I had while watching the show. It is quite peculiar though as I consider myself one of the most avid enjoyers of the ""MC-Gets-Cheat-Sheet-To-Becoming-Strongest"" story formulas and I admit to the instances where we find ourselves \'self-inserting\' in some cases whenever a certain ""scene"" goes the way it was supposed to be - or better, in this case.But why? Why is it that somehow with the...passable visuals, arguably-good choice of voice actors/actresses, actually nice music and somewhat a plausible and workable storyline, is it that I am profoundly unimpressed yet satisfied with this mediocre ""Overpowered MC + Harem"" show?Shall we try to break it down?Story: 5/10The story in itself isn\'t entirely terrible, it is a new attempt - for one of which deserves an applause - unto once again the ""Hero, the party, the allies, the plot twist, and of course -- The Demon Lord"" While it is a new attempt on what is already considered to be a overjuiced genre deconstruction trope it still is a new approach towards what is considered good, bad, just and evil. On how can someone who was supposed to be pursuing the path of righetousness, nobility and justice become someone that becomes the very antonym of his very own trademarked insignia.As far as the premise of the story goes it actually hit the nail, but as to how it delivered it in general? Yeah, I know. It sucked. The only thing that worked for me in here is how the story was slowly portraying on how much the Hero\'s party actually despises their ex-scout and recon member - that of which whom they kicked, please remember that as it will be showed a lot in this show - and it just conveniently grows throughout the series.In summary, the story\'s premise looked nice and that\'s why it\'s still a passable thing for me but it is the only thing that is holding that score of 5 alone. The rest of the show was never carried by anything else, everything was convenient incluiding the evergrowing rage that the hero has for his former teammate. If we were to notice the story\'s progression by itself though you\'d see that we were all just going in a wide straight line that was supposed to be ""cool and exciting"" as it gave us another trope where with the convenient casting of characters, majority of them would be women-- and in that case, let\'s make them become ""r*p*able and ab*s*ble! if ever the MC messes up!Seriously, if the show just stuck to the part where there is tension between the two of them but no convenient character development twists then I think it\'d actually be passable on its own.Character: 3/10There is no actual backstory to any character and everyone involved in that show is if anything else, they were simply just plot conveniences;  personified and animated. Look at it this way dear reader, asides from the kidnapping of Luna what else did they possibly have that was supposed to move the hearts of the viewers and see them more asides from the generic flat-loli-cutie-patooties with personalities that conviently match their name, do you recall of one? Their convenience to the story only shows up later in the show where it is revealed that they possess the power to multiply one\'s incantation abilities -- mind you, as if our MC Reid wasn\'t doing that already! Reid already showcased this prowess by taming more than 1 beast whenever he needs it! But sure, for the sake of plot convenience let\'s let that one slide. But asides from that even Reid has trouble knowing the worth of the two fairies he formed a contract with. And Tania being the Deus Ex Machina of tropes that is the convenient ""onee-tsun-kuu-dere"" being the strong type that also wants to be pampered but also wants to be strong but also wants to be proud but also wants to be inlove -- I mean seriously man how many cliches do you want to write into this thing?The design is cute though this rating belongs to the art segment of this review. As for the actual characters in itself there is barely anything, but it is to be understood since this after all wasn\'t really a show that was meant to be deep nor intriguing; if anything I\'m starting to believe that after the string of coincidences that arise from each character, this might simply be another way to profit some extra income by appealing to the things that can trigger every enjoyer and whatnot.Art: 6/10The art is as best as it gets in this show. I like the repetitive designs of the characters and their colours. I am particualarly biased about Reid and the Twins\' designs and colors as they make me feel like I should\'ve designed them all myself. The show also utilized a bunch of different chibi and expression cards that they made for the characters but didn\'t go Jojo on them. Kind of like Blend S in that case?The simple design of the characters and how it portrays a burning city, a a burnt city and a post-war city. everything else was just a good ""eh"" at best but those ones latter really did well to complement a story telling, It fit the event that was happening and it didn\'t do much to complicate the scenes shown.Overall: 5Like how my scores are for this show it is without a doubt, conveniently balanced.Kidding aside, it is not a show I\'d like to recommend to people though personally would recommend to those that are looking for a show to simply pass the time.

In this anime, the eponymous “Beast Tamer”, gets kicked out of the hero’s party for being the weakest link, since he doesn’t contribute much in combat. He just does ALL of the legwork, scouting, packing, hauling, etc. He’s basically their scout/errand boy, but they kick him to the curb because he’s “holding them back”. He gets his revenge...by building himself a harem of monster girls chosen from the ultimate-species: cat-girl, dragonoid, a couple fairies, and a fox (not a spoiler because they’re all in the credits). I suppose taming monster girls is at least a step forward from buying up slave girls, but still, premise-wise, having the protagonist literally owning his fellow adventuring nakama is kinda weird. Even if they all join of their own volition, because they come to respect and love him, it’s still a strange basis for an isekai.I had a couple big problems with this series. That’s why I rate it 4/10. The ‘beast tamer’ owning his party of monster girls isn’t really one of them, I just think it’s weird.The series was really, really forgettable. I finished watching it yesterday and held off writing the review for it until now, but at time of writing this I don’t think I can remember the names of any of the characters… Also, the use of “The Hero is an A-Hole” trope in here gets beaten to death to the point I’m left wondering how anyone would ever think this guy and his companions are the ‘chosen ones’. It would have been one thing if they’d just gone away right at the beginning so we can move, but the fact that they come back, over and over, continuing in their comically rotten ways was borderline Team Rocket level (except without even a shred of lovability).The anime felt unoriginal, which isn’t really an original thing to say about it I’d imagine, so I’ll just end this review here. by building himself a harem of monster girls chosen from the ultimate-species: cat-girl, dragonoid, a couple fairies, and a fox (not a spoiler because they’re all in the credits).

The animation isn\'t anything to write home about, and monster designs are rather lame, but all in all, decently enjoyable.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 6/10------------------------------------------Voice acting is solid. Everything else felt forgettable.Story - 4/10-------------They\'re not even trying any more...The story revolves around a teenager with a tragic backstory, who gets booted out of a Hero\'s party for being worthless. Even though he had an incredibly obvious superpower, that apparently neither he nor anyone else noticed.Then we get a dozen coincidences in a row which aware him to his own powers. And he becomes progressively more overpowered by finding more and more female ""ultimate species"" he then ""tames"", resulting in obtaining their powers and inserting them into his harem. Which those girls are all too happy to say yes to. Because apparently what every ultimate being wants, is to be a servant to some random dude from a backwater town.There\'s no grand story. The hero is supposed to fight the Demon King and what have you, as usual, but we get none of that, just a side story about how this one dude is actually 10x the hero for no reason.Characters - 5/10---------------------The most comically evil villains, the most comically good natured protagonist and his allies. It\'s a world with no gray in it. Everything is black or white. Villain is evil for no reason other than to be evil and nothing will change their mind. The good guy is good to the absolute core for no reason and would rather die a horrible death than even think of not helping someone else.And the women...I\'m sorry, but there\'s only so much blatant male fantasy I can tolerate in an anime. The protagonist is a complete airhead, who apparently is the greatest Beast Timer in the history of the universe, yet doesn\'t even know it himself. He seems to have just the right skill and experience for every single situation. It\'s as if the story was written first, and then the MC inserted and any powers or coincidences he needed to win, are given as needed.The secondary characters are no better. 5 girls. All ""ultimate species"". All supposed to be rarer than god, and powerful beyond measure. Impossible to tame or do anything with. But our MC magically runs into every single one of them, tames them all instantly, and all the girls are like: ""hell yeah, this random teenager I\'ve known for 5 minutes is the person I\'m going to swear infinite loyalty to for all time.""Like god damn. They didn\'t even try...---Total - 6/10---The only good thing about this whole show is that it\'s incapable of doing anything noteworthy, so it\'s actually possible to turn off your brain and comfortably drool on yourself as the images run past your eyes. expressions, magic effects are fairly pretty.

As an Anime, a solid 5 or 6 out of 10. My personal rating how ever 8 maybe even 9. Because this show knows exactly what it is and will happily flaunt it. The main character is stupidly overpowered, everything that happens is incredibly convenient for them. But it does all of it so unapologetically that it's just stupid fun. Minor Spoiler: There's a point...later where a character is immune to Instant Death, they explain this by arguing that the character is immune to STATUS effects and that Instant Death is a STATUS where regular death is a STATE OF BEING. It's the dumbest yet greatest writing I've ever seen and I'm begging for a season 2. Most of the show is like this and I just have the biggest grin on my face while it's happening. Highly recommended. It's like a mockery of modern fantasy anime and it's fully aware of that, but not in a tongue in cheek way, they just don't care, and I love it. later where a character is immune to Instant Death, they explain this by arguing that the character is immune to STATUS effects and that Instant Death is a STATUS where regular death is a STATE OF BEING.

A nice, wholesome fantasy watch. 9/10]After having completed it and coming back to see how there are more \'not recommended\' than \'recommended\', I definitely feel compelled to recommend it to future watchers!Beast Tamer has a unique and fresh storyline and worldbuilding although its world is not explored, explained, nor elaborated much. Nevertheless, it\'s definitely up there as one of the best OP MC-kind of fantasy anime cliche. Sure, it still very much follows the template of OP MC animes, but the back story, the struggle, the social...trauma, the different backgrounds and personalities of each characters - they\'re all quite fresh and enjoyable, not boring in the slightest.Even though he has a harem, there\'s almost no oversexualization in sight (except this one scene that I\'m sure was put in as a casual fan service, yet since it\'s only one scene, I consider it not \'over\') which is what I much prefer and am comfortable with than those who are clearly sexualizing the characters. Yes, even though the anime is about taming cute, pretty, and even \'sexy\' female ""beasts"", it\'s NOT focused on SEXUALizations AT ALL! So do not get the wrong assumptions before even watching the anime!One of the best feature of Beast Tamer\'s writing is the PACING! The pacing is one of the best out of all OP MC trope that I\'ve watched - it\'s just right! We get to really feel like we\'re journeying alongside the MC. It might be a bit faster in the end, but it\'s understandable since.. it\'s nearing the end and they have to close the anime, but it\'s not that obvious nor that big of a problem. Simply wonderful, enjoyable pacing.However, like I said before, perhaps it\'s because the worldbuilding lacks adequate elaborations, I feel like we could\'ve been much more mesmerized by the world than what it currently provides. Because of that, I think the plot is great, enjoyable, and definitely marathon-able, but not in anyway out of the world special or anything.Decent, adequate quality with cool action scenes and visually appealing yet unique characters.

Quite well done, but nothing too special or notable.All in all, a 9/10 for me as a nice, wholesome fantasy watch.~', 'A pretty laid back, light comedy fantasy adventure anime.The certified nice guy MC, Rein, is an adventurer of the ""Beast Tamer"" class, with the abilities to insta-tame beasts temporarily, or bind them to him permanently. However, since his skills don’t work on monsters, and due to an unfortunate lack of grizzly bears in the local forest, his DPS were too low, and he was kicked off his team. \tHe then finds himself wandering the local woods, slaying some goblins who broke a fence, and stumbles into an ultra-super-rare catgirl, whom he promptly enslav- i mean, ""tame"".If you have ever played Pokémon then Reins next step...might be obvious; To travel the world and collect all the rarest Pokémon so he can get his gym badge. But instead of catching Pokémon, he will magically enslave an ever-growing harem of rare monstergirls while wandering the local woods and instead of doing it for a gym badge, he will just do it for no real reason.Most of the plot and dialogue can be described as ""light"". It’s just interesting enough to not be filler. The characters often act or think nonsensical, the pacing is strange too. Often, characters make comments that makes you wonder if you missed an episode and some of the internal monologues had me wondering what the hell they were talking about, or how they got to that conclusion. It often feels like a scene or two have been removed.Rein doesn’t really have any motivation, after being kicked from his party he reacts with a ""Oh, wow. I am sad. Oh well, I guess I’m going to become a freelance adventurer, or something."". Then we follow Rein and gang around while they are doing some VERY laidback ""adventuring"". As in, mostly collecting herbs from the forest, eating, small talking. And sometimes stumbles across something that needs a beating.MC doesn’t really have any goals, and apart from stumbling over random events, there isn’t really anything happening. There isn\'t much in terms of character development either.The setup reminds me a bit of Rising of the Shield Hero. Enslaved fluffy-eared girl. Party kicking MC, no real offensive abilities. But instead of a grand betrayal, it’s just the party telling MC that his DPS is thrash and that he is trash too.One of the things i liked the most about Shield Hero was the lack of offensive abilities, paired with the shields ability to transform to different designs, each having different functions. The Beast Tamer class has the same gimmick. No real offensive capabilities and the ability to tame different animals depending on the challenges ahead. Using smarts to compensate for the lack of raw power.The promising setup is ruined by the end of episode 1, as it is revealed that Rein is yet another (relatively) overpowered MC. Apart from his ""Taming Power"" being so absurdly high that he can casually enslave humanoids, as long as they have a tail and fuzzy ear, its revealed that he can mass-tame animals and give them complex orders. This immediately begs the question; Why didn’t he just rush every enemy with a bunch of forest critters? Well, that’s because he is retarded.But that’s okay, we can still get a nice ""Weak"" MC like the Shield Hero who has to rely on his allies for damage, right? Nope. About 5 minutes into Ep 2, the last hopes were dashed, as he apparently gets superhumanly stronger for each monstergirl he tames. The otherwise exciting setting is thereby reduced to an excuse for the author to surround our average-OP-niceguy fantasy protagonist with a harem of fawning Kemonomimi monstergirl slaves.Our MC Rein is a typical clueless niceguy. The most atypical thing about him is his lack of knowledge about things that a beast tamer should know, as well as how carefree he is. Nothing really sticks to him, and he spends most of his time drifting aimlessly from one task to another, like a paper bag in the wind.Apart from MC, there is the girls. First of which is Kanade the catgirl, a cutesey airhead with a jealous streak. Apart from acting clowning around and reacting with shock every time MC does something impressive, she also part-times as a walking encyclopedia. Every time MC, the beast tamer, needs something explained, be it information on beasts or specifics about how one of beast tamers only abilities; ""permanent bindings"" work, Kanade the catgirl apparently knows it.Catgirls are both ultra powerful and close to extinction. My headcanon being that they are a bunch of airheads. Sometimes they get bored, wander into the woods, forget how to forage for food, almost starve to death, and then asks the first beast tamer they stumble upon to enslaved them.VISUALS:There is the occasional moments of pretty visuals, but it mostly range from all right to simple and uninspired.The cast looks good, but the contrast between main characters and bystanders can be pretty jarring at times. The animals look pretty nice as well, to be honest. But the backgrounds are beyond weak, and most of the time missing. When the characters are talking, it often replaces the background. Maybe it’s a cutesey pastel colored background with crayon-style figures, sometimes its eye-scorching white. It makes the already weak dialogue even more stiff and unnaturalFight scenes especially boring, ever since MCs shitty knife broke in EP 1, he has resorted to straight up punching enemies and having gained super strength, its surprisingly effective. Kanade has twice as many moves, as she varies between punching stuff and doing jump kicks. Overall, the fight scenes are lacking in terms of both visuals and coordination.AUDIO:The voicework is fine. The music is okay, its appropriate and not in the way.\tThe effects are bad and OP and ED are boring. Same with their visuals.TLDR:All in all, a pretty boring anime with a lot of lackluster visuals. if you are looking for a lighthearted wholesome-ish fantasy comedy to watch at 2 AM, then this might be for you. I suppose it could be worse.3/10 might be obvious; To travel the world and collect all the rarest Pokémon so he can get his gym badge.

I suppose it could be worse.3/10', 'Banished From the Hero\'s Party? Oh please, I\'d rather choose to watch the show featuring Red and Rit. But otherwise, let\'s face it: this show is only pure waifu bait, because it\'s just an unintended harem being intentionally layered as a action fantasy show of sorts.Just like with the whole Isekai Otome Game fantasy shtick, the idea of getting booted out from the Hero\'s Party and making a new life out of it feels just as fresh as when the sub-genre started, such as the case with last Fall\'s Shin no Nakama, which was one of the best adapted LNs of last year, and a...show that I really enjoyed the heck out of it. But where there\'re a handful of good ones, lay some bad eggs, and in the proceeding Fall that is this season, we get novelist Suzu Miyama\'s Yuusha Party wo Tsuihou sareta Beast Tamer, Saikyoushu no Nekomimi Shoujo to Deau, or as it\'s simply known: Beast Tamer, because why the hell would long-winded names be translated into a clusterfish of sorts. This is almost single-handedly the biggest improvement of the source material overall.As previously mentioned, not everything is a life worth a bed of roses for some characters, and in this show, it\'s the beast tamer Rein Shroud that gets booted from his ""so evil it\'s cliche"" Hero Party because his skillset is not strong enough to support the party, full of a wad of selfish and/or loyal followers that only do what they\'re summoned here for: to defeat the Demon Lord, that\'s who. Everything else works out the exact same way that Shin no Nakama did, only except that Rein finds new life in acquiring girls like they\'re gacha material. And these girls are no slouch either: they\'re ultimate species, the best and strongest of their kind, and are often a rare sight in the fantasy world to begin with. It just so happens that Rein coincidentally managed to find one such race, in the form of Kanade of the cat race, and after saving her from the oh-so-typical ""maiden in distress"" cliche, Rein finds out that Kanade is an ultimate species, wandering alone in the woods, and as the approach goes, Rein can only try his beast taming skills on her, only to succeed, and the companionship starts with more girls found along the way for a new-found better way of life.There\'s just something about stories like these that provide a good hook, but you can only meander around this route so much that it becomes stereotypical genericness over time. And as to be expected, Beast Tamer follows the formula to a T, that it\'s hard to expect anything new from the growing story and plot, except more evil in the form of the Hero Arios adjusting his targets from the Demon Lord to Rein for his confounding wad of jealousy to even think that Rein could be stronger than him after leaving the Hero\'s Party as Rein sub-consciously develops a harem around him with more ultimate species in the form of girls, because that\'s just how LN authors needn\'t think so much that it hinders creativity while their sales reap the progress. And that to me, spells a disaster that the anime industry just would not get over with on differences between Japan and the rest of the world.Back to Rein, it\'s the adage of ""good guy gets girls because you can sub-consciously create a harem"", and in his case, he has a new party in the form of 5 girls: Kanade the Cat, Tania the Dragonoid, sisters Sora and Runa the fairies, and last but not least, Nina the Fox demigod. Each one of them has powers that are unique to each of the species they come from, and Rein\'s beast taming skills hide one interesting tactic that would prove him useful in battles: the ability to use close-to-replica powers from the girls that he makes a contract with, thereby powering him up from his usual ability of being able to tame multiple monsters at once, as opposed to the stereotypical single monster that an ordinary beast tamer can only deal with. It shouldn\'t be a surprise that like cats, Rein is a natural good and kind-hearted guy, and the girls all fawn over him, so much enough to realize that as time passes by, his saving grace in the form of other girls is to be expected, and not calling it a harem is a way that he would\'ve objected seeing them as such, apart from growing to be more OP with each and every beast taming contract. It\'s just absurd when LN authors try to think of a way to possibly stand out from doing something different in regard to the genericness, only to shove it in your face that it\'s the same goddamn formula, just layered at the expectation that this would feel different, when it\'s not, and literally isn\'t improved upon to leave it as such.Given studio EMT Squared\'s in-house director Atsushi Nigorikawa\'s standards overall, most of his directed shows have been a miss: Ren\'ai Boukun a.k.a Love Tyrant, Boku no Tonari ni Ankoku Hakaishin ga Imasu. a.k.a A Destructive God Sits Next to Me (this is an unexpected surprise hit), and now Beast Tamer, which references to the tick-tock formula of having a bad, good, then bad for shows under his belt. Though in this case, he did a decent job on adapting the LN source material, which I almost got a stroke as to why the manga version of the LN went at a breakneck speed. Regardless, a show is only as good as the indentments done to add from the source material, and this by all accounts, was a decent showing. Everything is (and was), to be expected when low-budget studios can only muster the best they have to give the shows they are chosen to adapt at acceptable levels, and this was certainly the case for Beast Tamer here.The OST...really was a hit-and-miss affair. For the boyband group MADKID, the Tate no Yuusha a.k.a Shield Hero series have always been their best caliber, and it hurts me to say that I\'m not really a fan of their OP song here. It sounds so out of place for a show like this, and it\'s so mind-numbingly boring that it\'s an easy skip. Marika Kouno\'s ED fares somewhat better, though it\'s only good for a few listens and nothing more than this. What a shame that was so generic, but I guess that\'s only so much you can do about lots of generic stuff that are plentiful all around.It\'s anemic to say that the entire show may have been doomed from the start, because all of this premise and characters feels like a cakewalk into what is your typical average cliché of a story plot, and from then on, it has absolutely no chance of recovery at any form of creativity nor interest to keep its audience hooked, me included. I\'d guess that this exists in some form of bad dream, and Beast Tamer for one, is one lucid dream of a harem\'s worth of anthropomorphic girls that can be likable, but that\'s all that it has going for. What a fall from grace. show that I really enjoyed the heck out of it.

It sounds so out of place for a show like this, and it\'s so mind-numbingly boring that it\'s an easy skip. Marika Kouno\'s ED fares somewhat better, though it\'s only good for a few listens and nothing more than this. What a shame that was so generic, but I guess that\'s only so much you can do about lots of generic stuff that are plentiful all around.It\'s anemic to say that the entire show may have been doomed from the start, because all of this premise and characters feels like a cakewalk into what is your typical average cliché of a story plot, and from then on, it has absolutely no chance of recovery at any form of creativity nor interest to keep its audience hooked, me included. I\'d guess that this exists in some form of bad dream, and Beast Tamer for one, is one lucid dream of a harem\'s worth of anthropomorphic girls that can be likable, but that\'s all that it has going for. What a fall from grace.']"

Even some characters have similarities in appearance too but this anime's whole plot stands on average student Bon and Ream's(Girl from future)journey to several historical events through time travel.While watching it one thing is very noticeable that it doesn't hesitate to show blood(*one scene) for sake of relevance of the story so that normal audiences like us can take it seriously. Their overall journey was pretty smooth, btw historical places are not limited to Japan so you might find some places and events...pretty familiar.Worth or not: it's not a must watch anime, still it's pretty fun to watch. Personally speaking mc is good at his job and has quick character development, Ream is cute, storyline is good, animation is Doraemon's movie level so there's no reason for avoiding it. pretty familiar.Worth or not: it's not a must watch anime, still it's pretty fun to watch.

It's not because I hate this anime, but because there's nothing I like here. Hear me out. There's nothing really going in this anime. And that frustrates me because of how locked the perspective and the whole premise of this show is. Something like this can easily be fit within a 12 minutes cour season. Not a full 24 minutes cour season.To put it simply, this anime is just a huge waste of time.There's really no point in this anime existing. What's the point...here? There's no conflict, no plot moving forward, nor any important plot threads that puts together a coherent story. Nothing.It's just a boring story about a boring protagonist and her boring life.Slow life, more like painfully tedious life. Again, I've said this before in some of my reviews, but stories need to have a reason to exist, otherwise what's the point of it existing? Sure, you can make unique stories with that mindset, but who cares if it doesn't follow the basic story-telling.There's a reason why cliche stories still works to this day, because of how they twist the formula, but still keeping it the same.But this anime is a SOL, so if I say it to this anime, won't it apply to all SOL anime as well?Well, no actually. Some of SOL anime yes, but most of them have a reason to exist.Whether they actually tell a story with moral lessons with the disguise of being SOL anime (Mushishi, etch.), or SOL anime that is romance-based. Of course, these two are two of the some examples, and even then, the anime would still suck if it isn't executed well.Well, moving on. The characters. Oh boy, oh boy. I really don't like how one-dimensional the characters are. They are basically just a set of archetypes, so it's not really that interesting to watch them. Honestly, even my dumb dogs have more personality than all of these cardboard characters. There's basically no personality in the cast nor the side characters because they all basically agree to one another with few exceptions.The animation is decent. It's just real cutesy and moe sh*t. The animation is really decent at best, so I don't have anything to say about it.The music is also decent. I find the ost to be super lacking, but the ed is surprisingly decent. The opening though, I can't put my fingers to it, but I don't like it. It's not my cup of tea.Overall, just a bad anime without any purpose to exist.(3.2/10) here?

They are more often than not, one of the first creatures one will encounter in video games of fantasy worlds, bar none. As such, they are easily defeated. It’s only when one faces more than a blob of slime that they can get to be a problem, because they attack in groups or in tandem with other types of monsters. In essence, simes find great power in numbers. So why does one kill them if they are too stupid to mean any real ill will? They’re not just holders of experience and loot. Some kill them because they reproduce...extremely quickly. They are capable of asexual reproduction once every few minutes, and it is often used as a means of self defense (as can be seen in Secret of Mana). Otherwise, they just kind of go and do it as they please. A single slime can create hundreds of clones a day, and those clones can create further clones, and so on, and so forth.There are mandates in most fantasy worlds to kill slimes on sight, as to help keep their populations down. It is also ill-advised to keep one as a pet, regardless of how insanely cute they may be. Without the right training, a pet slime can grow to be a big problem very quickly. There is no known way to “neuter” them; they just keep reproducing willy-nilly until they are killed. But if slimes are good, these prove that they can be noble, hardworking creatures if they absolutely have to.In the meanwhile, one will keep coming across their brethren on the battlefield and slicing open their gooey centers for gold and EXP (mostly that). But from this point forward, one can do so knowing everything about the little creature he/she is slaying. Know that he/she must kill them to further their adventuring career and to help the environment! It is cruel, but it is the way of virtual nature.Now take a look at Slime 300. Yet another Syosetu work, which means that it\'s no doubt an Isekai. But to see someone who has consciously died in real life, only to get resurrected in another world just to kill slimes for 300 years as means of protection for her village brethren, that\'s some insane ""God""-like feature that one can only dream of grinding the monotonous way just to be OP. And all that hinges on 27-year-old Azusa Aizawa, overworked with stress to the point of humanly death, to get rebirthed and killing slimes as an immortal, and dubbed the ""Witch of the Highlands"" due to her expertise on medicinal knowledge. Talk about OP in the most generic and literal sense, though I\'d believe that only a handful of gamers actually did MAX their levels this way. You\'re a genius if you could just bear grinding and levelling up with just slimes alone. I tip off my Fedora hats to you.The basis of Slime 300 is just what it is: a fantasy, comedic, slice-of-life CGDCT. What, you only realize now that the entire character cast consists of only females? Man, you\'re slow on the uptake. That said though, Azusa ""the Witch of the Highlands"" Aizawa has had quite the objective to just grind slimes for 300 years for boredom\'s sake until level MAX, so much so that as low-key as Azusa wished she\'d live the stress-free life, people come knocking on the insanely powerful girl\'s doorsteps instead. From challenging her as a sorta ""Final Boss"" treatment to recruitment because she is a great asset to the group, Azusa is constantly bombarded from mere humans, to even monsters and creatures. Atta girl.One by one, Azusa\'s ""family"" gets bigger after the numerous amount of attempts to sink or reel her in, and her adoptions are as follows. Minor spoilers be warned, but honestly it\'s no biggie:- Firstly, the shape-shifting red dragon Laika. Like many challengers who\'ve come and failed at the same time, Laika is no different in this department. Getting thumped and whomped by the Witch of the Highlands is embarrassing enough, even for a dragon species, and if that\'s not enough, she carelessly destroys Azusa\'s house in the process. Seeing as though that\'s her fault in her first place, Laika makes amends to help repair her house, and at the same time, requests to be the Witch\'s apprentice/pupil. Family no. 1 adopted.- Secondly, the slime spirit girls: the turquoise Falfa and lime-green Shalsha. Having had their brethren killed for 300 years without a cinch, the 2 slime spirit girls are noticeably sad, and one of them hatches a plan to get revenge on Azusa, which again, like Laika before her apprenticeship, fails to do so. The acknowledgement that other brethren slimes that doesn\'t originate from them are allowable to be exterminated, and Azusa adopts the slime daughters, which Falfa appropriately called Azusa their ""mother"". Family No. 2 and 3 adopted.- Thirdly, the nonsensical elf apothecary Halkara. She is easily the funniest character of the family due to her abrupt mood swings, aside from having a busty build of a body. In the real world, think of those insurance agents who go out of their way to chase people into purchasing their products, and Halkara is the exact same: marketing her products to people around her and not giving two Fs about it...until she manages to piss off someone (that we\'ll comeback to soon) and seeking for protection when threatened. The mushroom-knowing but scatterbrained and accident-prone elf you are, all the blame\'s on you Halkara. Her purpose to stick around in the family is so until her business can get moving again. Family No. 4 adopted.- Fourth, the demon girl Beezlebub. Having been naively bought into Halkara\'s nonsene of a product, the side-effects caught onto her, and as such for compensation, she seeks revenge against this scatterbrain of a character, to which under someone\'s protection, deems that she is a potential enemy. As expected, it does not take too long for the misunderstanding to get fleshed out, and with the constant challenges that racked up more losses overtime, Beezlebub is stuck into following Azusa\'s growing family as well...and still purchasing Halkara\'s product, because that\'s a thing. Family No. 5 adopted.- Fifth, the blue dragon Flatorte. Even within the dragons themselves, different beings will have different temperaments, and that\'s definitely the case with both her and Laika. Going out of hand to gate-crash a wedding between red dragons, this feud is unstoppable, until both Azusa and Beezlebub had to intervene by attacking Flatorte\'s brethren blue dragons and eventually making peace within both red and blue dragons, much to the chagrin of the latter, which stems from her discipline problems (that slowly overtime gets better). Family No. 6 adopted.- Last but not least: Sixth, the ghost girl Rosalie. Initially, she was hampering Halkara\'s business, so much so that it scared workers off, and so Azusa and her indirect family has to solve this issue directly on-site. It was tough NGL, to get the restless ghost out of her comfort zone and relocate her to Azusa\'s house, which, you\'ve guessed it: Rosalie eventually becomes part of the family, completing the family relations as adoption No. 7.Phew...this is a lot to take in for a growing budding family of 8 girls, but we\'re not done yet.Under Beezlebub\'s command are 2 girls: Fatla and Vania, both are Leviathan women, and the former is the older sister-cum-secretary. Despite very much looking like whales that stem from the myth that they are water creatures, they are in fact air dwellers, employed for living transportation with a resort on their backs. This is common in the Demon Realm that serves Beezlebub and privileged guests to their designated places, and both sisters have to work in tandem with one resting and one working as transport. Rounding this up with the Demon King: a loli Pecora, whom is like PriConne\'s Illya in every way with the natural kid-cum-mature adult transformation. The small, petite girl that can be interacted with informally and cheerfully, she can be a viable threat when she goes all-in. The other females (the shy immortal ""Witch of the Cave"" Eno, music singer almiraj ministrel Kuku) that pop by once in a while in the show aren\'t limited to Azusa and her extended adopted family, but are like stopgaps in the slice-of-life, comedic fantasy of a journey that just keeps the ball rolling forward into enjoyable episodic adventures. Seriously though, this is a definite CGDCT trait through and through.If anything, this resembles a kids type of show in every way with the light-coloured pastels of visuals, and damn, does Revoroot do such a good job replicating the source material with its kiddy-like themes. Animation might not be much, but who cares when the visuals are so brightly coloured that it looks dazzling to the eye. Even that trait trickles down to the light-hearted OST with Aoi Yuuki and Azumi Waki\'s happy-go-lucky OP/ED songs, and need I say much that Aoi Yuuki has had quite the recent MC explosion of a reputation from ""So I\'m a Spider, So What?"" lead MC spider Kumoko to this show, being yet another lead MC witch Azusa Aizawa. You can\'t deny that you can instantly recognize Aoi Yuuki\'s voice now.While this may be a generic fantasy Isekai through and through, it\'s kiddy themes are the anime\'s strongest suit. Pair that with the diverse cast of female characters with different personalities, and you have the makings of a relaxing chill of a lovely Isekai to watch. So why not come in, breathe in and breathe out a sigh of relief, and just gander at a show that doesn\'t require too much from your brain?

I've been reading the manga for many months now, and it's near and dear to my heart. So to see it have an anime, and for it to look and sound like this. Of course I'm super happy with it all. If you love the series, please do check the manga when it's finished airing. It's good fun.Isekais are everywhere. Every season, there will always be one, two, three, or even more. Some of them good, some of them bad. This...for sure is one of the more good ones. But good for reasons you may not expect. Isekais are quite common in terms of how their plots go and develop, but this one is far different in many aspects. There is no long term goal, there is no big baddy to defeat in order to return home, there is no special purpose. It's just light hearted and relaxing fun, to the point I would say that this is the most relaxing Isekai that I've ever seen.Story and charactersThe story is pretty simple.

It's chill, it's lovely, it's borderline fantasy fun. Watch it and love it now! for sure is one of the more good ones. But good for reasons you may not expect. Isekais are quite common in terms of how their plots go and develop, but this one is far different in many aspects. There is no long term goal, there is no big baddy to defeat in order to return home, there is no special purpose. It's just light hearted and relaxing fun, to the point I would say that this is the most relaxing Isekai that I've ever seen.Story and charactersThe story is pretty simple.

The first episode is a snore, as it explains her being isekai'd and sets things up for the show to actually begin. The ONLY way her being reincarnated in this world factors in is as a motivation for her wanting to live an easy laid back life.So, while this is technically an isekai, I wouldn't consider it one. Our main character reincarnates and the story starts after a 300 year time skip of our...immortal heroine living in that world. she's lived in that world several times longer than she lived her life as a japanese woman. I can barely remember what life was like 10 years ago, so she really isn't thinking of japan 300 years later. This world is her world far more than her previous life at this point. The isekai part serves no purpose aside from putting it in the genre, it should just be a story about an immortal witch who wishes to live a peaceful life.It's really just a slice of life show set in a fantasy world. It's just a show about cute girls doing wholesome and cute things. it tries to be funny, but the comedy falls flat most of the time. it has some ecchi, but that too sort of falls flat. it's really just a relaxing anime about cuteness.

Basically, it is a fusion between reincarnated as a slime (oddly...a good show) and 300 slime no- sorry, I meant 100 man no inochi (here we go, mystery solved: it inherited not only the title from this, but also the trashness).Moving on to the story, a random girl died for a stupid reason (at this point i would have preferred Truck-kun) that I refuse to write, and the usual god reincarnated her into a cute girl in another world, but WITHOUT OP POWERS?Don’t worry! we have a timeskip of 300 years where the mc becomes OP by defeating slimes, and here we have the show.Wow, what an original plot, never heard of something like this before.Honestly, I can write a plot better than this in 5 minutes.And don’t tell me that you would rate this high because the originality here lies behind the fact that it is relaxing, you know why? I don’t think it is a problem that affects just me, but I can’t properly relax if I’m watching something cringe AF.It is your average flat plotted isekai power fantasy show, filled with moe and useless  (filler) scenes.If you like this kind of stuff then cheer up, because it blends those “qualities” amazingly, taking the worse from each side in order to create one of the most painfully mediocre shows you could ever watch.It reminds me of Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear.If you still don’t believe me, then go to watch both of them and play ""find the differences"" between those two amazingly written shows.Anyways, I can already tell that if you are gonna try this you lost in advance, so to avoid any other waste of time, both mine and yours, I would stop here, suggesting not to watch this fucking G A R B A G E. a good show) and 300 slime no- sorry, I meant 100 man no inochi (here we go, mystery solved: it inherited not only the title from this, but also the trashness).Moving on to the story, a random girl died for a stupid reason (at this point i would have preferred Truck-kun) that I refuse to write, and the usual god reincarnated her into a cute girl in another world, but WITHOUT OP POWERS?Don’t worry! we have a timeskip of 300 years where the mc becomes OP by defeating slimes, and here we have the show.Wow, what an original plot, never heard of something like this before.Honestly, I can write a plot better than this in 5 minutes.And don’t tell me that you would rate this high because the originality here lies behind the fact that it is relaxing, you know why?

No salt.  No brown sugar.  No nuts.  Just plain, bland oatmeal.So far, there really hasn't been any character development.   Each episode has been about the new character being added to the household.Everything I needed to know about this anime I could have got from the OP and the ED.  The progression of characters are being marched out in the same order they march across the screen.  I like isekai and I love a good SOL, but I have a hard time staying interested in this one....It's not bad, it's not good.  It's just bland, mushy oatmeal. It's not bad, it's not good.  It's just bland, mushy oatmeal."", 'In the vast sea of isekais about defeating demon lords and getting trapped in a game world emerges Slime 300, an isekai that\'s all about living a peaceful life... and slaying slimes. Slimes are what\'s known to be the most common and well, less rewarding monsters to kill in RPG games. However, this anime takes the entire weak concept of slimes to the spotlight and makes the MC slaughter them for 300 years only to achieve the max level. Think that\'s a good idea? Well, we\'ll see.[TL;DR]Characters: 7/10Art and Animation: 5/10Music and Sounds: 5/10Story: 6/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 6.6 (7)...[Characters 7/10]Let\'s start with what builds the entire story, the characters. Although the characters are nothing special and are basically what you will expect in an isekai anime such as elves, slimes, witches and dragons, they somehow managed to be interesting enough and sure contributed a lot to the comedy aspects of the anime. They know who they are, they have their own backstory, and all have a unique personality. The only downside about the characters is their lack of character development. I have only seen development in 1 or 2 characters but they are too minor and happens in the exact same episode the character was introduced in, which makes people overlook it easily.SPOILERS AHEAD:There\'s also a ""curse"" for the characters in Slime 300. If you see a new character get introduced, you should be expecting it to have some sort of cute girl form. From fearsome dragons to bouncy slimes, if it becomes somewhat relevant to the main plot of the story, it has a 101% chance to transform into a cute girl for no reason. I personally don\'t find this annoying but I do find it weird.SPOILER END.[Art and Animation 5/10]The art in Slime 300 is surely not the best and not the worst either, it\'s kind of in the middle. Sometimes the art can very well be a piece of art, but sometimes it can also be a piece of trash. The animators tend to not shade the characters in dark areas a lot which creates an effect of weirdness when half of the screen is properly shaded while the other half of it is just coloured in a single colour. There are also times when the character heights are messed up. For example in episode 9, Shalsha appeared only a few centimeters shorter than Halkara for some time when she\'s meant to be a lot shorter than that. They are also known to occasionally reuse animations. ""Wait, what\'s wrong with reusing animations? It\'s a smart way to cut down the budget!"" Well, I do think so as well, but the fact that they forget to remove the mouth animation of the characters in some reused animations when they\'re not talking is just a bit more than simply reusing animations to cut down the budget. Other than those, the art in Slime 300 is not really that bad, and the cutesy art style fits the anime. The background images and visual effects look amazingly appealing and I won\'t be embarrassed to put them on as my wallpaper. They\'ve shown potential to create smooth camera movements without the use of CGI such as in episode 6 when Rosalie is marvelling the night sky. Although the art can certainly be bad at times with maybe a few episodes as exceptions, it wouldn\'t effect the watching experience much if you just bear with it.[Music and Sounds 5/10]Probably the only thing I dislike about this anime is the mass reuse of soundtracks. They have this isekai-themed soundtrack that they use a lot in scenes where the characters hang out together or do something dumb, which I don\'t actually mind because who has the money to produce so many soundtracks for the same purpose anyways? BUT what I care about is that they literally used this funny soundtrack for inappropriate scenes such as action scenes that felt intense. Think that\'s actually acceptable since they don\'t stay long and aren\'t that important? Well, what if I tell you they also used that exact soundtrack for touching moments (at least they could\'ve been), which completely ruined the atmosphere? There are still parts where the studio did a great job in this category though, such as that literally almost all of the sound effects are dubbed by the legend, Yuuki Aoi. Instead of hearing sparkling sound effects, you hear Yuuki saying ""kira kira~"". I personally found this approach very fun and unique since not many anime I know does this and it matches the comedic atmosphere of this anime. Slime 300 also has beautiful OP, ED and insert songs (TINY SPOILER: *cough* Episode 10 was a treat. *cough*) and they became the only songs on my Spring 2021 anisong playlist. I\'ve been listening to them for 300 minutes and emptied out my phone battery. :)[Story 6/10]The story starts off with Aizawa Azusa suddenly dying for overwork, which is a serious problem in the society right now. The story then proceeds to let us feel severe déjà vu by using the common isekai plot of meeting an entity that reincarnates the MC with some sort of OP ability, in this case being the ability to become immortal. Alright, OP ability acquired, what\'s next? Forming an army to save the world? Nope. Azusa decides to just live like any other normal person and killing an average of 25 slimes every day as a source of income. 25 x 365 x 300 x (2 + 2) = Lv 99. She maxed out her level after 300 years and here\'s where the real story starts. The story in Slime 300 is pretty simple and straight forward, it is what it is and doesn\'t have any hidden meanings behind it. This can be both a good thing and bad thing depending on what kind of entertainment you are looking for. A new problem arises almost every episode, and the story is all about Azusa and the ""family"" solving them and putting the problems into a close. Besides getting reincarnated into a game world by a goddess with some OP ability, the rest of the story is quite original and interesting enough to keep me watching without urging to watch something else. However the sequence of most episodes are very predictable (much like a lot of other animes I guess):A new problem arises -> Azusa summons Beelzebub into the bathtub? -> Tracks down the troublemaker -> Troublemaker transforms into a girl -> Troublemaker apologizes -> Troublemaker either disappears for a few episodes before reappearing or joins the family -> Yay, ED plays!Yes, that\'s exactly how the original ""family"" of 4 expanded into huge numbers. If you look at the episode list, you might realize that the first few episode names all start with ""Along came the blah blah blah"", ""A blah blah blah appeared!"", etc. and I think you know why now.[Enjoyment 10/10]""What? Why a perfect score?"" Well, it\'s because this anime brought me the most laughs this season and made me feel better and recover during sad times in the 3 months of it airing. Don\'t get me wrong, even though I gave this anime an overall score of 7 and pointed out a lot of its downsides, it was the only anime this season that made me feel hyped for the next episode every week. Even during rewatching a few episodes to confirm my statements in this review, it still made me laugh a lot in the process, although I have already seen it all and know what is going to happen next. It might not have good character writing, it might not have good art, it might not have a good plot, but it does a great job in keeping the viewers entertained and relaxed.[Overall 7/10]Admit it, no one watches this to get excited or to feel severe emotions (maybe except 1 episode *cough*). We only watch it to relax and get a few laughs. If you\'re looking for a soothing slice of life comedy, I would recommend to at least give the first few episodes a try as Slime 300 does a great job in that case. Despite having a lot of downfalls, it is still a great series to spend your free time with. If this anime does get a Season 2, I sincerely hope that it will receive better treatment in production.[Conclusion]Animes are all filled with gore and violence recently, and Slime 300 is for you to take a break from them.Thanks for reading my first non-preliminary review and I hope this review was helpful to you.

Happy anime watching!', ""I'll defend this series because I really enjoy watching this. PLEASE READ THE SYNOPSIS FIRST BEFORE WATCHING SOMETHING. AND ALSO IF YOU'RE NOT INTO SLICE OF LIFE TYPE ANIME, THEN DON'T WATCH IT. If you're not into that type of thing, don't watch it. IT is just that simple. This show deserves more love for the fans of slice of life.This is the type of anime that's similar to Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear. They're isekai but really wholesome. Having a slow life depiction anime with a comedy is really comforting. The wholesomeness of this series totally overwhelmed me. Anime like this (Called Iyashikei) is really...underrated outside of Japan. Such animes like K-on, Blend-S, Yuru Camp, and other top Slice of Life Animes. Wholesome animes needs more recognition so that other people who is into this type of anime and yet others are still hating on this type of anime. Anime is supposed to be ENJOYED, not Critique it. That's what I believe.The Story of this anime really fits in to my taste. It is like Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear but the main Character is a Witch. That's why I gave it a 10/10Art doesn't matter to me as long as the story is good. So a 10/10 too.Characters are really wholesome, of course I gave it a 10/10Enjoyment is the top thing that gives on this anime. 10/10Overall is a 10/10.

I would personally buy a merch for this anime on how wholesome it is to watch."", 'There are a lot of people giving this anime very low scores for having a lackluster plot or having issues in other categories, but the point of this show is not to be some masterpiece. Its a cute girls do cute things type of show. Just in an isekai. I for one absolutely love this show so far. I\'ve watched the 9 episodes that are currently out and I think its really great. Its cute, funny, relaxing, just everything I would want in an anime.Ok now lets get into rating the showStory: 7/10I get it, its nothing special. Its a slice of life its not...supposed to be very action packed (although it does have a few fight scenes and such) I think people misinterpret this show when it comes to the story. I personally think the lesson that this anime teaches, not to work so hard and to simply enjoy life, is really cool. And its kept consistent and executed well in the show.Art: 7/10Again its pretty standard for a 12 episode anime. The characters are cute and they have plenty of emotion but the art doesn\'t have a whole lot of detail and you can tell where they had to cut some things out for the budget. Either way it doesn\'t bother me and I think the show looks goodSound: 10/10I could go on forever about how much I love the sound in this anime. First of all the OP and ED are really cool and fun pieces of music. The op is crazy, random unique, all that and I love it. The ED always puts a big smile on my face (as if the show didn\'t already) at the end of each episode. I just love it. But neither of those are my favorite parts of the sound in this show. No, its the sound effects. The little ""boom""s and ""pow""s and ""sparkle""s that Aoi Yuuki voices and adds in herself are sprinkled throughout the show are so funny. It might actually be my favorite part about the entire show, it brings me so much joy.Characters: 10/10I love them, all of them. I love how well all of the different character tropes fit together in this show. I wont go into too much detail here for the sake of keeping this review somewhat short but they all just connect with each other so well. All of the characters in this show are very memorable. in 10 years you could forget the names of these characters but still remember their personalities. (of course I think you could, this show has only been out 9 weeks) But anyways I just think they all are super unique and funny in their own way.Enjoymeny: 10/10This is very subjective and everyone likes what they like but I am thoroughly enjoying this show so far. I really truly love it.Overall: 9/10yeah I know it\'s high, but trust me its as good as I say it is. Just don\'t take it so seriously its truly very very good. supposed to be very action packed (although it does have a few fight scenes and such) I think people misinterpret this show when it comes to the story.

Either way it doesn\'t bother me and I think the show looks goodSound: 10/10I could go on forever about how much I love the sound in this anime. First of all the OP and ED are really cool and fun pieces of music. The op is crazy, random unique, all that and I love it. The ED always puts a big smile on my face (as if the show didn\'t already) at the end of each episode. I just love it. But neither of those are my favorite parts of the sound in this show. No, its the sound effects. The little ""boom""s and ""pow""s and ""sparkle""s that Aoi Yuuki voices and adds in herself are sprinkled throughout the show are so funny. It might actually be my favorite part about the entire show, it brings me so much joy.Characters: 10/10I love them, all of them. I love how well all of the different character tropes fit together in this show. I wont go into too much detail here for the sake of keeping this review somewhat short but they all just connect with each other so well. All of the characters in this show are very memorable. in 10 years you could forget the names of these characters but still remember their personalities. (of course I think you could, this show has only been out 9 weeks) But anyways I just think they all are super unique and funny in their own way.Enjoymeny: 10/10This is very subjective and everyone likes what they like but I am thoroughly enjoying this show so far. I really truly love it.Overall: 9/10yeah I know it\'s high, but trust me its as good as I say it is. Just don\'t take it so seriously its truly very very good.', 'Its got funny girls and a few maids, dragon girls and pointy ear people and mommy beelzebub and a few lolis if you into that. Best show of the season all the other shows suck compared to this one. Yeah its that good. Dont care about what you gonna say cause you will just be wrong. Cant prove me wrong so i win Best show of 2021. ok so it just told me that i need a longer review so . Its got this Maid whos a dragon. and her name is laika best girl. yeah shes cool.

With cute visuals it makes the heart happy and the peace makes the heart peaceful. And this anime is so colorful that you don't get bored seeing it. The story is also interesting with a brief explanation we can clearly know about the life of the main character. The jokes are also funny and easy to digest, and the main advantage is that the girls are beautiful. The story is also very relaxed but still fun to continue. The monsters are also cute like playing in rpg games. Really recommends to watch. "", 'This is such a great anime. Characters all have great personalities, animation quality is good and is an overdose of cuteness (Falfa and Shalsha UwU).Highly reccommended from me. Main premise is the MC overworks herself and dies though gets reincarnated and kills slimes everyday to become OP but wants to live a peaceful life instead of getting attention. Characters introduce themselves throughout it and they are all great imo.  If there is any conflict it is quickly resolved and there isn’t too much drama going on so you can just kick back, relax and enjoy the show :). I guess you could say the...story and main tropes are a bit cliche though the way they are done in here is on a much higher tier than other anime. Definitely should give it a watch. story and main tropes are a bit cliche though the way they are done in here is on a much higher tier than other anime.

That goes across the board from adults down to children.Like every other gag character, the one here was no exception to my annoyance, though she's still fits a pretty good gap and was a nice way to accent all of the regularness (yep, not a word, but I went with it because it's worth it that's when I was recording this.)There was consistent attention to detail to the little things that you don't realize is being done. For example, there is a ghost that has blue flames that hang over her shoulders. If she is behind a couple of people and only one flame is showing and she flies just enough for the other shoulder to show, the flame shows as well.This was mostly a two-part, one episode show, though there are two that take up the whole time slot.I needed this is a breather from some of the things I have been watch and I made a wonderful choice; simple dumb luck paid off.

After 300 Years of living said life she has become the strongest witch in the world and therefore her peaceful life slowly comes to an end, as other people and creatures want to test their strengt against her or ask her for help.There is no underlying deep plot to the story, but the episodic short adventures she lives though are really fun to see.Art: 7The art style is easy on the eyes with detailed backgrounds and adorably cute character designs.The animation is nothing groundbreaking or overly impressive, but still looks really good and gets the job done perfectly fine.Sound: 7Neither the opening or the ending are my cup of tea, they are quite catchy though and by far not the worst I've heard.The soundtrack overall gets the job done, nothing to complain there. I wish there had been one or two more memorable tracks, but it's fine either way.The voice-acing is as usual fantastic, super cute and talented voices across the board.Character: 6None of the characters are particularly complex but they also don't have to be for this type of anime.They are all following the standard character tropes you probably have seen multiple times before. Despite that they are still absolutely likable and cute.Enjoyment: 7Sometimes it was predictable and you were able to see jokes coming from miles ahead which kind of ruined the jokes, but that is to be expected after you have seen a few anime, since they do tend to follow certain schemes.However I enjoyed the show. It was a fun watch for in-between and got some laughs out of me, which is all I expected it to do.Overall: 7This show is not to be taken too seriously. It's not to be watched with a too critical mindset. If you want something with a deep story, strong plot with plot twists, deep characters and hat not, this is not for you.It's a fun comedy, slice of life show which you can watch if you need something to laugh or if you want to watch something light to relax a bit that does not require a lot of thinking.Give it a try if you can be not too critical and want to laugh a bit.

I mean, I could understand this can be seen as...a flaw for ""thriller"" animes, ones like death note for instance where strategy has a big place in the plot and the viewer expects some nuanced characters in order to truly understand their motivations. But come on, if you\'ve watched the trailer or read the synopsis for Slime Taoshite, the anime doesn\'t promise that kind of things at all. As a matter of fact, this show is only trying to depict the life of the MC in a fantasy world where she\'ll encounter new friends and each episode/chapter will narrate a small ""adventure"" in their everyday life, which is always resolved by the end of the episode.Now I\'m not saying this anime is enjoyable for everyone, it\'s a specitic type of anime, one where the plot won\'t have high stakes even in this fantasy world, and it\'s okay if that doesn\'t appeal to you, but all those reviews giving low grades to the anime because it was too ""plain"" feel innapropriate.All in all, Iv\'e enjoyed watching Slime Taoshite, I rate it 8 out of 10 because while being a nice watch, some episodes did feel a bit slow at times, or some scenes/jokes were too cliché, this is clearly not a master piece, but it remains entertaining.If this anime sounds interesting to you, you can watch the first ( or 2 ) episodes : if you enjoyed them, you\'ll like the whole season, otherwise, you should probably drop because chances are you won\'t enjoy the rest of the season. a flaw for ""thriller"" animes, ones like death note for instance where strategy has a big place in the plot and the viewer expects some nuanced characters in order to truly understand their motivations.

The show just...clearly doesn\'t know who it\'s supposed to be aimed at, or what it\'s supposed to do with such a large cast.The few episodic plots are actually somewhat interesting, largely due to the surprises that some from a mix of meeting and subverting isekai and harem tropes.

Wouldn\'t recommend binging it because the pacing is pretty slow, it might bore you out.Slime 300 feels like a discount Maid Dragon at first, but Azusa carried the show pretty well. Considering this is the 5th anime of the studio, I\'ll say it did pretty well, but by no means is this a 10/10 AotS. It\'s just something you can watch if you\'re bored and just want to turn your brain off, and preferably not in an anime binging mood, because I\'ll recommend...you something else like ID:Invaded instead.To go with the usual format:Story: 5/10In simple terms, it\'s Azusa building her ""harem"", except she\'s a female MC building a house of female cast. While they\'re cute and enjoyable in their own right (I don\'t really find any of them annoying, even Halkara was tolerable tbh), the story is absolutely predictable. Almost every episode you have someone new introduced, and then has a conflict Azusa has to solve (for them), and then they join the family in the end, living together. Yep, that\'s it. The story is not what\'s supposed to be the highlight of the show anyway.Do not expect to see Maid Dragon writing here despite being the same genre/type, because Maid Dragon actually has a background story and the growth of the dragons from being genocidal maniacs to cute little Kobayashi simps are well fleshed out.Art: 8/10Being a relatively new anime studio, the art is pretty good, and the animations do not have noticeable problems. Of course, considering Slime 300 is supposed to be carried by the wacky cast, they obviously have to draw them well, and they did just that. You may still find some of them being easily forgettable (more on that later) but that has nothing to do with the art.Sound:6/10I remember the music was decent, but then again I don\'t remember the music. Sounds like a weird way to describe it, but basically it wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t great enough to make me remember it or save it to my playlist as well.Character: 6/10For a show that depends on showcasing the interactions between the wacky cast, it did just that, especially for the first few episodes where Azusa slowly constructs her house. However, later on, there are just way too many characters, and it leads to the point where you might not remember some characters. For example, I personally think Beelzebub is quite memorable, but everyone else except Azusa was easily forgettable. Not that it stops you from enjoying the anime when you watch it, but it is, at the end of the day, just an anime for you to turn off your brains and waste your time on. It\'s a CGDCT series, don\'t expect too much from it aside from the characters being... well... cute.Enjoyment: 7/10I followed the anime when it was airing, so it was an enjoyable experience for me, although I must say I am not an anime connoisseur. I watch whatever interests me, and whatever manages to keep my interest. Slime 300 wasn\'t anything special nor some groundbreaking masterpiece, but it definitely was enjoyable while it lasted. I seriously think the anime will be a weak binge though.Overall: 7/10Nothing out of the ordinary, but not a bad watch either if you\'re looking to just laze around and chill, preferably with food, some snacks or Cola.

Enjoyable enough, but honestly nothing too special.The main character is sweet and probably my favourite part of the anime. She has a decent amount of common sense, which is unusual for a fantasy anime character. On the other hand, one of the side characters gets on my nerves to no end with the sheer amount of stupidity they have. And not even the cute kind of stupid, just the annoying kind. The other side characters are just about as loveable as the main character, which is a big plus.The only reason I wouldn't...rank this any higher is mainly that the show is a bit too straightforward.

It doesn't have the best animation or story but it carries it quite well making the viewer (in this case me) want to know more about the main characters and the plot. One of the things I liked the most was that there is a goodness in the family that the characters have, each character has something to contribute, it shows how they each care and love each other, that makes my heart melt with love.The main character is a plus to the anime, she is always there to...help others and leaves us several teachings in each chapter.

The story is just about the life of the girl with her ""family"", but the special thing about the story is about the lives of all the characters.

Not to ruin the hype on the other slime based title, this slime killing witch surely is not to be missed.For once, the main character is not a guy, and died because not from getting hit by Truck-kun or having god smite her with lightning. From the start of the anime, we are are treated to some basic isekai anime protocol. Character dies, holds a conversation with god or some form of deity, gets to choose what they want to do when they get reincarnated and so on. However, what is unique is...the fact that the lead is a female and also the fact that she does not lead a harem or an adventurers life of combat and romance. Like most isekai titles, Azusa did a complete 180 transformation, both in her appearance and her lifestyle. Gone are the days of being a corporate slave, working 24/7, and sleepless nights. From just being another Japanese salary woman, she becomes a loving mother, a caring teacher as well as your neighborhood doctor. Honestly, it is quite a mistake labeling this title as a fantasy genre, the term slice of life suits this title better, in fact it suits the title so much due to how relaxing and easy going it is and I am a sucker for all things slice of life.This title is certainly an enjoyable one, the story is clear, it follows the usual literary storyline, the characters are all likable, and no nonsense whatsoever. It is almost too perfect in fact, too perfect to the point that you might as well call it a text-book example. Yup, as enjoyable as it is, it is hard to deny the fact that this title is plain as vanilla. But just like vanilla, plain and simple is sometimes the best way to go, but also like vanilla, it is easily forgettable. This title does not have a wow factor to it other than the things mentioned before. Another title in mind would be kuma-kuma-kuma bear. Just like the former, both have female leads and both did not die at the hands of god or truck-kun. So slime taoshite, as much praise as it deserves, it lacks in any form of wow factor to make it stand out amongst its adversaries. Having Azusa lead a life of a witch instead of an adventurer is not what can be considered a unique selling point, also the title is a mouthful, both Japanese and English.There is not much to say about this title given that by the time this review is submitted, the anime is still airing. It is certainly regrettable to say that this is just another seasonal installment of a fantasy anime, a list that continues to grow every season. the fact that the lead is a female and also the fact that she does not lead a harem or an adventurers life of combat and romance.

Sure, it's not Nichijou, but it's better than your average Harem Isekai Generic Marathon; it's a little bit generic, but the good kind - the kind of normality that one could use on occasion. Just some light fluff with an overpowered protagonist and good voice acting.Thus:Good - voice acting, art-style, sound design and characters.

They say this show has no story, no character developement so it sucks.

Not in the conventional way, since there is no epic final boss she has to defeat with her new OP powers to save the world blah blah blah. Instead her one wish to live a quiet and slow life falls apart, since everybody starts to...gravitate towards her power. This creates sooo many amazing moments of comedy, her values and her lifestyle she has been living for 300 years have to change to accomodate to the family she is in now, which she never wanted but grows into loving them and doing anything with her OP powers to defend them.So yeah, the show has basicly no story, no real direction, we don't even have a sense of time since most episodes are seperate from each other in terms of story, but this is not supposed to be a 200 episode long show where the MC either has to grow from zero to hero, or the typical shounen isekai where it's all about fighting all show long so the OP MC can defeat the even more OP final boss with her also OP friends. No, this show is SOL and comedy, and it really is a laid back, hilarious, wholesome, episodic anime with very much loveable, adorable and funny characters.

I\'m not that eloquent with words, but what I can say is that this show is great. It\'s not full of action packed scenes like MHA or JJK (Although there was 1 pretty good fight scene) and it\'s not a super heartfelt drama like Bunny Girl Senpai. What it is, however, is relaxation. After a crappy week of school and work, I found myself looking forward to each and every new episode. You get a peek...inside a well-written fantasy world, where nothing much ever really happens. My eyes didn\'t need to strain and keep up with high action scenes and I didn\'t need to focus on every aspect of the show or get super emotionally invested. All I needed to do was watch, and I would laugh, relax and be entertained. This show is one think: pure relaxation.That\'s my overall review, but to the individual parts-The story was well written, nothing felt rushed, all the characters had development in one way or another. This was nice, considering the large cast that there was in this show.The art was very pretty, a simple style that didn\'t go wrong. Nothing was atrocious and unbearable to watch, and the in-betweens of the episodes were quite nice as well.Standing above any other aspect of this show was the sound. The little spoken words of \'Gurgle Gurgle\' or \'Sparkle Sparkle\' were really cute and nice; the music was relaxing, and fit very well into the whole fantasy theme. The horns, flutes and other instruments were really soothing and nice, even if they weren\'t the focus of the show.The characters were well-written, staying true to their nature without arbitrary changes in their nature. In most shows, there\'s a hateable character, or a character I didn\'t like because of their writing or actions or just their design in general. For this show, though, I really couldn\'t find my hateable character. I couldn\'t dislike a single character. That shows how great the characters are written.Overall, a big 10/10. The voice actors absolutely slayed their roles, the animators did an impeccable job, the writers and directors did not fail to meet to perfect standards, and the sound design was just wonderful. If you\'re a super stressed and busy person like me, then I recommend this show. You don\'t use energy to watch this show, like many other shows. This show is just a perfect Slice of Life, Fantasy and Isekai mix.

It is a comedy slice of life show with cute girls doing cute things in a fantasy setting. It is a lighthearted and wholesome anime. It is also completely harmless in its humor, there is plenty of it, and there is a lack of subversion at any point so it is a great choice for both kids and adults that are looking for something that is just nice, positive and easy to watch.The anime is an adaptation of the light novel series of the same name which started in 2016. Unlike many others these series...of books, already on the 17 volume with 9 very well translated to English, are also very well written, the little stories are coherent and rather hilarious, enjoyable and follow a logical path. For those wanting to fill the many blanks of an anime adaptation, I 100% recommend them.The anime itself has beautiful art with good attention to detail on both the main characters and the backgrounds. The animation is good in general, with very good polish, it’s hard to find a frame that looks poorly done or rushed, and, this was very important for me, it favors traditional animation instead of CGI for the most part, magical effects and water being the main exception, which is understandable and looks rather great.It is worth noting that the animation is surprisingly excellent at times, like with the few fight scenes that happen. It is always interesting to see a slice of life anime with this amount of care for such scenes, something that many fight focused shows lack more often than not. You won’t find a single drop of blood here except for a brief nose bleed one episode. As a side note, it’s very amusing to see how the team seems to enjoy referencing Dragon Ball in particular.The story is faithful to the light novels and, as the premise says, it tries to teach good positive little lessons, such as that slow and steady wins the race, that the extremes are always harmful, that small moderate efforts are better than doing all of it right away. You get the idea.Interestingly, the isekai part of this show is only a very small plot point that serves the main character, our now very cute witch Azusa, to change her old workaholic ways and never go back to them. It is interesting because her story could easily work just fine without the isekai part of it. She could have been born in her now new fantasy world, became a witch and end up both immortal and desiring a laid back life on her own,  similarly becoming max level with the same little effort every day for 300 years. It is not a big deal though.As more characters are introduced their personalities clash in hilarious ways here and there. Needless to say, some of the humor is about other characters teasing Azusa, harmlessly really, for the giggles. It is more common in the anime due to its fast pacing, but it is funny thanks in no small part to the amazing voice actresses. The English dub is also surprisingly excellent too and it’s also dubbed to other languages.There is no romance here of course but the anime doesn't shy away from hand holding, hugs and kisses on the cheek, which is pretty adorable. One character in particular is really mischievous in the most amusing and surprising ways, although it shouldn’t surprise anyone considering what her first name means in Spanish, so she gets a special mention.Many of the main characters see Azusa, and she in return, as family, mostly sisters even if they’re not related, so their reactions are realistic and make sense for their different personalities. Perhaps the elf girl is portrayed a little off canon at times for the fan service, as she is more competent, even if clumsy at times, in the light novels.Finally, the music score is pretty light and doesn't get in the way during the show either. The celtic like vibes are more than welcome and fit nicely with the fantasy setting. I must say that the opening song was a little strange at first, since it's just the original voice of Azusa in this one, speaking very fast at first, but it's very catchy and will easily glue to your mind, plus she's a delight as per usual.All in all, I was going to give this show a 9, just for the very few things that annoyed me here and there. But then I remembered that many effects are actually voiced and they never stopped to greatly amuse me. So I’m going to round up the score to 10 thanks to that brilliant idea that really added to the comedy and lighthearted tone of the show. It is not perfect, and the studio is relatively new so it doesn't have a big following so don't let the overall scores discourage you. In the genres that it is competing in, it is outstanding. I hope that it gets a second season in the future. of books, already on the 17 volume with 9 very well translated to English, are also very well written, the little stories are coherent and rather hilarious, enjoyable and follow a logical path.

I'm still not too familiar with how things work on mal but I will try my best.When the trailer dropped for this anime I got hooked, an isekai about killing slimes for 300 years? Sounds good enough for me and the mc looked cute. But man, I had high hopes for this one but it disappointed me. I was struggling with not dropping it for the last 5 episodes but I managed to finish it altogether. Since this will be my first anime review it will be rather short and to...the point about my likes and dislikes.(DISCLAIMER: This review will contain minor-spoilers regarding this anime)The first things I will bring up about this anime are the pros:Animation/Visuals - 8/10 Best PartMost likely the best part this show could offer, relative good animation with pleasant looking visuals. It almost felt like a waste at the end of the show. By looking decent enough they could fool people into thinking it was going to be amazing; at least it was visual wise. Animation was fluid and rarely felt stiff which was enjoyable and the art style itself was decent looking.Story - 5/10 Mediocre At BestUsually I have no problem with a typical isekai story as long as it has interesting characters and the story itself is a little bit different and I thought at first that it was the case with this one. Death by overworking, being reincarnated into an immortal witch who slays slimes for 300 years and ends up being super powerful, sounds interesting enough for me. Well that was basically the very first episode, then it goes downhill after episode 3. Nothing exciting happened in the story that kept me hooked, things did happen but it was either bothersome or not the slightest interesting. It didn’t exactly go bad but I lost interest pretty fast.Here comes the cons:Characters: 3/10 Boring, Mediocre or AnnoyingSome of these characters in the show (especially Halkara) got on my nerves pretty quickly and it became clear to me that this was going to lower my score for the show. When someone made a mistake it felt more like a plot device than a genuine mistake from the character themselves. Let me not get into how uncomfortable Pecora made me with her ‘’big sister’’ obsession, very weird tension between her and Azusa (poor Azusa). Speaking of her, Azusa might be one of the few I somewhat liked, she ain’t anything special but she does her job as the main MC but I’m not sure how she can put up with everything. Majority of the characters felt pretty plain and there was nothing intriguing about them either, usually I don’t need super developed characters to enjoy something but this felt rather cheap.Comedy - 3/10 Made Me Laugh OnceEveryone has a different taste and preference when it comes to comedy and this was not for me. It wasn’t terrible though; it got a few chuckles out of me and a genuine laugh at one part but it was lacking overall. When it came to certain parts it felt more like what I would call ‘’fanservice comedy’’, making me either slightly uncomfortable or simply roll my eyes. Sometimes it would be predictable too, for example when Halkara said she didn’t pick any poison mushrooms and acted clueless when there was in fact poison mushrooms there because she has done the exact same thing in the past.Conclusion - 4/10 Disappointed OverallTo summarize my thoughts about ‘’I’ve Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level’’ into a single sentence;‘’It was like the start of a rollercoaster which was slowly going up and when going down it went straight into hell’’The amount of times I wanted to drop this one was more than what I can count but I wanted to see it all and judge it fairly.

It had potential to be a little bit different and enjoyable but with that type of cast won’t do at all.

It almost felt like a waste at the end of the show. By looking decent enough they could fool people into thinking it was going to be amazing; at least it was visual wise. Animation was fluid and rarely felt stiff which was enjoyable and the art style itself was decent looking.Story - 5/10 Mediocre At BestUsually I have no problem with a typical isekai story as long as it has interesting characters and the story itself is a little bit different and I thought at first that it was the case with this one. Death by overworking, being reincarnated into an immortal witch who slays slimes for 300 years and ends up being super powerful, sounds interesting enough for me. Well that was basically the very first episode, then it goes downhill after episode 3. Nothing exciting happened in the story that kept me hooked, things did happen but it was either bothersome or not the slightest interesting.

It just shows how bad it was for me, this is by no means a hate review, just pointing things out.This anime is just a waste of time. In general, there is nothing going on in it. The story is bland, uninspired and dull. I\'m not a fan of Isekai genre, because there is just too much bad anime, yet there are still a lot of gems. But among all anime I heard and watched, slime-300 gonna be the worst one I ever touched. And yeah, I watched Tsuujou Kougeki ga...Zentai Kougeki de Ni-kai Kougeki no Okaasan wa Suki Desu ka? and it still felt better, and I gave it better score than this one. You know, it could turn into interesting take on non-combat isekai where protagonist is just too smart and wise with good amount of adventures - in this way it would be watch-able, compared to what happened in reality. In reality, we have 12 episodes of total boredom, each episode telling us a little story, but... fails to make it interesting. It\'s just all clichéd, all stereotyped, I struggled to find at least some novelty in every episode but i just couldn\'t. You can say this is Slice of Life genre, but out of all SoL I watched slime-300 had worst pacing, lame jokes, one-dimensional characters and dialogues like they were written by neural network. I\'m not exaggerating - you can try to watch it and find for yourself, but I advise against it.So, like I said, characters are one-dimensional. Simply put, there are zero character development through whole season - except maybe for protagonist albeit its minor changes. The most change for MC was 1st episode, where she went from good for nothing rookie to max lvl character. And yeah, it stays for the rest of show like this. No power crisis, where MC encounters something she can\'t beat, no inner monologue about how with great power comes great responsibility, no reflections on her journey, on her friends, on what she had to do - she just exists and solve all problems easily, without second thought, sometimes with power of others. But you see, the biggest flaw in MC is that she is unstoppable, the world of this anime have no one to counter her, for crying loud - even the best warriors of the world couldn\'t compete with her and lose in their first battle. MC is just a tasteless Mary Sue, who wins warriors with hundreds years of battle experience. And you see, there is just one big mistake - if you train 300 years with slimes, you can easily know how to beat all slime types, that\'s for sure. But if you had 0 experience fighting dragons, demons, elves et cetera, you will lose, regardless of your power level, simply because you don\'t know strategy and weakness of these other races and types of enemies. And what happen in slime-300? Azusa mops the floor with them. And then they become friends, oh, family (which is even more ridiculous, because family is not something you can easily consider adding someone into, though this anime doesn\'t care at all, they are just like ""let\'s play house""). Yeaaaaaah. Okay. Other characters in anime even less written - they are just common anime archetypes with no personality, or with personality that could be explained in 2-3 sentences.Story is kind of, well, non-existent. Why so? Because it doesn\'t follow even basics of storytelling. There are no conflict, no reflections, no character development which shows progression, everything that happens is like fairy tale, but sadly executed, because even fairy tale requires actual actions and aftermath of them. Yet, Azusa and her family face no consequences of their actions - like everything is always okay. Out of all anime, there were just one time when things got rough - when one of ""daughters"" turned back to slime. Yet it still resolved as quickly as ever and nothing really changes. Even the battle between dragon clans (the biggest crisis in anime) felt predetermined - just because Azusa was here and viewer already knows that she can\'t lose, so yeah, no surprise here at all. You can say - It is SoL anime, what you expected? But even SoL have standards, either comedy SoL, or healing SoL(iyashikei), but slime-300 doesn\'t fit in either. Because it\'s realy devoid of novelty. It could fit into healing SoL sub-genre, but alas, there are better alternatives, which had characters with actual stories, temper, personality etc. Watch Aria, YKK, Amanchu, Non non biyori, Yuru camp or w/e else, it will be better, I promise youArt is good, I could say very good, maybe not best, but character art and animation are great. A lot of cutesy and with somehow ""family""-centered plot, it could be one of strong points of this anime. I am sure there are people who appreciate such setting, so here you go - it may be your piece of cake. Not mine, but you can enjoy for sure.Sound is not so bad, not so good, something in between. I didn\'t like either OP or ED, the former is too hectic and chaotic to enjoy, while the latter is forgettable. But the soundtrack itself works fine for that anime, so it is a solid 5.Overall this is the worst anime I watched, and I watched a lot of different genres/subgenres, works of different studios, and a lot of various plots and character types in them. But slime-300 was the most boring experience - I had to watch last 4 episodes at 4x speed to actually finish this anime because i didn\'t have stregth in myself to watch it at all. However, while for me it was worst experience, others may enjoy it - it is indeed cute isekai where nothing bad happens, there is good art and character design.

It would take you forever, of course, because each slime only yielded 1 experience point. Intrepid electronic engineers could nowadays hook up a microcontroller and some transistors to the controller's buttons and have a machine learning model actually play the game in the starting area until the character's maxed out, which would honestly feel too much like a chore.

To anyone that knows the scene, it\'s pretty obvious that japanese authors have a distinctive genre: isekai. Pair isekai with the other themes emblematic of japanese webnovels: OP protagonist, ""fluffy life"", trivial obstacles, integrating japanese culture into new world, maids, western medieval world, super long title, unnecessary politeness that is a distinct contrast to actual power level, and cute obedient, and loyal subordinates, and you get Slime Taoshite 300-nen, Shiranai Uchi ni Level Max ni Nattemashita.In fact, if you didn\'t notice already, these...characteristics are so generic that you can take another popular webnovel adaptation and it would still work.

This ain’t it. In fact, remarkably, it’s lower than either. Even after comparing it to any fantasy anime with woman MC, I still couldn’t wrap my head around this one.Like all good things in seasonal anime series, Slime 300 (for short of ""Slime Taoshite 300-nen, Shiranai Uchi ni Level Max ni Nattemashita""; tl: ""I\'ve Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level"")  has a little bit of good premise out of it in the first episodes, around half-cour I’d say, to show the audience that this has a little bit of something for everyone. Nevertheless, almost nothing if not none had been delivered in the midway.Warning: SPOILERS, et cetera.Perhaps the one part that had me the most is that sequence in the first episode where Azusa (the MC) makes her battle debut and fights a dragon as a witch where the animators showcase a potentially cool and smoothly drawn action sequences. Three episodes later after that, I was served. But to say that I was served is the same as me asking for the most expensive recommended dish accompanied with the best wine present in the most luxurious French cuisine restaurant, only somehow to be given BTS meal instead. Not what I asked for, but hey, I’ll take it since I’m hungry enough and I can box them up for home because I certainly won’t eat that shit at a resto. Based upon this, you can pretty much assume what kind of taste I have in this slice-of-life anime stuff: not great, but not terrible.That’s basically how it all started. Everytime one of these seasonal show came out, the concept would somewhat be interesting enough to invest to at first glance: Somehow Azusa died after overworking herself and somehow her physical form transferred herself into a fantasy world where somehow she decided to take this new reincarnated life experience as a new opportunity to create her new self into being an isolating lone-wolf witch. Henceforth, living her daily life by killing slimes every single day for 300 years straight and getting away with it somehow. And she didn’t get bored in all those 300 years of doing the same shit over and over again. Somehow.What I like about Azusa is how she decided out of the blue to make peace with what she had to become and settled down to make a living of her own and for her own. All in all while killing slimes for 300 years, which would’ve been either funnier or cooler depending on how they would care to elaborate on this peculiar monotonous behaviour of slimes-killing Azusa to get to know her better and perhaps have a little more perspective on how she did all this without slowly losing her absolute state of human sanity. Needless to say, they went with “extraordinarily immortal human” trope and shrugged it off.I think what surprises me the most is the voice actress behind Azusa is literally Aoi Yuuki herself. There’s a part of me that felt absolute respect and an uncontained amazement when I realized that the same woman behind Azusa’s voice is the one who voiced a lot of unexpected characters. I certainly wouldn’t expect that this is the very same Tsuyu (MHA), Yoshiko (Aho Girl herself), Madoka (Madoka Magica), Tatsumaki (One Punch Man) and Tanya motherfucking Degurechaff (Youjo Senki). It’s like if the word “Kusogaki” (shitty brat) was ever a person, then this woman would voice it. I also remembered her as Lotta Otus (ACCA-13) since that’s my favorite show. By the way, she’s also voicing Kumoko (Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka) in this season.Add the plain fantasy world nonsenses if it’s not bad enough. Put some more of those meaningless Silmarillion-esque names and dictionary vocabularies. The villagers look like passerby walking dead to serve as some kind of pity background. There is no open-world building, there is no sense of adventure nor any kinds of self-satisfaction  in Azusa’s daily fantasy life, and certainly there is no reason for either Azusa or me as the audience to indulge in her world any longer. We’re supposed to go with the flow of this show’s world-building like it’s some sort of incomplete RPG fantasy game in which we have to wait and pay for its DLC expansions in hopes that it will get better afterwards, which will never come out. I’ve never been scammed this hard before since EA’s Star Wars Battlefront.Perhaps the part that I could give any chances to is the ‘COMEDY’ of this show, which came out as a product formed from the dynamics between all the characters gathering around the overpowered Azusa like attracted flies. Things couldn’t get any better when you realized this is a faithful adaptation to its original light-novel work. For all it has to offer, I can’t think of anything else about the side characters but taking them as some kind of product of running gag where they’re all fanservice characters presented for the sake of ambiguous yet obliviously mainstream stereotypes that would always appear in all seasonal anime, purposefully created just to make us laugh: shy tsundere red dragon girl, klutz blue dragon girl, klutz elf girl with big breasts who is suspiciously perverse, loli twins, loli demon king with big breasts, young tsundere ghost teenager girl and ‘not-naked’ dark elf demon girl. In terms of those unfamiliar with this format, there may be chances that all the jokes in this anime could land to such viewerbase. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that both the light-novel author of this adaptation and all the Chad Japanese anime-enjoyers need to realize sooner than later that this is 2021 where the only people unfamiliar with this sort of slapsticks ‘comedy’ format are Gen-Z kids who were born in the middle of 2015s and wouldn’t even know about any other types of animated shows apart from Youtube’s Cocomelon.At least if I want a slow-paced slice-of-life fantasy journey where I can take it easy with my main character, please give me something like Kentucky Route Zero. That literal piece of shit of a supernatural point-and-click story based PC game actually had no gameplay whatsoever and I can still get invested in it to the point that it became my guilty pleasure. Also, the reason why I’m currently talking about KZR is because that game reminded me of how much it lacked gameplay and if that game made my day, then it can definitely make your day as well, and neither I nor you would get out of this while being incredibly bored if that lame ass game is so enjoyable.What reminded me of everything Kentucky Route Zero always have even among its inevitable flaws is what essentially this show is lacking: visual immersion and reason to follow the plot; which is funny because the only thing KZR has offered to me in its 20 good hours of ‘gameplay’ is literally nothing but having me dully loitering around in the same dumbass city. In that sense, I could put KZR in comparison with this kind of anime, because it felt like watching a movie. Whereas Slime 300 has a total of 13 episodes with 25 minutes each and I stopped watching at episode 8; roughly less than 200 minutes of watch time due to the lack of visual and world exploration. Hell, I’ll play KZR again after this just for the hell of it.More hardcore DLC scam can be found in the animation department. Not only did they not deliver us with better open-world, they also went from the attitude of “Let’s make our best impression!” to “Yeah, fuck it” in somewhere around episode 6 that I couldn’t even bear it anymore. Exactly there, actually.What I found incredibly hilarious is that this isn’t from any god-tier anime studio, right? So of course at some point I would get into this with low expectations when it comes to its animation department. However, this anime is incredibly skillful at how it grinded my gears due to how much trickery they put into it to the point it’s deceitful.We were served at the first episode with a fine animation between Azusa and the red dragon, which again not great but not terrible, and it went well as a first impression when we jumped into this. Further along, we have more characters introduced, and then came episode 4. That episode showed something. Out of nowhere, Azusa who always wanted to lay low and avoid conflicts at all costs, fights multiple dragons at once. Fine animation, but that’s like second in a row. So I imagined that if they keep this up, they’d certainly make this anime so much better just because of the animation alone. But that wasn’t the case, since they stopped doing that in the midway. What we’re witnessing in this series is a blue-balls waste of  our goddamn time. Gosh, I hoped the animators aren’t being paid less or something. That wouldn’t happen ever, in anime industry.Even with a carefully made soundtrack, it still didn’t help the fact that this show is becoming quite bland the more we’re getting into it. This whole thing is like a scam. It has good premise and promising plotline, but nothing happens. It has some better-than-average animation, but doesn’t deliver any more of it after. It wants to be better, but doesn’t know how and just fucking around in it.So, with all that explained, now it begs a question: Is this a good light-hearted anime? Well, yes.Nah, not really.I have to say, despite all the negative parts, this looks just like any other CGDCT anime, with its own appeal. For a lot of bad things in this show, I could not disregard the fact that a show about a female witch that lived for 300 years and killing only slimes for EXP gain does exists. It just sounds too good to be true that an isekai anime featuring an OP female character would ever be made on-screen instead of simply laying dormant in light novels. The premise sounds like something that is memorable and worth to recommend when you think about it. As I said, however, I made a mistake by thinking this would be like a slice-of-life with a little bit of adventure settings, like Itazura, or Somali, or Aria, or pehaps my favorite of all time, Girls’ Last Tour. Despite thinking this has potentials, it doesn’t go anywhere further than being a seasonal anime that not even God knows whether or not it would get season 2. It just feels like something that people would forget after watching it once yet still certainly worth the watch regardless.I used to watch lots of slice-of-life anime back when I was a young lad, like Azumanga Daioh, Kinmoza, Gochiusa, Yuru Yuri, Love Lab, Comic Girls, Hitori Bocchi, or even Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san and Senko-san. Even now, I’m still watching stuff like Yuru Camp (very discreetly, of course). Among others, lots of my enjoyment revolves around slice-of-life CGDCT. I think there’s something about that genre which brings me to a peaceful and safest space, but in the midst of it also kept on reminding me that there is more to this genre than simply just escaping to my comfort zone all the time.Which is why I tried to invest my time into Slime 300, because  it looks special. Not only it’s a slice-of-life, it’s also a fantasy adventure. Not a lot of these can come out succeeded in doing so; maybe that isekai spider anime Kumoko, but honestly I thought this one has much better prospects. I feel like there hasn’t been any anime with slice-of-life fantasy adventure where the main character is an overpowered female. Omnipotent Saint, which is the closest we have for such anime in this season, might be the example, but honestly it is far from being an action adventure, despite it being a fantasy anime.For what it’s worth, let’s just put it in a perspective where we as the viewerbase watched this with a grain of salt and ask more questions: Is this worth the watch? Can ‘I’ get invested in it? Is this recommendable? The answer is: No, no, and probably.Exempli gratia: Girls’ Last Tour is an easy-going anime about a couple of girls making their way on a nomadic journey in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity almost extinct. Slime 300 is also an easy-going one, but revolving around a reincarnated woman from another world who lived for hundreds of years while becoming a slime-kill exp-gaining witch.Remember when I said that CGDCT is an anime genre where you dive into our own comfort zone? That’s what I had from Girls’ Last Tour: it did so while also being opposite of that at the same time. Almost like watching Gakkougurashi without it being too dreary and grim. There is a part of Slime 300 that brought me hope that it would be something more than a mere slice-of-life. It challenges the viewers. Maybe the closest I could have when it comes to a slice-of-life with the same trope is Nagatoro from the current season, but I haven’t made a review for that one yet. What with all it has offered, like animation, or fantasy settings, or the well-done soundtrack, I felt like Slime 300 could have done more than just being how half-hearted they are.I have to say, this is such a good breath of fresh air. An anime about female main character who knows what she’s doing is something I’ve always looked for, especially those in unfamiliar settings. However, I just hope that this genre will have a better chance, whether it’s outside of this poorly-handled series or perhaps in the next installment of this series if the sequel is ever confirmed. I genuinely wish that the industry in this particular genre would look at this as some sort of inspiration and perhaps bring a better light into it. Now excuse me while I’m getting the fuck out of here to enjoy my unironical Viper the Rapper playlist since that’s definitely much more indulging than whatever this weird anime is. strong advice for you.RUN.Run for your life.Keep on running and don’t look back.My greatest mistake was thinking that I’d lower down my standard and going into this expecting something nice, like Itazura, or perhaps something more chill like Honzuki no Gekokujou (Ascendance of a Bookworm), which then I regretfully realized half of the series later that this isn’t even remotely like either of those. This ain’t it. In fact, remarkably, it’s lower than either. Even after comparing it to any fantasy anime with woman MC, I still couldn’t wrap my head around this one.Like all good things in seasonal anime series, Slime 300 (for short of ""Slime Taoshite 300-nen, Shiranai Uchi ni Level Max ni Nattemashita""; tl: ""I\'ve Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level"")  has a little bit of good premise out of it in the first episodes, around half-cour I’d say, to show the audience that this has a little bit of something for everyone. Nevertheless, almost nothing if not none had been delivered in the midway.Warning: SPOILERS, et cetera.Perhaps the one part that had me the most is that sequence in the first episode where Azusa (the MC) makes her battle debut and fights a dragon as a witch where the animators showcase a potentially cool and smoothly drawn action sequences. Three episodes later after that, I was served. But to say that I was served is the same as me asking for the most expensive recommended dish accompanied with the best wine present in the most luxurious French cuisine restaurant, only somehow to be given BTS meal instead. Not what I asked for, but hey, I’ll take it since I’m hungry enough and I can box them up for home because I certainly won’t eat that shit at a resto. Based upon this, you can pretty much assume what kind of taste I have in this slice-of-life anime stuff: not great, but not terrible.That’s basically how it all started. Everytime one of these seasonal show came out, the concept would somewhat be interesting enough to invest to at first glance: Somehow Azusa died after overworking herself and somehow her physical form transferred herself into a fantasy world where somehow she decided to take this new reincarnated life experience as a new opportunity to create her new self into being an isolating lone-wolf witch. Henceforth, living her daily life by killing slimes every single day for 300 years straight and getting away with it somehow. And she didn’t get bored in all those 300 years of doing the same shit over and over again. Somehow.What I like about Azusa is how she decided out of the blue to make peace with what she had to become and settled down to make a living of her own and for her own. All in all while killing slimes for 300 years, which would’ve been either funnier or cooler depending on how they would care to elaborate on this peculiar monotonous behaviour of slimes-killing Azusa to get to know her better and perhaps have a little more perspective on how she did all this without slowly losing her absolute state of human sanity. Needless to say, they went with “extraordinarily immortal human” trope and shrugged it off.I think what surprises me the most is the voice actress behind Azusa is literally Aoi Yuuki herself.

They have a good development and the first episode is great. However in the second episode and forward things got weird.The slime daughters plot was okay and sure a cast with four characters have space for development, but I noticed the huge amount of characters in the OP and there would be more joining them soon. So yeah, episode 3 came throwing Laika into the corner and giving us a Walking Tits character with an overload...of fanservice scenes. And episode 4 and the rest is more of it.In conclusion, there is no story. There is no conflict, and when there is it's solved right away. It's simple enough to be a kids' show, but if that was the case I wouldn't be making a review out of this. The amount of sexual referrences makes it not be suitable for children either.And there's queerbaiting of course. Walking Tits is there with random scenes of advancements on the protagonist and teasing, that are just to show her boobs bouncing. This anime doesn't even develop the characters' relationships. Laika is not even Azusa's friend or apprentice, they barely talk and she acts like a maid all the time. The daughters are there for fluff just like the rest, because nothing happens. All the plots that would make this an actual story are discarded.I feel like I dodged a bullet. What a waste of time. of fanservice scenes. And episode 4 and the rest is more of it.In conclusion, there is no story. There is no conflict, and when there is it's solved right away. It's simple enough to be a kids' show, but if that was the case I wouldn't be making a review out of this. The amount of sexual referrences makes it not be suitable for children either.And there's queerbaiting of course. Walking Tits is there with random scenes of advancements on the protagonist and teasing, that are just to show her boobs bouncing. This anime doesn't even develop the characters' relationships. Laika is not even Azusa's friend or apprentice, they barely talk and she acts like a maid all the time. The daughters are there for fluff just like the rest, because nothing happens. All the plots that would make this an actual story are discarded.I feel like I dodged a bullet. What a waste of time."", 'This show is Hollow. It is slice of life, with wonderful characters. No real story, just events. The main character arguably lives the dream life, Immortal eternally youthful body, life is easy and she just relaxes and lives day to day.Every character that comes along can either be helped or appreciated by the main character. There is no danger at any time. She can one hit the Demon Lord, and can solve everything. If you are looking for something other than CGDCT(Cute Girls Doing Cute Things), you will most likely not really find it here. There is a debate on whether it is yuri,...or not. It is probably(Definitely) Yuribait, but cannonicaly they are all just Adopted ""Sisters/Family/Children"" which is good in my opinion.I found myself at around episode 7 realizing that the show was not very fun for me. You will for sure get a few laughs maybe every episode or two.If I had to give any one gripe about it, it would be that the villains follow a theme... Rather the show follows a theme. It paints women as great, and Men as generally bad. Not in an overbearing way I think. It is just that Out of all the men characters that have speaking roles, only 2 were not villains and I am not sure that they even had more than one scene each. I will admit there is not really a Villain of the week situation but men are Portrayed Poorly in this anime. Even if they are not the Villain they are usually given bad character traits that affect people negatively.(Sure elf is clumsy, but in a good way, Sure Demon lord is tricksy, but in a good way) In fact the only female villain in the show, gets a ""redemption arc"" almost immediately and she is brought into the family, which is good.--There is no Yin and yang in this show, there is only Yin. --I am not saying there needs to be romance, or recurring male characters but They really should try to balance it out as it seems unnatural. Make some of the villains Women. Maybe make some of the people they interact with men, without them being Negative entities either in personality, or action. Honestly it just seems like Mediocre writing, or intentionally leading a group by their nosering and expecting people to like it, As you would have to have a fetish to miss it. I know that they are not really representing men, but at what point does it become insulting to us?----I think it was the Pig Bar scene.... Though sadly there are people out there who enjoy that. It would be funnier to me if it was less true about so many people. Not that I was personally offended, just a stray thought When I got to that scene.That being said, Art is wonderful, Main cast of Characters are all 10/10 art and personality and you should like them all unless one just grates on your nerves, I did personally think that they are all wonderful. The show was a bit slow paced, and in fact when I read the Novel years ago I stopped reading it because it felt slow, and unenthralling, and that kind of was alleviated by the Anime Format, as far as I am concerned if you are interested in the ""Story"" the Anime is the way to go with this one, and the studio did a great job with the overall quality of this one.That being said there was never a point where I wanted to stop watching the show, it never did anything outright bad. What this show does it does well, and it avoids doing anything to absolutely ostracize itself from the watcher.TLDRI generally really Like Fantasy stories so I gave it a good go and watched all 12 episodes and will probably try and watch season two, but if you are not Specifically into CGDCT, Slice Of life(Sub Genre: Where everything goes right), or Yuribait I would recommend against it as it was Barely humorous enough to me to warrant a comedy tag, and not Fantasy Enough to ring that bell for me. 5/10 or not.

Episodes skip around LN and for some reason they always left out the best parts. All the stuff that actually makes this series fun are not in the anime.My biggest regret... THEY SKIPPED THE WHOLE STORYLINE WITH ZOMBIE CAT GIRL GAMER. And absolutelly murdered music festival arc - they only put like 50% of it...in anime which turned one of the best LN arcs into the most boring anime episode.It's not that bad, vibe is great and overall it still is pretty enjoyable.

I don\'t say rating stories is a bad idea, I say that this standard leads most slice of...life shows to be underrated, for proof, I call this review section where there\'s definitely some morons complaining about story in a slice of life.Rant done, now I can talk about the anime itself. Slime Taoshite 300-nen, Shiranai Uchi ni Level Max ni Nattemashita has a pretty misleading title. While the main character did spend 300 years killing slimes, it all happens off-screen. Instead, you are met with a semi-episodic anime where you get our main character, Asuza Aizawa discover your average fantasy world after spending little time outside for 300 years.Each episode, you get an introduction of a new cute anime girl, sometimes more, and you get Asuza to bond with them until they become a recurring character, or they come back to their business and will maybe re-appear in another episode.The characters themselves, well they\'re pretty average, while their design is very good, and is pretty much the driving factor in whether or not you wish to co tinue the anime, and the voice actors are also not to be trifled with, well, they really don\'t have much character to back it up and will be relegated to eye candy for you to pick your best girl and fight for her until you die for her cause (Rosalie best girl, I\'ll fight you).Slime 300 is not for everyone, it really isn\'t entry level slice of life due to its lack of substance, and it strays off the isekai genre\'s beaten path into the ""slice of life isekai"" subgenre that has recently been developing, so don\'t think you will enjoy this just because you are easily satisfied by isekai. I would only advise this anime if you have a decent amount of slice of life anime under your belt that you enjoyed, I don\'t want to see someone else complain about how the action was lacking and the battles had no stakes, or that the MC is too overpowered for anything interesting to happen.

It's a really comfortable kind of show, where nothing too surprising ever happens and you're free to just enjoy the somewhat comedic premise and the interactions between characters. Sometimes all I want from a comedy anime is to laugh at simplistic jokes that rely on established genre tropes and standard comedy situations. Putting it in a fantasy universe with an immortal witch that kills slimes for 300 years like an autist doing endless daily quests in WoW is just flavor text on an otherwise simple family sitcom.It's a little silly how her family keeps...growing every episode to include at least one of every fantasy race but they lampshaded it so I think that makes it okay, right? A couple of the running gags were alright like teleporting the demon lord into their bath and basically forcing her into whatever menial task they have at the time or anything involving the ghost girl, she was pretty funny.Overall it's a fairly simple isekai and a good watch for isekai trash fans like myself who just can't help falling prey to the brain parasite that is modern seasonal anime. 8/10 growing every episode to include at least one of every fantasy race but they lampshaded it so I think that makes it okay, right?

You feel like you are placed within the crew and you're having adventures with them. Every cast member is valued and loved and there is a real bond with the characters who are unique in their own way.Animation is outstanding, there are even fight scenes with amazing choreography....The colour scheme for the animation is bright and wholesome, a world I would love to live in. The characters designs are crisp and clean.Voice actors did an incredible job, absolotely hilarious and wholesome. The sound effects are amazing the opening is unique.Every character is great and is centred around the MC and dynamics are brilliant and the way they interact is amazing,I was on anime burnout and I struggled to complete a 12 episode series but after watching this I completed the show and I was sad that it ended. I enjoyed every episode, you can watch this show once a couple days or by binging and you will still find enjoyment.Overall, this anime wants me to be transported to another world to live a slow and easy life killing slimes for 300 years and go on wholesome adventures.

If you want an insanely deep show from an isekai or is all about fighting this is not going to be your show, it has some fighting but it's nowhere near the focus and it's not very deep.

The sound and art are very good imo and with 1 episode stories it's a very simple show to binge except for the fact it usually adds a new character nearly every episode.

I've seen a good amount of Isekai at this point and for every 10 bad ones there's one good one. However, this one is EASILY the worst of them, i fully understand that this show is just meant to be a mediocre slice of life but it fails at that too. every single one of the characters are flat, they're so boring on their own that they introduce a new one just about every episode. the comedy is terrible, like absolutely not funny its just cringeworthy. we can also address...the fact that this is really not an Isekai, i mean they skip 300 years into the future almost immediately into the show, the main character doesn't seem to recall not being from the world she is in currently at all and it doesn't play a part in the show either. if there is one thing this show did right it's having a predominately female character list and not oversexualizing them, other than that there is nothing at all, if you want slice of life, there's a thousand other ones and just about any one of them would be better than this. if you want Isekai, this is hardly even relative to that genre. if you want action, just about all of the possibility for it was skipped in the 300 year time leap besides a few super uninteresting duels. I tried very hard to finish this show but i am going to drop it because i gave it every chance to get better and it's just more disappointing as it goes on. i would never recommend this show to anyone, in fact i wrote this, my first and probably only review, to try and save people the waste of time that this show is. the fact that this is really not an Isekai, i mean they skip 300 years into the future almost immediately into the show, the main character doesn't seem to recall not being from the world she is in currently at all and it doesn't play a part in the show either. if there is one thing this show did right it's having a predominately female character list and not oversexualizing them, other than that there is nothing at all, if you want slice of life, there's a thousand other ones and just about any one of them would be better than this. if you want Isekai, this is hardly even relative to that genre. if you want action, just about all of the possibility for it was skipped in the 300 year time leap besides a few super uninteresting duels.

Never in my life seen it in real life, very random as such and rare to see this kind of incident. After that, you reincarnated, you get to...be a witch that becomes immortal like Skips. Ok, probably a fine way of living a better life? Well, that’s not gonna work well even if you guys tried to think of that way. After that you just do your daily routine as Asuza for 300 years just to kill slimes, you become OP like Maple or Yuna. WTF, this is like a Gamer’s grind in Warzone but actually physically doing it. Literally the weirdest plot to ever see in an anime, besides Tatoeba last dungeon. The ending of this anime is quite off, showing just the anime ending without a 2-3 minute credits while the anime is playing, an example of that problem would be Super Cub. It would be fine if there is a short part after the ending like what “The Aquatope of white sand” does.Artstyle is always the same as usual. Not gonna complain with that and there’s nothing even unique at all.Sound is a mix of good and bad. The good sight there is the Peaceful, cute sounds, and fantasy music. The thing that is unsettling for me is the opening, which really is weird and a way to start off an anime episode. I like the ending, very active and does play similarily to Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear’s opening having the bright mood and hearing the same singer and voice, which is Azumi Waki also both voicing Fina in Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear and Flatorte in this slime anime.Speaking of Flatorte, which I will be asking about the Characters, she’s probably the only ok comedic character in this series and the best one IMO, besides Halkara and Beelzebub, but Halkara is quite worse because of the personality and getting drunk that easily and Beelzebub is literally just a plain badass, proably has more motivation than Azusa, which is the Main of the anime, not only she’s a witch but is literally just a mix of other characters with aesthetics and OP characteristics like Elaina, Maple, Yuna, Lloyd, and Saitama. As for Shalsa and Falfa, they are fine characters, but they don’t play really well while trying to be cute besides episode 10 with their singing or episode 9 where Falfa is an actual slime like Rimuru. Rosalie is meh, but doesn’t add much personality to it besides one in episode 8 where she shouts at the lousy drunk men. Laika is a weird one almost, because this feels like she always flirts at Azusa and being treated like a real pet. There’s even a yuri moment there, which is unsettling.

I really recommend this if you're interested on those partVary characters also with vary species, seems kinda adding some enjoyment point because its balancing slow/calming pace into kinda normal-fast pace because every character has its own disadvantage / problems itself.~[Cons]~If you're looking...for heavy / well-built story. I guess this Anime wont get your expected chart.

Of course, this plan is ruined (as anime usually goes), and it follows a different path with the same mindset. The story isn\'t much, but it is rather cozy and relaxing, which isn\'t...common in most isekai animes that follow the adventure and action genre. This anime is very cute and doesn\'t take itself seriously, which benefits it well.The characters are this anime strongpoint, as they are all so vivid and cute. Each of them has its own unique styles and flaws, which help them work well off of each other. However, this only applies to the main cast, as the background characters and rest of the world seem dull and lazy.

There are some scenes where things look weird and off, but it isn\'t much to cause a disturbance.Overall, this is a cute and relaxing anime.

You know I almost didn\'t watch this because of the terrible title and isekai premise. Slime 300 in reality, after you get past the lousy first impression of a first episode, a damned good fantasy SoL that actually makes good use of its isekai premise.Slime 300 is a fantasy-themed Slice of Life with Azusa and her growing family. The interactions with her and her family and friends, especially with her two daughters are...downright adorable and make you warm and fuzzy inside. The isekai theming actually works well with the SoL as Azusa reinforces the theme of the importance of relaxing and taking breaks from overwork, so kudos to sticking to the theme. Azusa as a character works great as an anchor to reality and general tsukkomi to everyone else\'s antics, which complements her retorts and status as a foil to the greater cast. Each episode spotlights a different character or group cast, and the pacing works well from episode to episode. Part of the reason why the comedy is so strong is because the characters are all so likable, especially when they surprise you with someone like Pecora in terms of her character archetype being subverted from helpless cute girl to surprisingly devious.And if there\'s anything, the show has Hibiki (Symphogear) punching Nanoha (Nanoha), so there\'s that wish fulfillment for me.8/10 downright adorable and make you warm and fuzzy inside.

But not entire episodes.""A cute girl is a immortal witch that lives 300 years killing slimes and begins to create a \'harem\' for herself by mistake but is not ecchi at all!?~ OM-..."" this is where I would stab the person who is shouting that.Beginning ThoughtsSo forth most, I\'ll say this that I love Isekai series. Each one is...unique in their way and a few are good. However a lot of problems I see is that they begin to go stale with the same repetitive styles and just fall off the face of the earth. (Never finishing.) With that, I am only glancing at this series hoping to enjoy this like other series. And at first I did, but as the episodes went on. I\'ve begun to see a few things that the series just repeated and nothing new/interesting happened. Because of this, my personal rating for the series dropped over time and I was almost ready to give this series up at episode 9. But as I\'m writing this, I\'m watching episode 10 and gonna say screw it and finish the series just to see if the last few episodes change my mind. For the first few episodes the series caught my interest mostly by it\'s beautiful art, music/sound and well... sadly that\'s it. Every Isekai series has it\'s own way of starting and this one is no different. Let it be death from overwork(which the series did), getting run over by truck-san, murdered by a random dude running through the streets, or getting absorbed into the game your working on. With that in mind I sat back, turned on my Isekai mood and begun to watch. And the series did have a few hooks that latched onto me and kept me watching.. however after the third episode, these hooks were nothing more then cheap plastic compared to other Isekai\'s. Reason so will be told down below in each category I\'ll be making.Characters (3/10)For most, this entire series is focus around female characters only. You will only see one movable and well speaking male and that\'s the mayor of the town. You see him once or twice. After that, all males in the series are bland images that don\'t move. Besides that, lets get into the characters.. and IMO, this series had only one decent character and that\'s Beelzebub. Now now before you begin freaking out and down-voting the review I\'ll tell you why. With Azusa, she is an worker from a black company that dies, with this, she is tossed into another world and well given everything she desired and that\'s it.. she doesn\'t grow over time, doesn\'t show any well supportive acts to any other member and every challenge thrown her way, is fixed by another character or she just wildly throws her fists about. Ok, bland main character cool. Off to the others...Laika - A tone down version of Tooru dragonmaid ripoff. She appears once episode to fight Azusa because Azusa is the strongest witch in the lands (Max level). In doing so, she gets beaten rather easily but through the fight she accidentally breaks Azusa\'s home and in turn. Becomes her servant, going to repair the home, make meals and just always following Azusa around. That\'s her entire character, she hasn\'t changed one bit from the first episode she arrives into the series.Halkara - A dense, clumsy, big titty elf gal. That\'s all you need to know and that\'s how the series play her out. She\'s a herbalist that manages to create energy drinks. She keeps messing up every time the show gives her a chance to do anything and she misjudges everything. Thinking people are trying to kill her/get her. But really no one is.Falfa & Shalsha - The cute twin loli sisters that don\'t do nothing but be cute and are there. The show had an interesting concept on the go that over the years and from all the dead slimes, these two little ones were born. One being completely innocent and only seeing Azusa being her mother. While the other is on pure desire of revenge for all the slimes that were killed. Which was cool, but after just a little talk or so. The second one just becomes all innocent and that\'s it.Flatorte - The opposite of Laika, being a blue dragon. She is aggressive and hates red dragons. Hmm.. red vs blue.. Hmm... being a jealous of the red dragons and well herself not having been wedded. She tries to crash a wedding and fight the red dragons. But after being defeated with such ease! She becomes submissive and just quietly stand in the background like the other characters at times. The show tries to show a bit of character development but then just. Pop, back to standing in the back.Rosalie - Seriously.. in my opinion, this show didn\'t need her. She\'s just some human that died and became a spirit. She shows a bit of struggles of nobility and doesn\'t want to be a part of it and in the end dies and just haunts a factory that the elf girl wants to buy. But the series wants to save her and she becomes a part of this kinda flimsy poor family the show had slapped together.Beelzebub - Where do I begin with her? First off, she\'s part of the demon empire. Being a high-ranking demon. She has her connections with the Demon Lord and in turn has one of the best personalities, even through the show is trying to keep push her down in the background character lane. Whenever something goes wrong, Azusa and the group looks to her. She\'s there to help but also has her personal goals in the background. (Aka wanting to fight Azusa again which she manages too later in the series). There is a few weird moments with her but besides that in my opinion, the best out of everyone.Pecora - Loli Demon Lord... that is all I need to say really. Ahh she was kinda of a disappointment. I\'m getting sick of seeing loli characters being in \'high power\'. Being in the writers or studious shoes and just thinking of them saying. ""You know what would be funny! If the Demon Lord was a small girl that looks super young but is thousands of years old!"" No not really. It\'s stupid and doesn\'t give the character a fitting image of them being a demon lord. You think demon lord and you imagine a massive being with power, but instead. Demon Loli girl. ""But but she does have massive power!"" You mean the terrible Dragon Ball Z speed and power? Meh. Another character in my opinion the series didn\'t need to focus on or even make.Music/Sound/Art (6.5/10)I\'ll make this short and to me, the music is good at a lot of moments in the series, there needs to be tension. The show would either play something or simply go quiet for the moment. Needs to be colourful and a laugh. It will have upbeat music and just pleasant in general. And the sounds, the strange goofy noises made when a character is doing something. Like growling noises coming from someone\'s stomach is cute at the first few episodes, but grows really old and boring halfway through the series. If they had removed the weird vocal noises. I think the entire music/sound would be at a really high rating for me.The series has amazing art for such a mediocre series. It\'s beautiful and bright, the environments are clean. The towns and cities are good. It\'s a shame it was worked on so much for this kind of series.Plot (2/10)There is none.... at all. Each episode is given a small problem, which in turn seems to fix itself in a way. New character having a problem? Well lets talk about it. Do a small montage and it\'s fixed! Ta daaa!~ That\'s it. There is no growing plot over the series. Not major conflict at all. This series is nothing more then, lets watch a poor girl\'s only family live and do strange things at times.Final ThoughtsMy final thoughts on this series is that if your looking for a decent and I mean average anime to play int he background and to glance at every so often but not fully watch. This would be it. It\'s not amazing and not bad. There is to many terrible characters slapped together and there is no proper connections to well make them seem like a family. The writer is the only reason these characters are a \'family\'. You can easily replace Azusa with any bland generic character and the series wouldn\'t change one bit. Scratch that, you can replace every character in the \'family\' with normal villagers from the town and it wouldn\'t change the series at all. Thinking about it right now. I would have preferred to see the every day life of just a villager instead of watching Azusa and her crew of misfits.

When I heard slimes, I was exited for a comedy anime, and wasn't disappointed.The story was very cute with many loveable characters and a nice flow. A well deserved reincarnation with many years of peace before enjoying her new life of craziness.The many characters was well used and a fun dynamic together. Nothing to crazy with many cute moments. The mix was a great way to keep the slice of life style even when they were around there own house.I...found this anime to be a very good slice of life isekai with some fun and funny moments done very well.

I think this is a great one off kind of anime but could do fine with a S2."", 'Slime 300 is nothing exceptional; it is a very typical slice of life and CGDCT anime. It follows the story of Aizawa Azusa, who is isekai’ed into a new world and lives a peaceful life. Throughout the season, she eventually meets more and more people due to various circumstances explained in each episode. The anime shows Azusa living with these characters and shows their daily lives together.From this, and the written synopsis, it is obvious that this formula is pretty generic: the main character died in the world we live in (“real world”), got transported into another world by a god or someone equivalent, and...lives a different life than the one they left behind. However, for some reason, something about this anime clicked with me. It’s lighthearted (without little drama) and relaxing, which is definitely the vibe the anime is trying to portray. If you have watched SoL and CGDCT before and like this genre, this is definitely an instant recommendation. The story’s formula isn’t something new, but it works. Each character has their own charm and works well together (as portrayed).(Story - 7. Characters - 7)Art (7):I did say this anime is not exceptional. This includes the art. The character models are simplistic, and so is the background. The production value is not high; it is very normal for anime in this genre. I’m biased, so the score is higher than it should be.Sound (8):I found the OST fitting for the anime’s setting. It takes place in, minor spoiler, the countryside. The music fits and utilizes instruments that would portray this setting. OP&ED are good and portrays a playful-ness to the beginning and ending of each episode.The voice actors casted for this anime fits their respective roles well and adds to the character personalities. It helps that the VAs are popular and have starred in other popular works.I also love the little sound effects they use in each episode. It adds to the comedic factor and inadvertently makes me smile every time.Overall/Enjoyment (9):I kept on re-watching each episode during some of the down times I had. I didn’t want to watch another episode from the same season, so I end up turning to this for some light entertainment in the background. In fact, as I am writing this review, I’m watching this in the background for some entertainment. Simply put, it is very enjoyable for me to watch (bold the “for me” part.

Slice of Life anime aren't really my thing, neither are isekai. Somehow I still enjoyed it so much. The characters are all unique with cute and funny personalities. MC is really kind and even tho she's lazy she's still willing to help anyone who needs it. It's really nice to see how she's warming up to people and starting a family. There aren't any major event happening so there isn't any tension building up, which is the reason why it's so relaxing.

It follows the ""cute girls doing cute things"" formula....A bit overlooked this season. A bit overlooked this season.', 'Man, talk about squandered potential. This series is seriously losing me; it\'s the definition of a 6. It can\'t decide if it wants to have a plot or not, it\'s taken over half the season just to introduce all of the characters, and when it tries to have fights they somehow lack both impact AND comedy (think One Punch Man, but without the wit). It started with promise, and it\'s just not really gone much of anywhere since. It\'s a fine way to waste 30 minutes, but it\'s not really fulfilling, and I guarantee a lot of the people leaving good reviews now won\'t remember...it by the end of next season.First and foremost, I appreciate the novelty of an isekai MC whose power comes solely from modest work over a long period of time -- particularly as a result of having a previous life that was full of overworked weeks. I also acknowledge that if we were shown much more of the titular 300 years of grinding than we already were, it would have been insufferable. I can\'t really fault it for opting for a time skip, as a result. And, for what it\'s worth, the opening premise of a witch being exposed as being max-level and having to deal with constant intrusions from others is interesting. The first three characters we meet -- Laika, a red dragon, and two twin slimes -- had genuinely interesting motivations for seeking out our MC.These motivations were quickly swept under the rug, however, in order to introduce the rest of Azusa\'s pseudo-yuri harem. In fact, as a harem anime, it\'s pretty lousy. We\'ve seen one major interaction with every character so far, and then they all just sorta fall into the background by the episode after they were introduced so that Azusa can focus on the new girl-of-the-week\'s starter quest. Sure, some of the plotlines of these are entertaining, but many are just...lackluster. They mostly just serve to take up precious time that most *good* harem animes would spend developing the characters via their interactions with one another. As a result, the characters tend to feel a bit one-dimensional, reduced only to a few, surface-level traits that dictate their abilities and how they tend to talk to others. When you\'re constantly shuffling off the new girl to make way for whoever\'s next, you\'re bound to have flat and/or shallow characters. There\'s a reason why manga doesn\'t tend to spend several chapters in a row just introducing everyone -- no one wants to just constantly meet new characters while watching the old ones sit around doing nothing. I can\'t imagine why they decided that was the right way to do things with the anime adaptation.I\'d give the series props for at least daring to show girl-on-girl romantic affection more boldly than most series do, but it still ends up with an air of...baitiness about it. There\'s always plausible deniability, and it\'ll doubtlessly go nowhere interesting with any characters, so if you\'re in it for the yuri, you\'d be better served elsewhere. (I\'ll admit, though, I did enjoy her fight with and subsequent pseudoromantic conquest of the demon lord.)As it stands, 7 episodes in, it\'s just been a formulaic series of introductions that make all the characters feel one-note, and which (for the most part) lack any sense of impact or meaning when Azusa can essentially just hand-wave away most issues. It\'s not that there aren\'t good moments here and there, or unique or novel concepts -- it\'s just that the main framework of the show so far is lacking in direction or purpose.They clearly wanna show off our MC\'s powers, because they really put effort into making the magic look pretty. It\'s just that most of the fights she participates in feel inconsequential and out-of-place, ending in mere moments, and they just contribute to the mounting sensation that the show doesn\'t really know what it wants to be. If she\'s gonna be godlike in power, why include fights in any serious capacity? Just go for the witty, ""Ugh, can\'t believe I have to put up with this,"" OHKO to get the new character into her harem, and move on to spending the last half of the episode letting the characters interact. If, conversely, it\'s actually supposed to be about the way she bests a neverending wave of challengers who\'ve heard about her power, then put more effort into the fights; make them stand out, or make it seem like she actually has to TRY. As it stands, there\'s no effort being put into developing character relationships, and there\'s no effort being put into exhibiting the MC\'s accumulated power in interesting ways. It\'s just half-assed on all fronts, pulling itself apart in all directions -- a jack of all trades, but a master of none.Now, a lot of people who enjoy this series are probably going to read all that and say something along the lines of, ""It\'s not supposed to be engaging, it\'s supposed to be comfy! Don\'t go into it expecting much, and you\'ll enjoy it!"" That argument seems to be confusing ""comfy"" anime with anime where nothing happens. Let\'s compare it to one of the most infamously comfy anime around -- Yuru Camp. Like Slime Taoshite, it\'s also contains beautiful scenery and an all-female main cast. Also like Slime Taoshite, it\'s a very formulaic series wherein every episode centers itself around the same basic elements (travel secenes, camping scenes, and cooking scenes). The difference between the two -- the reason I actually find myself enjoying the comfy experience of Yuru Camp -- is that those scenes are used to actually enrich our understanding of the characters and their relationships with one another. Seeing those girls become better friends, and uncovering more sides to their personalities as you go, encourages the viewer to reminisce on all their own childhood friendships and travel experiences to give us that cozy and nostalgic feeling. It may be slice-of-life, but those slices *reveal* more about the characters and engage the audience.Slime Taoshite, on the other hand, centers its framework on just getting a new girl through the rotating door every week. Whenever there *are* attempts to show the current cast doing something together, they\'re wasted by just reinforcing what we already know about each character. There\'s no development -- you don\'t feel like you\'re getting to know these people and see their found family dynamic grow and take hold. Laika\'s loyal, Halkara\'s clumsy, Shalsha\'s kuudere, Beelzebub is the straight-man... No one seems to have any desire to get to know anyone else better, and like I previously mentioned, for characters who are supposed to be learning from Azusa, they don\'t seem very interested in self-improvement. None of the activities they undertake reveal anything new about the characters after their initial introduction. It\'s a cycle of endless monotony.Hey, at least it looks pretty damn good, right? Well, yes, it does. The scenery is, as I briefly mentioned before, beautifully drawn, and the animation of the lackluster fights and hand-wave-y uses of magic is admittedly gorgeous a lot of the time. The character designs are on the whole balanced (i.e.: not over-the-top or gaudy) but also memorable, though some of them do sit a bit weird with me. Aside from the visual aspect, though, things could be better. The voice acting is up-and-down, with the ghost girl\'s voice actor in particular being a bit sub-par in my opinion. It just doesn\'t always sound confident, as if they were still workshopping it when they had to record their lines. Oh well, these things happen.What annoys me much more than the occasionally mediocre VA, though, are the OP and ED songs. Moe whisper-singing is played-out in the first place, and it\'s hard to get right even if it wasn\'t. When you couple it with a jumpy, unsure-of-itself melody, its pitfalls as a singing style become increasingly apparent. It doesn\'t happen that the frantic metre and half-rapped sections just open it up to comparisons with the seiyuu\'s other current-season series, ""Kumo desu ga, nani ka?"", whose chaotic yet powerful EDs just show that the seiyuu is capable of a delivery that is much superior to what\'s on display in this show\'s OP. Similarly, the ED of Slime Taoshite -- which is a much better composition to begin with -- is kneecapped by the edition of some wholly unnecessary autotune that is just intrusive enough to make this supposedly wholesome ballad seem ingenuine and overproduced -- which I suppose is fitting for a series that\'s suffers as a result of being overproduced. It\'s doubly a shame because the seiyuu\'s delivery is much improved, with a fuller tone and some nice vibrato here and there, but it\'s hard to notice under the completely soul-erasing pitch correction. There\'s a time and place for autotune, and this was *not* it. Let Myth&Roid handle the autotune work, and leave your lead seiyuu\'s excellent performance alone.So, in summation, Slime Taoshite seems to be an adaptation that can\'t help but to try to be too many different things at once, and as a result none of them turn out being all that well-executed. It\'s a time-waster show -- good for a few chuckles and some eye candy artwork, but if you try to engage with it as either a harem anime or challenge-of-the-week type of show (as it seems to want you to in alternating fashion), you\'ll be left disappointed. At least there are a lot of interesting concepts for fan works, I suppose. Thoroughly mediocre; just a ""fine"" series. it by the end of next season.First and foremost, I appreciate the novelty of an isekai MC whose power comes solely from modest work over a long period of time -- particularly as a result of having a previous life that was full of overworked weeks. I also acknowledge that if we were shown much more of the titular 300 years of grinding than we already were, it would have been insufferable. I can\'t really fault it for opting for a time skip, as a result. And, for what it\'s worth, the opening premise of a witch being exposed as being max-level and having to deal with constant intrusions from others is interesting. The first three characters we meet -- Laika, a red dragon, and two twin slimes -- had genuinely interesting motivations for seeking out our MC.These motivations were quickly swept under the rug, however, in order to introduce the rest of Azusa\'s pseudo-yuri harem. In fact, as a harem anime, it\'s pretty lousy. We\'ve seen one major interaction with every character so far, and then they all just sorta fall into the background by the episode after they were introduced so that Azusa can focus on the new girl-of-the-week\'s starter quest. Sure, some of the plotlines of these are entertaining, but many are just...lackluster. They mostly just serve to take up precious time that most *good* harem animes would spend developing the characters via their interactions with one another. As a result, the characters tend to feel a bit one-dimensional, reduced only to a few, surface-level traits that dictate their abilities and how they tend to talk to others. When you\'re constantly shuffling off the new girl to make way for whoever\'s next, you\'re bound to have flat and/or shallow characters. There\'s a reason why manga doesn\'t tend to spend several chapters in a row just introducing everyone -- no one wants to just constantly meet new characters while watching the old ones sit around doing nothing. I can\'t imagine why they decided that was the right way to do things with the anime adaptation.I\'d give the series props for at least daring to show girl-on-girl romantic affection more boldly than most series do, but it still ends up with an air of...baitiness about it. There\'s always plausible deniability, and it\'ll doubtlessly go nowhere interesting with any characters, so if you\'re in it for the yuri, you\'d be better served elsewhere. (I\'ll admit, though, I did enjoy her fight with and subsequent pseudoromantic conquest of the demon lord.)As it stands, 7 episodes in, it\'s just been a formulaic series of introductions that make all the characters feel one-note, and which (for the most part) lack any sense of impact or meaning when Azusa can essentially just hand-wave away most issues. It\'s not that there aren\'t good moments here and there, or unique or novel concepts -- it\'s just that the main framework of the show so far is lacking in direction or purpose.They clearly wanna show off our MC\'s powers, because they really put effort into making the magic look pretty. It\'s just that most of the fights she participates in feel inconsequential and out-of-place, ending in mere moments, and they just contribute to the mounting sensation that the show doesn\'t really know what it wants to be.

Just go for the witty, ""Ugh, can\'t believe I have to put up with this,"" OHKO to get the new character into her harem, and move on to spending the last half of the episode letting the characters interact. If, conversely, it\'s actually supposed to be about the way she bests a neverending wave of challengers who\'ve heard about her power, then put more effort into the fights; make them stand out, or make it seem like she actually has to TRY. As it stands, there\'s no effort being put into developing character relationships, and there\'s no effort being put into exhibiting the MC\'s accumulated power in interesting ways.

Of course it isn't.

It\'s a great example of one, but not recommended for people that dislike slice of life or are expecting a story here.Story: There isn\'t really one.  The protagonist, Azusa, has been reincarnated in a fantasy world as an immortal witch after dying of overwork in the real world.  The incredibly long title basically explains the rest of the premise.  Now that she\'s become powerful, she starts attracting attention from other powerful creatures, and invariably befriends them and adds them to her ""family""...of monster girls that live in her house.  Most episodes follow a simple formula of some new girl entering the story with a problem that only Azusa can solve, and the increasingly large cast coming together to solve it.  There\'s very little to it and if you aren\'t into slice of life, the lack of progression or overarching story will probably drive you crazy.  But it\'s always relaxing and cute, and that\'s the real goal here, not telling some complex or amazing story.Audio/Visual: Really great on both counts, but especially the sound.  The art usually looks just a little above average for what you would expect in 2021, but it quickly becomes clear that this is because they used their limited budget to absolutely animate the hell out of the very few action scenes in this show.  You will seriously be shocked at how they turn on the style for the big setpiece scenes, given how the show looks normally.  The audio is outstanding in every way, from the Aoi Yuuki-voiced Azusa leading a strong VA cast to the goofy fantasy background music to the legitimately excellent Kuku concert scene.  But the part that I really want to call attention to here is the sound effects.  In lieu of actual sound effects, they will often have someone simply saying the various onomatopoeias in words, like ""squish squish"" or ""sparkle sparkle"".  It\'s hard to express how incredibly funny this is in text, you really have to see it in action to get it, but it was legitimately one of my favorite parts of the series.  Whether it was the director or the sound editor or whoever thought that idea up, they are a genius for it.Characters: They\'re so good.  There honestly isn\'t a single bad character in Azusa\'s ""family"", and the only character I disliked at all was the loli demon lord Pecora (loli demon lords seem to be proliferating at an incredible rate across all of anime these days), and she\'s not even really in the series that much.  Beelzebub is my personal favorite character, but you can basically pick any of them as your favorite and it would be valid.  Azusa\'s slime daughters are so adorable that you\'ll need to reach for insulin.  Halkara\'s buffoonery is always entertaining.  Laika and Flatorte\'s fights over nothing are a great ongoing bit.  There\'s just so much to like here that it\'s hard to list it all.  If I had any complaint about it, it\'s that there are so many great and lovable characters that some of them get lost in the shuffle and don\'t get the focus that they probably deserve.  But having too many great characters is a good problem to have, all things considered.Overall, it\'s funny, it\'s cute, and it demands nothing of you.

However, this anime is at its core a light-hearted, refreshing fantasy.Azusa is a corporate slave who dies of overwork and is given the gift of immortality in a new fantasy world. Sounds like some god-power character who\'s going to be forced to save the world again. But nope! Azusa is determined to live an absolutely carefree life. We immediately timeskip to the endgame.As the name implies, 300 years later Azusa has...(accidentally) maxed out her level killing nothing but slimes everyday, thanks to a passive XP boost on every mob she kills. Given quantity over quality, it was inevitable.Slime Taoshite is best described as a set of easygoing stories where Azusa gets inevitably dragged into other people\'s problems, making new friends along the way. It\'s mostly just fun and games, since Azusa is literally an all-powerful, albeit slightly aloof, deity. At the end of the day, it\'s a rather boring story, but it\'s so light and fluffy it makes me smile.As the series goes on, the cast will fill up with a roster of colorful characters. The dynamic is a little clichéd, but is ultimately a happy experience and a welcome break to anyone who\'s been put off by other darker stories or unsatisfying series conclusions. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this innocent anime.If you are expecting a plot going into this... well, there isn\'t one. It\'s about as cohesive as a sketch comedy skit. This is not the sort of anime you binge; it is a casual watch. It\'s an anime you\'ll throw on when you\'re bored and really aren\'t in the mood for anything else. In all honesty, there isn\'t much value in finishing this series. If you forget about it despite being a few episodes in, it\'s okay to drop it. You won\'t be missing much.And yeah. Some of you are going to hate it. That\'s totally fine. You\'ll know for certain after watching the first or second episode whether you\'ll want to continue. But as a general rule of thumb, ask yourself this question before attempting this series: Are you the kind of person that could enjoy watching a kid\'s show if it had a decent plot? If yes, watch this. If not, proceed with caution.Just me ranting on the side (SPOILERS):*All of Azusa\'s new friends are non-human (or superhuman), long-lived races so they can match Azusa\'s immortality. Draconic, Elvish, Demonic, Spiritual...*It\'s a bubbly, all-girls club. There are literally zero male characters. I\'m seeing that this is becoming a trend recently. Focuses on friendship instead of inserting romantic distraction.* The whole concept of an RPG leveling system is referenced precisely once in the beginning to give the series its title. No one mentions leveling ever again. Quantitative measurement of one\'s power is dropped altogether, with Azusa subtly redefined from ""max level"" to just ""extremely powerful"".*Laika is an adorable bean who deserves all the head pats. I\'m also 90% certain she\'s crushing hard for Azusa.*Beelzebub apparently talks in an English, or at least very formal, accent (despite speaking in Japanese).

Like thirsty animals anime fans desperately search for new isekai to momentarily quench their thirst. They resort to licking the ground in sight of the slightest hope for salvation, only to small bits of success. How harrowing...However. In an age such as this, there is satisfaction to be found.This unnecessarily longed-named anime, which I will refer to as Slime Witch, was actually a pleasant surprise. Thankfully, this is one of the few instances where the anime adaptation of an isekai manga/light novel is much better...than it's 2D counterpart. Though the animation quality doesn't stand up to the likes of Tensai Shitara Slime or Youjo Senki, it manages to prove it's metal at being a generally funny fantasy slice of life.The story of Slime Witch is the basic black company office worker dying of overwork and being compensated by [insert deity] and being transported in another world with [insert skill] where the protagonist ends up being completely overpowered. The twist this time is... there is no twist? The main character Azusa is portrayed as the type of person that generally just wants to relax and live life as quietly as possible. Because of this, when asked what kind of skill she desired before transferring worlds, she obtained the ability to prevent her from aging. Using her new found freedom, Azusa sets up home next to a small village and lives life by hunting a couple dozen slimes a day and selling potions. After 300 years of chilling like this she finds out that her game-like status is maxed out, much to her chagrin. This is where the real story begins.The interesting thing about Slime Witch is that, rather than using the isekai trope as a tool to make a self insert power fantasy, it is used to set up the story of a fantasy protagonist that has no prior attachments to the world she lives in. Azusa being an office worker in another world was more like a backstory to justify her personality. As she meets various new beings in the world, she shows that her desire to life peacefully is overtaken by the delight of living with the new faces that mutually care for her as she does them. Making for an incredibly wholesome and funny experience.The sound and art are also not to be overlooked. Even though Slime Witch doesn't have the biggest budget put into its animation, it's not bad. There are generally some creative and expressive motions all around and some of the fights are given exiting touches, even if most of them are slideshows. The setting and character designs make up for that however, the bright and cute designs paired up with the beautiful sky and natural landscape make for a pleasant experience. Slime Witch's ost is generally the same quality as the animation, making it a nice fit for the the show. The op on the other hand is actually incredible. It perfectly captures the show and sets up the relaxing and cute tone of the episode making it my second favorite of the season behind Pink Blood.Another good surprise is the comedy. The jokes landed all the way through, never becoming over saturated or too predictable. Combined with its cute animation and design, the voice acting and script accel at giving the characters depth and personality. The only exception would be the slime twins, but they get a pass for being the cute kids.In a season that started off amazing, this was one of the few shows that I ended up sticking around watching the day it aired. Don't watch it if you dislike slice of life or writing that focuses on being cute. 8/10 than it's 2D counterpart.

Saturdays are often really engaging and intense, especially this spring\'s anime lineup, watching this was a nice breather before I get into the more action anime in the morning.The story was pretty slow, not much went on, and it\'s a relaxing ride down a witch and her ""honorary"" family just living their own lives, with only a few exciting moments from time...to time, definitely something you don\'t see in many series like this in modern anime. I like how they kept on introducing various notable characters, showing how diverse they are in terms of what they\'re like and how they get along with Azusa once they meet her, showing how colorful the cast is in terms of personality.The animation itself was simple, nothing too exciting, yet respectable animation, the character design was creative. From a couple of dragon girls to demon girls with features that set them apart from simple humans, while two characters, the slime twins reminded me of Rimuru from That Time I Got Reincarnated As a Slime, but they tried to make them diverse from that character.In terms of its worldbuilding, it was decent, it mainly took place in one area, but in a few episodes, it would change it up to different land that also described more about the characters. Although it might\'ve been the reason why they use those new areas to introduce new characters that are the center of a certain episode and then never go back to it for the rest of the anime.The music and soundtrack were calm, showing how Azusa is living a peaceful life near a village while showcasing just how powerful she is whenever she has her moment to shine. The opening and ending were peaceful for once, not that many anime go that route, but only a few such as Fruits Basket and Horimiya do so to show how relaxing the anime will be. I love how Aoi Yuuki had her moment speaking fast in the opening again, that was pretty cute. The visuals were also a key factor in showcasing character traits in each of the girls and show what we should expect whenever we meet them in each episode.Overall, I\'ve Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level focuses mainly on character showcasing while displaying its fantasy aspects from time to time. I\'d recommend this anime for those that need a breather after the more engaging anime that come out and for those that want to watch another isekai. Many of the women shown have the potential for joining the contender for best girl this Spring, and I\'m down for this Isekai to have a second season in the future. Once again, it was a wholesome series to watch and I hope to hear more about it in the future. to time, definitely something you don\'t see in many series like this in modern anime.

The art not something you can impress but more than enough. This anime very wholesome & you dont have high expectation about the plot. The story feel flat but you wil still enjoy the anime. I very like episode 10 because somehow the anime have genre music in it. I dont expect many character will singing & also the character have their own personality.

Its one of those which you can kinda turn off your brain and enjoy the cuteness of it.That being said, yes plot progression is basically non-existent and yes the characters personality traits (besides the mc) arent that complex, but i do think it is intended to be like that.The VAs were pretty good, you can specially notice that in the episode they sang.The animation / art style isnt that elaborate but it fits to the slife of life thing.In conlusion if you like cutesy stuff watch it, if you prefer plot over anything...else dont.

There is some pretty good animated action, but it's short lived for the most part.With that you should then know not to expect a grand story, ravishing evil villains, tons of character development, insane fights, etc. What you get is a lighthearted show with cute girls doing cute things in a fantasy world. It does brush over some real topics, but its very brief and for the most part keeps its fun warm tone throughout. There is also a small bit of fanservice centered around one character which makes it hard to blatantly recommend as just a cute all-ages show, but it isn't focused on that much at all.The surprising piece is it goes more into the fantasy world itself than I was expecting, as I had imagined a lot of the anime would center around the home setting, but pretty much every episode travels out into the fantasy world meeting new people.Overall, watch this if you want something wholesome, cute, and fun.

Starting out, I really had high hopes. It was an intriguing concept and a clever character, though technically overdone. Even going into the first couple episodes I mostly enjoyed what I was seeing, but then began to see flaws crack in its facade. Unfortunately I was already in too deep that I had to see the whole series through, but had I known what was in store for the last half of the series,...I wouldn’t have even began the show at all…at least I don’t think.I hate to start griping from the start. Usually I like to point out the positives first and then go in on what I just couldn’t deal with. “300 years” had three major flaws for me. First and foremost was the lack of stakes. Yes, a 300 year old witch who is nearly invincible was the initial draw, but it gets old after episode 3. Seeing an old lady that looks young just win against other supposedly stronger beings is just not entertaining for 12 straight episodes. What’s the point in watching sub par fighting animation when there’s not even a threat of danger. It was just monotonous and dull after Beelzebub was defeated.This leads me to my second flaw for the series, and it goes along with stakes. The flaw being too many characters with little to no reason for their existence. Now sure, I did enjoy the characters designs, and had they been introduced separately or at a slower pace it might’ve hit differently, but the show might as well been named, “witch of the highlands makes a new friend every episode”. It was comical how predictable the blueprint became after the red dragon moves in. It’s gone so far past what the show should’ve been that by the last episode, they ran out of ideas for characters….thus a heavy metal bunny girl is the last experience we’re left with. At this point I’m not even sure what the point of the series is, or what even is the purpose of all of these friends moving in? Why do we need to see this and what makes it any different than any other piece of media in existence?Finally, my third issue. This more of a personal gripe for me, but where are all the men in the series? Why are not just most, but all of the powerful beings in this world women? I don’t have a problem with female driven plots, quite the contrary in fact, I usually prefer the heroes be female. But there isn’t even a dynamic here. You at least need a competent male or two in your cast if you’re going to have a well thought out cast. A prime example of this being done well is Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Cafe. It’s a mostly female cast, but also acknowledges that there are competent males in the world as well like Faf-kun! It’s almost as if the creators didn’t want to outright insult the male gender so instead decided not to have them be present for any roles other than background merchant, drunk, or security guard. Again this is more personal observation, but it’s statistically impossible to avoid the other gender as often as these main characters do. All it accomplishes is making the world feel fake or less full.Like I mentioned earlier, great female character designs, but shoving more and more characters in our faces without either giving them real personalities or fleshing out the cast you already have, just makes everything monotonous. I still don’t know the difference between the slime daughters, the blue dragon and the red dragon, or the ghost and the energy drink elf. I’m sure I’ve forgotten someone, but that’s how little effect the extra characters had on me and just feel like cheap plugs to get to 12 episodes….particularly the heavy metal bunny girl, wtf. The only two characters I even really concerned myself with were the main witch, whose name eludes me and I don’t care to look up, and Beelzebub. I will say Beelzebub was done well and stood out amongst the crowd so I’ll at least give this show that.There’s not much more to say about this series. There are some funny elements, but the jokes are repetitive. There are some interesting plots, but those are repetitive as well. And lastly, great character introductions, but of course…more repetition. It’s like they made a plan for 3 episodes and told the writers “do this 4 more times” and just hoped it’d work. I have no clue what I watched or why I watched it. It wasn’t necessarily interesting after the 4th episode nor did anything of importance even happen. So would I recommend this show, probably not. Shows that lazily ship out generic plot A with generic characters A,B, and C shouldn’t deserve any real positive recognition. I will say I laughed a couple times maybe, and did like 1 of 2 characters, both from the demon realm. Other than that, it was just kind of a meh experience, probably should look elsewhere for entertainment.

Other than that, it was just kind of a meh experience, probably should look elsewhere for entertainment.', 'I am going to try to keep this review short for any potential viewer of this show: The first 3 or so episodes are actually entertaining and showed quite a bit of promise, however, after that the quality of the content within each episode seemed to exponentially drop. While the first episodes are really cute and wholesome, the following episodes become boring, poorly paced, and outright ""cringe"" at times. It is a shame honestly, as the series initially had so much potential but it all seemingly went to waste. In all honesty its a miracle that I actually completed this show and I have no...idea how or why I did so. If you are like me, episodes 4-12 are a complete waste of your time and I would highly advise against subjecting yourself to watching them. idea how or why I did so.

Well, there it is, and it was a witch too! Meet Azusa, the witch who lived eternally until she defeated a slime for 300 years. One day, she finds out that her level was maxed out and she became the most powerful being that no one can\'t defeated her. Despite of her motto ""To enjoy a peaceful life"" sadly it doesn\'t go as her intended, she was infiltrated by a dragon who accidently struck her house and the dragon wanted to become her disciple! Will her live goes as intended,...or else will her live isn\'t going as her motto does?Slime Taoshite 300-nen,  Shiranai Uchi ni Level Max ni Nattemashita or to be shorted as Slime Taoshite is surprisingly a show about the daily life of a witch who created a family instead of living peacefully (without being disturbed) eternally. It was heartwarming, intriguing, and funny at the same time. It gives the vibes of happy family with its own odds and ends and giving you the mood of happy family.Now you might find this intriguing but let me tell you a little bit about this anime.Story: 5/10There are a lot to talk about the story actually, where there are some things that still needs an explanation or things that needed to appear in the scene. Some subjects are fatigue and they appeared as something like doing a ""family routine"" stuff and solving problem for the family member, as the story could be more improved by the fact that it has strong concept like ""revived and going to the new world and living eternally peacefully"". There are some subjects that it doesn\'t even appear and never talked about, it\'s just about a story about how a person that doesn\'t want her life to be disturbed into creating a whole bunch of family. Such a shame that they didn\'t do that. In fact, the story could go even more better with some subjects that is written in the beginning. There are also many scenes that seemingly unnecessary such as the fight scene, in fact they didn\'t even need to put the fight scene because they can just talk about the problem (because most of the story doesn\'t even require fighting and they resolved by talking at each other) it\'s a slice of life things and why do they need to make those fight scene? No idea why but it feels like a filler that doesn\'t even make it.Art: 5/10Everything about the art is just mediocre and nothing feels special about it, it\'s just another trope of ""anime girls doing anime things"" but instead of doing lesbian things or stuff they make a whole family instead (and a little bit problem here and there) the art is not even that impressive and it\'s pretty generic to its point. Nothing feels special about the art and it\'s that one anime which art are generic.Sound: 6/10Appreciate about the sound, it was fit for a certain scene but for some of the scene is just doesn\'t make it and turns out lacking. It needs to be improved such as the fighting scene, it doesn\'t have that marks (probably because they are more focused to the daily life not the fighting scene instead) and it wasn\'t even hit the feel of some scene.Animation: 7/10What do you expect from a slice-of-life story with generic plot and mediocre art? Yep, it is also a generic animation. But surprisingly the animation for a slice-of-life story is pretty well made and it isn\'t CGI, much salute for that.Overall:This anime is just for you who just wanted to spend time after work or after study so you can watch some girls doing cute things or some girls doing ""anime-ish"" thing so they can relieve their stresses and they come to replenish it, overall, it\'s pretty mediocre but somehow a heartwarming story or else will her live isn\'t going as her motto does?Slime Taoshite 300-nen,  Shiranai Uchi ni Level Max ni Nattemashita or to be shorted as Slime Taoshite is surprisingly a show about the daily life of a witch who created a family instead of living peacefully (without being disturbed) eternally.

The iDOLM@STER Million Live!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42385/The_iDOLMSTER_Million_Live,"['Idolmaster\'s adaptations have always had an issue catching up to the greatness that is the 2011 anime. I\'ve always been a firm believer in quality over quantity, and the 2011 anime manages to make the most of its runtime by giving each of its girls (and crucially, Producer) a dedicated spotlight episode as well as fleshing out their characters to make them appealing for people who don\'t play the games. The inability of its subsequent spinoffs to stand up to the 2011 show is evident in Cinderella Girls (lack of focus on both the core trio and the overall cast) and Side:M (too many idols,...Producer is a non-entity). Then came U149, which had managed to capture the same magic as the 2011 anime, even blowing it out of the water at some points, despite its shorter runtime by having such a razor-sharp focus on its cast and by having a lot of its episodes dedicated to non-idol activities (this is important as I\'ll elaborate later on). I had thought the series had returned to good hands, and then the long awaited Million Live anime came out, and it blows alright.Uniquely MiliLive has inherited both negatives from Cinderella Girls and SideM. You have a stupidly large cast of girls, none of whom get any real focus on to flesh out their individual characters, alienating anyone who isn\'t into the games, alongside with a total non-entity of a Producer. See, one of the core aspects of Idolmaster is that the Producer himself is not just some self-insert; he is as much of a main character as any of the girls, and his proactiveness in some episodes is what elevates him above the usual ""token male character in an all-female show"" compared to other shows. You can easily remove MiliLive\'s Producer and it would not make a single difference. Speaking of the girls, there\'s just too many of them to keep track of, and their core archetype/personalities just get forgotten the moment they\'re offscreen. It\'s really bad when I can\'t even remember the names of half of them even at episode 12. They\'ve also brought in the original cast (albeit some alternate reality version of them more similar to Imas 1\'s universe than Imas 2\'s) as bait, since they don\'t amount to much in the end as well.And, I think this is a fundamental misunderstanding for people making Idol shows, and not just a MiliLive problem, but the actual idol parts of the shows are actually the most boring parts. In any work related show, the work aspect is just set dressing at the end of the day, and what people want to see are activities that happen outside of work. The 2011 Imas and U149 got this right by having the idol aspect be secondary while the real focus shifts to the characters and their interactions, growth, and relationships outside of work. Most of Million Live is just about preparing for the big show, and doing the big show. It\'s just watching people work. It\'s honestly no different to coming to the office and having one of those shallow conversations with your colleagues: You pretend to talk about something exciting to mask the dread of monotony in the workplace. Most of Million Live\'s interactions rarely involve the personal relationships or developments around the characters, but instead are mostly work-related. Oh Shizuka\'s sad because her dad disapproves of her idol work? Come on that\'s boring. This is nothing like Risa\'s anxieties in U149 or Chihaya\'s dead brother in 2011. Why is it so difficult for the production committee to understand that we enjoy these kinds of shows because of the characters, not because of the work they do. At this point I\'m even content with the melodrama from Mio in CG or Sakuraba in SideM, because at least those were focused on the characters themselves.Honestly, maybe the adaptation was too little too late. After all, the heyday of MiliLive was around when the 2014 movie aired, and that was as good as an adaptation MiliLive was ever gonna get, even if it\'s only ever focused on Kana. But at least it was focused on someone and delivered a spectacular finale. I felt nothing after MiliLive\'s 2023 adaptation ended, and I dread to think how the Shinymas adaptation is gonna be like. At this point maybe giving the girls Mechas to fight asteroids may have been a better alternative.5/10 Producer is a non-entity).

For me, had watched the movie, played game Starlit Season, and listen to their music on music platform.By did three of those above, it will make better experience watching this Million Live anime because it will have a nostalgia vibe and matching vibe like ""Yeah, she would doing this because her X personality"". The matching vibe doesn\'t mean negative where know the plot went, but in positive way like ""if she personality X, meets personality Y, what will happen?"" that...would find intriguing that trying to guess what interaction going about. If the guess correct, then feeling happy that the characters stay in characters. If the guess wrong, it\'s a new discovery of characters personality and feeling curious.All characters introduced with great pacing from episode 1 to 4. No rushing and characters interaction is amusing because their unique personality. They are top well-written like I felt the anxiety when the characters felt anxiety. I felt happy when the characters felt happy.The conflict solved rather fast in one episode, where original Idolmaster need at least 2 episodes for major conflict to solve the problem. So the feeling of worried, anxiety and cynicism about 60% compare to original Idolmaster but still has awkward moment that would find interesting. I believe it\'s because the new characters is so talented to become idols that do less mistake. However I found episode 4, the conflict is really best. Idolmaster conflict really captured depiction of real life.The CGI is better than I expected. There are no clipping, the model matching with the background, no lighting error, and no weird movement even the 3D really pleasant to watch. However, the model of Shizuka\'s hair that looking from sideling seems a little buggy for me.The ART is really interesting that when paused for a sec, the ART blended really well with CGI and were created really detailed like have a good lightning environment typical high quality visual novel background.Overall it did make me felt anxiety, happy, laugh, curiosity, empathy. would find intriguing that trying to guess what interaction going about.

A setup that drives countless fictional stories, and one which Tiger Mask W delivers in spades.If you are browsing this and ordinarily enjoy a good battle shonen, just go watch Tiger Mask W, you need read no further. Pro wrestling - at least as it\'s portrayed here - is basically the same thing with more spandex. They still have attacks with cool names and take implausibly large hits, but there are no gruesome deaths or spirit bombs on display, just an occasional ""they\'ll never fight again"" killer move to raise the stakes. It\'s a Toei series, so the quality is typically choppy...and relies a lot on ""classic"" compositions with a static camera against dynamic still poses, but it\'s well-directed and sustains a feeling of movement for an extended period. Pretty much every fight is easy to follow, flows well, and engrosses the emotions.OK, you say. The fighting is pretty good. What else is there? The other important part of a series about fighting, of course: giving the characters good reasons to fight. The main plot of Tiger Mask W is a straightforward revenge story, and many of the subplots are roughly as predictable. But like the fighting, it manages to juggle a fairly large cast and develop them at a steady, easy-to-follow pacing. Everything ties together in a neat, by-the-book fashion, which is in keeping with the ""throwback"" feel of the visuals. You\'ve seen it all before, but rarely with execution this strong. It\'s not a  twisty, meta, or philosophical type of show, it just delivers the goods on satisfying setups and resolution, over and over. Most seasonal anime could stand to learn from this example.I actually started watching Tiger Mask W with its final episode, which was a chance happy accident: the conclusion to the main plot was in the previous episode, and this was more like an OVA-style epilogue that acts as a teaser for a possible new season or spinoff, with a focus on side characters and stage-setting for new plot arcs. I really hope they go through with producing more of this series, because it\'s like comfort food to me. and relies a lot on ""classic"" compositions with a static camera against dynamic still poses, but it\'s well-directed and sustains a feeling of movement for an extended period.

They are both hobbies looked down upon by society as a large and have most of their fanbase communicate online. They are also full of idiots and elitists hating on “normies” and “casuals”.Story:As far as I could find out, this anime is a sequel to the original Tiger Mask, but ignores other sequels to it. Since the original is solely available in Japanese, I have no idea how this one correlates with it, so let’s just judge it as a show on its own. A young guy named Naoto picks up the moniker of Tiger Mask to...make it big in the wrestling business and find the man responsible for crippling his mentor and make him pay. At the same time, his former training partner Takuma has the same intentions, but joins the evil organization to destroy them from within. The whole plot isn’t much to write home about, but a simple story well executed can still be a good one. Tiger Mask is pretty straight forward, which is definitely for the better, as the writing doesn’t feel like it could handle big twists or a deeper storytelling. Almost everything that happens is easily predictable, but the show never tries to pretend that it’s going to surprise you. A very nice addition to the cast are the stars of real life promotion New Japan. They give the whole story a more realistic feeling, showing us that this isn’t a fantasy world with made-up guys doing impossible moves, but a show about somebody wrestling. Of course the Tigers still have impossible finishers, but you get the idea.7/10Art:Tiger Mask looks very reminiscent of old 80s sports shounen and doesn’t really try to be more eye-pleasing than absolutely necessary. The animation is kept very simple, which isn’t a bad thing in itself, but here it comes across as rather lazy. Like “the kids won’t notice” kinda lazy. It’s certainly not a budget issue, as the last three episodes DID look spectacular and it makes it all the more jarring to know what maybe could have been.5/10Sound:The opening song is a newer version of the classic Tiger Mask theme, which, even though it’s pretty cheesy as you would expect from a 60s cartoon, still works fine today. I don’t know if the ending theme is a rehash too, but I thought it was pretty cool. The rest of the soundtrack is basically just some stock music. I somewhat missed entrance themes, but that’s just me being a wrestling nerd. In terms of voice acting I didn’t notice anything remarkably good or bad, it was a solid performance. Just a shame that the New Japan guys weren’t voiced by themselves (except for the final episode cameo).7/10Characters:Naoto is a good main character, he’s serious when fighting, he can be a bit goofy when outside the ring and he has some flaws that almost prevent him from reaching his goal. Takuma is a good anti-hero, with noble motives but behaving like a bad guy. However, I found the villains to be weak. Even The Third didn’t have much more going on than just being that one incredibly strong guy who likes to injure people. The side characters were a lot of fun though. Furukawa Mask was hilarious, Haruna and Wakamatsu were fun too. I especially enjoyed the many cameos by New Japan heels, like Naito or Kenny Omega. In total, the cast was fine by me.7/10Enjoyment:Tiger Mask had a few lengths when it looked like this is going nowhere or might even end up becoming a long-runner. Thankfully, the stronger parts made up for it and ended up making it a quite entertaining show. However, as with probably most other sports shows, if you are not interested in the subject of wrestling, there will be little for you to enjoy about this anime. It isn’t really able to stand on its own as a compelling story and could easily bore you to death. IF you enjoy wrestling however (especially Japanese), I’d say it’s at least worth giving a shot. A solid sports anime, nothing more, nothing less.6/10Overall:6.4/10 make it big in the wrestling business and find the man responsible for crippling his mentor and make him pay.

Furukawa Mask was hilarious, Haruna and Wakamatsu were fun too. I especially enjoyed the many cameos by New Japan heels, like Naito or Kenny Omega. In total, the cast was fine by me.7/10Enjoyment:Tiger Mask had a few lengths when it looked like this is going nowhere or might even end up becoming a long-runner. Thankfully, the stronger parts made up for it and ended up making it a quite entertaining show. However, as with probably most other sports shows, if you are not interested in the subject of wrestling, there will be little for you to enjoy about this anime. It isn’t really able to stand on its own as a compelling story and could easily bore you to death. IF you enjoy wrestling however (especially Japanese), I’d say it’s at least worth giving a shot. A solid sports anime, nothing more, nothing less.6/10Overall:6.4/10', ""Alright, as a wrestling and anime fan, i feel the need to review this show. (First review ever, so dont judge too harshly. or dont. who cares.)So, Tiger Mask W. Whoof. This series had some massive ups and downs. As a wrestling fan (particularly NJPW) it had a lot of good fanservice, but that's almost it's downfall. I feel like one of the selling points of TMW is that it has so many references to real-life wrestlers, but if you're not at least tangentially aware of who these people are (Kazuchika Okada, Hiroshi Tanahashi) you're gonna miss a lot of content. Okada's first appearance in...the series is treated as a big deal, but if you're not aware he's the current longest-reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion, it's going to mean nothing to you. There's even a joke later on in the series involving Tanahashi that you wont get unless you're in the know. But i digress.Being a Toei production, the animation is all over the place. At the least, it's good when it counts in the fights, and that's all we can really ask for. Even so, it means that we dont have a fully fantastic animation quality, and that's sad.The Story, while cliche, is a fun story to follow. Naoto fights to get revenge for his father figure, while his childhood friend does the same, with different means. It was a fun story, but nothing inherently special. The characters are probably the best thing about the series, even if they are also nothing inherently special. Haruna was probably the best part to me, her energy and sense of humor was the best thing that kept the series fun to watch at any given time. The rivalry between Naoto and Takuma was engrossing, if a bit cliche. Obviously there was also the frequent cameos of real-life NJPW wrestlers, which was a great source of making the series feel grounded, even in the impossibilities of the wrestling shown.Overall, if you're a wrestling fan (especially a NJPW fan) you'll likely get a good amount of enjoyment out of Tiger Mask W. It's DEFINITELY cliche by anime standards, it's story being a very old-school style of storytelling. But even so, it has heart. It may have gotten a 6/10 from me, but it kept me enjoying it, if only for it's over-the-top style and it's fanservice. Give it a try if you're a wrestling fan, but i'd probably stay away if you're not, or are into shounen that try new things. the series is treated as a big deal, but if you're not aware he's the current longest-reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion, it's going to mean nothing to you.

There's also semi-naked mountain climbing. With bare hands. In the freezing cold. There's a room for training full of old school robots, because of course it has. There's a mysterious evil corporation bent on conquering the world of pro-wrestling, and a fair, preternaturally gifted protagonist looking to avenge his master - and a long...lost friend on the same tortuous journey, but he's stoic, got long hair and wears a black mask, so he's cooler. It would be my favorite anime if I was growing up, now I find it so cheesy - but cheese is also the best food, so that's fine.Shonen anime is a great medium for a pro-wrestling history as both are build around big, outrageous characters (I love Tanahashi having trouble securing his identity behind a mask because his personality is just too big), impossible stunts and muscle-bound physiques. In both mediums, the fights are part of the dramaturgy, a form of narrative and also how connections are made: respect for a fighter turning to friendship, or a rivality deepening. Every in-ring confrontation is when Tiger Mask W is at its best.The stop-start nature of a wrestling match, with emphasis on facial expression and psychology/narrative, lends itself well to this more economic (i.e. cheaper) animation style. The fights are really fun, but the upscalling of the animation at Tiger Mask's great first fight with Yellow Devil, for instance, or during the War Games episodes, shows the heights this could achieve with a more dedicated focus on the occasional seriousness of the emotions, and how real are the risks of really great wrestling and storytelling.Loose thoughts:- There's a tendency, in wrestling related work, to be 'realistic'. I really like that the whole story here is in kayfabe: the fights, the relationships, everything is real. (Which of course it would be. It's anime.

Rather than a change of character (as in real pro-wrestling), it's a big change of trust. It also works as critique of revenge as a source of action.- Pro-wrestling is used as a spectacle capable of reinvigorating public and civil spaces, something that has at its (visceral and violent) heart a populist power.

UFO Princess Valkyrie 2: Juunigatsu no Yasoukyoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1128/UFO_Princess_Valkyrie_2__Juunigatsu_no_Yasoukyoku,"[""Set in an alternate version of the present, where magic, alchemy, catgirls and aliens are all acknowledged and present, UFO Princess Valkyrie 2 follows (you guessed it) a magical princess from outer space named Valkyrie. The leading lady crash lands on Earth - and into Kazuto, the male lead - damaging her soul and transforming her, both physically and mentally, into a child.Told mostly in an episodic fashion, the often crazed, random, imaginative story is a wholly enjoyable ride. The episodes often take a 'monster-of-the-week' format, where a villain or problem is presented at the beginning and is resolved by the end. These unorthodox adventures...are, of course, highly predictable given the format, but they are carried by creativity and fun. The world of UFO Princess Valkyrie is overflowing with inventiveness; there is a whole heap of content with which to base each episode on, and the sheer limitless nature of the anime universe keeps the series fresh and compelling. The second series begins to expand more on Valkyrie's character and past, and the few episodes that do connect add a sense of heightened drama to an otherwise predominantly comedic series.The animation in UFO Princess Valkyrie 2, much like in the first series, is simply satisfactory; it doesn't give off the impression they had much budget to improve. The action sequences sometimes come across as stiff and dull, not helped by the uninspired, turn-based choreography. The art department, however, have created a rich, invigorating world, filled with all kinds of delightful, intriguing aliens and space creatures.The score was handled by Kenji Kawai, perhaps most famous for his work on Ghost in the Shell. The music in UFO Princess Valkyrie is of course very different to his haunting melodies in Mamoru Oshii's sci-fi tour de force, but his clear talent lives on evermore. Kawai creates some stunningly beautiful themes and composes a lovely variety of insert songs sung by members of the cast; the soundtrack is one of the absolute stand-out elements of the series.The characters are a merrymaking bunch filled with excitement and imagination. All the anime archetypes are present; from the air-headed Raine to the robotic yet comical Chorus and the troublesome tsundere Akina. There's little character development, however, and the cast are largely one-dimensional. They complement the story format, but never leave their moulds or challenge convention.Needless to say, that's besides the point. UFO Princess Valkyrie 2 is a series not to be taken too seriously. It's a harmless bit of no-brainer entertainment; something you can pop in and out of when you're in the mood. Simple-dumb-fun.

Even on a version of Earth where technology has advanced to the point where alien integration has become commonplace, the phrase “Strange places” should still not be taken lightly.  This is how it was for Kazuto, the owner of his family’s struggling bathhouse, who was minding his own business one day, both literally and figuratively, when calamity struck.  A spaceship, driven by a runaway bride from another planet, crash-landed through his roof, killing him.  The pilo, Princess Valkyrie of the Valhalla royal family, was stricken with grief by what she’d done,...so she offered half of her soul to bring him back to life.  This simple act of kindness brought new life to the young man’s heart, in more ways than one.  The loss of half of her soul may have turned Valkyrie into a child, but the bond between them still continued to grow, to the point where the two of them became very much in love...  And it was a love strong enough to overcome every obstacle the scorned Royal Family could throw at them.Having put what they thought was the worst of it behind them, Kazuto and Valkyrie have settled back down into their relatively normal everyday lives, running the bathhouse, dealing with all sorts of alien nonsense, and generally stagnating in a passionless, vaguely defined relationship.  Whatever floats their boat, I guess.  But strange things have been happening around them, beginning with the appearance of The Key of time, a weapon tied directly to the dark history of Valhalla, followed up by the appearance of Chorus, the weirdest member of the Royal family, and most importantly by the appearance of Valkyrie Ghost, a mysterious black-clad woman who bears a striking resemblance to Kazuto’s child bride.  Calling him her “Phantom Lover,” Valkyrie Ghost seemingly intends to separate Valkyrie and Kazuto from the life they’ve settled into, but for what purpose?  What does she want with the Key of Time?  How much does Chorus know about her?  As it turns out, these elements and more share a surprising connection in the continued adventures of Valkyrie and friends!Yes, we’re revisiting UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie again, which of course means we’re revisiting it’s animation studio, Media Factory Inc, who shared it’s duties with a smaller studio, TNK, who also collaborated with them on High School DXD, but managed such lovely projects as School Days by themselves.  The animation was abysmal in the first season, and while I can’t say the budget has improved since then, the direction definitely has.  The first season was directed by Shigeru Ueda, who’s had a ton of backstage experience, but has only acted as the main director on a handful of titles, including Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne, the swimsuit OVA from Senran Kagura, and the final two episodes of Key the Metal Idol, one of which you’ll remember I called virtually unwatchable.  Ironically, I can’t find any information on second season director Nobuhiro Takagi outside of a handful of single to dual episode storyboard jobs, and yet he was handed the director’s job in Valkyrie 2, and he did a much better job with it than Ueda did.Keep in mind, I’m not saying the series looks good.  That’s probably a bridge too far.  It does show vast improvement compared to it’s predecessor, but that doesn’t really feel like a hard thing to accomplish.  Takagi employed a lot of money saving techniques, the majority of which are immediately apparent to even the greenest of anime viewers.  He limits unnecessary movements through clever framing, he spent nearly an entire episode on characters standing on stage and singing while the camera panned up a still shot of them while only their mouths move, and while there may have been one magical girl transformation scene per episode in season 1, they can happen multiple times an episode in season 2...  Especially because there are at least four different transformation sequences, and I kid you not, one of them...  Introduced in episode 9...  Is used almost half a dozen times in that one episode.  It’s annoying to see these sequences over and over again, and it’s transparent as all hell, but it does a great job at saving money, so the rest of the series doesn’t have to look like ass.Animation is still stilted, there are of course a lot of lengthy key frames, and I’ll even admit that there are several uses of one of my least favorite budget saving tactics, bouncing the top half of a character’s body up and down to convey that they’re walking, but it does save enough money for the series to feature movement whenever it needs to, especially during the action scenes.  Remember, there’s a villain this season, and while the fight scenes she gets involved in are passable at best, that’s still far better than anyone could have expected material from this franchise to look.  More impressive still is the art direction, which, unlike the animation, is more than just relatively good, it’s actually, genuinely good.  No more inconsistent anatomies, no more faces going off model, everyone looks fine, the lighting is well thought out, and the backgrounds...  Particularly when they leave the normal world to travel to alternate dimensions and eventually outer space...  Are gorgeous, and often capture the exact moods they feel like they’re supposed to.What helps the mood of the series even more is the music, which is another noteworthy improvement over season 1.  While that season was mostly silly, weird and melodramatic, Season 2 dives into a much deeper well of emotions, including fear, sadness, loneliness and actual romance, among others.  In order to convey this, the orchestration takes a much more epic tone, although you wouldn’t know it from the opening.  I wasn’t a fan of the first season opening, but the new one is just generic and boring.  The song is okay, Meguriai by Melocure, but the video just feels like a dull slog trying to get itself over with.  There’s about eleven seconds of it panning sideways on a still image of a bathhouse changing room, and of course, every relevant character gets their profile shot.  These problems are thankfully made up for by the show’s insert song, Princess of December, a beautifully written song that’s performed just as well by Megumi Ogata, and it does more than just stop hearts...  It’s one of the many elements of the series that foreshadows the larger plot that culminates in the later episodes.The English dub has also stepped up, but if I’m being honest, the biggest influence on this change isn’t a change in voice direction or acting, it’s in the quality of the characters, and the way this specific move has changed what was expected of the actors.  The exception to this is sadly Greg Ayres, who still feels wasted in the boring, milquetoast role of Kazuto, perhaps the least interesting main character in anime history, but the change in writing has been a godsend for Kira Vincent Davis, who plays three different versions of the female lead, Valkyrie.  She plays the child version of Valkyrie with the same voice as before, but the character herself is way less annoying, and almost never makes any creepy pedophilic innuendoes, a welcome change.  Valkyrie herself shows up a little more often, and is given a better array of situations to act on, rather than just being a love-struck Captain Planet like before.  The addition of Valkyrie Ghost, however, is what truly allows her undeniable talent to shine, as the dynamic between Valkyrie and her sinister doppleganger adds layers of complexity to both performances.The list of characters who’ve improved for the benefit of their actors is expansive.  Miss Sanada is still obsessed with Valkyrie, but to nowhere as creepy or cruel a degree, giving Christine Auten reason to play her more likably, with a bit more care and purpose in her voice.  Akina spends the majority of her dialogue in ways that are related to the plot and her relationship with Hydra, so she no longer has to play the thirsty forlorn bitch, which was clearly refreshing for her.  Rika’s not as uptight or miserly as she used to be, making even Monica Rial’s weird choice of delivery a lot easier to listen to.  Nancy Novotny is still the perfect actor for Hydra, writing changes be damned, and thankfully for Hillary Haag, the character of Laine gets a lot more depth this season, especially with the addition of Kimberly Prause, who plays her estranged high school chum Chorus as weird and dorky, yet oddly serious, even when dropping ridiculous anime references.  It’s also worth mentioning that the adaptive writer Kyle Jones took a loose approach to the dialogue, but unlike certain other ADV names, his changes were mostly for the better, and they only really stuck out a few times, like a strange Tyra Banks reference that’s more dated than anything.  Over-all, it’s a pretty solid dub.If you remember my review of the first season of this series, you may remember me having a less than favorable opinion of it.  In no unclear terms, I called it the pedophilic rip-off of Ah! My Goddess, an assertion that I still stand by.  Well, okay, it wasn’t JUST that...  It was, at the most basic level, a fanservice show that failed miserably at both having fans and providing them service.  To put it bluntly, people who watch anime for fanservice don’t have the highest of standards.  Give them boobs and sexual situations, and they’ll put up with lazy art, terrible animation, horrible implications and God knows what else just to have another anime in their spank bank.  UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie, despite taking place at a bathhouse and thus having what should have been unlimited access to exposed skin, was a complete flop.  That’s how bad this series was at fanservice, whatever their problem with it was.  There are good ways and bad ways to deliver fanservice, and while it’s surprisingly complicated, Valkyrie was distinctly part of the latter.In order to fix this problem, director Nobuhiro Takagi apparently made the unorthodox decision to scale back the fanservice, a decision that’s not always the best idea.  There are many anime that needed that kind of content as a crutch, and wound up suffering without it...  Love Hina and Negima! come to mind...  But there are also some that would be better off with less skin and panties, like Valkyrie Drive Mermaid and Strike Witches.  The second season of Valkyrie, subtitled December Nocturne, falls right into the latter category.  Aside from a handful of recycled and weirdly framed bathhouse scenes in the first two episodes, there’s almost no fanservice throughout the rest of the series.  There’s no panty shots to speak of outside of one of the new transformation sequences(which is otherwise entirely clothed), the pedophilia has been wittled down to one admittedly painful child abduction gag, and while there are scenes taking place in the bathhouse, they rarely feel exploitative beyond their involvement in the plot.Unfortunately, the premise of the series hasn’t changed.  Everything still revolves around Kazuto and Valkyrie, and when you get right down to it, they barely have the basic qualifications to be considered characters.  Every character around them is more interesting than they are.  The relationship they have is still completely uneventful, boring and passionless, and yet we’re supposed to be afraid that they might get broken up.  They never express their feelings for each other through actions or gestures, and while I get that you can partially blame that on one of them spending most of her time as a child, the farthest they go when she’s an adult is looking longingly into each other’s eyes, and that happens like twice this season.  Even if their situation never changes, and Valkyrie never goes back to being an adult full time, they’re supposed to want it to happen, so that *I* have a reason to want it to happen.  It’s been two seasons, and they both seem content with having a love they can never physically express, and while I guess there’s some chaste virtue to that, they don’t even struggle with it.  It’s a non-issue.  It’s a huge problem, and it makes up the core of the series.Having said that, December Nocturne has two huge advantages over the first season.  The first is the character of Chorus, who is introduced in episode 2 and adds a brand new dimension of comedy to the franchise.  Her introductory episode tells you everything you need to know about her, as she pretends to be a dying robot, and damn does she commit to this act, driving the main cast to desperate action only to casually move onto her next act after supposedly dying in front of them.  She’s a unique character who lives in her own world and follows her own logic, with little regard for anyone else, appealing to both otakus and people on the autism spectrum(I can attest to both) in genuine ways that I rarely ever see.  One of boring old Valkyrie’s best moments is when she’s trying in vain to save Chorus, and if that’s not amazing enough, she actually winds up making the previously annoying Laine likeable, too.  They even get their own backstory episode taking place in school, although that episode DOES feature homophobic overtones that don’t show up anywhere else.  Seriously, explain to me how Laine used to have a massive crush on Valkyrie, but now only has eyes for Kazuto.The other advantage is the plot.  And I’m not just saying “It’s good because it has a plot,” I mean it has a GOOD plot, and one that it actually takes seriously.  To be clear, this is not a deep series, nor is it original or smart.  Where it shines is in it’s sincerity and execution.  There is no ulterior motive to the writing.  It isn’t trying to arouse the viewer, or waste as much time as possible on filler, or pretending to be more mature than it is.  Good writing and execution can make even the shallowest of material engaging, and that’s exactly what December Nocturne does.  Every single episode, regardless of how stupid or cliched it may look at the start, winds up doing something relevant to the plot, and even aside from that, each episode winds up doing something engaging and thoughtful.  The budget saving episode where everyone enters a karaoke contest, for example, seems at the beginning like it’s going to be simple and straightforward.  You see most of the cast sing, there are sub-plots floating around about the prizes, there are good laughs to be had, and it’s an okay episode by harem standards.But then, in one of the best and most emotionally provocative moments in the series, Valkyrie ghost shows up at the end, not only making you feel genuinely sorry for Val, but establishing an important detail about the relationship between the two of them and the Phantom Lover.  There’s a hot springs episode, which is common in most anime and absurdly common in this particular genre, and while it’s pretty sterile in terms of nudity, you spend most of the episode with the cast lost on a snowy mountain, with the music and art direction establishing a tone that tricks you into thinking any one of them could die at any moment...  Especially when, once again, Valkyrie ghost enters the equation.  There’s an episode where the main cast gets turned into children, which is normally the worst ideas any harem anime can pursue, but aside from the aforementioned child abduction scene(which was legitimately despicable), but we also get a beautiful story of one of the less-represented princesses getting to explore a romance and rediscover her youth.  Akina’s love for Kazuto got down-played this season, but when we learn about a special power she and Hydra have, we’re given a somber look into the feelings she still has for him.And then we have the ultimate plot, which is revealed towards the end of the series.  It’s a great idea, and it gets pulled off with a lot of heart and emotion, falling back on set-ups and call-backs that you probably never thought would again be relevant, but...  How can I say this...  It uses the wrong kind of foreshadowing.  It does an okay job as is, and you can tell that they had everything planned from the start, and it all builds up to a satisfying pay-off, but if there are huge secrets underneath the surface of Valhalla’s history, then THAT is the material that needs to be established.  They needed to drop hints about the Royal Family not being what they seem, and even if they did turn out to be completely innocent, the characters need to have some form of doubt so that we, as the audience, can feel it just the same.  I love Valkyrie ghost, she’s one of my favorite anime villains, but I needed more than her to keep me guessing.  Things should have been happening from multiple angles to keep the characters guessing, and I really feel that a tighter focus on the mystery from these angles could have helped the series to reach the level of sophistication that they skirted so close to.  It might be one of the biggest seasonal improvements I’ve seen, but it could have been so much more.UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie 2: A December nocturne was originally available from ADV Films, before being rescued and redistributed by Section23.  Like the first season, it was initially released stateside in 30 dollar 4-episode DVDs, but have become much more affordable overtime.  The ADV Thinpack release, for example, can be found for as little as four dollars, depending on your timing.  A two-pack featuring both seasons 1 and 2 can be found relatively cheap online, but it unfortunately wasn’t picked up by Funimation like seasons 3 and 4 were, so your success level may vary.  You can, however, watch the entire series on Amazon video.  The original manga by Kaishaku has not been released stateside.I haven’t seen a sequel put this much effort into fixing the problems of it’s predecessor since Cinderella 3.  does it have problems?  Of course it does, look at the franchise it’s in.  It was meant to have problems.  That’s why the quality of the series tanked right back down to insufferable levels in season 3.  But this season was different, as it had a director that tried, and put extra effort into making something awful into something watchable.  I’m not saying it was great, nor do I think it would have been fair to expect greatness from it, but I was honestly surprised at just how good it managed to be.  It was bogged down by a few unavoidable details, such as the idiotic premise and the bare bones budget, and it still wound up being really stupid on the whole, but by adding a well-thought-out comedic character and an awesome villain that presented a legitimate threat and a sympathetic backstory that didn’t take anything away from said threat, and by committing to writing even the most hare-brained situations with heart and substance, December nocturne was a lot of fun, and it’s a series that I’d recommend even to people who haven’t seen the first season.  I give UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie 2: A December Nocturne a 6/10. so she offered half of her soul to bring him back to life.  This simple act of kindness brought new life to the young man’s heart, in more ways than one.  The loss of half of her soul may have turned Valkyrie into a child, but the bond between them still continued to grow, to the point where the two of them became very much in love...  And it was a love strong enough to overcome every obstacle the scorned Royal Family could throw at them.Having put what they thought was the worst of it behind them, Kazuto and Valkyrie have settled back down into their relatively normal everyday lives, running the bathhouse, dealing with all sorts of alien nonsense, and generally stagnating in a passionless, vaguely defined relationship.  Whatever floats their boat, I guess.  But strange things have been happening around them, beginning with the appearance of The Key of time, a weapon tied directly to the dark history of Valhalla, followed up by the appearance of Chorus, the weirdest member of the Royal family, and most importantly by the appearance of Valkyrie Ghost, a mysterious black-clad woman who bears a striking resemblance to Kazuto’s child bride.  Calling him her “Phantom Lover,” Valkyrie Ghost seemingly intends to separate Valkyrie and Kazuto from the life they’ve settled into, but for what purpose?  What does she want with the Key of Time?  How much does Chorus know about her?  As it turns out, these elements and more share a surprising connection in the continued adventures of Valkyrie and friends!Yes, we’re revisiting UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie again, which of course means we’re revisiting it’s animation studio, Media Factory Inc, who shared it’s duties with a smaller studio, TNK, who also collaborated with them on High School DXD, but managed such lovely projects as School Days by themselves.  The animation was abysmal in the first season, and while I can’t say the budget has improved since then, the direction definitely has.  The first season was directed by Shigeru Ueda, who’s had a ton of backstage experience, but has only acted as the main director on a handful of titles, including Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne, the swimsuit OVA from Senran Kagura, and the final two episodes of Key the Metal Idol, one of which you’ll remember I called virtually unwatchable.  Ironically, I can’t find any information on second season director Nobuhiro Takagi outside of a handful of single to dual episode storyboard jobs, and yet he was handed the director’s job in Valkyrie 2, and he did a much better job with it than Ueda did.Keep in mind, I’m not saying the series looks good.  That’s probably a bridge too far.  It does show vast improvement compared to it’s predecessor, but that doesn’t really feel like a hard thing to accomplish.  Takagi employed a lot of money saving techniques, the majority of which are immediately apparent to even the greenest of anime viewers.  He limits unnecessary movements through clever framing, he spent nearly an entire episode on characters standing on stage and singing while the camera panned up a still shot of them while only their mouths move, and while there may have been one magical girl transformation scene per episode in season 1, they can happen multiple times an episode in season 2...  Especially because there are at least four different transformation sequences, and I kid you not, one of them...  Introduced in episode 9...  Is used almost half a dozen times in that one episode.  It’s annoying to see these sequences over and over again, and it’s transparent as all hell, but it does a great job at saving money, so the rest of the series doesn’t have to look like ass.Animation is still stilted, there are of course a lot of lengthy key frames, and I’ll even admit that there are several uses of one of my least favorite budget saving tactics, bouncing the top half of a character’s body up and down to convey that they’re walking, but it does save enough money for the series to feature movement whenever it needs to, especially during the action scenes.  Remember, there’s a villain this season, and while the fight scenes she gets involved in are passable at best, that’s still far better than anyone could have expected material from this franchise to look.  More impressive still is the art direction, which, unlike the animation, is more than just relatively good, it’s actually, genuinely good.  No more inconsistent anatomies, no more faces going off model, everyone looks fine, the lighting is well thought out, and the backgrounds...  Particularly when they leave the normal world to travel to alternate dimensions and eventually outer space...  Are gorgeous, and often capture the exact moods they feel like they’re supposed to.What helps the mood of the series even more is the music, which is another noteworthy improvement over season 1.  While that season was mostly silly, weird and melodramatic, Season 2 dives into a much deeper well of emotions, including fear, sadness, loneliness and actual romance, among others.  In order to convey this, the orchestration takes a much more epic tone, although you wouldn’t know it from the opening.  I wasn’t a fan of the first season opening, but the new one is just generic and boring.  The song is okay, Meguriai by Melocure, but the video just feels like a dull slog trying to get itself over with.  There’s about eleven seconds of it panning sideways on a still image of a bathhouse changing room, and of course, every relevant character gets their profile shot.  These problems are thankfully made up for by the show’s insert song, Princess of December, a beautifully written song that’s performed just as well by Megumi Ogata, and it does more than just stop hearts...  It’s one of the many elements of the series that foreshadows the larger plot that culminates in the later episodes.The English dub has also stepped up, but if I’m being honest, the biggest influence on this change isn’t a change in voice direction or acting, it’s in the quality of the characters, and the way this specific move has changed what was expected of the actors.  The exception to this is sadly Greg Ayres, who still feels wasted in the boring, milquetoast role of Kazuto, perhaps the least interesting main character in anime history, but the change in writing has been a godsend for Kira Vincent Davis, who plays three different versions of the female lead, Valkyrie.  She plays the child version of Valkyrie with the same voice as before, but the character herself is way less annoying, and almost never makes any creepy pedophilic innuendoes, a welcome change.  Valkyrie herself shows up a little more often, and is given a better array of situations to act on, rather than just being a love-struck Captain Planet like before.  The addition of Valkyrie Ghost, however, is what truly allows her undeniable talent to shine, as the dynamic between Valkyrie and her sinister doppleganger adds layers of complexity to both performances.The list of characters who’ve improved for the benefit of their actors is expansive.  Miss Sanada is still obsessed with Valkyrie, but to nowhere as creepy or cruel a degree, giving Christine Auten reason to play her more likably, with a bit more care and purpose in her voice.  Akina spends the majority of her dialogue in ways that are related to the plot and her relationship with Hydra, so she no longer has to play the thirsty forlorn bitch, which was clearly refreshing for her.  Rika’s not as uptight or miserly as she used to be, making even Monica Rial’s weird choice of delivery a lot easier to listen to.  Nancy Novotny is still the perfect actor for Hydra, writing changes be damned, and thankfully for Hillary Haag, the character of Laine gets a lot more depth this season, especially with the addition of Kimberly Prause, who plays her estranged high school chum Chorus as weird and dorky, yet oddly serious, even when dropping ridiculous anime references.  It’s also worth mentioning that the adaptive writer Kyle Jones took a loose approach to the dialogue, but unlike certain other ADV names, his changes were mostly for the better, and they only really stuck out a few times, like a strange Tyra Banks reference that’s more dated than anything.  Over-all, it’s a pretty solid dub.If you remember my review of the first season of this series, you may remember me having a less than favorable opinion of it.  In no unclear terms, I called it the pedophilic rip-off of Ah! My Goddess, an assertion that I still stand by.  Well, okay, it wasn’t JUST that...  It was, at the most basic level, a fanservice show that failed miserably at both having fans and providing them service.  To put it bluntly, people who watch anime for fanservice don’t have the highest of standards.  Give them boobs and sexual situations, and they’ll put up with lazy art, terrible animation, horrible implications and God knows what else just to have another anime in their spank bank.  UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie, despite taking place at a bathhouse and thus having what should have been unlimited access to exposed skin, was a complete flop.  That’s how bad this series was at fanservice, whatever their problem with it was.  There are good ways and bad ways to deliver fanservice, and while it’s surprisingly complicated, Valkyrie was distinctly part of the latter.In order to fix this problem, director Nobuhiro Takagi apparently made the unorthodox decision to scale back the fanservice, a decision that’s not always the best idea.  There are many anime that needed that kind of content as a crutch, and wound up suffering without it...  Love Hina and Negima! come to mind...  But there are also some that would be better off with less skin and panties, like Valkyrie Drive Mermaid and Strike Witches.  The second season of Valkyrie, subtitled December Nocturne, falls right into the latter category.  Aside from a handful of recycled and weirdly framed bathhouse scenes in the first two episodes, there’s almost no fanservice throughout the rest of the series.  There’s no panty shots to speak of outside of one of the new transformation sequences(which is otherwise entirely clothed), the pedophilia has been wittled down to one admittedly painful child abduction gag, and while there are scenes taking place in the bathhouse, they rarely feel exploitative beyond their involvement in the plot.Unfortunately, the premise of the series hasn’t changed.  Everything still revolves around Kazuto and Valkyrie, and when you get right down to it, they barely have the basic qualifications to be considered characters.  Every character around them is more interesting than they are.  The relationship they have is still completely uneventful, boring and passionless, and yet we’re supposed to be afraid that they might get broken up.  They never express their feelings for each other through actions or gestures, and while I get that you can partially blame that on one of them spending most of her time as a child, the farthest they go when she’s an adult is looking longingly into each other’s eyes, and that happens like twice this season.  Even if their situation never changes, and Valkyrie never goes back to being an adult full time, they’re supposed to want it to happen, so that *I* have a reason to want it to happen.  It’s been two seasons, and they both seem content with having a love they can never physically express, and while I guess there’s some chaste virtue to that, they don’t even struggle with it.  It’s a non-issue.  It’s a huge problem, and it makes up the core of the series.Having said that, December Nocturne has two huge advantages over the first season.  The first is the character of Chorus, who is introduced in episode 2 and adds a brand new dimension of comedy to the franchise.  Her introductory episode tells you everything you need to know about her, as she pretends to be a dying robot, and damn does she commit to this act, driving the main cast to desperate action only to casually move onto her next act after supposedly dying in front of them.  She’s a unique character who lives in her own world and follows her own logic, with little regard for anyone else, appealing to both otakus and people on the autism spectrum(I can attest to both) in genuine ways that I rarely ever see.  One of boring old Valkyrie’s best moments is when she’s trying in vain to save Chorus, and if that’s not amazing enough, she actually winds up making the previously annoying Laine likeable, too.  They even get their own backstory episode taking place in school, although that episode DOES feature homophobic overtones that don’t show up anywhere else.  Seriously, explain to me how Laine used to have a massive crush on Valkyrie, but now only has eyes for Kazuto.The other advantage is the plot.  And I’m not just saying “It’s good because it has a plot,” I mean it has a GOOD plot, and one that it actually takes seriously.  To be clear, this is not a deep series, nor is it original or smart.  Where it shines is in it’s sincerity and execution.  There is no ulterior motive to the writing.  It isn’t trying to arouse the viewer, or waste as much time as possible on filler, or pretending to be more mature than it is.  Good writing and execution can make even the shallowest of material engaging, and that’s exactly what December Nocturne does.  Every single episode, regardless of how stupid or cliched it may look at the start, winds up doing something relevant to the plot, and even aside from that, each episode winds up doing something engaging and thoughtful.  The budget saving episode where everyone enters a karaoke contest, for example, seems at the beginning like it’s going to be simple and straightforward.  You see most of the cast sing, there are sub-plots floating around about the prizes, there are good laughs to be had, and it’s an okay episode by harem standards.But then, in one of the best and most emotionally provocative moments in the series, Valkyrie ghost shows up at the end, not only making you feel genuinely sorry for Val, but establishing an important detail about the relationship between the two of them and the Phantom Lover.  There’s a hot springs episode, which is common in most anime and absurdly common in this particular genre, and while it’s pretty sterile in terms of nudity, you spend most of the episode with the cast lost on a snowy mountain, with the music and art direction establishing a tone that tricks you into thinking any one of them could die at any moment...  Especially when, once again, Valkyrie ghost enters the equation.  There’s an episode where the main cast gets turned into children, which is normally the worst ideas any harem anime can pursue, but aside from the aforementioned child abduction scene(which was legitimately despicable), but we also get a beautiful story of one of the less-represented princesses getting to explore a romance and rediscover her youth.  Akina’s love for Kazuto got down-played this season, but when we learn about a special power she and Hydra have, we’re given a somber look into the feelings she still has for him.And then we have the ultimate plot, which is revealed towards the end of the series.  It’s a great idea, and it gets pulled off with a lot of heart and emotion, falling back on set-ups and call-backs that you probably never thought would again be relevant, but...  How can I say this...  It uses the wrong kind of foreshadowing.  It does an okay job as is, and you can tell that they had everything planned from the start, and it all builds up to a satisfying pay-off, but if there are huge secrets underneath the surface of Valhalla’s history, then THAT is the material that needs to be established.  They needed to drop hints about the Royal Family not being what they seem, and even if they did turn out to be completely innocent, the characters need to have some form of doubt so that we, as the audience, can feel it just the same.  I love Valkyrie ghost, she’s one of my favorite anime villains, but I needed more than her to keep me guessing.  Things should have been happening from multiple angles to keep the characters guessing, and I really feel that a tighter focus on the mystery from these angles could have helped the series to reach the level of sophistication that they skirted so close to.  It might be one of the biggest seasonal improvements I’ve seen, but it could have been so much more.UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie 2: A December nocturne was originally available from ADV Films, before being rescued and redistributed by Section23.  Like the first season, it was initially released stateside in 30 dollar 4-episode DVDs, but have become much more affordable overtime.  The ADV Thinpack release, for example, can be found for as little as four dollars, depending on your timing.  A two-pack featuring both seasons 1 and 2 can be found relatively cheap online, but it unfortunately wasn’t picked up by Funimation like seasons 3 and 4 were, so your success level may vary.  You can, however, watch the entire series on Amazon video.  The original manga by Kaishaku has not been released stateside.I haven’t seen a sequel put this much effort into fixing the problems of it’s predecessor since Cinderella 3.  does it have problems?  Of course it does, look at the franchise it’s in.  It was meant to have problems.  That’s why the quality of the series tanked right back down to insufferable levels in season 3.  But this season was different, as it had a director that tried, and put extra effort into making something awful into something watchable.  I’m not saying it was great, nor do I think it would have been fair to expect greatness from it, but I was honestly surprised at just how good it managed to be.  It was bogged down by a few unavoidable details, such as the idiotic premise and the bare bones budget, and it still wound up being really stupid on the whole, but by adding a well-thought-out comedic character and an awesome villain that presented a legitimate threat and a sympathetic backstory that didn’t take anything away from said threat, and by committing to writing even the most hare-brained situations with heart and substance, December nocturne was a lot of fun, and it’s a series that I’d recommend even to people who haven’t seen the first season.  I give UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie 2: A December Nocturne a 6/10.']"

Just watch episodes 1 and 2 and you\'ll definitely know if you\'ll like it. It has a nihilistic outlook that\'s gripping rather than pointlessly edgy. Most of the non-ninja characters are scum of the earth in completely banal ways rather than being cartoonishly annoying or mean. It\'s a breath of fresh air.

Want some ninja vs. ninja action? You\'ve got it!It\'s weird, it\'s frenetic, it\'s whacky — a full-on ninja war for both active and inactive people, who are unassuming people living amongst us...Among Us, Ninja Edition. And to think that this show would turn many heads into thinking that this is quite the fanfare, it definitely has its quirks that\'ll make it all the more absurd. And this show, coming from the author best known for his action-horror and psychological thriller hit manga series I Am a Hero, Under Ninja, is the prized mangaka Kengo Hanazawa\'s latest work to follow in...the same trend as its famed predecessor.Under Ninja\'s world comprises a fictional world where typical wars erupt like the Pacific War, but what remains are people known as the shinobi, a.k.a ninja, who, as the name suggests, conduct the usual assassinations in covert missions. However, as time passes after the war, there still exist ninjas in Japan; they\'re just hiding in plain sight, with their numbers racking in at 200,000, working in the dark in the public and private sectors and in all kinds of organizations. While some of the elite ninja work behind the scenes in national-level conflicts, the ninja at the end of the line is often unable to find work. And one of those ninjas happens to be a NEET by the name of Kuro Kumogakure. The 17-year-old high school dropout, sucking up to life\'s miseries, gets an assignment from his superiors, which calls for him to infiltrate a high school where ninjas are present. Together with his fellow ninja folks, Kuro sets out on a mission that would change his life forever from being a Genin to a capable ninja.First off, even though the world is full of ninjas, you NEED to understand that their serving organizations are actually very different. Kuro is part of the ninja organization NIN (National Intelligence of NINJA) that\'s not controlled by the government, with its elite members performing assassinations and sabotage in secret. Their enemy is the UN (Under Ninja), which aims to eradicate the remnants of NIN by way of competing against their advancement in Ninja gear. You got that? OK. It\'s characters, however, are quite over the top with their existentialism and way of operating, which gives them quite the pose that they are as ninjas: Kuro is comedic and low-ball with his replies and duties; Miracle Hibi is exactly what it says in the pseudonym name: a weirdo who can give electric shocks due to his ""Thunder"" moniker; Suzuki is the classic ninja warrior assassin, with their ninja chief Kato being their mobile HQ; and more. You also have the usual landlord of Oono trying to sniff his way through alcoholism with the landlady Kawado, a Russian foreigner on the verge of seeing dicks like wieners cut off, as well as the UN girls like Mako-chan and Mitsuki Yamada, who are just a force to be reckoned with in the high school that Kuro is assigned to. Furthermore, the acclaimed fatso of Sasama, talking cat, and motorbike that\'s almost like Blade Runner\'s Mustang? This series is unhinged by its many possibilities while still keeping its story plot interesting in every nook and cranny. And this is the strength of Kengo Hanazawa as a creative author, and with so many diverging plotlines, he has managed to keep the overall storytelling consistent and back to the point.Throughout its world and the many cast of characters, you will definitely be poised to identify who is who in this ninja vs. ninja world, because for one, Tezuka Productions\' in-house director Satoshi Kuwabara opted for a ""show, don\'t tell"" approach, meaning that all of the flashbacks and plot-thickening are definitely as intentional as they are, scraping off the manga\'s adaptation in a better order of storytelling that is plastered all over the anime. It\'s definitely jarring if you\'re expecting to refer back to the manga over the many interchanging sequences of events, but trust me, while the manga\'s original pacing gives the story a tone that fits it the most in a visual and readable form, the anime has a charm of its own that can be taken as its own remix of the original source material.That said, if I ever have to fault the anime for one aspect, it will have to be the production values. For a story like this, Tezuka Productions gave this show a rather low level of importance, which it really shows, especially in the action scenes that in this show have quite a fair amount of it that don\'t look quite as polished. Still though, if they nailed one thing from the manga, it would have to be its grittiness, unapologetic of the vulgarity of its world, and eccentric characters, which is a nice compliment to the unkempt comedy that the series has going for.The music is definitely a whole \'nother area of unhinged expression, and it definitely is the aspect best used to complement its gargantuan, complex world that is just the ongoing war between ninjas of different corporations. The OP and ED songs are quite the bop as well: Kroi\'s Hyper is the perfect combination of grimy, funky, off-putting, soulful, and lively vibe, while KOTOKI\'s ED is the nostalgic 90s throwback that\'s aided by the rather unique animation of Kuro traversing through the real world through his lens.Trust me when I say that Under Ninja as a show has a vibe that is uniquely one-of-a-kind, though it requires you to pay attention most of the time as it glosses through the frames of time to piece more than just the ninja vs. ninja story that it wants you to know. And that it rewards you over time when you finally understand its underlying plot and characters involved, which is always the usual big affair.Seriously, we need more shows like Under Ninja. I\'m always surprised, as an information-aware person, that there hasn\'t been a show like this in quite some time that always keeps me on my toes about what to expect next.

Sleeper hit with an interesting premise, good execution, the comedy lands very consistently, and in the couple moments thus far where it's taken its setting more seriously it works shockingly well. It's a breath of fresh air, especially for comedy anime, which even when done well rarely try something different stylistically.

What makes ""Under Ninja"" so enthralling is its plot, characters, and the plausible nature of the events depicted, which could feasibly unfold in our own reality under the guise of normalcy. The characters and clandestine organizations in this anime carefully conceal a trove of information, leaving me consumed by curiosity. I eagerly anticipate the release of the second season, and I must commend the impeccable art style, the commendable performances of the voice actors, the infectious energy of the opening song, and the consistently...cool music throughout the anime.

Yet, that\'s exactly what Under Ninja does.Now, as you might have guessed, the time jumps are pretty worthless. It\'s  (I\'m like 80% sure, will do a read-through of the manga very soon), a complete anime original filler. Chapter 1 of the manga doesn\'t do a time jump, so that\'s about how much it contributes to the story. In reality, the clips that you get to see in the future...don\'t matter at all, and it doesn\'t spoil or influence the story in any major way or form. It\'s like if you were spoiled that in a certain episode, the main character eats an apple for breakfast. It\'s essentially flavor text and nothing much more.However, it does set a pretty consistent theme for the show: that it\'s damn inconsistent. Plot points just bounce off the walls and the author desperately, and successfully, might I add, piece them together.No, you\'re not going to be looking at a realistic story. The author kind of just does what he wants and has world-building surrounding it. I could name so many plot holes because the author just doesn\'t care.You\'re going to have such high levels of technology that full and complete invisibility suits exist, and people are still fighting each other with shurikens and blades like it\'s the 1500s. You have interstellar space lasers, but there\'s no way to tack a GPS tracker on someone for it to lock onto. There are going to be AI-controlled vehicles, robots, brain transplants, and so many more high-tech gadgets yet you\'re stuck with no guns and hand-to-hand combat.Worldbuilding is similarly done after the fact. Ninjas are just assigned random missions with no clear goal in mind while they go to points of interest. There\'s a ton of random bits of politicking and history that don\'t really matter.But really, who cares? It\'s truly a type of story in which the author purposefully writes the most BS stuff in order to create a fun show for the viewers and readers.Under Ninja jumps from random small talk, beating up bullies, to firing off and killing people at the drop of a hat. You\'ll be going from one scene where people are calmly talking about the history of some random event, and the other will be two people desperately fighting it out. There are people who are desperate to find ninjas and randomly believe a road sign to be a secret communication channel for ninjas. The weird thing is that they actually show up. There\'s just a lot of surreal humor that goes on. There will be random drops of worldbuilding regarding the TV shows that NIN sponsors, to near-useless high-tech gadgets that don\'t impact the story at all. Then you just have random civilian characters uninvolved with ninjas just talking to them on a daily basis. And they take any bad news real well. Did someone they knew die? Oh well. Students whose entire sphere of influence dies out? Just a bad day. There\'s a lack of brevity or seriousness to all of the side civilian characters despite the macabre and politicking that they are exposed to behind the scenes. And this extends to the main characters where there will be people waiting patiently in line to fight to the death with each other.But that\'s what is so charming about this show. Nothing is compartmentalized. Shounen shows like Boku no Hero Academia where there are clear arcs and development are so cringe-filled with predictable tropes. You have the main character having dreams of becoming strong, going to school to hone his skills, making friends, fluffy slice of life, and fighting the bad guys. Oh no! My friend got kidnapped, gotta save him!!Under Ninja just does everything at the same time. People make small talk, people kill each other, people have sex and make friends, and you\'re still on the same episode. Under Ninja is unpredictably funny despite the random hodgepodge of plot points that come together. The show isn\'t random for the sake of randomness. It\'s random because it heightens the core of the show: characters.Each character is fun. They\'re fun to watch. Whether it be in conversation dragging on for minutes, talking about taking tests, fighting other people, backdoor scheming, or whatever is going on, the characters are interactive. Some are stuck in their situation. Some revel in it. Each has their own motivations which eventually get explored, but finding out parts of each character, even the side characters is fun. When seemingly filler conversations talking about alcohol with no real comedy mixed in still entices me, you\'re doing something right. What I love about the show is that you\'re not constrained to a certain narrative. The show goes in a round-robin order of showing off different characters in different situations that tie up to the actual overarching plot that\'s happening.Finally, we get to the actual plot itself. It goes without saying that it\'s kind of BS, but there are some good things about the general directions. First of all, is the theme of corruption and greed. Kuro\'s organization is not the ""good guys."" Neither is their rival organization, the UN, ""the baddies."" They both are shit. Top brass is corrupt like hell. People defect from both sides to benefit their own interests. There are factions, withholding information in their own organization to gain personal advantages, and there doesn\'t seem to be much of any sort of cohesiveness on both sides.  Kuro\'s just in the quagmire, ""boots on the ground"" where he follows orders or else he gets hunted down and dies. There\'s no ""holier than thou"" narrative where there are the good guys and bad guys. No one is out there to protect lives and save civilians.In the end, the way the story is structured reminds me of Chainsaw Man, another show that breaks traditional tropes and introduces chaotic elements in order for characters to have fun.And to be honest, I probably enjoyed this show more when it comes to core components. It\'s just that the show itself lacks too much budget. The voice acting kind of sucks. Kuro is good, but no...delivery of lines is just kind of garbage sometimes. The animation is beyond horrendous.

Whoever was responsible for writing the dialogue made it sound janky, but I applaud the voice actors for barely having an accent.-There are weird, perverted scenes in the anime? Not quite fanservice, but definitely ones that would make one uncomfortable if they didn\'t like seeing that stuff.

The show seems self aware in how absurd it is at first and thats what made it feel like a comedy but the last episode is simply insane and tries to add in multiple unexplained plot points at the last moment that it was no longer...funny and instead left me wondering how much i was meant to take seriously and how much of the show was a meme... funny and instead left me wondering how much i was meant to take seriously and how much of the show was a meme...', 'It\'s like The Room, except it\'s done on purpose, and an edgy ninja show. That\'s it. There is no comedic timing, or witty lines to indicate when you\'re expected to laugh. Under Ninja just throws the most absurd concepts and cliches at you, while remaining dead serious for the entire runtime. And the worst part is that all of it starts to make sense the longer you watch.I saw another review call it ""an anime watcher\'s anime"" and that might be the best way to describe it. Someone without extensive background knowledge would have a difficult time seeing the irony in this show. ', ""Here is my review of this anime in 2023!Story (7)The story is about a ninja who's popular since there is a murder case of a military army got killed by a katana. Their assumption is that the culprit must be a ninja. The main character is a man who's actually a ninja and he has to live normally like a normal person. But it's really hard to do since a lot of events are occurring and He has to fight. That's how his journey begins.Art (6)The art in this anime is fine! I like the color they were used to make this anime.

The opening and ending scenes can be much better.Sound (8)All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation.Character (7)The main and supporter characters are memorable since they have their unique personality.Enjoyment (7)It's enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.Overall (7)It's recommended to those who love action, comedy, and ninja vibes. prefer if they animate a lot in the battle scene and daily life such as the detail of grass moving or else to make it more eye-catching and the battle looks much more intense.

For those seeking complex story and high quality production, the anime would be a disappointment. However, for those looking for something a bit eccentric and keep you hooked, it might be worth a shot.Despite starting off with tense war scenes and some intriguing element, the story took a sudden turn when we entered the life of our protagonist, Kurou, a jobless *genin* (a lower-ranked ninja) who lived a rather unpromising life. The show was filled with Japanese-style dry humor; it\'s easy to mistake...as a datsuryoku-kei comedy at first glance. The nonsensical comedic situations persisted even as we reached the middle of the series (for example, the entrance exam in ep.5).As the narrative gradually unfolded, the truth and conflicts slowly came to light. Audiences were naturally drawn to the plot itself, and started to connect the dots on the ""laughable"" details. Absurdity remained, arising from the disconnect between the content and the narrative tone: the story frequently featured technology and abilities that seem unrealistic and comical, yet all the characters were really taking them seriously. The misalignment created the feeling of ""absurd in a serious way"", which was one of the pleasures of watching this anime.In the first few episodes, the story presented itself in a nonlinear way. Viewers were forced to jump among plotlines and characters of different time and places, until they eventually converged into one coherent narrative. While it is a commonly used approach, the presentation in this anime was a bit messy given the weekly release schedule. Watching the show in one go would likely enhance viewer experience and highlight the story\'s compactness.The animation of battle scenes left much to be desired. Most of the time character movements lacked fluidity, and their poses failed to convey the sense of action. To cover up these shortcomings, static frames and black screens were frequently employed. However, it\'s worth noting that the anime\'s selling point isn\'t the quality of its battles scenes; it was rather unimportant. Therefore, these issues won\'t significantly impact the viewing experience.The last episode added a touch of melancholy to the anime. It played with viewers\' expectations, but the viewers would still find it easy to relate with reality. Hope to see more of such wacky works! as a datsuryoku-kei comedy at first glance.

Hope to see more of such wacky works!', 'When thinking about what anime I am more interest in for this season, seriously, most of it seems to be quite typical. However, Under Ninja has caught my attention. It may be due to the uniqueness of the plot among many anime this season, many of which have a typical plot. Surely, Under Ninja wasn’t comparable to big names like JJK, Spy x Family, The Eminence in Shadow or Sousou no Frieren but Under Ninja has some unique storytelling. That’s the reason why, in my opinion, Under Ninja is a hidden gem of this season.Particularly, credit must be given to the storyboard, which is brilliantly...done. The plot may be interesting enough; however, the arrangement of storyboards has finely enlarged the potential the plot initially had. For instance, the introduction of the Russian guy at the beginning and him being the central event surrounded by hidden Japanese assassinators – Ninja that were gradually revealed. Until episode 4, the title of the show was recalled and that was where the real story of the show began. With the closing of the consecutive murders conducted by the Russian, we have finally got a clear image of what the anime is exactly about and of who Under Ninja is.Besides, the character design has been a personal favourite. Each character apparently carries a different personality, and most of them are weirdos. Not gonna lie, these weirdos did come along and create stunning chemistry and effects for the show. The noticeable characters somehow slightly remind me of Prison School which will break your common sense, especially considering that real-life Japan is the stage of this comical event.The progression of the plot was always intriguing, and the momentum was kept even until the last episode. Moving on to the plot per se, it displayed a ninja community that is hiding among the normal citizens, but at the same time, it later turned into bureaucracy division and conflict within the community which enlightened the gusto of the show as it began to show more battles. Honestly, it was quite disheartening to see how Kumogakure Kurou ended up in the final episode as bro has been acting so chill and dope throughout the show. This merely proved that Kurou was a Genin after all and he has no ability to confront such conflicts initiated by the finest ninjas above him.Last but not least, hopefully there will be a season 2 in the near future to see the Kumogakures who showed up surprisingly, take revenge for Kurou. Under Ninja is an interesting anime that you can give a try if you are tired of typical harem or shonen fights. Its peculiar story settings are what make it stand out among many names. done.

There were many points where I was caught off guard by its storytelling and comedy, even though I\'m aware that it is one of those wacky Seinen genre manga/anime. Unlike Naruto and other ninja shows, Under Ninja depicts its ninja as human being just as vulnerable to cuts and bullets just as we are, and rather than magic, they rely on scifi gadgets in combat. In fight scenes, the ninjas\' analysis on their opponents and situation are heavily monologued, and often laced with the emotions of caution or fear as their odds of...surviving are never in their favor. There are also a lot of deranged characters in this anime, some just mildly absurd, some creepily funny.Unfortunately, Under Ninja did not do well. I believe it\'s because of the lack of sexual appeal in the character designs. The character designs are mostly ""ugly"", they\'re not too realistic either. The main character isn\'t all that interesting either and a lot of the mysteries remain shrouded to the end of the anime.Still, I\'m a fan of wacky titles from the Seinen genre. It\'s been a while since I\'ve watched one too so 10/10. I laughed pretty hard one certain scene. surviving are never in their favor.

Then you will probably like this.This one was a rather sudden watch on my end when I decided to pick this up in the fall 2023 season but it managed to pique my curiosity a bit, atleast the first episode did. This anime was a jumbled bag of sorts. While at one hand it portrays a sort of a modern Ninja group who are living day to day lives and are hiding in plain sight doing what needs to be done but the execution left much to be desired. The premise was interesting no doubt but the execution is where I...have issues with this.Let's start with the main issue I have with this anime, I really think this anime should not have opted for the piece by piece storytelling style. I don't know if this was in the manga or this is just the Director's personal flair but it definitely can get really confusing really fast. Things are shown from the past and present perspective, events shown out of order to later be assembled for the wow factor (Something like Baccano you can say). But this does not work in the favour of the anime at all. In fact, at one point I thought stuff was happening in the present but it was infact the last. I have no issue with the pacing or animation and think those were done really well. The only thing detracting from my enjoyment of this kind of weirdly unique anime was the out of order storytelling which Iam not a fan of. Don't get me wrong, it works in several other shows where mystery is the driving force or in supernatural shows but in a realism dipped show like this it actually doesn't work in my opinion. It's something done for the shock value and wow factor but it has no impact.Now let's talk about the characters, The MC is one of the most bland characters I've had the displeasure of seeing lol. Like he seriously cannot be bothered to do something. His lack of enthusiasm or even remotely any interest in stuff really makes me not like his character at all. Character wise, I don't think there was even one standout character here. They are all wacky and do wacky stuff and that's about it. Nothing to write home about.Now let's start with the positives of this show aswellThe animation and artstyle is oozing style, definitely think it's perfect for this sort of anime and atmosphere.The opening and ending are absolute bangers aswell. Soundtrack was good and nicely placed.The ending for this was generally one of the most out of nowhere stuff I've seen recently and that increased my overall thoughts about this anime. The ending is such a big plottwist.All in all, definitely one of the most unheard of anime of the fall 2023 season and it definitely was interesting and tried to do something different which is appreciated. It did some bold stuff and the author used really unconventional ideas. It definitely deserves another season since it was enjoyable and I would love to watch more of it.I'll rate this an honest to goodness 7/10.

Thanks for reading!"", '\u200bI don\'t tend to write reviews on this website, because taste is so subjective. But I really enjoyed this anime and it seems to have a pretty small audience that paid attention to it, so if additional praise gets one or two more people to watch this then great.Story:9The general plot is that there is a hidden world of ninjas in modern Japan that were cultivated as a result of WWII. The reality though is that at some point there was schism in the ninja organization\u200b leading to factions who are in conflict with one another,  \u200bhow this conflict\u200b unfolds is the main drive...of the whole show. Because this show is narratively unique, the first half is spent introducing you to most of the main characters (as well as some red herrings) while revealing their motivations, and their skills as ninjas.The show chooses to do this with a non-linear narrative. It made the first two episodes a bit of a confusing slog, but once you understand what is happening it works really well to propel the action as you focus on a conflict occurring that will cut back to actions taken in prior days or weeks that led to the predicament the characters now find themselves in, or to foreshadow how a conflict will likely end based on previously unseen actions. However, after the stakes have mostly been set, the non-linear storytelling is replaced with a mostly normal linear style that still winks at the previous non-linear style from time to time when needed.I don\'t want to spoil all the twists and turns that occur, but I will state that this show purposefully obscures the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys. It seems the goal is for each character to be a mix of good and bad, with messy sides and motivations that have you questioning who is working with whom. It kept me at the edge of my seat as I tried to puzzle out the possible implications of the choices that everyone was making, and the very dire consequences that resulted from some decisions (people definitely die in this show).While the plot is unfolding the tone of the show flips back and forth between a very dry absurdist humor and drama. Terrible things will happen and be immediately undercut with humor. So many ridiculous moments are played straight by characters, including hand waving away a ninja who has been body-swapped into a cat that people seem to sometimes understand??. That last sentence sounds ridiculous, but it actually becomes an important plot point that makes the motivations of the mostly unseen leaders of ninja society murkier. The story is by far the strongest part of this anime for me, the only let down is the way it ends. So many new questions are created in the final five minutes, and it is unclear whether this show will get a second season to answer them.Characters:8The characters in this show are not the most complex, but they are clear and well thought out. Their behavior makes sense for how they are portrayed, and they don\'t make decisions simply because the plot needs them to. However, they are not that multi-faceted, and we get very little back story on what makes them tick. There are flashbacks to pieces of some characters\' past, but those mostly occur to explain a character\'s current motivation, not to flesh out who they truly are.Kurou is a standout as the protagonist, and I loved all of his interactions especially with his neighbors\u200b, who are mostly loveable simpletons. He comes across as apathetic and lethargic, but\u200b it becomes clear very quickly that he is a pretty clever fighter. He isn\'t too flashy or overly powerful, but he is good at playing to his strengths and using whatever the situation gives him to his advantage.This is an ensemble cast so the story jumps around to follow the many ninjas and civilians caught up in the central conflict of the schism, but for the most part I was just rooting for Kurou\u200b.Art:5As much as I loved this show the art is the weakest part, there is some really trash CG in the beginning that nearly had me turning the show off, but it\'s a 2-minute segment and then it goes away, so aside from that moment nothing else was as egregious. Even so, it was clear that there was not endless money put into animating the many fight scenes in this show, meaning there are a lot of cuts and still images. However, I would say that they manage to mostly be clever in how they depict action regardless of the lower production value of the show, it did not end up ruining my enjoyment of the fight scenes.Sound:7I loved the opening for this show. It was a banger so I never skipped it. The ending was fine, but not as loved. The music in the show was appropriate for the scenes it was in, but it didn\'t stand much otherwise which I think is fine for a show like this.Overall:8This was one of my favorite watches from the fall season, I started it, watched one episode, then put it on the shelf for months only to circle back and love it. I watched the 11 episodes in one sitting, once the plot got going, I just had to keep watching to see what would happen next. This is a show for people who need a plot to keep them invested, but who don\'t mind eccentric humor and some mildly unconventional storytelling at the same time.

It is quite compelling actually.And this story is THE Protagonist. In this anime singular characters don't matter, what matters is painting the ongoing, and escalating conflict between ninja factions. The main cast, secondary cast, none...of them matter if they're not contributing to this storytelling through either comedic relief or direct involvement (the scale of which goes way over the head of any of them that we get to know, even in passing), and after they're done, they can go fuck right off.I admit I've never seen game of thrones, but from what tidbits were forced into my throat by people who did watch it, I think it's quite similiar in it's stance to storytelling.For me it was a good watch, but I'm almost certainly not rewatching this. of them matter if they're not contributing to this storytelling through either comedic relief or direct involvement (the scale of which goes way over the head of any of them that we get to know, even in passing), and after they're done, they can go fuck right off.I admit I've never seen game of thrones, but from what tidbits were forced into my throat by people who did watch it, I think it's quite similiar in it's stance to storytelling.For me it was a good watch, but I'm almost certainly not rewatching this."", ""It's really refreshing to see and lives up to the seinen catagory because of the amount of literal engagement with the audience.The show was formatted well and feels watching a certain period in history but diggs deep into the characters and events that tells you what you really need to know in order to understand the story to the point where its willing to cut in-between the story. And without doing this there would be plot holes that would leave the audience confused and unsatisfied.Overall the show was great but had choppy animation that lead me to rate this a 8.75/10!

Watching this for plot is the same as trying to watch p0rn for plot which is equally absurd.Under Ninja felt curious when I saw the trailer. Ninja in modern day with whatever sci-fi and shenanigans, it can be fun, right? In a way. Turns out watching Under Ninja is like looking at a burning dumpster fire, you keep looking at it in amusement to see how long will it keep burning like that.I don\'t know how many will get this reference but for me it reminded of Ichi the killer movie or...Hobo with a Shotgun, stuff like that. Where those movies would use heavy parody, weirdness and lots of gore as a guilty pleasure type of movie for you to watch, Under Ninja is somewhat serious about itself. I have fun with things like that but as always, things still need some sort of purpose and the movie/anime whatever needs to understand what it tries to be.What Under Ninja basically is? It goes heavy on absurdity of everything happening in the show, from the characters, to gadgets, plots, dialogues, situations, fight scenes and outcomes but as the balance is off, it ends up feeling cringe and edgy, and not in the fun way. It tries to keep a straight face while running a never ending gag that has no punchline and no beginning.Let\'s delve in this just a little cause I prefer to erase it from memory.A fat ""dude"" with a breast milk pump keeps telling random kids to try the milk, over and over again. Like, ok, got it. Where is the punchline?An AI powered bike that asks to show tits and later driven by a ""cat"". Ok? It\'s absurd, yes, but where is the joke?Several Metal Gear references, haha, got it, we have a million of those.Exchanging a skateboard for a bra with some random kids. Ok... where is the punchline of a joke?Someone might say but this is just dry humor you moron. Humor is still humor, you create a situation that make you laugh about it, and there are plenty examples in cinematography and anime where jokes given with a straight face in a serious manner will be funny, because the jokes are good. Here, it\'s just off.Show generally comes across as gross and while I don\'t care about it, it\'s not even fun. Like watching a bunch of creeps jerking behind a tree.What else we have? A who-the-fuck-cares political plot based on bs, that has no reason to be dragged on the way it was to sound more intellectual than it is, please, just stick to gore filled fights and absurd dialogues and don\'t try into topics that don\'t fit. Ironically by the end of what seems to be 12 out of 24 episodes, the plot still makes no sense whatsoever with UN, ninjas and other ninjas fighting the battle because who-the-fuck-knows in some schools where it literally doesn\'t matter by the end, besides the short mini plot with ""Escape"".It also means that these 12 episodes are mostly like a prologue for the story itself.How is quality going on? It\'s horribly mediocre in every regard from cheap edited photo backgrounds, to boring recycled locations, to industry average quality of characters and nothing-to-write-home-about animation.VAs did a good job and they made it watchable.While some sophisticated viewers will stroke Under Ninja\'s shaft in search of deeper meaning and ""not your typical"" anime, I will throw it back in the trash and move on. A show where I had more fun watching the trailer than the show itself. Just cause you have absurdity and subvert expectations doesn\'t make for a good show. Hobo with a Shotgun, stuff like that. Where those movies would use heavy parody, weirdness and lots of gore as a guilty pleasure type of movie for you to watch, Under Ninja is somewhat serious about itself.

It\'s absurd, yes, but where is the joke?Several Metal Gear references, haha, got it, we have a million of those.Exchanging a skateboard for a bra with some random kids. Ok... where is the punchline of a joke?Someone might say but this is just dry humor you moron. Humor is still humor, you create a situation that make you laugh about it, and there are plenty examples in cinematography and anime where jokes given with a straight face in a serious manner will be funny, because the jokes are good. Here, it\'s just off.Show generally comes across as gross and while I don\'t care about it, it\'s not even fun. Like watching a bunch of creeps jerking behind a tree.What else we have? A who-the-fuck-cares political plot based on bs, that has no reason to be dragged on the way it was to sound more intellectual than it is, please, just stick to gore filled fights and absurd dialogues and don\'t try into topics that don\'t fit. Ironically by the end of what seems to be 12 out of 24 episodes, the plot still makes no sense whatsoever with UN, ninjas and other ninjas fighting the battle because who-the-fuck-knows in some schools where it literally doesn\'t matter by the end, besides the short mini plot with ""Escape"".It also means that these 12 episodes are mostly like a prologue for the story itself.How is quality going on? It\'s horribly mediocre in every regard from cheap edited photo backgrounds, to boring recycled locations, to industry average quality of characters and nothing-to-write-home-about animation.VAs did a good job and they made it watchable.While some sophisticated viewers will stroke Under Ninja\'s shaft in search of deeper meaning and ""not your typical"" anime, I will throw it back in the trash and move on. A show where I had more fun watching the trailer than the show itself. Just cause you have absurdity and subvert expectations doesn\'t make for a good show.', ""Under Ninja truly is something else. It's bizarre in a good way but the story is told terribly with characters being memorable only because of the absurd things they're doing.What is Under Ninja about? I'm not really sure. There are two Ninja groups, government sponsored NIN and private individuals UN, fighting for superiority. Why are they fighting? What are their goals? I have only a vague idea likely because of how much is going on. It was very difficult to follow week to week and remember the plot relevant things that happened because of the sheer amount of unimportant characters and how the story is...told. It jumps in time way too often during the first five episodes for absolutely no reason. For the remaining seven episodes new information is constantly thrown at the viewer as if we have any connection or knowledge to the characters infodumping. Following the stories of individual characters like Kuro is way easier than understanding the actual plot unfolding. Under Ninja would likely benefit from being binge watched instead of week to week, but I dont think it changes much. What I love is the unapologetically unhinged sense of humor, but it can go way too far like the hobo pumping breast milk in a public park and offering it to children. I only liked the Russian Foreigner arc and Kuro interacting with the people in his apartment complex, otherwise the plot was lackluster and impossible to follow. If you're confused, imagine how I felt watching it.The characters definitely carry the entertainment value. Kuro, the main character, is a quirky and talented genin without any drive. When he's not assigned a mission he's hanging out at home... the elderly Oono's spare room he started squating in. Kuro's dynamic with Oono and their neighbor Ai are some of the funniest parts of Under Ninja; they're like a dysfunctional family. The other Ninja like Hibi and Shion are almost completely forgettable. Neither have any impact on the unfolding plot and seemed to be an introduction for characters relevant later. I admittedly didn't remember any names outside of Kuro while watching the show and only remembered the strange things they did. There's the Russian Foreigner cutting dudes dicks off to become a ninja, hobo breast milk guy, girl who likes being groped, talking cat, and more who I don't remember any characteristics of. Besides their quirks, not a single character is memorable.The technical aspects of Under Ninja were incredibly mediocre. The animation is fine, doing nothing special besides trying to incorporate 3D animation occasionally. The Box Robot looks terrible in 3D and is incredibly jarring when it appears on screen. The animation the rest of the time is uninspired, not bringing anything new to the table. The music is also average; it sets the gritty tone without any memorability. The opening is killer and my favorite of the Fall 2023 season by far.Under Ninja is different from other anime, but I don't necessarily think this works in its favor. Maybe if you want a palate cleanser from the other stuff coming out these days or you wanted actual ninja stuff to happen in Naruto this is for you. I personally found nothing special in the overcomplicated story besides the sense of humor. Humor and fun character interactions can only carry it so far, however, so I'm unsure if I'd watch a second season.Plot: 4/10Characters: 6/10Animation: 5/10Sound: 5.5/10Enjoyment: 6/10Overall: 5.3/10 told.

However, this roller coaster seemed to only go downhill. At first I noticed a familiar style of drawing the characters. I was not wrong. The author of the original manga was Kengo Hanazawa. His manga 'I am a hero' brought me many positive emotions at the time. That is why I started watching UN with high expectations.But, there are always 'buts'. With each subsequent episode, my expectations for this show went lower and lower.What I thought was a kind of meta-ironic humor, which is only gaining momentum and will be revealed in the future, turned out...to be only a failed attempt to build gags on the subject of dark humor. The idea of combining a serious atmosphere with incredible absurdity is really worth it. But still, it just doesn't work right in this show. Cringe does not work as it should.A large number of interesting characters, all these secrets, the laws of their world - in 12 episodes, you simply cannot grasp all the available elements of the puzzle. There are too many characters, everyone seems so interesting, but they don't get enough screen time. A 24-episode season might have allowed for better exploration, but it is what it is.Also, in my opinion, the main problem of the show lies in the dialogues. While the dialogues with ordinary citizens are well written, the dialogues between ninjas are simply boring.I tried to love this show, I really tried. At first there was hope that in the last episodes the show would shine brightly,  the flower of Madao would bloom. But, there are always 'buts' and they make me sick. The ending turned out to be simply cruel, the unpleasant taste in my mouth has not disappeared. Well, at least the mystery with the Kuro clan at the end was a great cliffhanger for the sequel, as well as a sweet pill for me. to be only a failed attempt to build gags on the subject of dark humor.

the rest sure there is some kind of trama developing throughout the episodes but due their nature there are many inconsistent things and the fact that the series by itselft doesnt take it seriously at all is where their biggest weakness lies with some kind of plot that not only turn out to being stupid but also confunsing and really you could say with some plot holes overall.The thing is that even then is funny for most of the time sure not always land the jokes like expected but in general...in the comedy aspect was enjoyable and maybe the only thng why you would watch it to begin with, the series is classified as an action series which i could argue that is not the case even with their story revolving all around ninja there is very few moments where actual fights take place instead we have an inmensurable amount of comedy which in reality is their main genere, i mean just seeing the talking-cat driving a freaking motorbike is more than enough to make my point i leave out a lot of other examples but yeah.Animation wise wasnt good to being honest it did look kinda bad for moments and another times was fine but still nothing to go far  to call it good maybe could fool you a little just because most still frames looks kinda decent.Sound wise the op and end were dope pretty good, the ost in general forgettable but its an comedy what can we expect.The characters are on design and persona just freaking hilarious XD i mean one more strange and rare than the other which makes for such wtf moments and situations along all the series and gonna make you laugh more than once.I want to say that i found myselft seeing under ninja clinging from time to time between the seriousness and comedy but just failed quickly each time to convey something that you could call something ""solid"" story and character wise even if i got some glimpses of that sporadically.This season ends in a manner pretty unexpected ( at least that was the case for me) and quite surreal although this series has nothing normal in it XD, if you are into comedy then this is for you i feel animelist should fix the genere on this because is more than obvious that rather than action what predominates is the comedy and might give the wrong impression to people like me who delved into this anime expecting something where the fights taked more presence.I had i good time watching it and laughted a lot but still hope that with this review i can give an idea of what you are getting into for those interested on it.pd: if you are searching another series of the same genere that i could say is much better than this on the comedy and you really are gonna laugh the entirety of the series is prision school just writing this review maked me remember that one which i enjoyed a lot hahaha

'Summary: Unnecessary back and forth in timeline, boring family-name jokes, sexual contents in unpleasing way, a total mess.I don\'t even need to talk about Japanese victim mentality on their forced pacifism (If you want to know in detail, refer to ""Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution"" in wiki.) to classify this animation as a bad one. I have not read the original comics, so I\'m not sure if all the wrongs are made by origin or by animation.It goes back and forth in timeline very often, and some scene changes happen in unexpected timing. If used properly that kind of twists may bring an extra...impression, but in this show they were very inhospitable and did not bring any positive impact.To illustrate personality of characters it uses a lot of naughty talks, such as Kurou\'s family-name jokes and Sasama\'s breast milk jokes. And for fan service it contains many sexual contents, but none of them are in a good way. I don\'t know if someone likes them, but not for me.Hard to find a character that audiences can sympathize with, especially Saruta who slaughtered hundreds of civilians.

The ehm... let\'s call it a ""Stroy"" is also unique in its own way and some characters are funny.And now the bad things: The whole rest!As I just said the story is unique. Also, I don\'t have problems with stories you have to think about to understand everything like in Serial Experiments Lain, King of Thorns, or the Info dumping within the first episodes of Steins;Gate and DURARARA!!But the difference is that those Anime have a good story and once...you understand everything, it gets even better. But Under Ninja...There are just too many mistakes. For example, within the first episodes it goes always back and forth, which is not a problem, BUT(!) there are also several storylines mixed together which don\'t have any connection - or at least it feels this way since this Anime constantly throws in new characters and relations, while also having the time jumpes and with no explanation where the story is going to or if it even has a goal.Let\'s be honest, even at the end you get kinda info dumped and things happen where you ask yourself ""WHY?!""I would like to explain it further buw I don\'t want to spoil anything in case you still want to watch it.But even that would be okay, IF the characters would be compelling so that you want them to succeed, and yeah, some characters are good written so that you care for them, but those are exceptions. Tbh, even the lady side character with the big boobs was more interesting than the Male MC you get introduced to since he has the charisma of a box bread. And having a lot of characters with really a lot of side characters is no problem as long as they get fleshed out like in Tensura or Mirai Nikki - but unfortunately that\'s not the case here.However, what upsets me the most, is the fact that some of the side characters I really cared for (since they were actually good written) just get killed in the end... but than in the final minutes you get new characters thrown in in a way which is... well, just uninteresting.All in all, I really tried to get myself into this Anime but except for some few scenes I couldn\'t enjoy it. Just a waste of time. Hell, even Isekai de Cheat Skill... Level Up wa Jinsei wo Kaeta was better balanced and more compelling than Under Ninja and it kinda hurts me to admit that.So, if you have no expectations whatsoever and just want to see an Anime, go for it - But if you want to see a good Anime with Ninja in it, better watch Naruro or... damn, even Senran Kagura which is 90% Fan Service would be a better choice. you understand everything, it gets even better.

Absolutely horrible. The art style itself gives me anxiety and the animation depression. Like seriously I'm getting anxious when watching this.The story is weird. Sometimes weirdness works but this is a bit much in my taste. Linear storytelling is boring sometimes but this could have used it a bit more. Also what is wrong with the dialogue? They're trying to implant little snippets of stupid funny banter but I don't get it. Why? Is this a comedy? I guess it is but I don't get this style of comedy. Am I missing something crucial about Japanese...everyday life or culture? Still quite enjoyable.What I do like is the voice acting. It's trying to be somewhat realistic, so it's refreshing. There are a couple of stereotypically anime-voices which in my opinion should've been removed. No need for them. everyday life or culture? Still quite enjoyable.What I do like is the voice acting.

"Shikabane Hime: Kuro – Soredemo, Hito to Shite",https://myanimelist.net/anime/6344/Shikabane_Hime__Kuro_–_Soredemo_Hito_to_Shite,"[""Its an ova episode that takes place before Makina and Ouri met. Its about Minai Ruo the shikabane hime that gets treated badly.(spoilers) basically she lived with an abusive boyfriend after a while she was so scared she stabbed him and he died. Filled with guilt she committed suicide. When she woke up she discovered that her body was broken later monks found her tied her up and questioned what to do with her.Then Keisei was asked to be her shikabane hime since he left his card at her work place. Anyways he declined then Shuji Isaki lied...and accepted to be her contracted monk. He neglected her and insulted her but, it later turned out that he used her to try to get back at his older brother. His brother would do anything for money and he was scum. After that they developed a bond and it turned out they met each other as kids when he was helping run a family shop and Minai ate there when her parents were away at work.So Shuji Isaki the abusive monk actually did care about Minai even though he didn't show it. So hes not a completely bad person (watch episode 7 and 8 you will know who I am talking about). I wrote this review because Minai is my favorite character from the series.

Its about Minai Ruo the shikabane hime that gets treated badly.(spoilers) basically she lived with an abusive boyfriend after a while she was so scared she stabbed him and he died. Filled with guilt she committed suicide. When she woke up she discovered that her body was broken later monks found her tied her up and questioned what to do with her.Then Keisei was asked to be her shikabane hime since he left his card at her work place. Anyways he declined then Shuji Isaki lied...and accepted to be her contracted monk. He neglected her and insulted her but, it later turned out that he used her to try to get back at his older brother. His brother would do anything for money and he was scum. After that they developed a bond and it turned out they met each other as kids when he was helping run a family shop and Minai ate there when her parents were away at work.So Shuji Isaki the abusive monk actually did care about Minai even though he didn't show it. So hes not a completely bad person (watch episode 7 and 8 you will know who I am talking about). I wrote this review because Minai is my favorite character from the series.

After that they developed a bond and it turned out they met each other as kids when he was helping run a family shop and Minai ate there when her parents were away at work.So Shuji Isaki the abusive monk actually did care about Minai even though he didn't show it. So hes not a completely bad person (watch episode 7 and 8 you will know who I am talking about). I wrote this review because Minai is my favorite character from the series.

Its about Minai Ruo the shikabane hime that gets treated badly.(spoilers) basically she lived with an abusive boyfriend after a while she was so scared she stabbed him and he died. Filled with guilt she committed suicide. When she woke up she discovered that her body was broken later monks found her tied her up and questioned what to do with her.Then Keisei was asked to be her shikabane hime since he left his card at her work place. Anyways he declined then Shuji Isaki lied...and accepted to be her contracted monk. He neglected her and insulted her but, it later turned out that he used her to try to get back at his older brother. His brother would do anything for money and he was scum. After that they developed a bond and it turned out they met each other as kids when he was helping run a family shop and Minai ate there when her parents were away at work.So Shuji Isaki the abusive monk actually did care about Minai even though he didn't show it. So hes not a completely bad person (watch episode 7 and 8 you will know who I am talking about). I wrote this review because Minai is my favorite character from the series.
