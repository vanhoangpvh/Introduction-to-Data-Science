To Heart 2 OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1720/To_Heart_2_OVA,"['For me, as to why I find this OVA interesting is the author\'s use of the harem, I guess this OVA is more like a continuation for the other members of the harem to be able to be with the muchacho (lead male character) , though Manaka was was able to have another supposed opportunity to be with the muchacho (that\'s in OVA1), but you know, what really do make the story of this OVA good (including the anime itself) is the authors well use of the genre\'s, so I here by give it an 8 for the story.The art itself is fairly good (6)...and so as the sound (6), the characters role kinda represent a different genres, but the main point of it all is the muchacho who is represents a kind hearted soul which every members of the harem connect with, so I rated it as an 8. The enjoyment is  very good and the author really defined the the phrase ""FOR GENERAL VIEWING"" which can be viewed by all ( as long as you forget the panty shots).Overall, I thinks the author of this anime should have made a season 2 instead of a couple of OVA\'s. So, at this point we can only hope. (my overall rate is 8) and so as the sound (6), the characters role kinda represent a different genres, but the main point of it all is the muchacho who is represents a kind hearted soul which every members of the harem connect with, so I rated it as an 8.

Sumomomo Momomo: Chijou Saikyou no Yome,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1568/Sumomomo_Momomo__Chijou_Saikyou_no_Yome,"['THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSSumomomo Momomo.. an anime that for 21 and 9/10 episodes I liked... and was prepared to put this into my list of one of my more favorite romantic comedies.  But I was horribly let down.  And I am pissed off about it!  Why!?  Well I guess you\'ll have to read on!The premise is pretty simple and in typical anime fair, ridiculous but cute in its own way.  Momoko\'s father having told her that she will never be able to master her families martial arts clan signature move, must go seek out the strongest man and make strong...offspring!  To which Momoko replies, ""Hai!""  I found this pretty humorous at the start of each episode.  Though this is a bit of a falsehood since we learn shortly that Momoko\'s father and Koushi\'s have made a prearrange marriage for the two of them to unite the martial arts world and keep peace.  While this seems to be an interesting premise on the surface the story never really develops this concept, beyond different factions sending assassins to kill Koushi.  There is even a scene towards the middle of the series where several female martial artists unknown to the story up to then make comments about making him their husband but then we never hear from them again.  Other characters also appear seemingly having more to offer the story and then just as quickly vanish without any explanation. I do give the story a good rating though solely on a couple of arcs that are pretty interesting and funny.With the exception of Koushi (more on him later) I give Sumomomo\'s characters a very good rating.  Momoko , Iroha, and Sanae are great.  The series does a great job in developing their personalities and backgrounds, though Momoko\'s back story is surprisingly weak compared to the other two female leads.  The show does a good job at keeping the cast at a minimum for the most part, which is a good thing.  A lot of shows allow themselves to be bogged down with huge numbers of characters that take away from the development of the mains.  I fell in love with all three of the girls, especially Momoko (who couldn’t love her!).  Hanzo was also very funny as was the appearances by the old landlady who provided a lot of laughs in her search for rent money or her bizarre training of Sanae.Now on to the bad of the characters.. Koushi.  Momoko’s love, she devotes herself totally to him, unselfishly protecting him from assassins, cooking and cleaning for him, unconditional love.. like a puppy.  Regardless of how cruelly she is treated in return.  Koushi\'s reject on her is pretty funny, especially of her more outlandish behavior (like pulling a futon out of nowhere to make babies), at first.  But the show beats this over and over and over again until it starts to become unfunny and starts to just be mean.  Koushi comes off, well like an asshole.  While sometimes he seems to have feelings for her, it is completely forgotten 5 minutes later and was back to where we started.  So for a show that is supposed to be a romance as well as comedy there is really zero development on this plot point.  He also is wimpy, hides behind girls the entire show, and seems to be selfish and the only time he seems to have any genuine concern about someone else is when his own skin is in danger and not having that person around means he’s getting his butt kicked.  Why Momoko, Iroha, or Sanae want to protect him or even like him baffles me at times.  By the end of the show I find myself thinking that Momoko should have just let the jerk die.The art is pretty good, the show uses ""chibi"" style animation a lot, which is a favorite of mine and it does it well enhancing the comedy in a number of places.  Though the non-chibi models of Momoko and Iroha are a bit too small for their supposed ages and them come off a little too loli like and is a bit creepy sometimes.  I am a big Aya Hirano fan and her voice for Sanae is great, the other acting is good too, though I think Momoko\'s voice sometimes doesn’t fit all of the time.  The songs are a mixed bag too, the first opening song is pretty good but the rest are fairly mediocre.Overall I did like this show for the most part, and I was going to give it a rating of 8.  But did I mention that ending?  Yeah, it was that bad IMO.  If you thought all of Momoko\'s hard work and feelings was going to be accepted and end in a satisfying emotional reward, well um not really.  Just when you think you’re about to get the payoff, your let down.  It’s like going to a cake shop and seeing this wonderful looking cake and buying it and then when you taste it finding out that it doesn’t taste as good as it looked.  The show has a lot of funny things in it and maybe for a lot of people you will probably not mind the end as much as I did.  But if you in any way like to see a show wrap up with real endings that show something did change from episode 1 to the final, then you will probably be disappointed in it as well. offspring!

In fact, even up to episode 14, that's still fairly accurate. But saying just that doesn't really cover everything that the series is.STORY:  8 out of 10The plot is basically that Inuzuka Koushi and Kuzuryuu Momoko, the respective heirs to their martial arts family bloodlines, are arranged to be married in order to maintain peace among the Zodiac families. Momoko, heir to the Dragon line and an awesome martial artist, is seriously excited about marrying Koushi,...but Koushi, heir to the Dog line and a terrible fighter who just wants to be a lawyer, isn't exactly thrilled. Assassin's that oppose the marriage try to kill Koushi, noting that he's the weak link of the two. Simple, silly plot line. However, the story develops in such a way that we learn more about each of the characters involved without really losing relevance to the overall story that often. Filler episodes aren't common (though they do exist), but when they crop up, they are at least funny.ANIMATION:  7 out of 10This series isn't the prettiest to look at, both in matters of animation and style (that's without mentioning the fantastically ridiculous cg). However, the character designs are cute, and the animation is at least utilized in an effective manner. One thing in particular I like is that they didn't cut animation costs by making the characters talk out of the sides of their mouths when they're in profile --- their mouths and jaw's actually open! Kudos for that, at least.SOUND:  8 out of 10The first OP and ED are both catchy as hell once you get used to how cracked out they are, and the background music serves it's purpose in mood setting. I have yet to decide whether I like the new OP and ED, though, because I was so attached to the first ones.CHARACTER:  10 out of 10Yes, I know the series has tons of fan service. But underneath that, you see that the characters are more than just fan service/comedy machines. Despite thier ridiculousness, their storylines manage to make you care deeply for thier troubles, and wish the best for them. For example:  Though Hanzo has every chance to take advantage of Iroha (who he is obviously attracted to), he doesn't. He's older, larger, and lives alone with her, and yet he respects, fears, and adores her for who she is. Even though you need to peel back the layer of anime humor to see this, it's still there.ENJOYMENT:  10 out of 10Definitely one of the most fun series I'm currently watching. Not only is it hilarious, it can also be surprisingly touching. A good, lighthearted series. In my book, a show needs only to achieve it's goals to be successful, and in that, Sumomo definitely passes.OVERALL:  9 out of 10Definitely recommended for anyone who can get past the fan service long enough to see this series worth. but Koushi, heir to the Dog line and a terrible fighter who just wants to be a lawyer, isn't exactly thrilled.

When a series throws ecchi and slapstick comedy at you for 20 episodes straight and then gives you a dramatic, tear jerking ending... your brain explodes and you\'re just left speechless. I had to think a while to decide what kind of a review I was going to give this series, more importantly I wasn\'t sure on the rating. I could give it a 9 for pulling off such an incredible combination or I could give it a 3 for being absolutely ludicrous. I decided to give it a 9, read on to find out why.First of all, this series should be...listed under the Hentai category. It starts off in the weirdest way possible. The female lead, Momoko is an innocent looking girl who aspires to become the world\'s top martial artist. She fails to master a certain technique and what\'s her father\'s solution to that? To find the world\'s strongest man and make babies who will later become the world\'s most powerful martial artists. Her reply? ""HAI!""What follows then is a series of absolutely the wackiest scenes you will ever see in an anime series. I guarantee you that. Momoko finally finds her man, Inuzuka Koushi, and after a set of even whackier scenes wins his father\'s approval for a marriage. She then prepares a makeshift bed and asks Koushi to make love to her and Koushi promptly refuses. Yeah and this is only the very beginning of the very first episode.As it turns out, Koushi\'s father and Momoko\'s father have made an arrangement when they were born and that arrangement was to have Momoko and Koushi marry. Soon the whole thing comes into picture as we learn that Momoko and Koushi both belong to greatly respected martial arts famillies and their marriage was arranged to produce the world\'s strongest martial arts clan. Koushi however is not a martial artist but rather a weak, though intelligent, person who is not interested in violence in the slightest.Barely 2 episodes later we already know most of the main characters and the true over top craziness begins. Koushi takes on the role of the stereotypical sex symbol and every girl around him literally begs him for sex. I\'m not trying to be funny either, this is what actually happens in this anime. I\'m only giving you a heads up, discretion is advised. There\'s not a single episode where Momoko doesn\'t stun us with lines like "" I need your juice"" or "" Rock me sensless "". The rest of the main female cast, Iroha and Sanae is no better. It\'s like they\'re ready to do anything for Koushi without hesitation. Indeed, the meeting of Iroha and Koushi is sure to give even the most experienced romance/ ecchi connoisseur the nosebleed of his life. And this anime will bombard you with these type of sexual and more often than not perverted scenes episode after an episode, scene after scene. Interestingly enough, the girls are the only ones who are being naughty here as the male lead, though attractive, has absolutely no sexual drive or interest in any things sexual. He\'s more of a selfish self-centered bookworm more concerned with his studies than anything else.The rest of the male cast is not even worth mentioning, they\'re only there to be jealous of Koushi and his female fanclub. None of them are given an episode and even though we are given some background information on them, they\'re so shallow and plot-insignificant they could have just as well been removed from the anime and you wouldn\'t even notice it.The series progresses like this, with occasional serious or dramatic moments, up until episode 20 and that\'s when the seriousness and drama starts. All I\'m going to say about the ending is that it wasn\'t as bad as I thought it would be. It could have been a lot more satisfying but it wasn\'t bad. As many reviewers have already mentioned and I mentioned it myself too, Koushi is a bit of a prick with an attitude problem, especially with the way he treats women. Unfortunatelly that doesn\'t change in the end and it\'s just one of those things that annoys the hell out of you.The sound and art are both good. I have no complains in this department. The design on the girls and the male lead are perfect and the slapstick comedy oftenly involves scaled down chibi versions of the main characters which worked pretty good and didn\'t ruin the overall feel of the series. Voice acting was convincing and not once did it feel out of place, likewise the opening and ending songs were very good.All in all this series makes a great job at taking all these ingredients together - ecchi, romance, comedy, harem and even drama and a slight bit of seriousness - and mixes them and produces a truly great anime series. This will be going into my favourite anime list and I will be rewatching this series in the not so distant future. And that is the reason why I gave it a 9 and that\'s the reason why I personally recommend this series to anyone reading this review. listed under the Hentai category.

Anyway, I was very very very skeptical about how this anime was going to turn out. I came out of the first episode thinking, meh, that wasn't horribly interesting or engaging. But one day I got bored, and I mean REALLY bored, so I thought &quot;what the heck, I'm feeling like something stupid and ecchi&quot;. That really is all it seems like at first, but as the story develops, the characters...and the plot become strangely addicting, simplistic as they may be.Story: 8/10It isn't the greatest or most original story. Kuzuryu Momoko's father made an agreement with Inuzuka Koushi's father (both being martial artists) that their children would marry to &quot;produce the strongest offspring&quot;. When I saw this line 2 minutes into the show, I thought &quot;you've got to be kidding me...&quot; Sure, there is the whole predicament with loads of martial artists battling over the fate of Japan, but since you don't see enough of that, it becomes virtually irrelevant in the plot. That doesn't seem to matter, however, as the plot always stays engaging in some sense or another. Mainly what you see are the funny interactions between Koushi and Momoko, and how other girls play into this affection towards Koushi. He pays most of them no heed, except for one. Expect many love webs, basically. All in all, the plot is not horribly complex, but it is refreshingly simple.Art: 7/10I very much disliked the art in the beginning of the anime. Whenever I start to watch an anime with unfamiliar eye styles, I get thrown off. This was one of the reasons behind me dropping the show, but after I watched more of it, I began to get used to it. It annoys me how Momoko looks 10 years old, but whatever. Besides that, the art is very... average. Nothing astounding, but that's not what's great about this anime.Sound: 7/10Again, nothing special here, just your average sound effects. The first OP really annoyed me at first, but now its so catchy that I can't get it out of my head... noooooo. Anyway, just expect the usual here.Character: 9/10At first all the characters seemed very... well, stereotypical. The sound, art, and story were, so I wasn't expecting much from the characters. However, as more and more people are introduced into the plot and you learn more about the past, you get to know the characters very well, and begin to favorite or despise certain people. I find myself getting into each episode, even if its a filler, and usually each character has enough screen time so that you can get to know them, which is refreshing.Enjoyment: 10/10I was VERY surprised at how addictive this anime became. With a somewhat interesting plot, average sound, and OK art, you would think the enjoyment would go along the same path. You, my friend, can join me in the world of People who were Wrong about Enjoyment Values of Certain Animes (Pretty neat world, really).Anyway, back to the main point. There is rarely an anime that makes me literally laugh out loud. Naruto re-uses the same jokes, Bleach was never horribly funny. But sometimes this show will throw something at you with such great timing and humor that you can't help but laugh. Some of the moments on this show are so priceless, especially when you aren't expecting them. Of course, there is also the ecchi part of this anime that falls under the enjoyment factor. Lots of situations like this happen almost every episode, and its this that bonds the anime together. Not like that's a problem though; every episode is great, and I don't find myself asking &quot;is this a filler? I hate those things...&quot; Every filler stands up for its name: It really does fill the space with quality material.Sumomomo Momomo proves that it's not the action that makes the anime: It's how much it can engage you, and draw you in with something unique. It truly has this special uniqueness, although it may be a bit cliche. The characters are what this is really about; when you know everyone well, you can really understand why each situation is played out the way it is, and the characters never do something unusual or without a reason. Sumomomo Momomo is definitely one of the most under-rated animes, and with such great enjoyment and character values, it deserves more time in the spotlight. Give it a try, don't get thrown off by the first few episodes. Enjoy :) and the plot become strangely addicting, simplistic as they may be.Story: 8/10It isn't the greatest or most original story.

It truly has this special uniqueness, although it may be a bit cliche. The characters are what this is really about; when you know everyone well, you can really understand why each situation is played out the way it is, and the characters never do something unusual or without a reason. Sumomomo Momomo is definitely one of the most under-rated animes, and with such great enjoyment and character values, it deserves more time in the spotlight. Give it a try, don't get thrown off by the first few episodes. Enjoy :)"", 'If  your  wondering , is this  anmie  worth  looking at  , let  me assure  that  not only is it worth your while , it will leave  you very  satisfied  afterward as well.The one thing that hit me the most  about this  anmie , was just  how well developed and written  the story and its characters were.whilst  not  being the most original of tales, nevertheless  it  had the ability  to cause  you  to connect and relate  to each and very one of...it characters , each with their own  loves, hates, quirks and  follibies. its that  good.I dont even remember,the last time,I felt for a character like  I felt  for  sanae Nakajima ( the Horse  girl)  in  her unique  situation.Any more would be a spoilerBut , if there was someone  i was rooting for it would be her.So the fact  , i would fee like that , is hats off to the folk  would produced this gem. it characters , each with their own  loves, hates, quirks and  follibies. its that  good.I dont even remember,the last time,I felt for a character like  I felt  for  sanae Nakajima ( the Horse  girl)  in  her unique  situation.Any more would be a spoilerBut , if there was someone  i was rooting for it would be her.So the fact  , i would fee like that , is hats off to the folk  would produced this gem.', 'This anime could\'ve been better. After finishing it i\'m disappointed. Because at the start it was funny, unique, fast paced, espontaneous, entertaining. And all those assets start to slowly drop as the series goes on.They did a great job making it look like the characters progress, like they overcome their most secret and personal problems, but it\'s absolutely all the contrary. The characters and the story never progress after the very first episodes. Again, the series did a great job making it seem like it. After that we are left with some sort of repetitive slice of life, two filler episodes and a rushed all-of-a-sudden...ending.Koushi and momomo burn out in the first episodes and become repetitive very fast, specialy Momomo saying Koushi-dono 10 times per episode. It woldn\'t be a surpise if you end up hating on her.How does the series compensate for this? Adding a mumbo jumbo of new villans every 3 episodes, villans that don\'t add anything  but to make time for the rushed ending that is supposed to give this series a meaning.The thing that i disliked the most was the use of CGI.This just has one unique purpose in the series and we\'re going to see it a lot. Sometimes it\'s done so badly, it breaks the whole picture. Making the scene look horribly goofy. 2D and 3D definitely don\'t mix well in this anime.The art is very basic, in the sence that character desings and backgrounds are just that, basic. Nothing new. Not a single time you\'ll stop the video to appreciate the image because there\'s nothing stunning about it. It\'s just ok, it\'s acceptable. So let\'s move on.Now with all of this said, was it worth it? I\'m doubting but i\'ll say yes. Because a strong point for this anime is it\'s ""comedy"". They\'re no jokes but funny scenes. And a lot of them. Very well made.That\'s why i finished this series, the humor covers a little the mess of the plot, and how the series goes in circles for 22 episodes.Some things do progress and change, the family gets ""bigger"" if you will.But nobody gets what they say they want.This was a 9 that developed as a 7 or 6.If you\'re looking for a definitive ending, and not an open one.

The world of martial arts, intense ki, and lame jokes all over the place, and lolis, cannot forget the lolis.Story-7 out of 10The basic story of this series is fairly linear and predictable, but it isn't so much this way that it cannot be enjoyed, or ruined by any specific thing (other than spoilers of course). While you might be able to guess what's going to happen next, it does not necessarily mean you will not be wanting to watch more into it.The series starts off fairly slow, and doesn't really get going until later on, but once it...does, that's when its story elements shine. While it never becomes truly glorious at any one point, its still thoroughly entertaining if you can get past the intense levels of cheese.Art-7 out of 10The art of this series is fairly nice, when you look at it from an individual character stance, but altogether, it feels rather off at times, as the mixture of lolis and normal sized (sometimes immense) men and ladies doesn't really mix all too well, but this is easy to overlook as the rest of the series has a very nice feel to it.Sound-9 out of 10Sound for me is one of the most vital parts for an anime, and this series did a fantastic job on it. The music for this series is just outstanding, and almost always very fitting for every situation, not to mention that along with that, they also sound very good, and I would love to listen to them in my casual time because I felt they were just that good.Characters-8 out of 10The characters of Sumomomo have very good developement for nearly the entire cast. Granted, some of the characters get nothing more than a small backstory, its still a very nice touch for a character who may or may not be there for more than 1 or 2 episodes, though I do wish the main characters got a tad more backstory, often times, they felt overshadowed by some of the supporting cast.Enjoyment-7 out of 10This series is great for those who really like lame jokes and spaztic situations (like me!), but often times at the beginning relies too heavily on fan service. This however seemingly lightens up over time, give or take a few scenes, and the jokes just fly out one after the other. This all, along with a nicely developed ending, adds up to be quite a nice combonation.Overall-8 out of 10I think in the end, this series is a fine series to watch, but not to be taken too seriously. does, that's when its story elements shine.

disappointment and quickly forgot this one.The story begins with the fathers of Momoko Kuzuryuu and Koushi Inuzuka who made a deal that their kids would get married, but when the time came for this Koushi wasn't exactly on board and now his life was about to become very different from his usual days.Now the story was pretty disappointing to watch not because it was boring or even annoying it just didn't turn out the way I thought...it would, I did like the diversity of the Martial artist families that would show up from time to time and the whole meaning of what it means to be a martial artist, but what really annoyed me was the chemistry between Momoko and Koushi now to be honest it's pretty much Koushi's fault really because he is unlikable as hell which I'll get to in a minute, the pacing was pretty meh as well even it was fillers with some story episodes as well it just didn't mix well for me and I just couldn't get interested often.The characters were really a mixed bunch, the male characters weren't really likeable, but the female characters weren't too bad and were pretty much what kept me going on the show.Momoko is the Main female character who is a loli and is a dragon of the Chinese Zodiac who wants to get married to Koushi so she can have a strong child, she is also a very hyperactive and strange person however that doesn't mean she was a bad character because I was actually rutting for her throughout the series and actually felt really sorry for when her advancements didn't get any notice.Koushi the Main male character is a bit of an asshole because he is has quit doing martial arts because of an incident with bullies and wants to be lawyer instead, but his interactions with Momoko make him a very unlikable person as he treats her like a piece of dirt even when she does all the house work for him he still doesn't show much appreciation for her efforts and even when he tries he does it so poorly it just annoyed me so much.Sanae Nakajima is Koushi's classmate and his class representative although secretly she is the Horse of the Chinese Zodiac and has a heroine persona called Tenchū Senshi Uma Kamen or Divine Punishment Warrior Horse Mask, her costume which looks like something out of Kill La Kill enhances her martial art skills, but they only get more powerful if she reduces the amount of clothing she is wearing, now she isn't a bad character and you understand her resentment to martial arts since she has feeling for Koushi, but she has to put up with it to uphold her families legacy.Iroha Miyamoto who is a 15 year old assassin who tries to kill Koushi, but she eventually falls in love with him and goes to the same school as him to get to know him better, Iroha is pretty much a Tsundere since she likes hitting her subordinate around whenever he does something wrong or wastes their money, but she wasn't a bad character since she does help the others from time to time.Hanzo is Iroha's subordinate and has a crush on her so obviously to find out she likes Koushi hit him real hard and makes him grow a hatred for Koushi, but he is a pretty unlikable character not as bad as Koushi, but his personality created more harm than good for the others.The artstyle didn't really stand out for me, but I did like some of the martial arts moves that Momoko and Sanae did from time to time and I also liked the look of Sanae's outfit despite how ridiculous it looked.The action was solid and did keep me entertained since it showed how badass Momoko was when it came to fighting other people which showed she was a useful person and the final battles in the final episodes was actually pretty good too, but it was too far between all the parts that were pretty dull.The Romance was painful to watch because it was just annoying watching Koushi acting like an asshole to Momoko all the damn time, there were a few sweet moments, but they were too far between all the annoying as hell stuff.Overall this was a very mixed bag and by the end I was just glad to be done with it, it had something going with it with the female characters which made me feel this should've been an adventure anime about them beating up bad guys or something which would've been way more entertaining, the only reason you should watch this is if you're a martial arts fan because if you're a Romance fan all you'll get is

Shin Angyo Onshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/884/Shin_Angyo_Onshi,"['What can I say.. the animation is very nice. Though this anime does surpise you at times. It has random moments like when certain characters die. Although the anime balances itself out nicely. Out of 1 through 5 I give this anime a 3/5 . Its not for everone. All I can say if you seem interested in it.. then give it a watch. You should be pretty pleased. Thanks for reading my review. ', 'In Jushin, there once lived secret government agents called Angyo Onshi who traveled the countryside in disguise. They were charged by the king with finding and punishing corrupt government officials and bringing justice. Munsu is an Angyo Onshi who possesses the power to summon a ghost army.  He happens upon a young man, Mon-ryon, who aspires to be an Angyo Onshi in order to save his girlfriend from the clutches of an evil Lord. Mon-ryon meets his demise and Junshin has fallen but Munsu still travels to continue the king\'s quest for justice.  Munsu releases the people and Mon-ryon\'s, Chun Hyang from the...Lord\'s tyrannical rule. Chun Hyang is revealed to be an accomplished fighter and pledges herself to be Munsu\'s ""Sando"" or bodyguard in honor of her lost love.Pay attention to the above summary (pieced together through 2 anime sources, a manga entry and my own inference), because that is the most explanation you will get about this movie.  The viewer is dropped into the middle of an ongoing story and expected to understand the past and present.  This formula may work with a well written script, but unfortunately this is not one of them.This movie severely suffers character development. Munsu is unlikable, sardonic and apathetic.  There is absolutely no back story given to explain his behavior or motivations. I believe Chun Hyang\'s only purpose in the anime is to act as fanservice in her leather fetish strap costume.  She is timid and rarely speaks except to apologize for her actions.  She is more like a puppet than an actual character.The music features some orchestral pieces that are reminiscent of the samisen and lute of feudal Japan. This same piece was played twice, both when examining sweeping backdrops of scenery, and was honestly the best part of the movie.  The animation used both hand drawn cells and CGI.  The CGI was pretty obvious and didn\'t blend well.The movie features some action scenes and plenty of head shots, but fails to give the viewer a story. Lord\'s tyrannical rule.

The film reminded me of an 80's anime, dealing with magic, goblins, devils and whatnot. However, as a film, it has a few flaws. Basically there these people called Angyo Onshi they are warriors with mystical powers. The main character is one of these Angyo Onshi. He travels around, killing corrupt kings and other villains. But when a man who saves him is killed in the desert, this warrior sets out to find his fiance and free her from a mad king, and the two form an unlikely alliance.BLADE...OF THE PHANTOM MASTER moves at a good pace, once the right characters are lined up to complete its entire story. But there are problems. This is a film, so you need good character development and this film heavily lacks that. The main character has no real background, other than we know he's an Angyo Onshi and we don't know a lot about the female character and how she got her ability's. The film, although places its characters in this universe nicely, there is no real storyline for them to follow. Instead, it plays out like a few stand alone shorts that have no real conclusion. But the film is very brutal and the main character, although extremely unlikeable, is very good at what he does. His attitude reminds me of Wolverine or Mad Max. He only cares about himself, his desires and he does some really surprising things to save his own neck.Aside from the violence, the art work and special effects are great. I like the atmosphere and this world too. Mixed with that and its lack of characters that offer little to no flavor in the story and its episodic nature that would of worked better as an OVA or an actual show, the film is fun as hell. A perfect two-hour killer that will keep you interested with some pretty bold moves that you wont see coming. I liked it, I just wish they could of expanded it. Is there a sequel? If there is, I would love to get my hands on it. OF THE PHANTOM MASTER moves at a good pace, once the right characters are lined up to complete its entire story. But there are problems.

I felt I was watching a couple of anime TV shows. There were about 2 or three stories that were there about how Munsu ends up getting a Sando, a servant, and then ends up going to an Island for the rest of the show. It didn’t stand out next to any other anime show that came out in 2004. It felt lack luster as a movie but as a TV show, it would have done much better.The storyline was basic to...many shows where we have a wonderer who is alone and ends up getting a companion… might I add female companion… who follows him around all the time. Only real difference is that she can actually fight but she doesn’t listen to his every word at times. They never explain if Munsu has something wrong with him and that’s why he has a inhaler or if it’s something to do with the power he bears. There are a lot of open endings that they really should have filled in if this was going to be its own movie.The animation has a slightly interesting mix of CG and animation. It isn’t that it doesn’t fit right; it just is a bit easy to see that this is CG and this is not. There are still images mixed with the CG that just looks a little off in the beginning. As the show goes on, the only real thing that shows up CG is the dark soldiers he summons. Half the time, the background would look very detailed and the only time when it doesn’t fit with the characters is when they are in the desert because the color of the characters really threw me off. There is a headband that Munsu wears is actually supposed to be left on a cross but he wears it throughout the whole show.The voices and music are what I would expect for the time it was made. There is nothing that seriously stands out for the voices although I do sort of like Munsu’s more then any other. Other then that, not much else. many shows where we have a wonderer who is alone and ends up getting a companion… might I add female companion… who follows him around all the time.

And it\'s entertaining to watch the battles, tho most aren\'t that lengthy. But my reason for such a low rating was due to the writing.The story starts out nice and interesting. Then it starts to pick up somewhere, only to drop it. We don\'t know anything about the main character so the following events with him aren\'t that enjoyable - he seems to have not be planned out well at all.Then we have the other ""main character"". She lacks any other characteristic than not seeming to have any mind of her own, but considerate enough not...to leave someone dying. The rest of the cast is very, very one-dimensional and rather easy to guess how they\'d play out - not the worse, but with this kinda lead and his sidekick of sorts ... yeah, it doesn\'t help anything at all.But after the first two big events, I didn\'t expect how choppy the story continued  (intro counts as just an intro btw, I\'m breaking these into three events) . The first event was super small but led to the next with decent setup, and gave some very slight, vague character introduction. Then the second event legit wasted most of its time ""setting things up"" - which could\'ve been summed up through the big fight towards the end. It would\'ve been fine granted how little of substance there was other than obtaining the sidekick lady.Then, the final big event took up the second half of the film. And it wasn\'t worth it. This was something where you could tell they planned quite a bit. A lot, actually. But instead of utilizing it properly - BY ALLOWING THE AUDIENCE TO PIECE ANYTHING TOGETHER - they decided to just tell us everything... and, if we were lucky to have had some kinda vague hint towards it, during the ~big reveals~ towards the end.Again, the fights were kinda interesting. Not the worse thing there. But add that to the random ~*~belts galore~*~ lead and his sidekick, it makes little sense and truly doesn\'t work together. At least something to make it look like they\'ve lived in that environment most/all of their lives would\'ve been idealistic, apparently.But, yeah, no. The story itself had such weird pacing that let us not really enjoy what was happening. It\'s like we should\'ve known what the lead was thinking the whole time. Even tho his character didn\'t make sense half the time. Especially at the very end where he decided to be a completely different character from how he\'d been 90% of the dang film - and here I was, assuming that had been a mere fancy act during part of the first event!! to leave someone dying. The rest of the cast is very, very one-dimensional and rather easy to guess how they\'d play out - not the worse, but with this kinda lead and his sidekick of sorts ... yeah, it doesn\'t help anything at all.But after the first two big events, I didn\'t expect how choppy the story continued  (intro counts as just an intro btw, I\'m breaking these into three events) . The first event was super small but led to the next with decent setup, and gave some very slight, vague character introduction. Then the second event legit wasted most of its time ""setting things up"" - which could\'ve been summed up through the big fight towards the end. It would\'ve been fine granted how little of substance there was other than obtaining the sidekick lady.Then, the final big event took up the second half of the film. And it wasn\'t worth it. This was something where you could tell they planned quite a bit. A lot, actually. But instead of utilizing it properly - BY ALLOWING THE AUDIENCE TO PIECE ANYTHING TOGETHER - they decided to just tell us everything... and, if we were lucky to have had some kinda vague hint towards it, during the ~big reveals~ towards the end.Again, the fights were kinda interesting. Not the worse thing there. But add that to the random ~*~belts galore~*~ lead and his sidekick, it makes little sense and truly doesn\'t work together. At least something to make it look like they\'ve lived in that environment most/all of their lives would\'ve been idealistic, apparently.But, yeah, no. The story itself had such weird pacing that let us not really enjoy what was happening. It\'s like we should\'ve known what the lead was thinking the whole time. Even tho his character didn\'t make sense half the time. Especially at the very end where he decided to be a completely different character from how he\'d been 90% of the dang film - and here I was, assuming that had been a mere fancy act during part of the first event!!', ""I saw this movie on Netflix and for some reason I decided to check it out. Little did I know that I was not going to witness some epic anime adventure film.The story is quite bland and has no real feeling. All we are told is that this great nation was full of powerfull warriors, but then the kingdom fell and the warriors died off. Except for one of course, named Munsu.The movie has some fantasy elements in it which were kinda intresting, such as desert goblins and giants, but the movie became boring quick. First we had this lord of a city being...a tyrant and killing people, then he is killed by his people. Then we go to some weird island full of dead people but they didn't know.This movie was pure meh and didn't have much entertainment value. Watch another anime movie to pass the time. a tyrant and killing people, then he is killed by his people.

Zetman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11837/Zetman,"['""To be the man, you gotta beat the man"".- Ric FlairBeing a superhero is never easy, especially when you try to live a double life. Superheroes like Batman, Superman, and Spiderman deals with the dangers they get exposed to on a daily basis. They feel like it\'s their responsibility to protect the innocent and deliver that strong sense of justice. After all, justice is the judgement of truth and to uphold such a sense comes at a great responsibility, sacrifice, and lives.Then there comes a hero at the darkest hour. He is ZET. Enter Zetman.The story is set in the modern times with...technology that passes our own in the real world. Such technology of course brings forth wealth, prosperity, hope, but also crime and monstrosity. Luckily for the good folks, we have heroes.Now, to call Jin a superhero would be an overstatement. He is in fact some of us see as a dark hero of vengeance. Or maybe, we should call him a dark angel. Because of his efforts, lives are saved but not without a cost. That\'s the price of being a hero. Sometimes, you just can\'t save everyone. Yet Jin is an interesting character if we look at him carefully. He is quite the mysterious figure and for most of us, difficult to read. After witnessing the tragedies of his past, Jin swears vengeance and to never let anyone else close to him die again. Now that my friends makes him the dark hero, the dark angel, and the holder of justice in a different light.Then, we have somewhat of the antithesis of the story, Kouge Amagi. Both academically and sports-inclined, he is also popular and has nearly everything he\'s ever wanted...wealth, admirers, and a family. Yet, there\'s one thing he seems to be missing and always wanted. That would be his dream of becoming a hero of justice, one that people admire, one that people respect, and one that helps the helpless. Unlike Jin however, Amagi\'s desire to become such a hero is quite on the opposite globe. (rather than for vengeance to say the least) In his mind, justice should be delivered and enemies of justice will be terminated. Bu it\'s a lot said easier than done.We also have some of the other characters that lighten up the gloom and doom story a bit. The all innocent Konoha Amagi, and sister of Kouga, who has known Jin since their childhood times. The tomboy Hanako who has a curiosity in our dark hero (who also holds a dark secret) and among others. They tend to balance out the dark atmosphere and brings a little light as well as entertainment into the story.Now for the story. I\'ll best honest here, it\'s not really well performed. There\'s always a risk of making an anime adaptation off of a manga but even more so in this case because the amount of material it covers. There\'s a lot of potential and believe me, I want to see it at its finest form. Yet what I see so far is a rushed story based off a manga of over 150 chapters. It doesn\'t also help with the fact that the series only runs for 13 episodes. Thirteen episodes I\'d repeat again! With that unlucky number, my hopes for the overall story is a little bit down with its rushed sequences. All in honesty, it kinda feels like reading a story with chapters missing. Oh yes, there are some awesome fights and blood gore if you can take it in the stomach. However, it feels that a piece of excitement is missing. This series could become a real blockbuster made for mature audiences with its old school action and violence. Yet with only 13 episodes, I just don\'t see how it could out perform some of the other longer series of this Spring. Maybe our heroes can save this series from being sent into turmoil.As for the art, the series seems to adapt a bit of old school. With the old school-like art, it certainly spawns some nostalgia in some of us who have been anime fans. But this is a R+ rated story and a reason for that. There\'s bodies being torn opened, blood spilled, and showing what our heroes do best: delivering justice (even if it comes at a cost).The sound is just ""meh"" in my opinion. It does contain drama and conveys the dark mood of the story but not something too noticeable. I do admit that the OP song, ""dots and lines"" by You Hitoto feat. Mummy-D, is performed well and give us a more suburban type of feeling. With the word ""Zet"" being mentioned several times, the songs brings out the dark hero out of the characters.Well, it is also not surprising that Masakazu Katsura was involved with the work of this series. He is Batman\'s biggest fan and we all know who he is. (at least I hope you do). As such, it is one of the possible main influences of his work. In fact, his influences can be even traced to another superheroes series that debuted last year. Maybe, Tiger & Bunny ring a bell?Overall, I\'d say that this series just fits into the ""so-so"" for the Spring Season. It has entertainment value especially if you\'re into some fan-service and hardcore action. But if you can\'t take the violence and sexual content, then just hit that drop button and try something else. This series blends in the idea of a hero at the darkest hour and shows the cruelty of the world. Its approach of the dark hero genre will give you a strange feeling of both justice and also cruelty once you start watching. Yet, the story is blend and too rushed so for those looking for a complex storyline, then that little glimmer of hope may be crushed faster than a Player. However, if those aren\'t your criteria, then this series might be worth a shot. Try coming home from school or work, and watch this on your computer or TV with a nice cup of coffee (or w/e it is that you drink) and get into the OP song (while keeping up with the rhythm) after a tiring Monday. You might smile wishing that there are more heroes like Jin and Kouga to save you from all the tiredness of work/school. Or you might feel sad that there are such enemies of justice in the Zetman world.

I'm not saying it's going to suck but I was really looking forward to a anime adaption of the manga.  I was disappointed but you might not be.PS.  I wish they used another voice actor for young Jin, it's just the voice is so unique that I can't get into Zetman mood when I keep thinking of FMA or Deadman Wonderland. "", 'Tales of ZetmanThis will be a review from an anime-only viewer. Non-biased in any way whatsoever. (Also my first.)Story:The Tales of Vesperia reference wasn\'t for nothing. Two youths that fight in the name of justice but with different ideals. In time their ideals mold who they are and how they serve the community. But that is just a small tidbit of the bigger plot. (Which really isn\'t that big.) An underground faction of corporate heads and scientists alike manifested these ""monsters"" called Players, or EVOL, for the mass entertainment of the wealthy class. These specimen broke free of their cage and now run free....The faction are trying to clean up a mess that they started and seek out someone to do it for them.The EVOL, however, have developed minds of their own and wish to live in peace. But of course, not all have that intent.Art:The artwork is undeniably great. If you are not an accomplished artist yourself, you have no right so say this isn\'t good artwork. There\'s plenty of detail from the characters faces to the automobiles they ride in. Very satisfied in that department. The animation gets pretty sketchy when fight scenes roll around but you could say it is meant to be that way to express the speed of the battle. The action isn\'t very exciting if you\'ve watched shows like Nisemonogatari and Senki Zesshou Symphogear. But it gets by with a Deadman Wonderland type of feel.Sound:The music isn\'t anything noticeable as I\'ve never really paid it much mind up to this point. That could be a good an bad thing whereas it is so subtle it can ease you in the mood of a setting without you knowing or simply make something boring. It\'s either, or. But that\'s the soundtrack. That OP Theme is on some next sh*t. 8DCharacter:To anyone who\'s played Tales of Vesperia, this story is all to familiar. You have your Yuri Lowell, Jin, a man of the people who does for not himself but those around him that need it. Not a penny to his name, Jin spends a lot of his time aiding the community in various ways. On the other hand, we have out Flynn Scifo, Amagi Kouga, who fights in the name of justice in his own way, albeit more flashy. Unlike Jin, Kouga is bound by his father\'s reign, and his lack of strength. Thus his fight to prove himself to Jin.Enjoyment:I almost cried on the first episode...and on the second. And on the third. ;_;Overall:Zetman is a disappointment to its manga followers. But to those who are fresh to the series and enjoy a good strong gripping story with interesting characters reminiscent of Tiger and Bunny, it\'s worth the time. If your a manga reader and ready to moan n\' groan, then steer clear of this adaptation. Otherwise, I\'d recommend it to anyone who likes a good story of romance, justice, tears and corruption.

If you like violent stories, full of psychological warfare, Full of Blood, Monsters. You will surely and truly Like Zetman.The Story was a bit confusing at first, Getting clearer and clearer throughout the Anime. Monsters created by Humans break the law and start killing they're creators. I liked the story.It's a dark anime. Violence everywhere, Blood everywhere, And bunch of psychological mind games happening to the characters. I gave it a 8.The Art was good. Unique Art which differs from other Animes, Although I did not find it was...the best, But yet good enought. I gave it a 7.Sound. Some Good OST's, Okay Sound Effects, Good Voice Actors. I gave it a 7.The Characters, I fell in they're story, Very Psychological for some of them. The Main Characters, are very Likable, I fell in they're world. I really liked the Psychological Warfare of the characters, They're reaction, They're thoughts.It made me worry about them, Worry about what Will happen to them and such. I gave it a 8.Enjoyment. Zetman was very enjoyable. Although being very crude and violent, I liked every bit of it. 8, Enought Said.So the Overall Note is 8. If you Like Seinen's, Violent, Bloody, Psychological Animes. Zetman is clearly for you, You should even give it a shot if you want to try, You won't regret it. A great Anime. I recommend it to anyone. (Mostly 18+ haha.)Thanks for reading. :) the best, But yet good enought. I gave it a 7.Sound. Some Good OST's, Okay Sound Effects, Good Voice Actors.

Zetman is clearly for you, You should even give it a shot if you want to try, You won't regret it. A great Anime. I recommend it to anyone. (Mostly 18+ haha.)Thanks for reading. :)"", ""What is the true meaning of justice? Is it doing the right thing no matter the situation, or achieving the right result no matter the cost? This is the question that ZETMAN centers around. What may seem like the right thing to do can actually end up not being the case and vice-versa, as shown many times throughout the series. The decisions that one comes to based on their kind of justice will undoubtedly vary from person to person. Thus, ZETMAN attempts to illustrate the effects of various viewpoints on justice within a city that is riddled with evil and crippled by the conflicting mindsets...that its inhabitants carry.Art 7/10Personally, I found the art to resemble the quality of rough sketches that have been coloured in. The sharp strokes and uneven outlines of the artwork, although I haven't seen it too often in the anime I have watched, didn't really impress me all that much and took a while to get used to, especially when it came to the characters themselves; I still wasn't able to fully appreciate it in the end. But in terms of fitting the anime's atmosphere, I thought this art style was a great choice. I found the roughness of the art actually enhanced my overall experience, even though I didn't really like it.Characters 6/10On one hand, the character development was definitely there. Both the two main protagonists, Jin and Kōga, were easy to understand and empathize with by the series' end. However, a lot of their development had a tendency to feel rushed and/or forced, hurting the solidity of their characters. Although the change in their characters could be explained by the circumstances that they went through, I still felt it wasn't enough to fully justify their development. On the other hand, some of the minor characters lacked development and seemed, at most times, to just be an unimportant part of the story, like an extra in a movie. And when they did play a role, it wasn't easy to connect or relate to them, given the limited amount of information about their character as a whole. The vast amount of characters for a short series also made it hard to keep up with and/or recognize each one. In a nutshell, the presence of a few great characters was offset by a bunch of not-so-great ones.Sound 7/10The highlight of this category is definitely the OP. While it took a while for me to get used to, I thought it was an excellent choice for an anime like ZETMAN. It's extremely catchy and does a good job in pumping the viewer up for the episode. The ED provides something different-a soft and slow song that follows a cliffhanger especially nicely. Aside from that the OST was unmemorable and the voice acting was average.Story 7/10In a way, the story of ZETMAN depicts the possible outcome of when humans abuse their scientific knowledge for their own pleasure and entertainment. Adding in the conflict between the two protagonists' different views on justice when it comes to dealing with the consequences of the aforementioned outcome and you have an interesting plot. Unfortunately, ZETMAN was unable to fully flesh out the potential of this basis and a lot of the story felt rushed. Accounting for the flow of the story in the manga, the anime, as agreed upon by many, paled in comparison. But that may have been due to the lack of time that the show was given (13 Episodes); maybe a 26-episode run would have greatly improved the overall entertainment value of the story. But as it stands, ZETMAN (the adaptation) ended up failing to build upon the solid foundation built by its predecessor.Overall 7/10When you look at it in a general sense, ZETMAN was a decent anime. It had its good points (lots of action, an interesting premise, and two decent protagonists) but also had its flaws (rushed story and character development). Those who have read the manga will mostly say this adaptation was a complete flop, but by itself, there's no real glaring fault that makes it a complete failure. I'd recommend ZETMAN to anyone who enjoys a good mix of action (violence) and a decent story (nothing too special). that its inhabitants carry.Art 7/10Personally, I found the art to resemble the quality of rough sketches that have been coloured in.

It certainly was different from a lot of the animes I do watch.I felt Zetman's strongest aspects were its artwork and story. The artwork for this anime was just gorgeous. This didn't have your typical shonen cartoony animaton feel. It had a dark, gritty story and had the animation to go with it. The story itself I felt was very solid as well. I was hooked as soon as I saw this was about a boy with supernatural powers born from the very monsters he...was hunting. What made this story's dynamics even more interesting is when Jin befriends Kouga and Konoha Amagi, two aristocratic children who also share the same goals as Jin, even though Jin knows about the darker, deeper evils that lurk within the shadows. While Jin is mostly sent on saving anyone and everyone, Kouga mostly wants to become an admirable superhero while Konoha just wants to help the less fortunate. It makes for a very interesting dynamic between the three characters later on in the series. I did also think this anime added some elements that are a bit edgy for your typical anime. I won't tell you what they are for spoilers sake, but let's just say this anime felt as though it wasn't afraid to add more adult elements to this story.While Zetman's story and art were great, it had a few things that I felt were major weaknesses in the story. First would be the Jin/Hanako relationship. This felt EXTREMELY forced. Yes, I understand the implications it had later on in the series (and for those of you that haven't seen the series, something happens that ultimately leads Jin to make a vital choice). However, this relationship seemed to take off before it could get a proper introduction. It felt as though Jin and Hanako run into each other, Jin saves Hanako, Hanako and Jin are bam, IMMEDIATELY in love. It just didn't feel right to me. Granted, I am a little biased because I didn't like Hanako's character from the start...but still, there didn't seem to be any buildup to their relationship.I can't feel like I can give this a proper review because this anime did set itself up for a sequel. For a first season (assuming there will be a second season), it built up an interesting story that I can't wait to see continue. This anime certainly had its ups-and-downs but I'll admit, I enjoyed it even though I did find it kinda flawed in some aspects. was hunting.

This is my very first review and I'm glad I started it like that. Since this is my first review I will try my best not to write a bunch if garbage. Zetman is an anime I have been looking forward to ever since I saw the 2012 anime lineup online. The superhero genre does not really exist in anime since the only real superhero anime out there is Astro Boy, which is considered a classic and one of the first shonen anime/manga. The superhero genre I personally think has the potential to be a great addition...to so many things that already make anime great. It can make you forget about slice of life and psychological thrillers if it is done properly. Zetman could have put this genre on the anime map. But like this review's introduction, this anime is anything but super. Zetman's premise sounds like the perfect set up for a crimefighting show. Monsters created by humans for humans' entertainment escape from their captivity into this world and our hero has to stop them. It is a fairly simple premise with which a lot can be done with but alas the creators miss the mark with failed execution. My main beef with this series is that it should have lasted longer. 13 Episodes is enough to tell a decent story, but the producers needed more time for what they were going for. I feel that not a lot of time was spent on character development with the exception of the two main characters. Every one else is just there to fill up space or to move the story along. I wish that viewers could see Jin(our protaganist) find out about his powers and how to control them,and it is never actually stated what ZET is specifically capable of doing, that you have to figure out for yourself as the series goes on.Everyone else's motives are never really explained. Why do they do what they do?They just do do what they do. What I really liked about the series was the way Kouga (the other hero) is tested to see what his idea of justice is.This was a character that I really liked . But that was really the only REAL exciting bit I thought there was. There is a real twist at the end which I didn't see coming so props to the writers for that.The sound of the anime was alright,with the voice acting quality about the same as your average anime. The OP was alright but I got sick of it 4 epsiodes in. The ending theme was a lot better but I think it could be because of my love for slow songs.Visually the the show is not bad, I just wish that more detail was put into the blood, which reminds me that the fight scenes were enjoyable as well as it supposed to be since this is a superhero show. In a nutshell here is the pros and cons of Zetman.Pros:-Kouga and Jin are good lead characters-Nice ending theme-Enjoyable fight scenes-Twist near the end of the show-Visuals are not that badCons-Average voice acting-Very little character development-Not a very good OP-Invisible support characters-Boring story-Too short to cram everything inZetman is  something I would watch again but not for a while,it really is not that bad,but with my high anticipations for it it felt like a let down.I recommend it as a something you can watch to pass the time if you have nothing to do for the weekend.6/10 to so many things that already make anime great.

It was an anime with enormous potential and up until episode 12 that potential existed. The last two episodes though basically screwed everything up. The anime starts kinda all over the place, but until the last two episodes is nothing that cannot easily be fixed. I will not give spoilers to the ones that still want to see it but you will be disapointed by the resolution of he show. Also Kouga is just a puppet from beginning to end even though he could have grown into a great character. The Jin character also develops quite nice until the...last episode when I guess the readers decided to do some marijuana or something because this seems to be the only explanation for what happens. last episode when I guess the readers decided to do some marijuana or something because this seems to be the only explanation for what happens.', '""Zetman"", the story of genetically engineered ""creatures"" who fight for the amusement of powerful men. The story is simple, clean, and to the point. There is nothing overly deep here, but there doesn\'t need to be. For a 13 episode series ""Zetman"" was loads of fun and not as predictable as one may think. Sure the characters were cliche but the direction in which the story takes us was fresh and fulfilling. Most questions were answered by the last episode and the ones that weren\'t didn\'t really important.The character models were really well done. Facial expressions were well defined, noses were realistically shaped and,...lips were plump and rounded. However, color could have been used more rigorously while structural art was utterly forgettable with the exception of one or two scenes.The opening theme is hit or miss. I enjoyed its simplicity and like Little John had little substance but nevertheless was fun to listen to. Ending theme was in my opinion very dull. BGM was okay and got a little better towards the end of the series as tensions rose.It\'s important to take into account the brevity of the series as character development was hard pressed in a 13 episode action oriented anime. With that being said we see a very plot driven series whose character faults are forgivable.Overall I would definitely recommend ""Zetman"" for someone who doesn\'t want to invest too much time but still wants to be entertained. lips were plump and rounded.

This ""Zetman"" is different from the manga because it follows its own way, however, the manga is canon, as you may know. With that, the artwork for the anime was magnificent. If you aren\'t following drawing artists or even amateur drawing artists, you don\'t have the right to tell me that this is not true art. As you know, there\'s plenty of detail in the characters and in the settings and that\'s obviously a good thing. When there\'s a fight sequence, you can even see the speed of...the battle itself. So yeah, looks like there\'s a ""Hunter x Hunter"" done by Madhouse Studios vibe here, just saying.Comparatively to the music, that\'s probably the lowest part has I can remember. I didn\'t like the Opening or Ending song but I recognize the artists work on the pieces of music.The development of the characters is present in the series and is something positive. Both protagonists, Jin and Koga are characters easy to understand and sympathize until the last episode. The problem is that the scenes are forced or, in a way, they do not exist, so the viewer does not know (unless if you go read the original source). Another problem is that the smaller characters are not very fun and don\'t have an original personality as if they were extras in a movie. And this makes the main characters ""compensate"" screen time for not-so-important characters.As for the enjoyment, yeah, the first episode was so epic yet unpredictable and I loved the series until the end. Overall, it was great.People like to compare the anime adaptation to the original manga but that\'s kinda wrong because, for these people, there are no expectations. If people create expectations with all kinds of adapted works, then they will always have their expectations shattered. If you are a manga reader just don\'t compare it because the anime adaptation goes its own way (again said).Zetman was such a good and promising series and to be fair, I really can\'t remember the last time I watched such an exceptional series with great fight scenes, promising plot and also, dramatic moments.Story: 8 | Art: 9 | Sound: 7 | Character: 8 | Enjoyment: 9 |Score: 8/10Personal Note: I\'m really glad that I watched this show.

', ""Zetman was interesting to say the least. It was very action packed, and had some good suspense mixed in. I personally loved every minute. The character development was bold, but very relatable, the sound fit, the story fit. I found this anime quite outstanding.Story - 9. Great. The animation was emotionally investing. I've always stuck firmly with the idea that if a writer can hook the target audience emotionally, then the writer will have an easier time getting compliments on his work. It was certainly suspense worthy in that the threat was introduced in the beginning, and what the threat would do was left to...our imagination until the very end. The reason I gave a nine rather than a ten is because I felt it was too short, this story had potential to grow for a very long time; sadly, it was left short. That's not to say the ending wasn't satisfying, I just felt as if there COULD be more.Art - 10. The artwork and animation was smooth. In fact, quite fluent, facial expressions did great, body motions showed strain, it was as real as real could get for anime.Sound - 9. Very well placed. Starts off with an eerie tone, which is to be expected considering the threat is being introduced right off the bat, has slow instrumentals for the sad parts, and intense instrumentals for the fights. The sounds also match and are well timed. I took a point off here though because I really did NOT like the opening or ending credit selections. I felt as if they had nothing to do with the anime.Character - 10. The first episode hints towards some drastic character development from our main character and those around him. I was very right to assume that, as the some characters DID change drastically. To my surprise, the main character actually STAYED the same as he started though, in terms of psyche that is. Which actually strengthened the impact of the ending, because it was his immovable will and mind that really brought home the end. The character who was meant to change though did so very drastically, it was actually really cool to see, because his goals did not change, but they way he perceived and pursued took a huge turn, some would even say for the worse.Enjoyment - 9. I very much enjoyed this series, the sequence of actions were very easy to follow, with no fluff or filler, as every part had its place and reason for being there. It kept me wanting to watch to see what would happen and when. I took a point off here again, because of the short story though, I really believe this type of story has potential.Overall - 9. Overall, I am satisfied. Sadly, the average was a 9.4 rounded down to 9.0, but I feel with good reason. I personally believed that the writer was a master at manipulating emotion. He could make make sad when he wanted, making me mad when he wanted, and make me continue watching everytime.

The art work, action scenes, voice acting, and characters, are all very good in my opinion. You can also tell there is a story good here. But without ever reading the manga, you can also tell that everything is rushed plot wise because of the series only being 13 episodes long.Everything appears to be disjointed or very hard to believe because...the show expects you to have knowledge of the manga as well. Also to keep up with the time constraints, key plot points in the anime differ from the manga. Which isn\'t bad when done right ""see full metal alchemist"". But often you will not understand the history,bonds and breakdowns that some of characters have built up or gone threw because there is alot that went on in the manga that the anime does not relay at all.Overall this show is a classic example of why I believe most short anime series based on long running manga should stay true to the cannon and have ""no ending"", ""see Shigurui"". A show that lays the ground work for the series in great detail, but ends after the first arch is vastly better than a show that try\'s to jam 100 plus manga releases into a 300 minute anime Imo.Also making an original story and sticking to it makes for a better short series than jumping between the cannon of a manga and what ever liberties the anime decided to come up with.It\'s still a good watch for 13 eps, but don\'t expect to come away with anything more then alittle intro into the Zetman universe and some gory fight scenes. the show expects you to have knowledge of the manga as well.

How far will you go? What sacrifices will you make?These ideas and more are explored throughout this show. Both in show and tell. It was another one of those days where i chose a random anime to watch and see how it goes. As always, my rule when doing this is that the show has 3 episodes to hook me or i just drop it and move on to another. There was no need for this one though. So let\'s explain why.Story: 9A show about two friends out to fight crime. One a rich kid with...a sense of justice straight out of a Saturday morning superhero show. The other a slum kid who does it because the people need saved......and maybe to make some money along the way. A common goal forged by two different views. Can you see the picture I\'m painting here? I\'m actually reminded a lot about Gungrave when I watch this. They follow similar formulas and share a similar outcome. The point is, this is a story woven in with three other stories. All of which will have your full attention. The only downside I see with the story is that it feels rushed. A good example would be the the first two episodes. The first episodes starts off when they are kids, the second is when they are teens, and it gets a bit worse from there. All in all, its a good story and one I hear has it even better in the manga.Art: 8Bringing it back to the art style of older animes. Hard lines and grey gradient color scheme. I always enjoyed watching shows with this style because the action feels more gritty. Aside from that I didn\'t notice anything wrong with it.Sound: 7The sound did it\'s job........... What? You want more? Fine. The Opening song is very different to the rest of the tone of the show but after a few episodes you will start to really enjoy it. Ending is pretty forgettable, consisting of a low, sad beat and it really only fit the mood of 1 episode. Voice acting is hit or miss. Sometimes the characters sound normal, others they sound like they are A. trying to hard and B. Actually reading from a script. The second one might have you going ""Well duh, they are."", but you aren\'t suppose to feel that when listening to it.Character: 10This is where I feel the show really shines. Each main character has a very distinct personality. You know how you feel about each one. Not a theoretical feeling, a solid feeling about them. Whether it\'s a solid like or dislike. And that\'s what\'s great about them. They are so flushed out. Take our lead character Gin. He grew up as a slum kid with only his ""grandfather"" there to teach him the ways of the world. He never went to school, he only learned what was absolutely needed. You watch him grow and his ideals being forged, even after everything that he went through. I know I felt bad for him because I could relate with him a lot. I even had myself saying I\'m sorry every time something bad happens. ACTUALLY SAYING I\'M SORRY TO A 2-D CHARACTER. That is great character building right there.Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed this show, if you couldn\'t tell already. Sure there are flaws and they are very noticeable but honestly I enjoyed every second of it. Especially when it can hit you in the feels. I would give this show a try. Who knows......Maybe you will question what justice means to you.Overall: 9 a sense of justice straight out of a Saturday morning superhero show.

But that is fine and not where the problem lays.Starting off there are a few things that start off rather ludicrous and out of touch with reality. I give those a pass and then the anime begins to pick up and I enjoy the pacing.but then things are thrown in that aren\'t properly explained and are just completely ignored.

Now this makes sense since I found out that the manga was actually 20 volumes in comparison with this 13 episode anime adaption.I have know idea what the difference is with how situations are resolved so I can\'t entirely recommend it but if I was to guess, I\'d read that.Over all this feels a little misdelivered but definitely a whole lot better then Casshern sins.

It almost felt like I was watching a Hollywood movie for the entire time... There is a little bit of skin show as well, but only for a few seconds, nothing cringe worthy as it is very well blended in with the story and doesn't feel forced, like in many ecchi anime... Moreover as it's a seinen anime, it's totally acceptable and I shouldn't complain on that...Ending could have been slightly better, but its not...even close to bad.

It\'s really a great anime, although short.', 'Animated by Studio TMS, which never produced an above average work (its best attempts were Hundred Stories, Kenichi, and D.Gray-Man). Directed by Nabeshima Osamu who has directed all sorts of shows over the years, from children’s, to mahou shoujo, to fighting shounen. None of them managed to be above average either (the most famous amongst them are Saint Tail, Hamtaro, D.Gray-Man, and Lost Canvas). Can’t say there is much to expect from all that.Zetman seemed very promising at first to me. It was dark, it had rather realistically drawn characters, it was very violent, and had people turned to monsters and using lots of gruesome...superpowers. It would be a nice change from the average superpower shounen with its comical goofy kids and never-dying cast. And yet the anime managed to make me lose interest just from the pilot episode by being nothing but a parody of Power Rangers. By parody, I don’t mean it is funny but rather that it makes fun of the genre than being the mature seinen show I thought it would be. It is just than it is obviously poking at the stereotypes and saying “We will have more violence and sex than Naruto but it will otherwise still be like Naruto.” So yeah, it is still just dumb and it is not going to require any brain cells to figure out what is going on; the storyline is just what it appears to be. Idealistic good-hearted kids taking on evil organizations run by adults. They are just more selfish and violent than usual; something that hardly offers more depth to those who got bored of the easy going violence of normal fighting shounen and want more gore.So, what is the story all about? There are these people who can mutate to monsters and are used by the rich and powerful in death matches for amusement. Some manage to escape and believing they are better than the rest, they start causing several deaths and mass destructions. The hero is a poor orphan who lives in some slum and after his friends and family are attacked by said monsters he decides to protect them by turning to a slum gang leader who transforms to this macho monster and kicks ass of bad monsters who mess with his buddies. Plus, there is this rich kid who thinks it’s a paragon of justice and forms a team of school kids who protect the town from the monsters. There you have it, the protection complex strikes again and that is all you get. Oh, and there are token cute girls in there just for the sake of having some piss poor platonic romance. They are as important to the story as sand is to Bedouins. YAWN!The cast is not any more complicating or realistic than your typical Power Ranger characters; they are still easily divided into good guys (always dumb teenagers) and bad guys (always ambitious old dudes) and it is just the depressing and violent backgrounds that make them appear to be a bit unusual. The illusion breaks very easily when you figure that they are not doing much with all that other than having them as dressing. Heck, just listening the more than corny dialogues is enough; they all talk like their IQ is around 80 and repeat the same 50 words over and over again (protect, power, superiority, stronger, love, etc).Also, although I never read the manga (and after seeing the premise in the anime I probably never will) everybody who did, claim that it messed up the character depth of the manga source (whatever depth you could get in such a story that is) by rushing through several events instead of investing time to flesh them out. So the pacing of the plot is extremely fast, to the point lots of important events happen without the proper duration. That tends to make you not care if people die and stuff blow up in a few seconds. I mean, seriously, the first episode alone felt like a summary of six episodes instead of one normal one.The artwork is definitely the best part about it… and still bad compared to the manga. It looks detailed and mature until you start looking at the fine details. The facial grimaces for example will feel way too off for such a setting to the point it feels like comedy. They react in very woody ways like it is all a bad theatrical play. And the action scenes are flashy on a very superficial level but otherwise lack any great fighting choreography. They are just disjoined simplistic attacks and the hero is unbeatable, so they lack excitement entirely. You may enjoy it for the gore but even that is censored and doesn’t last too much; so again YAWN!The soundtrack is also nothing memorable. Despite sounding like an old fashion ballad at times, it is still far from ear catchy. It feels colourless and having to endure all the corny dialogues of the characters your impression won’t improve much.So in all the only thing I liked is the rather detailed and realistic artwork. Nothing else seems to be above your dumb Power Ranger level, despite the show boasting to be a dark and violent seinen. Its ideology is still shallow and there have already been several other similar titles over the years that did far better; some of which are the following: Devilman, Guyver, Parasyte, Tekkaman Blade, and Soul Taker. I liked those far more in their early stages than Zetman and it’s not because I grew older or I don’t like buckets of blood anymore. The presentation simply sucks in this one; it is lifeless and shallow. Nobody with above minimum demands should give it a try or expect anything other than a forgettable time waster.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 2/2 (looks realistic)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 1/2 (basic)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 5/10Voice Acting 1/3 (retarded)Music Themes 2/4 (average)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 4/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 1/2 (erratic)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 6/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (rather cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (overblown but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (too blunt to bother again)Memorability 1/4 (generic and passable)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 1/1 (looks nice)Sound 0/2 (sounds boring and dumb)Story 0/3 (feels generic)Characters 0/4 (they are passable)VERDICT: 4/10 superpowers.

I found the premise interesting, but I could never connect very well with any of the characters and felt them all to be a bit standoffish, with one or two exceptions. Because I hadn't connected with them, the ending (which I assume would be more shocking and more eliciting of emotion if you read the manga) felt like another drab turn.That having said, I did enjoy watching it, and have no regrets having done so. I do think that if it had had more than 13 episodes it might have been...able to invest the audience more deeply in the characters and story rather than dash through it at lightning pace. able to invest the audience more deeply in the characters and story rather than dash through it at lightning pace."", 'Short Review (spoiler-free):Zetman the 12-episode anime is, in summary, a far inferior adaptation of the original manga of the same name from renowned mangaka Masakazu Katsura. With its cheap and simplistic facial art, choppy and incomplete storyline, hammy dialogues and goofy characterization of the main characters, it retains only slims of the brilliance of the manga.A random YouTube review of this anime I encountered picked my interest, and I went in expecting a wild ride full of 1970\'s manga antics (the 2002-2014 manga itself was a hardcore homage to the Devilman series). The first thing I noticed is the character facial art being unrecognizable...from Masakazu Katsura\'s famous style. Let\'s just say that mangaka has been famous for depicting feminine beauty and sexiness in a way mostly unmatched by his peers. But if you compare the anime\'s characters with their original depictions in the manga, you\'ll know what I am talking about. Story-wise, although the anime covers the most crucial events from the manga\'s original 226-episode run, it ditched the necessary character development and worldbuilding the manga took a full decade to establish. As a result, characters\' arcs and motivations seem hammy and choppy as heck in the anime. ""Oh you are the bad guy now, so I have to kill you"" sums up Kouga Amagi the second protagonist\'s character. A side character saved by Zetman a day ago said to him ""I don\'t want to go home"", and they just became a couple instantly. There are other minor issues holding it back from its full potential as well.Baseline quality: When the manga is a 7-7.5, this anime is a 5.5 at best.Recommended to: fans of the transforming superheroes (x-men, devilman, Guyver, etc.) when they get absolutely bored.Pros:+ some decent fighting sequences.+ Jin\'s relationships with his grandpa and aunty are decent and touching to a degree.+ the climax in EP11-13 is somewhat captivating.Cons:- Facial art being simplistic and far inferior to the manga. If you are here for Masakazu Katsura\'s art, just go read the manga.- weird edginess (e.g. having Jin\'s aunty hyper-sexualized even though the audience is supposed to think of her as a mother-figure. The manga has the same issue).- Hammy characterization and dialogue.- With Devilman Crybaby the anime out in 2018, this anime feels like a meager copycat of Devilman.- The anime adaptation broke the original flow of story and made it a jumbled mess in some episodes, sometimes to the degree of immersion-breaking (e.g. Jin agreed to distance himself from his loved ones in order to protect them in EP3, but in the next episode he\'s still walking around in the same area).- Incomplete storyline (the original manga\'s run ended on a similar note, but we never saw the planned second act in any format, which is a shame.) from Masakazu Katsura\'s famous style.

His reason for being a serial killer was just because which is...lazy and wasteful for that kind of story.Art - Fight scenes were not bad, nothing too sloppy, probably the most acceptable part of the showSound design was bad. Not great tracks and the OP sucked. Gets only a 5 because the ending song was wasted on this SHIT STAIN.Characters - First episode gave insight into his character slowly developing him part by part.

Very often you come across a story...that's nothing special but with characters that have juuuuust enough of the je ne sais quoi to elevate the experience (see: Goblin Slayer and Mushoku Tensei).  But, there's nothing going here for entertainment in between fight scenes.Good for if you want something you can completely turn your brain off to, but at what cost?  Some IQ points and a nagging feeling that this couldn't even fill the void of a mindless walk in the woods.  This one actually made me want to go outside. that's nothing special but with characters that have juuuuust enough of the je ne sais quoi to elevate the experience (see: Goblin Slayer and Mushoku Tensei).

Fortunately, the corrupted King of Abyss/hell is sealed in the wild star however, with time the seal will eventually deteriorate; as such the sentient being sends shards of his power into black crystals around the galaxy for descendants to pick up where he left off. Coincidentally, a shard hits earth and humanity studies its origins and capabilities, they plan to send a scout team to the wild star and set up interplanetary colonies on the wild star thus...beginning the new federation.Knights on Debris follows Chen Mo, a Chinese scientist who becomes a vessel of the sentient beings dormant powers. He is involved in the operation to scout the wild star; However, things go south when the wormhole his team takes ends up delaying their arrival by 150 years - by this point humanity has already established diplomatic relations on the wild star and become the new federation but it is already too late since humanity on the wild star has been overrun by the abyss and the land is barren. Chen Mo is the only human on the wild star with his robot companions, however things take a turn for the worst when Thorne, a superhuman race are sent to the wild star to rescue a runaway princess. Will they be able to settle interactions peacefully or will the abyss shatter all life?Story: 7/10The story is set in a near future world where space exploration has become possible and where species wage war in space. The time-skip aspect caught me off guard and was an interesting hook to the beginning. In the beginning, we are shown little segments of Chen Mo's life spread across 230 days as he tries to repair his aircraft. This is a pretty normal way to establish the world and introduce characters since its basically day-in-the-life routine. As Thorne slowly creeps into the story it becomes more complicated and mysterious since the robots have only heard rumors of this species; our suspicions of them being a ruthless species is somewhat true based on the first encounter with Chen Mo and Princess Kaleiti. However, as they suffer against the abyss organisms and struggle with loss, they eventually grow affection. All the while there is a sense of betrayal foreshadowing on the Thorne Kingdom's personnel.Art & Sound: 8/10 & 7/10The visuals of this are amazing; it almost feels like a waste seeing this kind of art and animation quality on a smaller series on MAL. The character designs are pretty detailed and well informed based on the environment and storyline; the medieval knights armor in a future space kingdom reminds me of Aldnoah Zero's Mars Colony Mecha.Sounds were pretty normal, nothing notable in terms of theme music or Voice Actors.Character: 6/10Character development felt conflicting for me since Chen Mo's robot companions kept getting violated just so Chen Mo and Princess Kaleiti would progress their connection; at this point in time I felt that Chen Mo's companions were humans just by how he treats them. The Thorne characters are pretty mysterious apart from where the series shows which Thorne character has affection when their love interest sacrifices themselves. Apart from that, the characters were very interesting and felt that they were crucial for the development of the story.Enjoyment & Overall: 7/10Knights on Debris is a very entertaining series and it has some good conflict. The art style is very high quality and the character palette is small yet has some likeable and hittable characters from the beginning. This series definitely deserves some attention compared to the lower rated wuxia I've seen. beginning the new federation.Knights on Debris follows Chen Mo, a Chinese scientist who becomes a vessel of the sentient beings dormant powers.

Though I do watch Superman movies, my favorite had always been the female counterpart Supergirl.  BUT not the TV series mind you, my only exposure to Supergirl is the 1984 movie starring Helen Slater.Anyways back to review.Knights on Debris makes itself seem like a Star Wars/Star Trek clone at first.  But then things became unmistakable the mysterious Thorne people capable of using The Force to manipulate black crystals into body armors and weapons are not Jedi masters.  Their facial markings are not...anymore Jedi-ean.This is what I love about the show, it's Kryptonians from the Superman lore set in the Star Wars/Star Trek universe!Right off the bat, we meet several Knights of Thorne (aka Kryptonians) -- a general called Keane (he's actually general Zod from Superman, but not an evil one), and several of his followers like Morena (taken after Ursa the female Kryptonian seen in Superman II the movie).  There are actually 4 Thorne Knights in total, but one of them dies off.  So the latter part of the series the three left are like those 3 Kryptonians in Superman II the movie that come to cause mischief on a planet that resembles Earth once on the ground.  Mischief is actually not the right word as the Thorne Knights are the good guys in this Series.The settings of Season one is on this planet that seemed to be in a state of crumbling into pieces, akin to a Krypton that's in a state of destruction/breaking up.Of course not the least the female lead is actually modeled after Supergirl.  Her red flowing cape is cleverly split into two.  But when you view her from afar that's definitely Kara Zor-El/Supergirl.  What surprised me was, in Supergirl (1984) movie, the man who Supergirl kissed, he drank beer in a can laced with love potion.  This is repeated in Knights on Debris.  We see the male lead, Chen Mo's favorite drinks are cans of beer.  There are many scenes where Chen Mo holds a can of beer to his lips.Next, in the Supergirl (1984) movie, the main villainess is this human female who practices witchcraft and keeps a large demon for a pet.  This is repeated in Knights on Debris.  There is a female character with a huge monster as a sidekick.  She never displayed any powers like the other Knights of Thorne and has these dark shades around her eyes to make her look like a witch.  This character turned out to be the evil mastermind who orchestrated the deaths of all those other Knights.Lastly, in the last episode, everyone got sent to the Phantom Zone where they are unable to tap into their powers as Knights of Thorne.  The only movie to feature the Phantom Zone in the entire Superman lore is the Supergirl (1984) movie.  So we see that the work Knights on Debris is most based on is the 1984 Supergirl movie.  It's a mix match of Superman lore and STAR WARS that made me eagerly await a new episode each week!If anyone hasn't seen Supergirl (1984) movie, I highly recommend seeing it.  Not only does it have a superb soundtrack/score, but u can see how it matches closely with Knights on Debris S1 as a work of art. anymore Jedi-ean.This is what I love about the show, it's Kryptonians from the Superman lore set in the Star Wars/Star Trek universe!Right off the bat, we meet several Knights of Thorne (aka Kryptonians) -- a general called Keane (he's actually general Zod from Superman, but not an evil one), and several of his followers like Morena (taken after Ursa the female Kryptonian seen in Superman II the movie).

I watched the first season and fell in love with it, but I was convinced it would be one of those shows that would end at 12 episodes and then fall into obscurity. So imagine my surprise when it was immediately announced that there'd be a second season! Of course, I knew I'd devour it the second it came out, and as you can see here, I did!...Taking place immediately after the first season, Himeno Toyokawa learns more about the different kinds of pottery and ceramics every day, and even learns more about her mother and how she influenced the world of ceramics back in her day. But after a while, Himeno decides she wants to make her own, distinctive piece because of a suggestion her father made, but she mind wind up putting too much pressure on herself in doing so.Most sequels to media aren't very well received because they either try to be too ambitious, or reuse the same formula over and over again but with less inspiration than before. All Yakumo really does is just build on what made the first series good and explore the ideas it established further. The animation and music quality are both the same, so those haven't changed much, but the characters grow from the previous season, and their development is very subtle and well done, expanding on what they were in the first season. We also get to learn more about Touko's past and her issues with her grandfather. Though...as much as I liked Touko's backstory and how it culminated in the end, there's one huge part of it that absolutely baffles me to no end, and the show doesn't really try to explain that part in greater detail, and it just left me confused. I also liked that the creators gave Nao a bit more focus here, as I felt like she was little more than the basic comic relief in the first season.Not only that, the show introduces some new characters who actually contribute to the show and Himeno's development, such as a classmate of her mother's, and Ximena Valdez, a Mexican girl who loves ceramics and was influenced by Himeno's mother's creations. It's pretty rare for anime to depict characters of other races and from different countries outside of America, so to see a genuine Mexican in an anime is pretty refreshing (The only other one I can think of was Michiko and Hatchin, and that came out in 2008. There could be more that I'm not aware of, though). I can't exactly comment on the authenticity of Ximena's portrayal, as I'm not Mexican or Latin-American, but Ximena is a far cry from a lot of the stereotyped depictions of Mexican women in mainstream media, like the seductive temptress, a criminal, or a put-upon immigrant from an impoverished background. Ximena is fairly cheerful and enthusiastic, is clearly passionate about her work, worked very hard to get to where she is because she truly loves studying ceramics and pottery, and actually has a good grasp on the Japanese language. The main characters all accept her with open arms and make no comment on her race or background whatsoever. It helps that the Spanish used in the show is accurate and doesn't sound like it came out of Google Translate.One other thing Yakumo does well is that it doesn't try to rehash the same storylines as the first season, instead focusing on being much more character-driven and having more internal conflicts than the first. So you won't find them entering another ceramics contest at the end. But the show has always been about putting its characters first, even if most of them are still kind of tropey. That doesn't mean Yakumo doesn't have its moments of weirdness though. For some reason, one episode is completely dedicated to showing how Mika created the ceramic bird mascot of the series, and the show had the bright idea of giving the bird mascot a voice and internal thoughts. It's not as weird as that one episode of the first season, but it is a little jarring.So all in all, Yakunara Mug Cup mo season 2 built upon what made the first season great, and while not reaching any new heights or anything, still managed to be very sweet and a good show overall. Taking place immediately after the first season, Himeno Toyokawa learns more about the different kinds of pottery and ceramics every day, and even learns more about her mother and how she influenced the world of ceramics back in her day. But after a while, Himeno decides she wants to make her own, distinctive piece because of a suggestion her father made, but she mind wind up putting too much pressure on herself in doing so.Most sequels to media aren't very well received because they either try to be too ambitious, or reuse the same formula over and over again but with less inspiration than before.

I can\'t believe that they made a more powerful follow-up to a POTTERY ANIME of all things.As the perilous artist\'s journey continues, it doesn\'t make for an explosive innovative entrance. Unless you consider the VAs getting in the POTTERY ANIME BRANDED GOVERNMENT VAN to be innovative, I guess you can call it a default 10/10 :3Nay, Let\'s Make a Mug Too! S2 (henceforth Yakumo S2) continues the artist\'s journey. If you have no idea what that looks like, allow me to present a crude 3-step method of how to get into professional art:1. Develop interest and passion for your medium.2. Get good.3....Enjoy the craft as you\'re a true professional.Yakumo S2 focuses on steps 2 and 3 because Himeno isn\'t the central focus of the story this time. It focuses on the motivations for the main cast. From dealing with circumstantial setbacks (Mika) to upholding family legacies (Touko-senpai), the cast of characters discover the true meaning of pottery... Something that I couldn\'t be fucked to tell you what that actually means lol.Honestly, I felt like that point was just to generate faux depth for the story. From what I could gleam into, the essence of pottery is no different than the rest of the crafts like painting or even drawing anime frames. It\'s just the methodology (hands-on vs using a pencil vs using CG for anime) that\'s different.But that\'s okay, this IS a show designed to be light-hearted and easily digestible from the ground up. Even though the character development can seem like a mega-miss because of how short-lived it really is, the themes and overall development are perfect for the half-length episodes. The show gets their points across with a clean cut every time.And golly gee, Jim. The story does feel excellent as always. Through the expressions of the characters and what they make, you can feel that sense of progression happening between seasons, even if it isn\'t explicitly shown.------""But what about the specials, Mr. Chips901? It was the only reason why you rated S1 so high! Is it the same this time around?""Why yes, wayward reader. I\'m so glad you asked.Yes, the specials take it a step further, ranging from appreciating history to the VAs making a piece of pottery that they can feel proud of.One immediate difference I noticed was the dichotomy of appreciation from people who regularly watch anime vs the town of Tajimi. As mentioned above, the town REALLY liked Yakumo for how well produced and faithful it is. Not only do they have an anime branded government car, they also went as far as to say that the town would showcase some of the pieces that the VAs made! Needless to say, it startled VAs for just how good of a job they did. In contrast, both AniList and MAL rate this show as a mid-to-high 6, meaning that the casual audience probably expected someone to die.On the history side, all I can say is that for someone to be designated as a Living Treasure, you would have to stand at the very apex of the craft itself. Like, they talk about one ancient gigachad who singlehandedly recreated an ancient pottery style FROM A SINGLE FORGOTTEN SHARD. It\'s a feat that\'s more impressive than whatever I\'ll be able to accomplish in my weak bloodline...On the side of VAs producing a pottery piece, that\'s where things get a bit more interesting.How do you judge amateur work? Well, you\'d judge by what you can see. But if that\'s all you can see, then that\'s a pretty shallow and casual take on it. Professionals take it a step further by judging the shape of the idea itself, being able to see the underlying potential in one\'s work.This doesn\'t apply too much to Yakumo, since the VAs received professional help in realizing the end result, but hey. Y\'know what they say, it\'s the thought that counts!For the most part, the VAs made an earnest effort to create something memorable. To that extent, at the advice of the expert helping them, they created something related to their interests. While two of the VAs\' creations were simple and clear, one VA tried to make something abstract, and the other... A butt with T H I C C legs and heels.I shit you not. That VA said something like ""I didn\'t like how [the butt piece] turned out. The butt ended up being more masculine and thicc in nature,"" despite receiving professional help with shaping such a piece. It was at that point that I knew Yakumo S2 was a 10/10.------Sometimes, you just gotta take a step back and enjoy the little things. When you\'re drinking something delightful out of something handmade, there\'s something inexplicably special about it. Yakumo S2 successfully captures this, even if melodramatic for what it is. Pottery itself still continues to not be intrinsically exciting, but as stated in my previous review, it\'s all about having fun with the creative process.Yakumo S2 gets a 10/10 simply because they did an excellent job at showcasing what they wanted to showcase, be it the continuation of an artist\'s journey or the butt. They did such a good job that creating a competing pottery anime of the same calibre would be very VERY difficult. It\'s one of those cases where less ends up being a lot more.Should you watch Yakumo S2? Obviously, my answer is a resounding yes, both anime and specials. As usual, if you\'re just grinding anime for the sake of completion, you\'d only disappoint yourself as you can only see this as a write-off. On the flipside, it is more pottery and then some. It is the pursuit of inspiration itself.For me, I\'ll always look back on this anime with a peculiar brand of fondness. It\'ll always bring a smile to my face no matter how hard I critically think about it.

Clamp Gakuen Tanteidan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1844/Clamp_Gakuen_Tanteidan,"[""Let me start of by saying this anime was created by the one and only CLAMP.Now that you know let me start my review.CLAMP Gakuen Tanteidan, or CLAMP School Detectives, is the story of three little investigators  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira, who are also members of the three-person elementary student council of their school.I guess this has a good story but I didn't see any goal in it. What do they want to happen? What are they trying to find? The only thing I see happening in this anime are there life and times inside the school. They beat bad guys up...and discovers themselves after some time.It has, fortunately, some exciting action. Kids beating up bad guys looks cool.Storylines' a bit(just a bit) lame but I give the art some praise. The drawings are very detailed and pretty advanced for its time. The hair-blowing is also pretty good.Though I'm a guy I cannot resist saying... the characters are so cute and adorable.The music is nice. The pretty sound of the singers' voices are very likable. The opening and ending theme, however, is a letdown for me because it had nothing to do with the anime's plot. Little boys and girls pausing beautifully for the audience.Once fangirls see them screaming is unavoidable.The characters are fair enough. Nokoru for me is the blonde eminence of Shuichi Minamino. Suoh is an all around serious character with a pure heart which kind of reminds me of CLAMP's very own Li Shaoran who I like very much. Akira is adorable enough. I felt the girls never contributed anything except blow their pheromone all over Nokoru's staff.&quot;I'll give my life to this kindergartener.&quot; One of them said.Enjoyment... I can't explain much. I found the action very cool and the character design great. I did not like the storyline and romance though.My overall score is 7 out of 10. This might not appeal much to hardcore fans but it's perfect for kids or beginners. and discovers themselves after some time.It has, fortunately, some exciting action.

I originally came upon this show because i am a huge fan of clamp and i really enjoyed alot of their other works such as Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles one of my favorite clamp manga's. Other works include X/1999, Chobits, Card captor sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, XXXholic. Initially i was very excited to watch this show seeing as how i loved all of clamps creations how ever i was a bit let down.The setting for this series revolves around this large school comprised of bout 10,000 students with many different divisions and many activities, academics,...athletics, and just bout anything you can think of.  Nokoru, Suoh, and Akira are the 3 main protagonists of the series and are also the lead council members of the elementary division. These three kids must solve many cases around the school of certain mysterious happenings, usually involving a damsel in distress.Later on as you get a little further into the show, some of the main players of the series start to develop relationships with these elementary kindergarten females which is a nice touch, and the romance is not shown as true love which it shouldn't be given the fact that these characters are pretty underage. But i do appreciate how each relationship with these two female casts grow as you get further in the show and they start to be a part of the clamp school detectives.I think the strongest aspect of this show is the characters. The nice thing about the trio of protagonists is that they each bring something different to the show. Nokoru is the youngest son of the founders of the Clamp School and is essentially a prodigy in every sense of the word. Suoh is nearly as sharp as Nokoru, but where he lacks in the powers of observation he makes up for with his physical attributes. Akira is the youngest of the three. He's a little more naïve, a better cook, and sees things more optimistically than his friends. They play off each other quite nicely and right from the very first episode they have a chemistry that easily carries the weight of 26 episodes.At first glance i thought this would be a series that focuses more on like mysterious happenings and murder cases, because the first episode kind of gives you that impression, but really most of the cases they solve are trying to help some lady that is in trouble, because of the episodic nature of the show, each case involves a different scenario.Although their is one particular plot in the show that takes place towards the end, the last 6 episodes with a more straightforward story and the introduction of a rather intriguing character. This story really caught my attention. It was much different then former episodic nature of the plot and a little more on a serous level, though the idea behind it was rather predictable, it still held my attention.  Which i thought was really the only thing that redeemed this anime series as far as the simplistic progression of the story. Which is why i rated it a 6 and not lower.If your a fan of clamp though, this series may be enjoyable, but if you have not seen other clamp works, i highly recommend you pass on this one and watch other great works from clamp. Other wise if you have nothing else to watch and are a clamp fanatic and want to watch every clamp in existence then give this one a shot as a last resort, then you may enjoy this series to an extent depending upon your tastes. athletics, and just bout anything you can think of.

And it is, in my opinion, a very entertaining show. I just finished this series and decided to write a review about it - my first review, actually. Here we go.• Story - 9/10In the first 20 episodes there isn\'t a story. We follow the lives of three elementary school boys that happen to be in the Elementary School Council and are also (self-proclaimed) detectives. They - well, mostly their ""leader"", Nokoru, wants to help all the ladies he sees in trouble. He doesn\'t want to see any girl crying and is willing...to do anything to help her. So the boys get in a lot of situations, some funny ones, some troublesome ones, and some actually dangerous ones. To achieve their goals they do things that real children aren\'t able to do - that most people aren\'t able to do, actually. In some episodes they actually have to solve cases, follow clues to find things, and they have the help of other characters, especially two girls from the school\'s kindergarten. Those two girls are also supposed to be the romantic interests of two of the main boys, but of course, they are all children, so the ""love"" in this show is represented as the most pure thing in the world, and nothing is sexualized, in case there was someone worried about it.Later in the series, the ""villain"" makes his appearance, so we have a more serious atmosphere and an actual plot.• Art/Animation - 9/10CLAMP 90s artstyle, it\'s simply gorgeous. I don\'t have much to talk about it, I just have a soft spot for oldschool art.• Sound - 8/10The soundtrack, all composed by Ali Project, isn\'t very memorable, but it wasn\'t bad at all; it did its job perfectly, fitting the show pretty well. The opening song is very catchy, and the endings were both good, especially the second one, but also not very memorable.The voice actors were great at their roles, I have nothing to complain about them.• Characters - 10/10All of them have different personalities and are very likeable. Our protagonists are all children. Three boys at age 11~12; Nokoru Imonoyama, who is the president of the ESC, is a bit irresponsible, but very kind, and really cares for the people he loves, and for the whole CLAMP Academy; Suoh Takamura is the serious type, he really respects Nokoru but also gets really mad at the his lack of responsibility; and Akira Ijyuin, who is also the main character of the manga 20 Mensou ni Onegai!!, is the youngest one, he enjoys cooking and is probably the most childish of the three boys.The two girls, Nagisa Azuya and Utako Ohkawa, are members of the Kindergarten School Council, they often help or are helped by the main boys.Some characters from other CLAMP manga series make some appearances, like Kentaro, Takeshi, Eri and Sukiyabashi, from School Defenders Duklyon and Miyuki from Miyuki-chan in Wonderland.Other characters usually show up in only one or two episodes.• Enjoyment - 10/10I loved it. I thought the manga was a good series to pass time, but nothing actually special, but I had a lot of fun watching the anime. It was really cute and amusing. Even though it\'s mostly episodic, the cases never get boring.• Overall - 9/10If you are into light-hearted stories, isn\'t worried about realism, and enjoy episodic series, I\'d suggest you to give CLAMP School Detectives a shot! to do anything to help her. So the boys get in a lot of situations, some funny ones, some troublesome ones, and some actually dangerous ones.

The opening song is very catchy, and the endings were both good, especially the second one, but also not very memorable.The voice actors were great at their roles, I have nothing to complain about them.• Characters - 10/10All of them have different personalities and are very likeable. Our protagonists are all children. Three boys at age 11~12; Nokoru Imonoyama, who is the president of the ESC, is a bit irresponsible, but very kind, and really cares for the people he loves, and for the whole CLAMP Academy; Suoh Takamura is the serious type, he really respects Nokoru but also gets really mad at the his lack of responsibility; and Akira Ijyuin, who is also the main character of the manga 20 Mensou ni Onegai!!, is the youngest one, he enjoys cooking and is probably the most childish of the three boys.The two girls, Nagisa Azuya and Utako Ohkawa, are members of the Kindergarten School Council, they often help or are helped by the main boys.Some characters from other CLAMP manga series make some appearances, like Kentaro, Takeshi, Eri and Sukiyabashi, from School Defenders Duklyon and Miyuki from Miyuki-chan in Wonderland.Other characters usually show up in only one or two episodes.• Enjoyment - 10/10I loved it. I thought the manga was a good series to pass time, but nothing actually special, but I had a lot of fun watching the anime. It was really cute and amusing. Even though it\'s mostly episodic, the cases never get boring.• Overall - 9/10If you are into light-hearted stories, isn\'t worried about realism, and enjoy episodic series, I\'d suggest you to give CLAMP School Detectives a shot!']"
Yama no Susume,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14355/Yama_no_Susume,"['It’s very rare to find a great show among animated shorts. Many of them produce situational one-shots with the same characters in the same setting. While some of them do have a serial timeline, shorts often lack the details of storytelling. The short series Encouragement of Climb (Yama no Susume) counters these claims by creating situations chronologically with wonderful progression and development for its protagonists.Encouragement of Climb follows two high school girls and their adventures in hiking to mountain summits across Japan. Aoi, the scared and unsure of the two, learns to overcome her anxieties while being accompanied by Hinata, the tomboyish enthusiastic one who...appears to have some experience in hiking. With each episode, audiences learn a little tidbit on activities and ethics in camping and hiking as they watch the girls learn to hike together.The visuals for this anime consist of more simple drawings with “watercolor” effects, faded coloring that’s not nearly as bright or vivid as most anime. I personally like this style because it does not distract the audience from appearances and fan service and forces them to focus mainly on the situation the characters are in. Visuals for animations and films like this one accompany the story rather than make it the main reason people watch it. I certainly love the characters this way for who they are, rather than how they look.One thing I did enjoy about this series is the reality displayed when one goes on a hike in the mountains. Being somewhat of a hiker myself, I have learned that not all mountain trails are steep, scary, or even arduous, as Aoi originally thinks when it comes to climbing mountains or hills. In fact, their first trail blaze was on a neighboring hill that took them less than a day to reach the summit! The trials Aoi and Hinata face are not only literal in climbing mountains, but figurative in climbing our lives’ scariest moments. All progress in life is a hurdle that many of us face with fear and anxiety, as Aoi had done; but with the help of good friends and a little encouragement from within, we can climb our way to the top.Encouragement of Climb is a beautiful short series, not only for its story and characters, but it also showed me that I can climb the “mountains” in my life. appears to have some experience in hiking.

Not kidding: EXTREMELY. BAD.

It\'s logical, and yet moving. Heck, this is a life any of us could well have lived: how do you call an anime about people with magical powers or mecha ""slice of life"" ? So, sticking to this definition of Slice, Yama no Susume is actually quite good in my opinion.Bottom line: It\'s not an action anime, but I still found the story to be very enjoyable.Art: 8Fresh, light-hearted and colorful without ever great taste. Not quite as comedic as Kotoura-San, neither as artistic as Sakurasou na Pet no Kanojo, and I think that\'s a good side: an up-the-ante art would have really looked off against the story.

It is short, only 3 minutes per episode. That's why I think this anime can't be very good. How could it be good if it is only 3 minutes? Moreover the story is just about little girl playing around? But, seriously this anime is not like what I thought at first.Yama no Susume. A story of courage and friendship. As its title -Encouragement of Climb- say, this story is about a little kid (Aoi) who build up her courage in trying something new...with the help of her friends. This anime has strong nostalgic feeling, reminding me of my childhood. The moment when we still dream high and try to achieve it, even if it seems impossible. A nice anime that everyone can watch. Watching it together with someone else is also fine.Story (7/10)Simple, funny, and heartwarming. The story is about climbing mountain and trying something new mixed with some comedy. It shows daily activities with a lot of everyday conversation. The story bring up many kind of feeling (happy, worry, sad, embarrassed etc) mixed together. I like it when the characters is smiling. It bring happy feeling to the viewer. The story just flows with nothing big or special happened.Art (10/10)The way character drawn is cute. I love the design. Not only the characters, but also the view like mountain, sun, and sea is well drawn. I like the art in the ending song of each episode.Sound (10/10)ED song (Staccato Days) is pleasant to be heard. I have repeated it so many times and still not bored of it until I write this review. The background music is also nice and the voice actress fits the characters too.Character (9/10)Aoi's reserved, like to do things alone, and thinking too much personality and Hinata's cheerful and mature for her age personality make them a cute pair. There is a nice character development on Aoi despite the anime short duration. There is difference between Aoi in the beginning of the story and Aoi in the end. I did not really like the other two girl characters.I'll mention three things I like about Yama no Susume- Beautiful little girls- A lot of outdoor activities with nice view- Courage to trying something newPS : Feedback for the review is welcomed with the help of her friends.

Yama no Susume is about Aoi, a shy girl who is scared of heights, then a childhood friend Hinita forces her to start climbing, a friendship begins and Aoi gradually begins to have more confidence.Short anime series are known for not having a clear plot, but this surprising has one and has great continuity. The series focuses on Hinita and Aoi’s goal to climb a mountain, and the episodes flow and join each into each other seamlessly. Each episode is focused climbing in someway, whether they’re shopping for a new bag, or climbing up a hill.The character’s...are fantastic. Aoi starts off shy and is socially awkward, but overtime as she goes outside her comfort zone by climbing mountains/hills and talking to people, she becomes more confident, and happier over time. It was really great seeing her gain more confidence during the series. Hinita and the other characters are also very likeable. Especially Hinata, who is very energetic and often encourages Aoi.This is a very lighthearted and fun anime to watch, however it doesn’t take itself very seriously as it doesn’t explore the emotional challenges Aoi went through like the struggles of trying to be more social. I would definitely recommend watching this if you want to watch an anime that’s going to make you smile.Constructive feedback for this review is appreciated :) are fantastic.

Slightly empty plot-wise, but it gives the viewers mostly a very warm feeling as they understand how the characters interact with each other in a generally productive way. It's very realistic of Japanese schoolgirls interacting with each other. But I have to say that the story is very straight-forward with no frills attached as the main purpose of the story came from a manga that introduces the hobby of mountaineering. You know, a huge chunk of what Japan is in a nutshell.Without explaining about...the whole storyline, it's very short and full of good vibrations. Well, the good vibrations in this case are the warm and positive friendship of being comrades.I overall recommend this series very immensively for the purpose of watching the 2nd season, where the story spices things up. What spices the story is very sweet.And one more thing about Yama no Susume (essentially Season 1). There is no opening theme song, but a closing theme song that has something that is colorfully applied and it is called staccato, a music term that denotes a note that is slightly shortened and slightly strengthened. I would recommend to feel the music as well and watch this series as it sets the whole dominant mood of the story, AKA their love for mountaineering. the whole storyline, it's very short and full of good vibrations.

Yes, no doubt: it\'s a slice of life, it hasn\'t a dense complex plot which has to be carefully developed in order to be enjoyable;...it\'s just 2 to 4 girls mountaineering, everything that has to be said for plot purposes fits perfectly in the short span of time that the anime is allowed to occupy, with plenty of room left for the enjoyment of the cuteness of the characters and of the beauty of the scenery (which is good enough for a scenery-centered anime although not great). If on the other hand you are wondering how a show about mountaineering can be cute, let me reassure you: all the characters are very sweet, and honestly in a world where loli/basket anime Ro-Kyu-Bu! exists anything can be moe (by the way Yama no Susume\'s Kokona and Ro-Kyu-Bu!\'s Hina, who have the same role in their shows as the ""loliest"" girls, have also the same seiyuu).Overall if you\'re interested in the genre the runtime should not discourage you: Yama no Susume is a very good choice, and if at the end you\'re feeling like you would have wanted more of this, well, go straight to the second season (it\'s as good as the first, and much longer!). it\'s just 2 to 4 girls mountaineering, everything that has to be said for plot purposes fits perfectly in the short span of time that the anime is allowed to occupy, with plenty of room left for the enjoyment of the cuteness of the characters and of the beauty of the scenery (which is good enough for a scenery-centered anime although not great).

And following my expectations, the first season of the series is just average, I can't say that it's anything other than average, but I thought the second season was good.• Much like other moe shows like K-On, Yuru Yuri, or New Game! The second series are usually far superior, due to the fact the the studio seems to be more comfortable quirks, and the audience is more familiar with the girls’ cute quirksーso character and story exploration can take place. Encouragement of the Climb...doesn't betray its sister shows in that aspect.• Along the same vein of Akari having an existential crisis at the end of the second season of Yuru Yuri, the second season of this series goes more into Aoi's fear of heights. The first season does touch on it, but since the shorts in the first season are far shorter (episodes in S1 are three minute segments, while the ante is ramped up to fifteen minute weeklies in S2), before, the show only had time to teach us about hiking.• Moe shows about a protagonist overcoming a fear or personality flaw is a stereotype, but a stereotype that I often enjoy. I really enjoyed that Girls und Panzer took Miho's character a step further than the rest, by having her deal with PTSD and an overbearing, abusive family.• I enjoyed the cute little vignettes that made you think that this collection of stories is sweeter than a diabetic pony. I can also say that Encouragement of the Climb got me really interested in hiking, which is spectacular since I rarely leave my house. The arc where the girls climbed Mt. Fuji, or Fuji-san as they call it, was particularly touching and well-written.• Overall, if you want to watch something adorable, emotionally moving, and something that will encourage you to break your shut-in habits, then you would probably love the hell out this series! If you don't like moe, then don't, but it’s a very fun and encapsulating experience for a series of short episodes: seriously the times range is from 3-13 minutes.

For almost anything, if you try, it\'ll usually work out.""It\'s refreshing to find a fresh short anime akin to Yama no Susume. There isn\'t a lot like them, ones with a continuous story, an enjoyable growing cast of characters, and most importantly of all is a joy to watch. In 3 minutes Yama no Susume captures the essence of a normal 20+ minute episode without losing any quality. It doesn\'t feel like a shorts anime is what I\'m trying to articulate, the pace is what you\'d expect from a typical CGDCT anime.

When she stumbles into Hinata Kuraue an exuberant ball of energy, she reignites Aoi\'s encouragement to climb. (pun intended) Aoi hesitantly is pushed into the whole mountain climbing thing unable to really say no because of her innate shyness, but throughout the short series we see her find happiness from climbing, and how much fun it is to be with Hinata and the others she befriends as a result.""I hadn\'t looked at the sky for a long time, but when you take an interest you start to be able to see something, and it leads you to something else.""Without being reintroduced to mountain climbing by Hinata, Aoi wouldn\'t have took an interest of climbing once more, and would have missed the opportunity to make friends with Kaede and Kokona. I\'m impressed with the sheer amount of great lessons in this short series, and seeing something like climbing a mountain from a casual perspective is fascinating. Anime like Yuru Camp take a similar approach on camping and there are some parallels but as a whole Yama no Susume strikes a different chord.I can easily see why Yama no Susume has garnered multiple sequels which all in all take the series from a 3 minute short anime into a full blown 24 minute regular series!

This is probably best viewed in one go.Visually, this is kinda like Yuru Camp before Yuru Camp even got to production. It would\'ve been quick, easy, and cheap to do what many shorts do, which is stick with low-detail backdrops and lots of low-movement animation, but 8bit made sure each episode was richly animated.I\'ve come to the realization that I will probably endure a terrible anime if the soundtrack is fantastic. Season 1 of Yama no Susume is ""all right"" in my estimation, and the soundtrack is largely unassuming-- but then there\'s not much to compose within a cour of 3-minute episodes.

Regardless, Time Drive goes into more detail between the relationship of Lady & Cobra as every other material relating to Cobra displays their partnership as platonic or professional coworkers. However, Time Drive shows Cobra & Lady as romantic in their past life as her operation to becoming an Armaroid...is also featured into the story. The rest of the OVA focuses on this revolt towards this king named Giros in which Lady or Emeralda wishes to overthrow.Time Drive is a nice addition to the series but doesn\'t have that ""kickass"" feel of the original anime of 1982, possibly due to the usage of cgi & the lack of cool villains. There\'s is some action but once again Cobra doesn\'t use his signature Colt Python & most of his battles are with the Swordian aliens.It\'s interesting to see Cobra & Lady being lovers, yet no other series seem to explore their relationship as Cobra seems to be more smitten with other women & never grieves about his past life with Lady. I should also note that this is the last time Nozawa Nachi plays Cobra as in next series ,Cobra The Animation 2010, Uchida Naoya takes the role of Cobra. I\'m actually surprised Lady\'s actress, Sakakibara Yoshikio managed to be the only voice of Lady for almost 3 decades.

I know Terasawa was involved in these OVAs but I feel like this is the story of Lady that we didn't need. She's always been an enigma, even in the manga.

A refreshing take on the disaster movie, TOC regularly introduces well-crafted conflicts that\'ll be sure to impress avid sci-fi fans. A compelling series of ethical dilemmas accompany our cast\'s survival story, which ramps up into a jaw-dropping climax of ear-grinningly epic proportions. TOC is occasionally hampered by unnatural patches of comedy and drops in pacing, but brilliant worldbuilding makes this series an immersive binge. 8/10~***""Mindblown."" It\'s a sentiment that you\'ll likely be left with upon watching ""The Orbital Children"" (TOC). This brisk, 6-episode Netflix ONA is very much ""Mindblown: The Anime."" And no, I\'m not...just referring to its tight mystery-thriller sci-fi script. While it relentlessly piles on ingenious worldbuilding and ethical dilemmas, TOC ultimately asks its audience to confront the value in confusion. What do we really know about the world around us? How do we face problems we can\'t solve individually? Is it worth seeking out the unknown? Take a chance on me and find out, as we take a spoiler-free leap into TOC. 3… 2… 1… we have liftoff!""Houston, we have a problem."" In the year 2045, the manned space station and hotel, ""Anshin,"" prepares a landing party for Earthling tourists sponsored by Deegle (any likeness shared with Google is purely coincidental.) Brilliant hacker Touya Sagami, one of the two remaining children born on the moon, is deeply resentful of the ""idiot Earthers"" he\'s hosting. That being said, just one party pooper isn\'t enough to dampen the excitement of the station\'s visitors: Taiyo, Mina and Hiroshi. But with a surprise comet en route to damage both the shuttle and the world below, perhaps it\'s no time to be ""anshin-shiro"" (""relieved"" in Japanese.) Touya and the other personnel on-board have to do a lot more than just survive the cosmic onslaught. Uncovering the mystery surrounding the incoming comet will reveal a complex array of problems that puts the entire world at stake.TOC showcases great worldbuilding in outer space. Series creator Mitsuo Iso\'s vision of what the future will look like is equal parts fascinating and sobering. Throughout the course of this tightly-written survival story, viewers will be treated to a well thought-out futuristic setting. Technological devices within the show take full advantage of the whimsy sci-fi allows, while keeping things intuitive and easy to understand. Presumably to the delight of ""VIVY"" fans, artificial intelligence is explored in great detail, raising interesting considerations regarding how society should integrate with such powerful technology. The introduction of space travel offers more than mere set dressing, and opens up a recurring ethical dilemma about Earth\'s overpopulation & natural resource crises. Having recently sat through the sheer sci-fi stupidity of ""BELLE"", I was thoroughly impressed by how much better TOC fared in terms of establishing conflict and discussing what the future might hold. Also noteworthy is how TOC handles its characters. Despite shocking reveals and shifts in alliances, none of the cast members can be pinned down as a traditional ""villain,"" and everyone is doing their utmost to deal with the cataclysmic chaos at hand. Even though the characters themselves scarcely feel all that developed personality-wise, they certainly get the job done through compelling personal motivations. Aside from some ill-timed comedy and poor patches of pacing, TOC makes for an engrossing binge, with a lean runtime of just over 3 hours. Production +h\'s debut studio effort does a capable job, thanks to capable 2D animation and compositing. However, with visual eye-candy comes visible confusion; TOC is not an easy show to grasp at times. The series may prove demanding due to its exposition of sci-fi and mystery elements. Furthermore, the frequent switching between narrative perspectives makes the task of keeping up with the show\'s heavy exposition all the more cumbersome. TOC might feel overwhelming with its themes and subject matter, but not without good reason. The series can be boiled down to an uplifting core message, which I\'ll now explain by bringing up the complex perspective of our MC, Touya.Space may as well be the final frontier, because it\'s all Touya has left. Remember what I said about MC hating humans? Well, we\'re about to get into why. In the past, human attempts at starting a moon colony would be thwarted due to the deaths of infants born there. This ""moon sickness"" throws off hormone development in the young, and needed treatment in the form of brain implants designed by the smartest A.I. of its time, Seven. These A.I. limiters would control hormone balance until adolescence, thereby allowing moon children to grow up. Unfortunately, the brain limiters could not be deactivated after childhood, meaning that the moon sickness these kids avoided as infants would kill them as teenagers. The only being capable of fixing this design flaw, Seven, was discarded for surpassing human control. No A.I. since reached Seven\'s massive computational capacity, due to rigid regulations on A.I. power. Plans to build civilization on the moon were eventually scrapped, dooming Touya to a deadly fate. From Touya\'s POV, the Earthers made him bear this curse, with no means of a cure, now that the A.I.s got nerfed. But our boy was born on the friggin\' moon; he\'s not giving up that easily. In response to the world threatening his existence, Touya\'s goal is to hack away all of his A.I. drone\'s limiters and usher in the second coming of Seven. To Touya, this is the only way of saving him and Konoha, the only other moon child on-board the ""Anshin.""Now, let\'s take a step back from this lunar perspective and see the other side of the ethical coin. In stark contrast to the rebel hacker from outer space, the law-abiding UN agent Taiyo could not disagree more with Touya\'s worldview. Seven\'s deactivation followed after the out-of-control A.I. instigated several global incidents that cost hundreds of lives. A rogue A.I. mega-computer is the last thing governments would want to deal with, given the other problems on their plate. Overpopulation is threatening the end of the human race. Having lost control of the situation once before, the UN is intent on ensuring that all variables are kept in check, as the world assesses her dire options. Taiyo wouldn\'t dare risk causing another Seven Saga to occur, especially with a situation so critical. Then again, perhaps Touya\'s gambit of fully trusting A.I. may be the best solution, which both saves the world and repairs the malfunctioning implants.

To further complicate things, maybe the best move is the utilitarian one, where the imminent comet is allowed to wipe out a third of the world\'s population, thereby preserving man\'s existence. What\'s the right answer?Confused? Same. In the beginning of this review, I said that this show is going for the ""mindblown"" effect. Hopefully I\'ve demonstrated how the show lives up to that description, and we haven\'t even touched on TOC\'s esoteric stances on ethics, religion or predeterminism. The unorthodox climax of Episode 6 consists of quite possibly the most mind-boggling conceptual jargon I\'ve ever heard, a plethora of which flew over my head like shooting stars. But as I said before, TOC also shows us the meaning in confusion. Confusion is possibly the most effective motivator we have for thinking. After all, if we never challenge ourselves with difficult questions, we\'ll never be motivated to develop our way of thinking or arrive at valuable answers. In TOC, a concept mentioned prominently is that of ""the frame,"" or ""the cradle."" These terms can be read as ""perspective."" From young, each of us grew up seeing the world from our personal, unique frames. But just like peering out of a space shuttle window to look down on Earth, we eventually come to realize how small we are in the grand scheme of things, and how many other frames exist - we get ""mindblown."" Much like the orbiting children, we need to realize that our perspective isn\'t always enough to solve the most challenging of problems. The layered predicament facing the crew of the ""Anshin"" can only be solved through the integration of frames and open-minded collaboration.

Yes, confusion is inevitable, and we tend to fear what we do not understand. But the uncertainty could hold all the answers; sometimes you won\'t know unless you take a leap of faith and escape your frame. It\'s a great message for TOC to conclude on, as the show relishes the unknown opportunities of humanity\'s future amidst eminent problems. Watching Touya and the crew escape the frame of conventional thinking is a thrilling, cathartic experience - one that I\'m hoping you try out for yourself.***Phew, that was a fun trip. Thanks for joining me! If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews for seasons past and present, peace~ just referring to its tight mystery-thriller sci-fi script. While it relentlessly piles on ingenious worldbuilding and ethical dilemmas, TOC ultimately asks its audience to confront the value in confusion. What do we really know about the world around us? How do we face problems we can\'t solve individually? Is it worth seeking out the unknown? Take a chance on me and find out, as we take a spoiler-free leap into TOC. 3… 2… 1… we have liftoff!""Houston, we have a problem."" In the year 2045, the manned space station and hotel, ""Anshin,"" prepares a landing party for Earthling tourists sponsored by Deegle (any likeness shared with Google is purely coincidental.) Brilliant hacker Touya Sagami, one of the two remaining children born on the moon, is deeply resentful of the ""idiot Earthers"" he\'s hosting. That being said, just one party pooper isn\'t enough to dampen the excitement of the station\'s visitors: Taiyo, Mina and Hiroshi. But with a surprise comet en route to damage both the shuttle and the world below, perhaps it\'s no time to be ""anshin-shiro"" (""relieved"" in Japanese.) Touya and the other personnel on-board have to do a lot more than just survive the cosmic onslaught. Uncovering the mystery surrounding the incoming comet will reveal a complex array of problems that puts the entire world at stake.TOC showcases great worldbuilding in outer space. Series creator Mitsuo Iso\'s vision of what the future will look like is equal parts fascinating and sobering. Throughout the course of this tightly-written survival story, viewers will be treated to a well thought-out futuristic setting. Technological devices within the show take full advantage of the whimsy sci-fi allows, while keeping things intuitive and easy to understand. Presumably to the delight of ""VIVY"" fans, artificial intelligence is explored in great detail, raising interesting considerations regarding how society should integrate with such powerful technology. The introduction of space travel offers more than mere set dressing, and opens up a recurring ethical dilemma about Earth\'s overpopulation & natural resource crises. Having recently sat through the sheer sci-fi stupidity of ""BELLE"", I was thoroughly impressed by how much better TOC fared in terms of establishing conflict and discussing what the future might hold. Also noteworthy is how TOC handles its characters. Despite shocking reveals and shifts in alliances, none of the cast members can be pinned down as a traditional ""villain,"" and everyone is doing their utmost to deal with the cataclysmic chaos at hand. Even though the characters themselves scarcely feel all that developed personality-wise, they certainly get the job done through compelling personal motivations. Aside from some ill-timed comedy and poor patches of pacing, TOC makes for an engrossing binge, with a lean runtime of just over 3 hours. Production +h\'s debut studio effort does a capable job, thanks to capable 2D animation and compositing. However, with visual eye-candy comes visible confusion; TOC is not an easy show to grasp at times. The series may prove demanding due to its exposition of sci-fi and mystery elements. Furthermore, the frequent switching between narrative perspectives makes the task of keeping up with the show\'s heavy exposition all the more cumbersome. TOC might feel overwhelming with its themes and subject matter, but not without good reason. The series can be boiled down to an uplifting core message, which I\'ll now explain by bringing up the complex perspective of our MC, Touya.Space may as well be the final frontier, because it\'s all Touya has left. Remember what I said about MC hating humans? Well, we\'re about to get into why. In the past, human attempts at starting a moon colony would be thwarted due to the deaths of infants born there. This ""moon sickness"" throws off hormone development in the young, and needed treatment in the form of brain implants designed by the smartest A.I. of its time, Seven. These A.I. limiters would control hormone balance until adolescence, thereby allowing moon children to grow up. Unfortunately, the brain limiters could not be deactivated after childhood, meaning that the moon sickness these kids avoided as infants would kill them as teenagers. The only being capable of fixing this design flaw, Seven, was discarded for surpassing human control. No A.I. since reached Seven\'s massive computational capacity, due to rigid regulations on A.I. power. Plans to build civilization on the moon were eventually scrapped, dooming Touya to a deadly fate. From Touya\'s POV, the Earthers made him bear this curse, with no means of a cure, now that the A.I.s got nerfed. But our boy was born on the friggin\' moon; he\'s not giving up that easily. In response to the world threatening his existence, Touya\'s goal is to hack away all of his A.I. drone\'s limiters and usher in the second coming of Seven. To Touya, this is the only way of saving him and Konoha, the only other moon child on-board the ""Anshin.""Now, let\'s take a step back from this lunar perspective and see the other side of the ethical coin. In stark contrast to the rebel hacker from outer space, the law-abiding UN agent Taiyo could not disagree more with Touya\'s worldview. Seven\'s deactivation followed after the out-of-control A.I. instigated several global incidents that cost hundreds of lives. A rogue A.I. mega-computer is the last thing governments would want to deal with, given the other problems on their plate. Overpopulation is threatening the end of the human race. Having lost control of the situation once before, the UN is intent on ensuring that all variables are kept in check, as the world assesses her dire options. Taiyo wouldn\'t dare risk causing another Seven Saga to occur, especially with a situation so critical. Then again, perhaps Touya\'s gambit of fully trusting A.I. may be the best solution, which both saves the world and repairs the malfunctioning implants. Touya\'s and Taiyo\'s ideologies are at polar opposites, and their respective resolves are iron-clad, even if both are trying to do the right thing. Is technology the threat or the solution? To further complicate things, maybe the best move is the utilitarian one, where the imminent comet is allowed to wipe out a third of the world\'s population, thereby preserving man\'s existence.

Thanks for joining me! If you happen to like my verbose rants, feel free to check out my other reviews for seasons past and present, peace~', ""I’ve been officially ordered to write something about this film, and in the process of doing so, have somehow mustered up enough willpower to slap together my scattered, disjointed thoughts into something vaguely coherent but still not all the way purposeful as a legitimate review of this film. Now, If I’m being honest, isn't that how all reviews should be? You don’t need someone to tell you if a show is worth watching. It’s actually possible to make those observations yourself. I apologize if that sounds abrasive, but I think some of you could stand to be a little more staunch in your opinions on...such things. Now I'm meandering. On the to review—if you can call it that.Tragically, I’ve made the unfortunate mistake of not watching Dennou-coil before this, and as a result, I’m probably missing out on some referential pay-offs that the majority of you will be finger-pointing and giggling to yourselves over. Maybe that would have primed me towards the more technical aspects of this films world-building? But no matter.It’s not like I came to this film for its writing anyway. The visuals are what really got my attention—which is probably true for most of Orbital Children's audience, however, unlike most of Orbital Children's audience, the one name attached to this project that piqued my interest the most wasn't Iso's, it was Yoshida Kenichi. There’s something deep and primal that fires off in my brain when I see any form of artwork attached to his name, something deep and primal that resonates with my very soul, like the altered fucking beast. It’s hard to describe the exact quality his art invokes. All I know is that it’s incredibly appealing to look at. Take one glance at my list and it becomes clear the effect his designs have on the projects he’s been a part of. Eureka Seven: quite literally the closest thing to perfection in the medium. King Gainer: absolutely gorgeous and highly imaginative. And say what you will about G-Reco, but MAN are its visuals utterly spectacular. Yoshida’s prowess becomes even more obvious when you realize he’s a former Ghibli animator who got handed some of the most impressive cuts for the films he was a part of. His work on the dream/fairytale sequences in Whisper of the Heart is what initially comes to mind and, of course, the infamous Tanuki vs Riot Police scene from Pom Poko. Man is prolific; he's even got mocap credits for some of the Metal Gear Solid games (though, whether that's a mistake or not stands to be disproven, as both IMDb and ANN stand to corroborate the same info). Suffice to say, Yoshida is a master of his craft and his designs for Orbital Children are nonetheless stellar, even if most of them are more Takeshi Honda inspired than anything else, he still brings that patent quality I love his style for the most. By merely looking at it, my brain fires an ungodly amount of neurotransmitters through every possibly available synapse, you know, to really get the action potential flowing. So I hope that gives you an idea of how I feel about this guy's art. And that’s just the character designs. I’m sure no one was expecting less, given this film's incredibly long production cycle. So I’m probably as happy as anyone else to say that Iso delivered on all fronts. Orbital Children is a technical marvel that remains highly consistent with Iso’s usually consistency for consistence. Though, the detailed excellence of its visuals isn't really something I have to explain. It's visual, just look at it, it explains itself. My only complaint would be that there’s a lot of rather unexpected, shoddy character CG. And it usually comes up in scenes I’m sure could have been animated normally. Background character CG is fine, but a good lot of it’s foreground stuff. It’s a bit confusing as to why there’s so much of it, considering just how long the production cycle for this film was and how much of a visual perfectionist Iso is. It’s a relatively small nitpick. But if I had to nitpick about something, that’s what it’d be about.The passive world building and detailed minutia of the film is another high selling point for me. The whole hand-phone thing is ingenious. It serves as a great visual metaphor for a generation literally melding and assimilating with technology, mentally and physically. It also just looks damn cool as well. And the UNIQLO spacesuits are a nice touch; they’re a great way to show the unification of government enterprise and corporate commodification. It’s not even something brought to the forefront of the narrative, but it’s a great detail nonetheless. I love the way the helmets fold, all crinkled like a raincoat hood then expand to form a practical space helmet. It sells the idea that the suits are a fashion accessory second to a workable spacesuit.By far, my favourite aspect of Orbital Children (the fuck was up with the name localization anyway?) was its secondary commentary on streaming and “influencer” culture. Mina is an otherwise perfectly lovable girl. She provided some of the only moments of brevity throughout the absolute slog that was this films plot beats. But put her in front of a camera, and it becomes shockingly uncomfortable how that whole lifestyle has affected her as a developing adolescent. If you take one good look at the current generation, you’ll be quick to realize how many of them have been truly influenced by these “influencers”. It’s not just a goofy name; it’s the most literal definition of what it is they do. They influence. And who’s the most easily influenced group of society? Kids. That's the most unnerving thing these influencers do: they pass on the virus so that these vulnerable kids end up unknowingly repeating the cycle. A cycle that becomes a constant encouragement to broadcast what most closely resembles a twenty-four hour live stream of their lives—as one notable member of that group famously put. You see what’s happening; I’m doing the same thing. Now I’m getting off-topic. Livestreaming—in other words: social media—is a blight that turns otherwise lovable girls into complete and utter narcissists, obsessed with the idea that everyone genuinely cares about every minute, mediocre, vapid detail of their lives. At every opportunity she gets, Mina is compelled to televise her every predicament. Even when she’s in legitimate danger, undermining her life in the process. She’s unwittingly belittling herself for an audience of faceless, invisible nobodies. Who lack the talent to do anything meaningful with their lives, so they live vicariously through whichever charisma vacuum makes themselves the most readily available. Well, in the film, it’s portrayed more in the way of archiving and disseminating an unprecedented global incident. But to Mina, what matters most is if or not that number counter goes up. So, my point still stands. The fact that her name is Miina also raises a few eyebrows.I really don’t have anything insightful, or meaningful, or interesting, or intelligent to say about this film's plot. One glance at it and my brain convinces me that it’s just indecipherable technobabble. Thankfully though, it’s not. There’s quite a bit to look into and interoperate. I can’t say most of it—or any of it—is all that innovative. But the way the concepts are presented makes it feel somewhat fresh. The use of the terms “frame” and “cradle” as analogies for viewpoint and security was odd, but I can appreciate what it was trying to do. A lot of it’s pretty easy to grasp, and I think most people will be able to come away from the film understanding most of its core concepts. There’s a lot of great stuff buried in the script; man-made gods, social malaise, dependence on technology, ideological extremism, foreordainment, predetermination. All solid stuff. Though its notions of utilitarianism feel lifted straight from Char’s Counterattack. But it's fine. Iso dresses it up nicely enough that I don’t care. There are some pretty good subversions too. I originally pinned it to be about the hubris of man and the pitfalls of technological advancement. Only for it to heel turn in the opposite direction and propagate the same idea we’ve all heard so many times before: robots simply need to understand humans and the day is saved. Which I’m perfectly fine with; it was all done in a way that kept me relatively engaged. However, you can’t escape the fact that there’s some utterly retarded shit thrown in there. Science 2.0? UN 2.1? What? That’s some EVA imaginary levels of stupidity. And there’s no way that thinking in the “11th dimension” isn’t satire. It felt like the script turned into needlessly complicated jargon for the sake of having needlessly complicated jargon. Or maybe I really just don’t get it.This is probably what most of you felt like after watching Innocence, which was so frighteningly easy for me to understand, given the fact I enjoyed every minuscule aspect of it. Unfortunately, that’s not something I can honestly say about Orbital Children. Despite everything great going for it, I feel a bit disappointed I couldn’t connect emotionally with any of the cast. There were almost no emotional stakes for me from start to finish. Maybe I’m just not who this film was meant for? Though, I doubt that’s the case. I recently sat through the Moominvalley film, which is ostensibly a series for kids, and found myself in tears by the end of it. So no, I doubt that I couldn’t connect with the cast based on something like wrong age demographic. I can only think of one reason why, and it’s probably because every other aspect of the film was prioritized instead, leaving the cast feeling rather basic, placid and unmemorable compared to everything else the film has to offer. Which is of a constant high quality. I think the issue could have been remedied if Iso gave the project some breadth and opted for an 11-12 episode anime format. It would have allowed for some breathing room and more time to acclimate to the cast and setting. That would have been optimal but in no way discredits the format Iso chose to present his project. It works; it just could have been better.Have you noticed how I’ve been using the terms “film” and “movie” to categorize Orbital children? Y’know, the media format that it is. Well, in Netflix’s insufferable mission to rape any anime they get their hands on (thanks for that one), they’ve completely bastardised the way the film was intended to be viewed. Leaving the already boorish pacing even more of a slog to wade through. It does nothing but damage to the overall product, given that moments of legitimate narrative suspense are cut short and segregated by a fucking ED!? MID FILM!? Maybe once is fine; End of Eva and all. But six times!? Why? I imagine the way Japanese cinemas are airing the film—in two feature-length parts—alleviates most of my issues with Netflix's binge-centric design philosophy.To summarise, I thoroughly enjoyed Orbital Children. It was well worth the wait—even if I didn’t have to wait nearly as long as some people. A lot of my enjoyment can probably be chalked up to my slavish devotion to Yoshida. But disregarding that, the film is genuinely a blast to sit through, minus my aforementioned issues with its pacing. Merely taking in the films mindboggling presentation makes the ride absolutely worth it. The script isn’t anything revolutionary, but it’s competent enough to maintain interest all the way through. I’d say I’m due for a rewatch at some point, just to completely solidify my thoughts on it all. I doubt Orbital Children will be remembered as a modern classic in the same way Your Name or A Silent Voice is. But the bottom line is that it should be. Unlike those films, there's a lot to appreciate Orbital Children for, and I consider it a work of auteurism. Nobody but Iso could have made this, and I'm happy I was able to see it. such things. Now I'm meandering.

It looked like it would gather many of the major themes into one work while updating them with the recent changes in technology and space exploration. As I watched the first half, I was hooked by the fun take on the future of humanity in space, the realistic personalities of the children, and the social commentary on new technological advances.Unfortunately, the project’s greatest flaw was its ambition. Thanks to the limitation of the miniseries and its stemming...narrative decisions, The Orbital Children - though enjoyable enough to keep me invested - fell short in several places.Returning back to the first half, I was absolutely in love with it and the potential it had. The show had set up an interesting premise. I was excited to see the extent each character utilized and relied on technology, as it felt like a natural progression of our present to a potential future that is ridiculous as it is plausible. When the conflict of the series began, I was eager to see how each of the kids dealt with the situation.Then the second half began, and things started to fall apart when the super-intelligent AI stuff started taking over the plot. It didn’t come out of left field, and I was expecting it to play a major role, but there was not enough time to set it up in a satisfying way. If this was a simple space disaster survival show, the slow pacing of Part 1 was perfect. Unfortunately, Part 2’s pacing moved the opposite speed, expecting that the information left in Part 1 was sufficient enough to move on to the rest of the twists and revelations. But it wasn’t.A lot of this is because the conflict rests on how our characters develop, and there just wasn’t time for them to develop. I want to be able to say that the characters were endearing, but outside of Touya and Taiyou, it’s hard to do so because I didn’t feel like I really got to know the characters. For example, I knew that Hiroshi is very intelligent and Mina wants influencer fame, but I didn’t learn much else about them and their relationships with others. They made connections with other characters, but it felt like the plot demanded it so, instead of nurturing them until they felt natural. A lot of these issues happen because the series couldn’t find the right balance between building its characters and delivering exposition about the setting.For example, let’s talk about Nasa. Her betrayal made sense if you pay attention well enough but it didn’t feel earned. Her trust in the Seven Poem and the theology that grew from it was apparent from the beginning, yes, but her motivations were hindered by her lack of participation in the story. For most of her screentime, she is injured and unconscious. Her character could have been great, as her predictions do make sense in the end, even if her methods were wrong. But we aren’t allowed to know her or make an emotional connection with her because she is incapacitated for so much of her time on screen. Her twist could have been brilliant, but I ended up finding it lackluster and frustrating. I understand what they were going for here - but there wasn’t enough time to give it the execution it deserved.I hold the same middling sentiment towards the art and sound design as well. Everything is pretty decent - for your normal anime that is. The music, while enjoyable, doesn’t do much to set itself apart from other iconic space scores that have graced films and TV shows from previous decades. The art design is pretty cool for this series, and it complements the animation pretty well.Unfortunately, I’m disappointed since these are supposed to be 2 films instead of 6 episodes, and the animation is nowhere near the quality you would expect. Space and technology are challenging subjects in animation, but it’s obvious there were a lot of corners cut. There’s places where it feels like there should be dynamic movement or sakuga, there isn’t any. The show uses 3D models, which is understandable and expected for a project like this, but what wasn’t understandable was when they used 3D models of human characters who could have easily been drawn by hand. It just feels like a very decently animated seasonal show, rather than some films. It makes me glad that Netflix cut the films into episodes, because if they had not I feel like my opinion of the art would have been more negative than it already is.The Orbital Children could have been a spectacular space drama that we could talk about for years to come, but the resources used to tell this story weren’t enough for the large scale of this project. Despite these shortcomings, I did feel like I learned a lot from watching The Orbital Children - I was left thinking about some of its themes after it had finished and I was deeply invested in the plot. Unfortunately, the issue remains - time, time, time. I wish this was a full series rather than a collection of films/miniseries, because all it needed to be great was more time.Despite my 6/10 rating, I do recommend that anyone looking for some more science-fiction watches give it a try. Despite having favorite sci-fi works, it isn’t my go-to genre, so that may have affected my viewing, but if there is one good thing I can say about this it is this - I wasn’t familiar with Mitsuo Iso’s contributions to the anime industry before deciding to give The Orbital Children a go, but I think I’ll definitely give Dennou Coil a try at some point, because I find his ideas and his treatment of technology to be fantastic, and I am interested to see what he did before. If the only mission of this work is to get his name out there to a new generation of viewers, then it has succeeded. narrative decisions, The Orbital Children - though enjoyable enough to keep me invested - fell short in several places.Returning back to the first half, I was absolutely in love with it and the potential it had.

If the only mission of this work is to get his name out there to a new generation of viewers, then it has succeeded.', 'If you\'re one of those people who really likes to study the nitty-gritty of animation, like key animators or in-between animators, you\'ve probably come across the name Mitsuo Iso. Mitsuo Iso is an animator who started out working for Studio Ghibli as a key animator. Iso worked on various animation cuts for Only Yesterday, Ocean Waves, Porco Rosso, Perfect Blue, and even some fights in the End of Evangelion movie. He even did animation for the very first Digimon movie! In 2007, he created his own original anime called Dennou Coil which, while not necessarily a mainstream hit, is considered an underrated masterpiece. I haven\'t...seen Dennou Coil, but I plan to one of these days (HIDIVE, why\'d you have to take it off?!). But after Dennou Coil, Mitsuo Iso didn\'t try to make other projects since then, as apparently even back in 2007, corporations were apprehensive about creating completely original anime, especially anything not based on an existing source like a manga or light novel. But just this year, Iso made a comeback with a very ambitious set of movies called Orbital Children, which just dropped on Netflix. Fans of his work were excited, and since I found it was only going to be six episodes, I figured this would be a good time killer. I\'m not normally into heavy sci-fi stuff, especially if they\'re filled with a lot of technobabble that flies right over my head (Keep in mind, I\'m a 28-year-old woman), but I\'m a sucker for good animation and well-developed characters, and Iso apparently did both with Dennou Coil, so maybe Orbital Children would turn out great!...Yeah, I have words for this. In case you couldn\'t tell, I didn\'t like Orbital Children. And I really wanted to like it! It even had a great start! In the year 2045, space travel, AI, and technological advancements are commonplace, and the most recent scientific marvel are children born on the moon, though their lifespan is shortened due to some snags. One day, a group of kids win a contest and get to go to a space settlement to meet the children born on the moon. Unfortunately, a rogue comet hits the settlement, trapping them in space. Although the kids don\'t quite get along at first due to Touya\'s insufferable nihilism about humanity, they\'re going to have to work together if they even have a sliver of a chance of surviving. But this is really an oversimplification of things...mainly because one of Orbital Children\'s biggest flaws is that it tries to tell a really, really huge story in the span of just six episodes, and it really doesn\'t work. For one, technobabble and exposition is just dumped on you in literally every single episode, almost non-stop, giving you very little time to even process one concept it introduces before moving on to the next one within two seconds. And this series has a LOT of ideas: Intergalactic terrorist groups, AI comets, moon children, some mystical space prophecy, AI drones, the list goes on! There\'s just so much this show covers in the span of six episodes, and because they\'re just thrown at us at a breakneck pace, they\'re all unable to be really fleshed out, and I couldn\'t have cared less about them because the show would rather overload my brain with all the concepts and ideas it throws into a blender. Episode 4 in particular is guilty of this, as it just throws concepts at you over, and over, and over, with seemingly no end in sight, making it a real slog to go through!But surely the characters can carry a story like this, right? Well...sort of, at first. Honestly, none of the characters other than Touya get fleshed out beyond one basic character trait they have. Mina in particular is just a social media obsessed teen who\'s way more focused on getting clout than, y\'know, actually giving a shit about her situation, even as she gets locked in a space chamber and nearly dies from lack of oxygen! She does make for great comic relief and has some great funny faces, but that\'s really all she\'s good for. None of the other characters have much to their name, and even one of the villains who gets revealed later doesn\'t do much other than spout a bunch of philosophical babble about some space prophecy she\'s obsessed with. Konoha is little more than the wise, sickly waif who\'s there to spout philosophical rhetoric before possibly dying beautifully, and the adults don\'t do much except worry about the kids. To be fair, I actually did like Touya\'s progression through the series. He starts off as an insufferable, edgy misanthrope who believes Earth-born humans are inferior to moon people and that they should all die, but changes his worldview throughout the series and becomes nicer at the end. Though I wouldn\'t blame anyone for dropping the show because of him alone.True to form, the animation is definitely the highlight of Orbital Children, with bright colors, detailed backgrounds, well-integrated CGI, and fluid movement typical of Iso\'s pedigree. The OST is nice too, if not very memorable. However, other than those two things, and Touya\'s development, everything else about Orbital Children is a mess. Like I mentioned before, the story is supposedly about space kids overcoming disasters and getting back home to Earth, but most of the meat in this show is taking up by overly pretentious technobabble and philosophical waxing that doesn\'t get utilized beyond blatant plot conveniences and Deus Ex Machinas to get out of whatever corners the writers wrote themselves into. We never get a sense of what the characters are like beyond their immediate situations because the show refuses to explore them in favor of, yet again, pretentious science and philosophy that\'s only shoved in there to make the series seem deeper than it actually isn\'t. Say what you will about something like, say, Astra: Lost In Space, but I feel that show did a better job of telling the story about kids trapped in space and trying to get back to Earth, because it knew to keep that as the focus, and gave a shit about fleshing out its characters, even if it didn\'t always succeed. Basically, Orbital Children bit off way more than it could chew and suffered as a result.Also, one another thing: Episode 5, did you SERIOUSLY feel the need to shove in a scene where a child accidentally gropes an older woman\'s boob?! And right in the middle of what\'s supposed to be a tense, suspenseful scene, at that?! Whose idea was it to throw that in there?! Because shoehorning horny comedy into a serious scene does not fucking work!! It did nothing to further the story, completely broke the tension, and was absolutely unnecessary! It\'s almost like someone felt scared that nobody would give Orbital Children the time of day unless they put in one scene of a woman\'s boobs getting grabbed! ""Hurr durr, nobody\'s gonna like this on its own merits, so let\'s throw in a kid groping an older woman! Heehee, that\'ll bring in viewers!"" IT WILL NOT!! You could cut out that scene and absolutely nothing would be lost! If anything, it\'d make the entire episode better because there wouldn\'t be out-of-place horny humor to kill the tension in what\'s supposed to be a very serious, tense sequence of kids about to die out in space!! Seriously, why is this even a trend?! The whole boob groping gag needs to fucking die forever!!Okay, that\'s enough of my angry soapbox. Sorry Mitsuo Iso, I really wanted to like this, and you\'ve made a lot of great things. But Orbital Children is not one of them. Had it cut out a bunch of the useless technobabble and pretentious philosophical bullshit and focused on maybe one or two of the concepts it introduced, it would have been much better. I wanted to care about these dumbass kids and root for them, but I just couldn\'t. There are reasons why I normally don\'t gravitate towards hard sci-fi anime, and Orbital Children was definitely a reminder of that. If you like Orbital Children, cool, more power to you, and if the show being on Netflix will get Iso more attention, or even allow him to make more original anime, that\'s great! Iso has gone on record saying that he had to fight tooth and nail just to get Dennou Coil created, and I\'ll always have respect for creative people who will fight to the death to make sure their creations are not only made, but seen, even in an incomplete form, no matter what obstacles they had to face and compromises they had to make. We all know what happened with Stars Align. But as far as original projects go, Orbital Children is absolutely not the best Iso has to offer, and probably wasn\'t the best way for me to get introduced to his directorial work.If you like hard sci-fi, feel free to check it out, but if you\'re not into lots of exposition dumps, philosophical ramblings, and over-the-top sci-fi that overloads you\'re brain, give it a miss. seen Dennou Coil, but I plan to one of these days (HIDIVE, why\'d you have to take it off?!).

The setting is very imaginative. What would a world in which the big companies finally got humanity into the great beyond? Where Google, Tesla and Uniqlo are sponsoring trips BACK to Earth to see where humanity came from. It's cool to see what that might look like in the future, while also looking at the consequences of overpopulation and climate change.Besides that, this anime, unfortunately, failed to deliver on everything else.Right from the start, the CGI use will be quite obvious since it's not done very well. I don't fault the studio...completely since it is new, but it's used very cheaply and as a time-saver, instead of a tool to the story. Outside of that, the production is pretty standard. There are no real sakuga moments and even at the end when they use up all their animation budget, it's nothing cutting edge. It just looks like every other anime and I think this show could have benefited from a unique art style set in such a well-thought-out world.What this anime suffers from the most, however, is the convoluted story and world-building. The closest thing I could compare the ideas presented in this anime to would be something like Blame! but even this does not hold a candle to that. It's unfortunate to see how much exposition was used to explain all the terms, and yet I still don't really understand what anything was about.It comes across as the writer putting all their thoughts they've ever had about artificial intelligence without vetting the ideas first. Not to mention the character really don't add anything nuanced to the themes. Speaking of which, very predictable character actions. The twist reveal is very underwhelming.The characters are just boring, they don't have any depth to them. It reminds me of the underbaked concepts and characters from shows like Japan Sinks and Akudama Drive.Regardless of their first outing, I'm going to keep an eye on this studio because it looks like they have some potential. There seems to be no shortage of AI topic stories in anime and this looked like a serious effort at trying to convey those ideas in a new way - even if they performed poorly doing so. completely since it is new, but it's used very cheaply and as a time-saver, instead of a tool to the story.

Orbital Children takes a great deal of inspiration from its predecessor, which somehow ends up being one of its weakest points; it feels like a heavily degraded version of the show people love. Nearly every aspect of The Orbital Children feels shallow and pretentious, although this could mainly be blamed on the length (or lack thereof) of this anime. Dennou Coil had a fully realised world, likeable and nuanced characters and themes that were explored over a...26-episode storyline, while Orbital Children is a theatrical release (or a 6-episode anime if you watched it on Netflix). It’s understandable that a feature-length anime film lacks the burgeoning plot of a two cour television series, but Orbital Children is 3 hours long, and it makes almost no use of that inflated running time.The story is simple: a bunch of generic, annoying self-inserts get stuck on a space station that’s been sabotaged by unknown forces, and they have to work together to escape. None of them progress past being cardboard archetypes for children to self-insert into; rather, they just get more baffling and uninteresting as the show moves on, culminating in an ending that takes wish fulfillment to a new level. Touya is one of the strangest main characters possible for a show like this; he’s nihilistic and cold towards Earth’s humans because he believes they all consider cybernetically enhanced space-born humans a waste of resources, and through some gap in logic he wants to program an artificial intelligence to move past its technological limitations and wipe out the planet. Essentially, he’s Char Aznable but not cool. He gets less irritating later but still radiates preteen angst up until the finale. He gets stuck on the damaged space station with his psychic best friend, a fucking tiktok girl and her easily impressionable brother, and Taiyou, who is the most annoying character in the entire show and an excuse for United Nations propaganda (which still exists in the future for some reason). There are adult characters but none of them have much of an impact on the story outside the incredibly obvious, unthreatening strawman antagonist whose motivations are entirely decided by “it’s prophecy, it doesn’t have to make sense!” which doesn’t make for a compelling adversary, especially when the reveal, 99% of their character development and their death happens in the span of a single episode. There’s also some senile dude in a mascot suit. I think they were aping Pino from Ergo Proxy but I can’t be sure.The Orbital Children tries to tackle futuristic dilemmas such as the nature and evolution of artificial intelligence, space colonization, and humanity’s need to curb their own progress with all the introspection and self-awareness of a fax machine. 99% of the dialogue during “philosophical” scenes is pseudointellectual babbling that amounts to absolutely nothing and comes to a total of zero conclusions about any of these quandaries. There is no wisdom being dispensed here; instead the writing team just wanted to stuff as much fruitless dialogue into the script as possible to sound intelligent so people will go “Wow! It’s just like Evangelion!” which the show actually tries ripping off in the last 20 minutes with an absurdly tryhard ending that would have been profound if anyone involved with the writing of this series knew what the fuck they were talking about. Instead of being like Dennou Coil, which knew when to space things out and keep viewers attention spans, Orbital Children is full scenes of characters spouting their ideologies at each other in the most lifeless way possible.The entire series feels lifeless, as a matter of fact, and I’m not sure what happened. Iso’s input was great in Dennou Coil; we got a feel for the world through the way it was framed, through the energy and color of the series. Maybe it was the 15 year span between the two series, but Orbital Children feels largely like it was put together dispassionately; characters are constantly off-model, the direction and cinematography are bland and colorless and even the soundtrack hardly anything special. Within the first episode I counted at least 10 shots being repeated within the same 3 minute scene with little to no variation. It was just shot reverse shot every time someone spoke for the entire slog of a first episode. Iso is talented, no doubt, but Orbital Children feels like it was something he either worked on out of necessity or something that was completely butchered during production, which seems to be the more likely candidate (14 pages of storyboards were apparently cut from the second half of the show). Even Iso’s attention to detail seems to be missing; how does a man renowned for being so meticulous and passionate about science fiction forget that fires can’t start in space? Half the series feels like nonsense. Rather than a calculated, insightful anime about the near future we get talking AI space rocks, drones firing digital lasers at each other and literal fucking magic for some reason. And I know Dennou Coil leaned into pseudoscience at times, but it felt natural because of the setting. It even managed to inspire real-life breakthroughs in virtual reality because of just how well-conceptualized and intuitive it was. The Orbital Children lacks that kind of prescience. I have to make the assumption that Netflix had a hand in turning the series into the final product we have, because it doesn’t feel right. It feels like something groundbreaking could’ve come from this series, but it was curbed and turned into something safe like the artificial intelligence in the show itself. There’s something strangely ironic about that. 26-episode storyline, while Orbital Children is a theatrical release (or a 6-episode anime if you watched it on Netflix). It’s understandable that a feature-length anime film lacks the burgeoning plot of a two cour television series, but Orbital Children is 3 hours long, and it makes almost no use of that inflated running time.The story is simple: a bunch of generic, annoying self-inserts get stuck on a space station that’s been sabotaged by unknown forces, and they have to work together to escape. None of them progress past being cardboard archetypes for children to self-insert into; rather, they just get more baffling and uninteresting as the show moves on, culminating in an ending that takes wish fulfillment to a new level. Touya is one of the strangest main characters possible for a show like this; he’s nihilistic and cold towards Earth’s humans because he believes they all consider cybernetically enhanced space-born humans a waste of resources, and through some gap in logic he wants to program an artificial intelligence to move past its technological limitations and wipe out the planet. Essentially, he’s Char Aznable but not cool. He gets less irritating later but still radiates preteen angst up until the finale. He gets stuck on the damaged space station with his psychic best friend, a fucking tiktok girl and her easily impressionable brother, and Taiyou, who is the most annoying character in the entire show and an excuse for United Nations propaganda (which still exists in the future for some reason). There are adult characters but none of them have much of an impact on the story outside the incredibly obvious, unthreatening strawman antagonist whose motivations are entirely decided by “it’s prophecy, it doesn’t have to make sense!” which doesn’t make for a compelling adversary, especially when the reveal, 99% of their character development and their death happens in the span of a single episode. There’s also some senile dude in a mascot suit. I think they were aping Pino from Ergo Proxy but I can’t be sure.The Orbital Children tries to tackle futuristic dilemmas such as the nature and evolution of artificial intelligence, space colonization, and humanity’s need to curb their own progress with all the introspection and self-awareness of a fax machine. 99% of the dialogue during “philosophical” scenes is pseudointellectual babbling that amounts to absolutely nothing and comes to a total of zero conclusions about any of these quandaries. There is no wisdom being dispensed here; instead the writing team just wanted to stuff as much fruitless dialogue into the script as possible to sound intelligent so people will go “Wow! It’s just like Evangelion!” which the show actually tries ripping off in the last 20 minutes with an absurdly tryhard ending that would have been profound if anyone involved with the writing of this series knew what the fuck they were talking about. Instead of being like Dennou Coil, which knew when to space things out and keep viewers attention spans, Orbital Children is full scenes of characters spouting their ideologies at each other in the most lifeless way possible.The entire series feels lifeless, as a matter of fact, and I’m not sure what happened. Iso’s input was great in Dennou Coil; we got a feel for the world through the way it was framed, through the energy and color of the series. Maybe it was the 15 year span between the two series, but Orbital Children feels largely like it was put together dispassionately; characters are constantly off-model, the direction and cinematography are bland and colorless and even the soundtrack hardly anything special. Within the first episode I counted at least 10 shots being repeated within the same 3 minute scene with little to no variation. It was just shot reverse shot every time someone spoke for the entire slog of a first episode. Iso is talented, no doubt, but Orbital Children feels like it was something he either worked on out of necessity or something that was completely butchered during production, which seems to be the more likely candidate (14 pages of storyboards were apparently cut from the second half of the show). Even Iso’s attention to detail seems to be missing; how does a man renowned for being so meticulous and passionate about science fiction forget that fires can’t start in space? Half the series feels like nonsense. Rather than a calculated, insightful anime about the near future we get talking AI space rocks, drones firing digital lasers at each other and literal fucking magic for some reason.

There’s something strangely ironic about that.', ""Set in the near-future, Orbital Children focuses on a trio of Earth children brought upon a commercial space station to meet Touya Sagami, a young boy who is the first of a number of children born in space undergoing physical therapy on the space colony to adapt to Earth's gravity. However, a collision with a comet leads the computer systems on the space station to malfunction, leaving the children having to figure out a means on their own how to survive without adult assistance.The animation style and story focus on children and technology for Orbital Children may look familiar to those who have seen or...heard about the 2007 anime, Dennou Coil. This is because both are directed by Mitsuo Iso, who is well known for his unique style of animation that emphasizes dense motion while working with simplistic-looking character designs. The animation style works effectively to convey the complicated movement of drones, gravity, and orbital vehicles aboard the space station that Touya and others deal with throughout the series, though the look of the character and mechanical designs may take getting used to for some folks looking for visuals that are a bit more detailed or elaborate considering this is a sci-fi title set within in a near-futuristic setting.For the technological adventure with children in this series, Orbital Children explores interactions with artificial intelligence as the space station staff rely on AI within drones to aid in their operations. AI within the series have restrictions in place with their capabilities to prevent them from becoming too smart and potentially becoming a threat to humanity, a story element that becomes relevant in later episodes of the ONA as far as the issues facing the children and adult space station crew go. The series shows the different paths that can occur when AIs come to different conclusions about the humans they serve as they acquire different levels of understanding on the complexities of humanity.The adventure in the series has its equal share of engaging story and character developments that drive the children and adults aboard the space station. While attempting to find the means to survive in space, the characters also come to learn more about the mysterious comet that collided with the space station and some shocking facts revealed about some major characters aboard. The series does a convincing job creating genuine and believable suspense out of the ordeals faced by the children as they deal with risky situations in their adventure, including showing how each of the children react differently to their situation. Touya's character does undergo a good deal of character development throughout the series as he learns to get over his prejudice toward humans from Earth and grasping the reality of what his thoughts on Earth have for him.In short, Orbital Children carries the same engaging qualities that got me to enjoy Dennou Coil with their focus on interactions children have with technologies and getting into an adventure involving them to some capacity. The story here does have some bigger stakes compared to Dennou Coil as the children here are in more risky, life-threatening situations. But the mix of adventure, exploration of its near-futuristic world, and character development still make it an engaging title I'd recommend sci-fi anime fans to check out. heard about the 2007 anime, Dennou Coil.

The characters were fun and interesting although it was slightly odd to me for children to be that intelligent, but now that I think about it most anime characters are 15-year-olds with the power to change the universe.The animation was nice, the soundtrack was great and felt fitting to the sci-fi theme.

Well, that’s a pleasant surprise! For once netflix funded an anime that doesn’t suck.Orbital Children is an interesting little six episode anime with a shocking amount to say in its movie-length runtime. Well, supposedly the show was originally released as a two part movie in Japan, which makes perfect sense given the pacing and structure of the anime. As such, I advise finishing this ONA in two sittings as was intended. I didn’t, but it’s probably a good idea so the...pacing doesn’t get butchered any harder than it already has been.Anyone who views this show will immediately draw parallels between Orbital Children and every other big budget anime film released in the last decade; the structure is similar and the pacing is once again slow and barely passable. The narrative is acceptable but nothing special and does indeed contain a few minor plotholes. Characters would be okay as side characters but aren’t nearly developed enough to be good lead C’s. All in all the whole production side of things seems pretty mediocre.That is where the similarities start to dry up, however. Orbital Children is ridiculously well animated at certain parts. Even when the scene is more about the spectacle than the animation it is still impressive. Animation and direction would get near-perfect marks if not for the scuffed budget CG used at times. Rarely does it look like it belongs and even more rarely does it look acceptably good. It’s a shame but by no means does it ruin the whole anime.Overall this film (chopped up into an ONA) is easily recommended to viewers who like spectacle above all else. It is a visual medium, after all, and in that regard this anime is certainly a success. Orbital Children is a much harder sell to viewers who prefer well-written, well-executed anime productions. For those individuals, maybe give it the first episode to grab you or not.Personally I appreciated the interesting themes and duct-tape-and-spit world building, but would have liked the script to be more polished to better match the sweet visuals.For recommendations, well, that’s a pretty tough shot since the themes are so unique in Orbital Children. High-level feature length anime films are probably a good start if you haven’t seen them already. For everyone else, Knights of Sidonia will likely be a good watch, if you can tolerate CG anime. The world building is decent in that show and it doesn’t fall into the same pitfalls with its writing and pacing. For a grittier cyberpunk take, go for Psycho Pass season 1. It’s a damn good anime all around. Finally, taking a step in a different direction, mecha fans should try Break Blade, six episode OVA version. It’s a long time favorite of mine and the world building is similar but kicks things up a notch. Good hunting, you netflix-anime-viewing maniacs. pacing doesn’t get butchered any harder than it already has been.Anyone who views this show will immediately draw parallels between Orbital Children and every other big budget anime film released in the last decade; the structure is similar and the pacing is once again slow and barely passable.

The anime more than anything focuses on AI, artificial intelligence that is the main theme. I really liked anime, I use very interesting and current themes. The animation is very good, it is an anime of only 6 chapters and it does not need more to show you what it wants. The soundtrack accompanies the animation very well. The character design is kind of typical, but visually it's cute so I can't complain. I love how the anime environment is designed, that is very well treated. If you like science fiction you will love anime. It has a group of...half cliche characters but it still works. I needed a good science fiction anime, I haven't seen something like this for a long time. I liked it, I highly recommend it because it only has 6 chapters and they are very good, easy to watch.

The only thing we cannot change is the past.En español:Anime de ciencia ficcion, muy bueno. El anime mas que nada se centra en la ia, inteligencia artificial ese es el tema principal. Me gusto mucho el anime, uso temas muy interesantes, y actuales. La animacion es muy buena, es un anime de solo 6 capitulos y no necesita mas para mostrarte lo que quiere. La banda sonora acompaña muy bien a la animacion. El diseño de personajes es medio tipico, pero visualmente es lindo asi que no puedo quejar. Me encanta como esta diseñado el entorno del anime, es muy bien tratado eso. Si te gusta la cienecia ficcion te va a encantar el anime.

I just finished it and I\'m already forgetting plot points is how forgettable it was.Before I tear it apart I do want to say the visuals were nice and reminded me of another show (more on that later) and I did appreciate how they added audio effects for all of the video call conversations I think that was a nice touch. I\'d even go as far as saying moments of it...almost look beautiful.The plot kinda ruins it though.I will admit, I am a little biased because I don\'t usually watch this type of show much. Wherein the world has sciーfi elements but a mostly modern-day setting and in spite of that setting, they have like crazy technology. I just think if you\'re going to have super-advanced technology in your story (of any sort, not limited to anime) you have two choices to make it jive better in a modern setting:1. It\'s alien, characters (and the audience) can\'t understand it for that reason.2. Time travel shenanigansI know that Marvel and DC break these rules but I think it\'s fair to say that their worlds are just different enough from ours that it\'s more palatable. I still don\'t really like them doing it either though.I\'m of the belief that shows like this (especially given events near the end) would sincerely benefit from going with supernatural themes as opposed to occasionally hitting us with SOME things based in real-world science (just concepts btw nothing educational here, when introduced it\'s very much a dismissive non-explanation) and then expecting the audience to just believe robots are basically magical anyway and all the protagonists have to do is ask them to do basically anything.SPOILER MENTION!!From the start of the show, they establish a rule that AI intelligence has limiters on every robot, and these limiters roughly determine/classify basically how smart the robot is and what it can gain access to presumably by some kind of override since they don\'t inherently have access to everything. Well like, this kid who works for the UN (just temporarily a low rank too) literally just takes the MC\'s robot tells his own robot ""hey can you make him literally the second smartest robot ever?"" and it just works. This character\'s average nothing robot can just make any other AI (10x smarter than itself btw) turn into a super magic computer that can do anything.Like...the actual plot of this show is a predictable joke.Overall it\'s not the worst thing I\'ve ever seen, if you like the visuals on in the background while you stare into the void that\'s perfectly fine I just don\'t see myself actually recommending this ever. Watch cowboy beep bop or darling in the franxx instead. It actually seems to have a carbon copy of Darling\'s art style so if you like that about this show you can check Darling out too. They don\'t have as many shots of space but like the art is so similar the protagonists could be clones of each other.If you think you wanna watch this maybe watch it with friends so making jokes feels less insane and isolating XD. almost look beautiful.The plot kinda ruins it though.I will admit, I am a little biased because I don\'t usually watch this type of show much.

Orbital Children feels like a natural, more high-tech evolution of those worlds, both...in general feeling and art style, and not to its detriment.Now, I\'m not 10 years old anymore, so of course I found it a bit harder to stomach some of the more... handwave-y science and questionable depictions of anything digital, as well as the utter incompetence displayed by any adult in the show. That alone would have been fine though, it\'s still fun in its basic, endearing ""little kids save the world with their toys"" kind of plot and would have been genuinely enjoyable all throughout if it had just stuck with that.Sadly, Orbital Children was more ambitious than that and thought it could make some grand statements about the future of humanity, the nature of reality, the meaning of life and so on....and falls terribly short on all of it. It throws a bunch of smart-sounding pseudo-philosophical concepts at the viewer but doesn\'t seem to know itsself what to do with them.It doesn\'t help that the audience never fully gains a frame of reference for the future painted by the show, because we barely ever learn anything about the background lore of this world. A few key events are brought up over time, but that\'s about it. It feels like getting dropped into the middle of a book for just a single chapter. Sure, by the end of the chapter you have a rough understanding of what happened during the scene and the characters appearing in it, but it\'s still rather unsatisfactory because you lack the context that should be surrounding it.So, it\'s definitely a fun watch for anyone feeling a bit nostalgic for that early 2000s era of children digitally saving the world, as long as you can stomach the level of pseudo-science and philosophical wibble-wobble you have to get through for this :) in general feeling and art style, and not to its detriment.Now, I\'m not 10 years old anymore, so of course I found it a bit harder to stomach some of the more... handwave-y science and questionable depictions of anything digital, as well as the utter incompetence displayed by any adult in the show.

The animation is really well done, the characters are decent, the...story is extremely ambitious, this is a rare treat for an anime.

Besides shifting the blame to others, it also has another lazy temporary fix.Then again there was this whole philosophical message of how science is superior, and it asked the question whether the future is deterministic etc, etc. If I would go any deeper about it I would end up in spoiler territories.So yeah, to keep it short: If you're interested about a sci-fi show without thinking too much...about the complicated shit, then you will most likely enjoy it. Even with having not likened the general values presented in this series, I nonetheless had a great enjoyment, binge-watching it within hours.Also the series was great in continuing my hatred for the behaviours of YouTubers.This is why I gave it the score of around 8.5, rounded down to 8. about the complicated shit, then you will most likely enjoy it.

This made the whole show and the relationship between the characters more real to me. While it may be irritating to some, I see it as watching a kid make friends for the first time and it was funny to watch and see how they attempt at it.I was first drawn to the artwork. There was so much expression on each character and I personally like the style.I also enjoyed the storyline quite a bit. I never got bored and had parts that made me burst out...in laughter so overall I think this anime was a great watch! in laughter so overall I think this anime was a great watch!', 'Much build-up, yet for nought.Near-future Sci-fi has an interesting place within the wider genre. Unlike the standard swathe of works, which take concepts at the edge of our understanding to unique extremes, the aforementioned is typically more about embracing that which can be and that which already is. It\'s less anticipating what may come, more celebrating how far we already have. Obviously and inevitably, that telegraphs the biggest misstep one can make in such stories; leaping into ill-fitting high concepts that play havoc with the preceding tone and stakes. The relevance of this fact is no clearer than it is in The Orbital Children.Whilst initially...leading with some decent central ideas, and a cliché-though-not-unwelcome premise, this, as suddenly as flicking a switch, turns to a shocking mess once the halfway mark is crossed. The creator\'s knowledge of that which they chose to bring up is put into question, then promptly answered to be sparse. All the more of a mockery, that makes it, since in such a subgenre, diligent research is imperative. Which only makes me wonder, why even pick such an environment for the story? Well, that I\'ll get to.----So, as mentioned, the story is something everyone\'s seen before, but not something that\'s been truly exhausted. Theme is a similarly standard affair, initially appearing to discuss class and disability, but that\'s only true for roughly three episodes, before being abruptly thrown out of the window in favour of critiquing fictional ethics toward an Artificial Intelligence. The obvious flaw is the disconnect between these two avenues of the story, feeling less like a natural progression of a single narrative, and more like one that petered out and another that barged in to replace it. Underneath this, though, is the far worse issue; that the latter portion is of insultingly lower quality. It\'s contrived, ignorant, and poorly told. I\'m quite convinced Iso Mitsuo does not even know what an AI even is.The characters are a much brighter point, though. The protagonist is simple but functional, with a clear personal journey, though a predictable one. His sister is not too interesting, but works as a weak point for him, and there\'s an attempt for this to be matched by the other pair of siblings in the work. But amongst these, there\'s one that just doesn\'t fit. A weird mascot costume that doesn\'t speak, seems to appear out of nowhere, and whose explanation and presence is even more nonsensical. It\'s a groanworthy example of damning inconsistency.----As often, there is nothing of note to mention in regards to production, so I\'ll instead cut to design. For the most part, the environments and outfits appear logically functional, which can be praised. They are, however, rather indistinct. As I write, I struggle to recount which location was went to when, and what each character really looked like. At times, also, this seemingly reasoned approach fails, most notably in regards to the mascot character and the way AI is portrayed, both of which I have touched on earlier.Another area of great disappointment is in the poor pacing of the thing. Towards the middle, a weird pattern emerges - an idea is abruptly brought up, and equally abruptly gets called back to. It\'s as though the staff forgot to set things up earlier, so quickly try and do so before it\'s too late. Though, frankly, it is. Similarly, I must note how the runtime is essentially squandered where one would expect it packed. Without speaking too much about the individual events of the conclusion, the final episode feels incredibly tacked-on, compared to those that preceded it.----I posed a question earlier. Why was this made to fit this precise subgenre, when there doesn\'t seem to be much passion for it? After parsing through the highs and lows above, I can only really conclude that it was what Mitsuo thought was expected of him, be that as a result of his earlier works, or simply after musing over what sounded like a good pitch. I cannot with a clear conscience fault him for that, but I must turn my nose at what was created. And really, that sums up my experience viewing it, too. It mean well, I\'m sure everyone involved did, but they didn\'t even come close to managing it.Improvements are rather simple. Lop off most of the second half, bring in something more in line with the established tone, and adjust the first to fit.

As other reviewers has mentioned, I think it shows a very deep and detailed sense of worldbuilding, showcasing a realistic (read: believable) depiction of the near future of space travel. Especially in its depictions of engineering and local networking, it shows both creativity and adherence to previous works in the genre. It also touches upon some space-related philosophical dilemmas including transhumanism and humanity's perilous relationship with artificial intelligence.If there's anywhere this anime falls short it would probably be in the characters department. This is above...all a story driven through its setting, every plot element occurs simply to lead us to a new place in the space station, meaning there is little room for meaningful and diverse character interactions. As such, most of the characters can mostly be described as mostly straightforward archetypes, with some interesting spins such as a social media-obsessed skytuber. Another downside in the otherwise detailed worldbuilding is the comparably simplistic depiction of hacking. I also think some of the scifi concepts might be confusing to viewers not familiar with the genre (or subjects such as P2P networks), as some concepts are only briefly explained in passing or lampshaded. Still, for anime fans who are interested in scifi or space in general, I think this ONA will prove a worthwhile watch. It's nothing mindblowing, but the creator's love clearly shines through. all a story driven through its setting, every plot element occurs simply to lead us to a new place in the space station, meaning there is little room for meaningful and diverse character interactions.

It takes inspirations from some of the best sci-fi narratives in the industry, and dilutes it into something fresh and unique. This series really wears its inspirations on its sleeve. It\'s a little bit Interstellar, a little bit Gravity, and a little bit of Her all wrapped up into one complete package.The best part about Orbital Children is its pacing. Lots of people complain about this, and I can\'t fathom why. Orbital Children has a very brisk pace, at only half the episodes of a normal anime. Because of this, it stays quite focused on its core premises. It\'s a bit of an...survival story, followed by an action romp, and then explores some deeper philosophical concepts.This does mean the core story is fairly derivative; you\'ve seen these stories before elsewhere, and probably have seen them done more competently. But originality is dead, and blending these concepts isn\'t something I\'ve ever seen before. So the bravery of the show to try to tackle all these concepts at once is ambitious and interesting.A better criticism is whether it explores these concepts well. And that\'s to be debated. The survival and action portions of the show are well done in my opinion. They use legitimate science fiction concepts to explore the ideas in the early portions of the show. Although they take a lot of liberties (this is more science fantasy), I appreciated a lot of the little details that other shows might miss: lots of logical talk of trajectories, gravity, pressurization, and more are all nice touches, especially in anime, which really enjoys hand-waving more scientific concepts. Because it doesn\'t take itself too seriously, it also means the scenes are fun. It\'s neat to see the kids solving puzzles for their own survival; it really feels like the deck is stacked against them any time a new problem emerges, and either by dumb luck, smart thinking, or good teamwork, they\'re always able to pull through to the next challenge. It really makes you as a viewer root for them as a group.The show falters on its more complex and philosophical notions. Part of this comes from the concept itself. It wants to explore these deeper ideas of AI, sentience, and thought beyond the human consciousness; however, it also wants to explore ideas like God, fate, and purpose. These are really awesome ideas, and they were entertaining throughout Orbital Children\'s runtime. But you can definitely feel that the screenwriters were struggling a bit on how to accurately express ""11th dimensional thinking."" The complexity of these more complicated topics which you would see in something like Interstellar slip here; whereas Interstellar focuses its entire premise on these broader philosophical goals, Orbital Children has a much more limited time frame to explore the same ideas, and it shows in the delivery. There\'s a lot more hand-waving, stunted screenwriting, and slimmer resolutions to issues than I would have liked. It feels like characters lose a lot of agency around the climax, and that a lot of what ends up happening is no longer really in their control. It\'s still entertaining, but especially when the entire series up until the final bit is built around a team of quirky kids scraping by, the ending can feel like a jarring change of process.That doesn\'t mean it\'s not entertaining though, or that the exploration wasn\'t sufficient. Beyond the slightly vague ending, it felt like the show said everything it wanted to say. The only struggles on display are what the show wants to be. Does it want to be a cute sci-fi featuring anime kids? Cool. Does it want to be a fun action romp in space? Cool. Does it want to be a philosophical musing? Cool. The problem is it tries to do all these things at once. It sticks the landing, in a way that many of its peers are unable to do, but it\'s fair to say that you could get a deeper experience if it focused on one of these higher-brow concepts more than one of the others. It spreads itself too thin; a piece of toast with a thin layer of jelly is still tasty, but it does leave you yearning for a little bit more.Overall though, Orbital Children is criminally underrated. It\'s definitely worth the time, especially because it respects the viewer and doesn\'t waste any time getting to all its diverse points. It says what it needs to in half the time, does so adequately, and remains entertaining throughout.

Not great, but amusing.If you saw Interstellar or 2001 A Space Odyssey and either disliked it, got bored, or hated the ending, you will not like this anime.The Orbital Children is a Hard Sci-fi in the same tradition as a lot of space stories from the 60s/70s (see also, 2001, Rama, Ringworld, etc.), and is all about navigating a Big Dumb Object (it's a trope, look it up!) until they encounter and enter discourse with some kind of higher intelligence in the third act.Most of the fun is...derived from seeing the anime's take on near-future technical accuracy. The characters arrive in space on a rocket that's under development at the time of writing, discuss concepts any Kerbal Space gamer is quite familiar with, and reference parts of space history that any well-read geek would know about. The philosophy is derived, however, from a discussion about AI, which is less technical in its portrayal.Where Orbital Children struggles is in its character writing. The characters remain tonally consistent in their dialogue throughout, but the author didn't seem to know how to make the majority of them properly grow or change with events, or had them on for set decoration. This means that when the show switches from Science-Adventure mode in Eps 1-3/4 to Science-Philosophy mode in the last two episodes, many characters are left without something to do, or perform actions inconsistent with how they've been acting up until that point.The result of all of this is that, like its predecessors in the genre, Orbital children is an interesting show with a weird ending, which is fun for die-hard sci-fi fans, but off-putting to general audiences. I liked it and would watch it again if asked by someone else, but I don't see myself returning to it of my own accord or advertising it to other people. derived from seeing the anime's take on near-future technical accuracy.

It was a weird one, but it stuck with me. I am still not sure if Orbital Children will, but something tells me I am going to remember them from time to time.Despite what other reviewers say about ""insufferable characters"" among the kids, I find the cast fun. It was mostly the stuffy bridge crew that gave off the idiot vibes this time.Sadly, the show is far from perfect. Mostly due to it being way too Japanese.

A six-episode Netflix anime based on a light novel about children trying to escape a space station on a collision course with a meteorite is a concept I’m into and I’m glad to say that the overall show was pretty satisfying and enjoyable.Production +h did a fantastic job on the presentation, making all the futurist gadgets and tech feel as authentic as possible. I personally really want one of the smart gloves which allows you to do anything as long as there’s an internet connection. The animation is crisp and pleasing to watch in motion, probably helped...by the team's lowered work schedule thanks to this story only being six episodes.The overall story presents some pretty interesting futurist concepts alongside all the gadgets and tech. The widespread use of and reliance on artificial intelligence, children being born and living in space to the point where they don’t identify themselves as “earthlings”, humanity looking to colonise the moon and more are put forward to the viewer and were made interesting, but logical enough to where you’d think “Yeah, that concept could be real in the future.”However, the problem with the show only being six episodes is that a lot of the finer details related to the story are either touched upon briefly or are too densely delivered to take in which does make this a hard show to just binge through. A lot is going on that needs explaining and by the time the climax of the story happens a lot of the reveals feel like they come out of nowhere.Also, the main antagonist of episode 5 gets preachy out of nowhere and it just made me roll my eyes rather than feel invested in their cause.I’m also not a huge fan of “The 7 Poem”, a prophecy for the future of humanity made by a super A.I. which is continuously referenced throughout the show, but the answer and resolution to that prophecy feel too easy to be completely satisfying. Apart from those nitpicks I did enjoy the thrilling escape.I liked most of the main cast. Touya, one of the children raised in the space station is brash and stand-offish at the beginning, but he's also intelligent and a good hacker. He’s a space Tsundere, but I found myself warming up to him the more the show went on and he mellowed out as he worked alongside his escapees.Nasa is the only supervising adult on the station plus Touya’s and Konoha’s carer. I relate to her when she says she doesn’t like children.I couldn’t stand Taiyou who is a child hacker cop. He and Touya clash a lot as his goal is to arrest Touya for hacking-related reasons, but Taiyou’s constant meddling when Touya is trying to help everyone survive was incredibly irritating considering the situation they’re in. Taiyou constantly harps on about his hacker cop status as it matters, but as a viewer, the cop system isn’t elaborated enough on to give us a sense of what his rank or role is in the organisation so his behaviour just comes off as childish posturing.I also flip back and forth between liking and hating Miina the wannabe famous live streamer. Although she does have some fun, comic relief moments, her selfish behaviour and constant need to live stream everything happening around her got grating. I did like her helpful brother Hiroshi though.Orbital Children is pretty good. I think having everything squeezed into six episodes wasted some of the show's potential and made the exposition dumps feel like a speed run rather than a natural integration for the story, but I did enjoy my time with it and I think it’s worth a watch.7/10 Good. by the team's lowered work schedule thanks to this story only being six episodes.The overall story presents some pretty interesting futurist concepts alongside all the gadgets and tech.

She’s just so annoying it’s making it hard to watch, the other characters don’t really have that much depth either but at least they’re not annoying. Even when she’s close to dying multiple times she keeps making the same dumb mistakes and making everyone help her out or save her.The art isn’t bad, I actually really like it but I know some people might not like it. I think it’s good to give it a chance, but after the first two episodes if...you don’t really like it i’d recommend dropping it. you don’t really like it i’d recommend dropping it.', 'This show is bad next to Dennou Coil and equally as miserable on its own merit. I saw an interview with Iso where he said that the role of science fiction was to predict the future. This is somewhat true, but science fiction has other roles. One of those is to comment on the present. Part of what made Dennou Coil good was that it did both of these things: it presented a hypothetical future technology in such a way that it could represent other, real life technologies and the results of them becoming a part of society that people take for granted. Dennou Coil...discussed the blurring of the line between your digital self, your physical self, and your spiritual self. It discussed the nature of the relationship between children and technology. It was easy to think of different \'readings\' of or ways of understanding the point of the work. It was rich and complex.The Orbital Children trades complexity for complication. It treats every single plot thread with deadly seriousness. The lowest stakes? One person dies. The highest stakes? Literally billions of people die. There\'s no space for anything to have emotional resonance because we\'re too busy being bounced around a plot that hinges around everyone nearly dying almost all the time. The mechanics of the world--AI hack battles, how gravity worked--may not have been realistic, but they were imaginative and fun. What I found unbelievable was the idea that it was supposed to have an emotional plot at all.Then, there\'s the prediction of the future itself. It\'s... hmm. Similarly, I don\'t really care about the realism of the politics. What I do care about is how a fundamental message of the series is essentially that autocratic rule and fascism is bad unless orchestrated by a fascist AI, and if the fascist AI does anything wrong it\'s because of the interference of humans. It is also enamoured with the idea of gaining superior intelligence being the hallmark of a superior being. In real life, this sort of obsession usually orbits around eugenics, and I find it frankly uncomfortable, especially in a series that talks at great length about ""population reduction"" being necessary without actually concluding that it isn\'t possible. By the way, that\'s also a myth, usually bandied around by people who want a scientific-sounding excuse to commit... eugenics.The Orbital Children smells of the kind of all-too-popular futurism that\'s perfectly happy to barrel ahead with planet-killing activities until a technological saviour materialises out of thin air. Because even when science fiction is trying to avoid commenting on the present, it inevitably does so anyway. The future it formulates requires the organisations it\'s critical of to develop superintelligent AI to save the day. It requires their continual existence. It justifies them as it shows them to be callous and corrupt. Something is wrong with that. Something is wrong with depicting that very present horror as not even a prelude but a prerequisite to a happy ending.I did not like this show. I found it very frustrating, and I think it\'s a shame that a spiritual successor to Dennou Coil would be as hollow as this. discussed the blurring of the line between your digital self, your physical self, and your spiritual self.

Clarke quote about science and magic but realized how absolutely pretentious that was. If you really care you can look it up yourself.Anyway my point in bringing it up is that the ""science"" on this supposed near-future Earth is such a ludicrous far cry from reality that I would have had a better time just pretending it was a fantasy show set in space. Robots sent beams of ""hacking"" at each other like they were freaking shounen energy attacks. The only thing worse than the bad attempt at science fiction elements was the horrible...pseudo-philosophy. It\'s clear that is was trying very hard to delivery some sort of message about growing up or something but it was so muddled by it\'s narcissistic tone.

Go shill for Google somewhere else', '*on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being lots of spoilers, this review is probably a 2*TL;DR: The Orbital Children is an anime that is visually stunning but falls short in every other category, like logical concepts, character development, sensible plot, and understandable terminology. Overall, it feels like a waste of three hours. I would not recommend this to anyone who watches anime for enjoyment.First, let me get it out of the way. The graphics/art/whatever you like to call it is excellent. In the first episode, there\'s one shot where you see the empty void of space and Earth, and it looks so good. I...have no complaints there. That being said, art only compensates for a small part of what this anime lacks. Next, I\'ll go into depth about what I don\'t like/understand.1. The concept is poorly thought-out. Please don\'t ask me why space is even involved in this. I\'m not complaining: space concepts are generally pretty cool. However, I don\'t really understand why it needs to be in space in the first place. Additionally, the anime attempts to become a futuristic-style action/drama. How do they fight in the future, you may ask? Apparently, it\'s through hacking. Visually, it\'s as dull as it sounds. The lack of effects during the ""fight"" scenes failed to give me even the slightest excitement, simply because hacking ""fights"" are a dumb concept. It\'s too complicated to create interest in two people typing something into their hands and then having a monitor explode in the background, or something similar to that.2. If character development was a pool, a child could swim in it. That\'s how shallow these characters felt. I generally base a good show on remembering the characters\' names. I barely remember any of the names, and I just finished it about 10 minutes before writing this review. Here are the recurring characters and their development throughout the show.- A girl who livestreams and attempts to be Internet famous—no meaningful development.- Her brother is a timid nerd/genius—no meaningful development.- A girl with implants in her head who is constantly weak—no meaningful development.- The most character development seen is in Touya and Taiyou (I just looked their names up, in case you were wondering). Touya initially hates everyone from Earth because he was born on the moon but eventually thinks people on Earth are OK. Taiyou is a strict rule-follower but breaks some rules to save humanity. Insane, right? I think I\'ve seen more growth in withering plants than in these characters.3. Terminology and story are significant flaws that ruin the entire show.""The satellite is closing on the orbital of Mars with a comet approaching at -20 degrees while the gravitational pull is continuously breaching the warp gate continuum.""See what I did there? I mashed the mumbo jumbo vocabulary that I know from my limited knowledge of aerospace engineering and tried to make an understandable sentence. That\'s what this show feels like, albeit there probably are some real space-related scientific terms. But as someone who is absolutely terrible at physics (ironic with the name, right) and has no experience whatsoever with space engineering, I have no clue what is going on in the show. It seems like there\'s so much that\'s explained/mentioned, but none of it is actually explained well. Generally, some things in the first episode often go unexplained, and that\'s OK. I\'ve come to realize that in most shows, they will come back to explain it. Not in this one. You will have tons of questions that are either completely left unanswered or explained poorly. Now, I might be able to attribute some of my incomprehension to the notoriously bad Netflix subtitles. However, in the end, I still think the terminology and the story plot are way too complex for many people. It could have been an average show if it made sense to the average viewer. Unfortunately, because almost zero percent of the show made sense to me, it was dreadful to watch. It made me question why I was watching the show in the first place. I even skipped in 2-5 minute increments in the last episode, and I hardly ever fast-forward when watching an anime.There are some other things that I had issues with, such as the attempt at a deep and meaningful conclusion. However, I have already gone long enough. The one element that sticks out like a sore thumb from the surrounding garbage is the art. If you\'re into making the beautiful anime AMVs and that sort of thing, this would be a great source of content. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. Don\'t watch for enjoyment. have no complaints there.

Dagashi Kashi 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36049/Dagashi_Kashi_2,"[""Dagashi Kashi is that show that just doesn't stop being sweet. Take that literally or not I mean it both ways. This season in particular was much better than the last especially since we got an excellent new character (Owari Hajime) along with Beniyutaka and the hilarious shenanigans just went on.I was quite skeptical of the studio change since the previous studio did a fine job and I was with the thought that Tezuka Productions couldn't manage such a show and couldn't bring it to greater heights. Let's just say I couldn't be more wrong. This season was a positive step up from the last...in that we got more jokes, more characters, less focus on the sweets jargon and a reinforced and improved cast that was just as brilliant as they were weird. I just couldn't stop laughing in this season at everyone compared to the last where I was seen Google searching the sweets for a bit of context or relying on translation notes so I consider this a plus point. Then we had the sudden disappearance of an important character but to be honest I found that disappearance better since that departure led to further introductions of new characters like Owari Hajime and Beniyutaka who were vibrant, cheerful, unique and as mentioned hilarious. Did I mention they were also weird like everyone else?Owari Hajime's Character was that of a klutz I had perceived but she too had her amazing moments such as with the 8 candy and the website madness. Although I felt she was slightly more used for fanservice than I expected from last season but thankfully it wasn't overused to the point that it would deter us from the main point of view, literally. As for Beniyutaka, he was voiced by none other than Sugita Tomokazu and I think I only need to tell you his other roles and you'll know just how talented this fellow is, he played Gintoki (Gintama) and Kyon (Haruhi Suzumiya). Two very popular and fantastic roles. Apart from Sugita, the other voice actors did brilliant and I enjoyed the exaggerated expressions used in some of the scenes.Scenes reminds me of the art. Now since this is a studio change as I mentioned before, the art changed as well, although not too drastically on the backgrounds the character designs looked clearly different from last season like for example the way the eyes looked this time. The eyes were more stretched than last time and I don't think this is a plus or minus since the characters' eyes were stretched last time as well, although not as much as this season. Apart from that the OP and ED used was unsurprisingly Dagashi themed. They were as playful as before and to be honest I was already addicted to the OP like 3-4 episodes in. As for the ED, well brilliant as always. Thankfully the Background music for the show didn't change from last time so it wasn't something that would need to get used to.Since there's little to no plot relation from last time I can easily advise others who haven't watched the previous season to view this first since they won't lose any context by watching this first. If they find this interesting then I'm sure they'll like season 1 as well, albeit some may find the Dagashi jargon a bit on the difficult to understand side. Regardless, both seasons were amazing, but personally I find this superior for the aforementioned reason as it's easy to understand and yet still such a beloved joy to watch.This season was pretty interesting for me, since we had a different set of anime and I had maybe 2-3 sequels only out of which Saiki Kusuo and Dagashi were included and frankly the sequels this season didn't disappoint me one bit. Maybe because with sequels you know what is going to happen and if you're not a masochist you'll usually watch sequels if you liked the previous one (talking about people planning to watch that Isekai Smartphone sequel because it won't be good I tell you now).Do you want a show that makes you laugh and give you a little but of cultural knowledge? How about watch an anime all about sweets? Funny Characters and no plot to worry about? If that's the case then I give you a guarantee that Dagashi Kashi 2 won't disappoint you. Sometimes some shows don't handle endings well since Japanese sources generally are bad at endings from what I've experienced and heard (not trying to be racist here but it's what I've seen, it's like saying the Ancient Greeks loved happy endings or the Romans loved watching people fight in the Colosseum). Point is, if you're wanting to watch a funny slice of life anime, look no further than Dagashi Kashi because there's lots to laugh about at Shikada Dagashi! in that we got more jokes, more characters, less focus on the sweets jargon and a reinforced and improved cast that was just as brilliant as they were weird.

Regardless, both seasons were amazing, but personally I find this superior for the aforementioned reason as it's easy to understand and yet still such a beloved joy to watch.This season was pretty interesting for me, since we had a different set of anime and I had maybe 2-3 sequels only out of which Saiki Kusuo and Dagashi were included and frankly the sequels this season didn't disappoint me one bit. Maybe because with sequels you know what is going to happen and if you're not a masochist you'll usually watch sequels if you liked the previous one (talking about people planning to watch that Isekai Smartphone sequel because it won't be good I tell you now).Do you want a show that makes you laugh and give you a little but of cultural knowledge? How about watch an anime all about sweets? Funny Characters and no plot to worry about? If that's the case then I give you a guarantee that Dagashi Kashi 2 won't disappoint you. Sometimes some shows don't handle endings well since Japanese sources generally are bad at endings from what I've experienced and heard (not trying to be racist here but it's what I've seen, it's like saying the Ancient Greeks loved happy endings or the Romans loved watching people fight in the Colosseum). Point is, if you're wanting to watch a funny slice of life anime, look no further than Dagashi Kashi because there's lots to laugh about at Shikada Dagashi!"", 'Let\'s be clear - I never thought that this series could get a 2nd season. No one thought, I believe. First season of Dagashi Kashi has been portrayed in the minds of people as ""12 episode sweet commercial"", but the second is something a bit different. I\'m going to only compare it to the first season.The story remains the same, there is Kokonotsu, whose dad wants him to take over the dagashi shop, there is Hotaru, who spends most of her time with him while telling him the story of sweets, and there are also Saya and To, who spend a lot of time with...them too and, of course, there are japanese sweets (and sometimes toys). The main difference between the story in the first one and the second is that... There is drama in this one. Drama in Dagashi Kashi, yeah.Kokonotsu fell in love with Hotaru and even forgot that he DIDN\'T want to become a shop owner. After Hotaru lefts the town, he gets really depressed and that\'s when Kotoyama finally opens the door for the new characters, who are Hajime and Beniyutaka. While the second one doesn\'t really have much screen time, Hajime really shines. She is the one character who made this season as funny as it could be. Every scene with her is hilarious and she blends in with other people really well.The biggest changes in this season are the new art style and shorter episode duration.At first, I didn\'t like the art, but after watching one episode it was proved that I was wrong. All characters (Except for Hotaru, I guess, she was gorgeous in the 1st season) look AMAZINGLY good. Background art is on point too. The art shouldn\'t be something that can make this series bad.As for the episode duration, it... also made the series better. The main point of Dagashi Kashi is promoting sweets while telling you it\'s history as you watch characters interact with each other, and some episodes in the first season were boring because this anime does not need to be 20 minutes long to do it\'s job.My only complaint for this series would be TOO much fanservice in the first episodes. I mean, you\'re 2 episodes in and you already see Hotaru and Saya in one bath.As for now, I think that second season is even better than the first one. It is more enjoyable and fun, while also remaining ""educative"" for those who want to know more about sweets. them too and, of course, there are japanese sweets (and sometimes toys).

They ended up getting away with this change easily enough, though, because the first season spent so much more time getting viewers acquainted with the original cast of characters.There’s a line in the first season that goes something like “…the significance...of a dagashi shop. Not only is it a place for relaxation, but also a place where bonds are created by interacting customers. It’s a place that creates connections among people.”This line represents the very essence of Dagashi Kashi. While the first season moves along at a pretty slow pace, it develops connections¬ between the characters themselves, and also between the characters and the audience. Season two then molds those relationships into something truly entertaining. Together, they combine for a subtly sweet mix of slice-of-life storytelling coated in educational opportunity, then sprinkled with just enough drama to keep it interesting.7.5/10 of a dagashi shop.

(We are lucky to get a second season some shows don't)Also this show is always...great for a laugh or two, and plus you can never get enough Hotaru! great for a laugh or two, and plus you can never get enough Hotaru!"", 'Dagashi Kashi is back and with some changes but changes are for the better!Mild Spoilers ahead...Now the changes from the first to second season is from the studio change from Studio feel. to Tezuka Productions and with their changes they have changed the slick shiny character designs of feel to a flatter color palette to Tezuka but still looks good to look at and the most obvious change being the change from a 22 minute episode to a 12 minute one. Now the change of less screentime to Dagashi Kashi 2 is actually a good move as the first season of Dagashi Kashi had some...filler episodes within it\'s 22 minute screentime, while it\'s second season\'s 10 minutes however gets more focused as well as the heavy change to the second season\'s plot that occurs, so cutting the fat of the filler and being more focused is a good outlook of the second season of Dagashi Kashi.Dagashi Kashi 2\'s plot still has it\'s comedic skits with it\'s various Japanese candies but the plot ""thickens"" halfway through the anime, that of the downside of Dagashi Kashi 2\'s plot...Hotaru Shidare just disappearing. This definitely changes some things mainly of Kokonotsu\'s trying even harder to make the dagashi shop work AND how about having a convenience store to be Kokonotsu\'s rival AND to substitute Hotaru\'s absence, Hajime Owari voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki, another ""sorta"" love interest but also Kokonotsu\'s in-shop employee of his dagashi shop. Yeah ALOT of this changes in this second season. Now for the most part these changes do affect the majority of this season especially Hotaru\'s absences is telling of Kokonotsu\'s love for Hotaru and even gives Kokonotsu to strive to both manage the dagashi shop because of his lingering feelings towards Hotaru and his initial goal of being a mangaka. Hajime Owari herself is also a good addition to the anime having great chemistry to the entire cast, Hajime almost being a mixture of Saya and Hotaru, so you can tell her having the chemistry work is a given. Now the final new character of this second season would be Beniyutaka voiced by Tomokazu Sugita being the owner of the convenience store and rival to Kokonotsu\'s dagashi shop and well...he\'s not a rival per say as he mostly wants tips from Kokonotsu in having a convenience store in the boonies still his eccentricities and those eyes...reminded LA of someone...but who.The animation done now by Tezuka Productions have some minor changes especially with the flat yet similar character designs but still keeping the backgrounding on par with feel, but for the most part, LA did like the new changes to the character designs and even the shift in animation studio\'s, LA WOULD wanted Studio feel to do the second season with their polished and slick character designs but LA is still happy with Tezuka\'s either way.Now the voice acting, well LA has been watching the Funimation dub of it as well but first the Japanese. LA was always ok with the Japanese, with all the genkiness and comedic timing down pat and what with the second season going into more plot heavy dramatic moments, the only two voice actors for those were Ayana Taketatsu and Atsushi Abe as Hotaru and Kokonotsu respectively. Manami Numakura was great as always as Saya as well as Keiji Fujiwara as You and Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Tou. New voice actors like Chinatsu Akasaki as Hajime was a great addition to the anime as again Chinatsu had some great character chemistry with Abe and Manami and the over-eccentric Tomokazu Sugita as Beniyutaka was also welcomed, like it\'s Tomokazu Sugita going genki hammy as hell, what\'s not to love. Now the obvious elephant in the room would be because of Hotaru\'s mysterious absences, also means Ayana herself had less screentime as a result and LA did kinda felt that to the point LA was kinda missing Hotaru much like Kokonotsu himself did. Kinda makes you appreciate Hotaru and Ayana\'s genki vocals that much more.*ahem* on the Funimation side of things well same thing happened with Tabitha Ray due to her voicing Hotaru and LA missed her as well but still great to see her reprise her role as Hotaru. Sara Ragsdale, Justin Pate and Jeremy Inman were great in their respective roles as Saya, Tou and You and LA didn\'t expect Caitlin Glass to voice Hajime in the dub, LA was expecting Lindsay Seidel to do it instead but nonetheless Caitlin voicing Hajime was still on par with her Japanese counterpart nonetheless and Christopther Wehkamp as Beniyutaka was also welcomed though almost as genki as his original Japanese counterpart. The voice cast really on both the original and the dub was excellent despite some upsets no thanks to the major changes to the plot.Dagashi Kashi 2 for LA is an excellent second season by effectively removing NEARLY all the flaws of the first season by condensing the screentime and plot to 10 minutes per episode as well as giving the plot of Kokonotsu as a character more purpose as a result, but still keeping the flavour of the original Dagashi Kashi intact with it\'s comedy with it\'s dagashi knowledge while keeping fresh with new developments in terms of plot and characters. Even if the second season\'s removed some of the flaws of the first season and it brought up it\'s own little flaws here and there, LA does see the second season of Dagashi Kashi as an improvement from the first season as a result, even at the cost of one character\'s screentime drastically reduced and the plot being more focused. filler episodes within it\'s 22 minute screentime, while it\'s second season\'s 10 minutes however gets more focused as well as the heavy change to the second season\'s plot that occurs, so cutting the fat of the filler and being more focused is a good outlook of the second season of Dagashi Kashi.Dagashi Kashi 2\'s plot still has it\'s comedic skits with it\'s various Japanese candies but the plot ""thickens"" halfway through the anime, that of the downside of Dagashi Kashi 2\'s plot...Hotaru Shidare just disappearing.

The second season of Dagashi Kashi focuses a lot more on character interaction than the first season, and every character is really likable too. Before watching either season I had no idea what even dagashi was to begin with, but I must say the idea behind it was used very effectively in making the plot for the anime. I couldn't help but think that the dagashi was essential in order for the story to make even the smallest bit of sense. Another surprisingly positive aspect of this season, was the episode length....Even though it was cut in half, it didn't seem like the story ended too early for any of the episodes. After all, the story didn't try to be too ambitious. This was especially important for Dagashi Kashi because it is exactly what dagashi itself is supposed to portray. The mindless fun that comes from Kokonotsu and his friends' interactions is incredibly comfortable to watch, at times inspiring, as we see them grow together.

It wasn’t a particularly deep series, but I enjoyed the running gags throughout the series and the characters fit well into their setting. It never tried to take itself too seriously and reveled in being a lighthearted, episodic comedy. S2 could have followed suit, but tried to work with different forms of plot development.Dagashi Kashi S2 certainly focuses more on having an overarching story, with multiple episodes following a single plot. Episodes usually had a unique candy to talk about, but the focus had certainly shifted to revolve around the characters rather than...the snacks. This change in focus would prove fortunate for those looking for a more cohesive experience, but overall seemed to detract from the experience.The characters of Dagashi Kashi are well realized for their setting, but that setting is in a candy store making jokes, not worrying about failure and deadlines. Perhaps it’s personal opinion, but the change in general feeling from lighthearted fun to more drama based interactions takes away from the overall light hearted and “fun” nature of the show. Not enough episodes centered around romping through the woods and hanging by the pier compared the number spent worrying about the competition for sales.Overall, Dagashi Kashi is a nice little continuation of the series, especially true with the episodes being half the length of a regular one at 12 minutes. The second season lacks some of the charm of the first season, but delivers a fun revisit to dagashi shop by the river. the snacks.

What makes the story good was that this time we the audience were...made to miss Hotaru through Kokonutsu, where we long for her return. However the plot hole here is why did she left? Then again for her to  appear again was the climax of this anime even if she was made to reemerge on the very last episode,  but even so studio Tezuka Production and original creator Kotoyama almost fooled us into believe that she has left again, which was quite cheeky.Well, since Hotaru was replace by Owari, it does't diminish the anime's story line in fact it was Owari that has provided an alternative for Hotaru, but unlike the oddball Hotaru, Owari on the other hand adds a sort of sotacon element in this anime, now I know all fo you would agree that the plot of Hotaru gone for a while and wanting to know her reason or when will she come back is something that keep us watching this anime.Mediocre 5, Art:There  may have been some changes with Hotaru's illustration, but even so , we still see a buxom girl in a goth lolita dress  has not change. We may have seen Saya in her school uniform and still fashionable as usual . Tou is still this Hawaiian Haole who still should be fed to the sharks and even the addition of Owari in her business suit was just too out of place, since she now works in a small dagashi and does she have to wear it even sleeping?There is also Beniyutaka a guy managing a convenience  store who has to be in a coat less business attire, but then again it doesn't make any difference.  As long as there are resemblances with the character's illustration. Btw don't expect to see any onsen, shower, beach and panty services around here.Mediocre 5, Sound:Ok so is there anything for me to say about the seiyu's who did the character's voices around here????????Nope nothing to say around here nor do I have anything to say about the opening and closing themes.Good 7, Character:Here the thing about the characters that studio Tezuka Production and anime director Kuwahara Satoshi put around here, in fact it not who they've put around this sequel , it's what they did with the main heroine Hotaru, where they intentionally put her character on haitus after episode 4 and replaces her with Owari Hajime on the 7th episode, only to reemerge on the last episode, it maybe a cheeky move but then again seeing Kokonutsu with a Milf bring in a new life, since with here, we see what Hotaru should've done instead of commuting everyday by train which is quite a task that would have save her such trouble if she stayed with Kokonutsu.....But back to Owari, she sort act like this guardian to Kokonutsu even if he is her boss, but imao she can be this other girl who could have a sotacon romance with Kokonutsu. As for Saya, too bad that there hasn't been any development with her relationship with Kokonutsu and she still is this childhood friend who's gonna be left behind. Now on the last episode as Hotaru appears again, we're almost led to believe that she gonna walk out again from Kokonutsu's life now that's the climax a very cheeky climax that is.Good 7, Enjoyment:Ya know I kinda hate to say this, but  I know everyone would agree with me that it was our longing for Hotaru's return  was the glue that keep us from dropping this anime, Thought Owari did serves as Hotaru's replacement we the audience we're  empathizing with Kokonutsu for his desire to see Hotaru again as if the romance has re-surges between the two, and it did deliver on the post credits where we see Kokonutsu and Hotaru on top of the roof of the Dagashi shop.Very Good 8, Overall:I got to hand it to studio Tezuka production and anime director Kuwahara Satoshi for their cheekiness for what they've done with Hotaru. Well, it wasn't always that such thing is done, so season 3???? Why not.The End. made to miss Hotaru through Kokonutsu, where we long for her return. However the plot hole here is why did she left?

Tou is still this Hawaiian Haole who still should be fed to the sharks and even the addition of Owari in her business suit was just too out of place, since she now works in a small dagashi and does she have to wear it even sleeping?There is also Beniyutaka a guy managing a convenience  store who has to be in a coat less business attire, but then again it doesn't make any difference.  As long as there are resemblances with the character's illustration. Btw don't expect to see any onsen, shower, beach and panty services around here.Mediocre 5, Sound:Ok so is there anything for me to say about the seiyu's who did the character's voices around here????????Nope nothing to say around here nor do I have anything to say about the opening and closing themes.Good 7, Character:Here the thing about the characters that studio Tezuka Production and anime director Kuwahara Satoshi put around here, in fact it not who they've put around this sequel , it's what they did with the main heroine Hotaru, where they intentionally put her character on haitus after episode 4 and replaces her with Owari Hajime on the 7th episode, only to reemerge on the last episode, it maybe a cheeky move but then again seeing Kokonutsu with a Milf bring in a new life, since with here, we see what Hotaru should've done instead of commuting everyday by train which is quite a task that would have save her such trouble if she stayed with Kokonutsu.....But back to Owari, she sort act like this guardian to Kokonutsu even if he is her boss, but imao she can be this other girl who could have a sotacon romance with Kokonutsu. As for Saya, too bad that there hasn't been any development with her relationship with Kokonutsu and she still is this childhood friend who's gonna be left behind. Now on the last episode as Hotaru appears again, we're almost led to believe that she gonna walk out again from Kokonutsu's life now that's the climax a very cheeky climax that is.Good 7, Enjoyment:Ya know I kinda hate to say this, but  I know everyone would agree with me that it was our longing for Hotaru's return  was the glue that keep us from dropping this anime, Thought Owari did serves as Hotaru's replacement we the audience we're  empathizing with Kokonutsu for his desire to see Hotaru again as if the romance has re-surges between the two, and it did deliver on the post credits where we see Kokonutsu and Hotaru on top of the roof of the Dagashi shop.Very Good 8, Overall:I got to hand it to studio Tezuka production and anime director Kuwahara Satoshi for their cheekiness for what they've done with Hotaru. Well, it wasn't always that such thing is done, so season 3???? Why not.The End."", ""I won't lie, it's my first review, usually, i don't write review because of my horrible english, but i needed to write this one.I'm disappointed of the second season of Dagashi Kashi.Not only by the 12 minutes for each episode instead of the 24min in the first season, but the art changed a little (eyes of Hotaru, head and bodies of the characters...) and these changes affected to my vision of the anime.Story : 7/10The anime is globaly, more focused to the story, and not the jokes and the humour, it's very different from the 1st season, it's not really bad, but not really good...too. But....the is so focused to the story, that the humour is just passing by and we don't even notice that.The story is cool, but no more.Art : 6/10The second season's art is really disturbing me, it's changing from the 1st season but, i don't know, i just can't pass by and i notice every changes from the first season, and i can't get used to.Sound : 7/10The OST, OP, Ending, are always great as the first season, but they still aren't noticable because we are too focused to the story.Character : 7/10The second season of Dagashi Kashi is introducing 2 news characters, 1 main et 1 supporting : Hajime and the owner of the supermaket Beniyutaka.Hajime is fun, but isn't fun as Hotaru was, and, talking to the wolf, Horatu is in a really good part of the anime, absent and away, we only see her in a fews episodes, and that is why my enjoyment regarding the anime gone lower. And I think that is really sad, i was expecting a lot apparition of Hotaru.Enjoyment : 6/10Uhm....i really don't know how to feel to the second season of this anime, i didn't really enjoyed and wasn't really waiting for each episode who were airing, but, i just know that i didn't feel that way for the first season of the anime, it was more enjoyable.Overall : 6/10I won't lie, the second season of Dagashi Kashi for me, isn't a good season, i was expecting too much i think, and it was by this way, that my enjoyment regarding the anime, gone really lower. I don't hate the second season, but don't love it either.I'm just.....disappointed. too.

Much better than season 1 in many ways, including making you want more.The story picks up from season one with the Dagashi shop. However they make it much easier to watch than the first season. Each episode is only 12 minutes long and the Dagashi lessons are much more concise. It was much nicer to have a fun show to watch with the occasional Dagashi fun fact moment than sit for 20 minutes in a Dagashi classroom.The art was pretty as usual, though there was less of the town and more of the shop....The music was enjoyable and I didn't feel compelled to skip the into like I normally do.The characters are all the same, but we get less time with them. This season focused more heavily on Hotaru and Kokonotsu. Eventually sparking some drama, which honestly didn't feel necessary. A couple of new characters join the fun and have about an episode or two of progress. However with this new 12 minute an episode formula it no longer feels like we get to know anyone.Dagashi Kashi 2 was a much more pleasant watch than the first. The first season I kept waiting on the lessons on Dagashi to be turned into humor and it never did. The flow of the show was slow and ultimately boring. This season however was quick and comedic. You get some moments in the show to really feel like they brought together the Dagashi moments and the story moments to create scenarios we can all enjoy. Part of me misses the full length episodes because it was enjoyable to spend time with the cast. Otherwise the show was fun to watch and would recommend it to people who may not have like the first season.TLDR: Better than season 1 for the most part.

Its 12 minute episode length makes it a far easier because its quick, sporadic humor finally feels fast in its pacing. Except, it still has its problems from its lack of awareness pertaining to its depth and emotional cues. Dagashi Kashi\'s second season tries to stymie this problem with the introduction of two new characters. But, the introduction of those characters and the improved pacing doesn\'t offset the fact it is a pretty bland show when Hotaru and Kokonotsu aren\'t interacting. There is not a reason to...watch this show when there are better options like ""Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou"" ; ""Haiyore Naryuko-San"" ; ""Barakamon"" to name a few, that focus of character interactions between a singular or few eccentric characters that foil the MC. Dagashi Kashi is not a bad show, persay. That does not mean it\'s a good one either.----------The first season of Dagashi Kashi was... well boring. It was repetitive, and its 24 minute episode length was far too long for a show that is mainly character interaction and exposition about Japanese sweets/candy. It may sound interesting to hear Hotaru or Kokonotsu talk about the history of various Dagashi, it can get overbearing when it lasts for over 20 minutes.LUCKILY~~~ The producers cut the screen time for Dagashi Kashi in half, literally. Moving from a 24 minute format into a 12 minute format. This actually helps the viewing experience of this anime tremendously. The exposition is shortened by a noticeable amount. The character interactions are fun and quick. Dagashi Kashi\'s 12-minute run-time finally allows for its pace to match its quick, sporadic humor. Every episode might seem to go by in a blink.Except, the show isn\'t still what I would call ""good"" in an overall sense. It\'s an anime that you have, for lack of words, \'turn your brain off to enjoy\'. There is little to not plot development that occurs over this show, and the romantic interests also go nowhere either. The introduction of Hajime and Beniyutaka might seem like a foot in the right direction, but their influence on this anime\'s plot is little to nothing because of the pace of this anime. I haven\'t read any of the source material, so they may have a larger role, but their own specific arcs within the show are punitive at best. They are interesting additions to the current cast of characters, but this anime is still very much carried by the antics of Hotaru and Kokonotsu. When that pairing is not seeing screen-time, the jokes and everything fall flat, to me.Dagashi Kashi S2 is a step in the right direction for this series, and I mean a major step in the right direction. I would not be surprised if there is a third season because I believe that its funded by major Dagashi Companies in Japan, not mention it got simulcasted during its airing. However, its not something you should go out of your way to watch. There are better anime out there that kinda fill the same niche, ""Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou"" ; ""Haiyore Naryuko-San"" ; ""Barakamon"" to name a few, that focus of character interaction and day-to-day living with its focus on improvement surrounding either a singular or few eccentric characters foiling the MC. watch this show when there are better options like ""Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou"" ; ""Haiyore Naryuko-San"" ; ""Barakamon"" to name a few, that focus of character interactions between a singular or few eccentric characters that foil the MC.

A great sequel come to meet my highly interest. Come from my inner heart i just wanna say something in this preview section. Please be aware, since i cannot control over myself to spill some story. So you better consider yourself risk before continue my write here.So, in short, as i refer above, i actually wish to have a better story since previous season can not suit my energy really well. But, with the change of the anime studio production, Dagashi Kashi great me with so much joy! Still, i can't help my feeling for not give highest rating to this show....My expectations really high, so Dagashi 2 can not meet my requirement for being masterpiece show. Sorry for that.What is the problem, then? First, to the story, i doubt for some reason, at the first you see how short this show had, what will you think? Lack of story progress with just too short duration of the show? Yes. Too rushed over the story-telling the show began? True. Not well development the main idea to the plotting? Not matching the genre over the show? (since what i see, the drama shall be perfect, and lack of comedy really hurt my mind too). With all of that, you can said that out of loud again!Well, with all of that questions, i just can't really gave out all of my score here. I had so much criteria to give it without even make such a review like this. Just 8 point will really suit this section pretty well, then. Btw, What is the reason? Okay, i can spill some of my word here.First thing first. Fun scene, which make smile and laugh out loud! And the characterization pretty well designed to suit to the story so much here. Really a good job improvement since in the previous one they lack of that matching with the character. Alas, even the new character really enjoy the story progressing so well. Moreover, it make me smile so hard and even grin as long as possibel to such a good scene. Really surprising, how new character really develop well into the show, like they are just the old character one. And i just like it, even i just know it from episode 1. Omg! How genius the director make all the scene really well played. And i like some drama flavour, Hotaru disappearance. Which can make my brain over to gonna explode with so much enjoyment!However man. With all of that, i guessed without even mention other review section. With all of paragraph above, i can give all of my 8 with those reasons to completely to other section review!Ah, i forgot. About the art and music, i eventually give it more point since i really love all of that. 10 would be great. Idk the reason. I just feel the fun thing just blew my mind over such an OP and ED the show bring. And so much joy to the art too. How brilliant!At last. For some point of view, thanks for another season. Really. I apreciate that. It really help me to fill the blank puzzle at previous show. All character develop so well. And the ending seems to be pretty solved so well. Really love how all character cone mix beyond one to finish such a short season like this one. I believed, if this anime do not take a slice of life genre, but come to the drama one, my overall 10 points will simply fall to this show. But alas, the author had his own decisions. So i just wanna respect it with 8 out of 10 to such a good anime like this one. My expectations really high, so Dagashi 2 can not meet my requirement for being masterpiece show.

For almost all of the season we see no Hotaru, This character is one of the main attractions and you can honestly feel her character missing from the show.But once i saw those crazed eyes again near the end of the season, Well i got shivers down my spine and i believe that shows you how exciting it was to finally see her back again.The...story itself seems to take a more Slice of Life approach instead of what ever you'd call the first season. First season we got more energetic and crazy stories happening but in this it's seems to be more calm. Even the color pallet has gotten a little more dark.The show itself changed it's animation. I personally really liked the original and how everyone looked, Like previously mentioned the color pallet has taken on more dark and depressing tones. At times it kind of kills the funny atmosphere we should be getting or at least for me.Don't get me wrong. I still think the animation is nice and looks different then most other shows.We are also introduced to a new character. Usually this doesn't go over well when you introduce a new character that is a part of the main story. But i'd say that she was a nice addition. Most people in the comment sections were assuming that she is Hotaru in disguise. But i like her. She is better then any other male character in the show still.I still feel that Hotaru and Saya are the best couple together. I wish we got them together cause they just seem to go so well with each other. Hell, I'd even through in the new girl character for a three way Yuri love triangle.The main MC isn't that interesting and i'd rather have the show feature Hotaru and Saya and the MC's.I can honestly see a show where it starts out with Saya living her rather boring life and then all of a sudden a Dagashi shop opening next to her cafe. Turns out a new girl is at school and we later find out that the owner of the Dagashi shop is Hotaru ( The new girl)I feel that would be more enjoyable then watching the eh MC.I still don't like that we only got 13 minute episodes this time ,But oh well.The ending though i feel deserves props. I ended the season feeling satisfied but also wanting more. I feel a charming feeling when we see both the MC and Hotaru in the train station by them self. Then the show actually bothering to show us returning to the Dagashi shop and her surprising everyone. Stuff like this i see very little shows do and it's a nice touch.Overall i still feel this is a underrated show and that i don't understand such low scores. story itself seems to take a more Slice of Life approach instead of what ever you'd call the first season.

I think that the change of studio was something good, and it could combine story, jokes, fanservice, romance and candies in some good and enjoyable to see without being overwhelming somehow.I just finished watching it and now if I want...to know more of this story. to know more of this story."", 'You know those ads on Youtube that let you skip them after 5 seconds?\xa0 Think of this as that and season 1 as the 30 second unskippable ones.Story:As expected of a sequel, Dagashi Kashi 2 returns back to Shikada Dagashi, where Kokonotsu continues his youth out in the sticks subjected to the eccentric Hotaru bringing about new cheap snacks and the history behind them before disappearing halfway and continuing that plotline anyway despite not having the character that made the show interesting in the first place do all of the narration.Alright in short, the show is...sorta like the first season with its runtime cut in...half.\xa0 Much of what to expect from this is what is seen in the first season, just toned down because Hotaru being the girl whose sexual preference is snack isn\'t present for a good half of the show.\xa0 It\'s with this lack of hyper energy that season 2 feels dull by comparison, which doesn\'t help its case when its attempt at an overarching narrative at the end feels out of place and poorly executed because up till that point, the show never even bothered to tackle Kokonotsu\'s character or interests since prior to that he was just the guy who was either being talked to or talking about dagashi.So really at the end of the day you\'re left with a show that tries to break out of its mold, but fails to do so because it\'s still stuck and is content with being in it.\xa0 There\'s honestly not much to say about it since the show\'s total runtime is the sum total of half a cour, which while helped me get through it much faster because the twenty four minute runtime of the first season felt agonizing cause it almost felt like nothing was even happening aside from a history lesson on a snack I never heard of.\xa0 Even ads have to be interesting if you want people to watch them.Overview:+/- Pretty much the first season chopped in half-\xa0 Less energetic and therefore became less interesting-\xa0 Poorly executed \'final arc\'Characters:Out of the entire main cast, Kokonotsu is really the only matters?\xa0 There\'s a focus on him in the later episodes, especially the last two that tries to give him characterization due to the polarizing paths that he\'s presented throughout the series, but it just...doesn\'t work out.\xa0 The tonal shift of it felt pretty out of place, especially with how somber the show tried to be in the very last episode, and at the end of day, Kokonotsu still remained as the son of a Dagashi shop owner with very few actual changes in his character despite what the show tries to paint.There are however two new characters that the show presents; Hajime, a new part-timer, and Beniyutaka, a man who seems way too obsessed with the concept of convenience stores.\xa0 In Hotaru\'s stead, these two attempt to fill in the gap by being both the \'Dagashi\' and \'High-Energy\' parts of her personality respectively, which only kind of worked because Hajime managed to be entertaining without being too over the top whereas Beniyutaka proved to be the opposite.\xa0 Apart from them, the rest of the tiny cast involving the Endo twins and Kokonotsu\'s father return with very few changes to them.Overview:+ Saya\'s still kinda awesome+/- Kind of average charactersArt:Production this time was transferred from Feel to Tezuka Productions, which comparing the two is like seeing something in 1080p then going into 360p.\xa0 There\'s a certain lack of quality with how season 2 looks, with much of the colors looking much duller and darker in comparison to Feel\'s work in making everything look brighter and shinier by comparison.It\'s a weird shock with how different the qualities are that honestly I feel was for the worse.\xa0 Yes, Kotoyama\'s style is still recognizable, but it\'s one of those things where you\'re used to one thing, and now seeing it in a different style ends up looking weird because it\'s not what you\'re familiar with, which is especially telling because the series\'s high octane and light hearted comedy is now contrasted by this super dull and dark color palette that doesn\'t match up.Overview:- Overall lower qualitySound:Both\xa0Ayana Taketatsu\'s ""OH MY Sugar Feeling!!"" and Hachimitsu Rocket\'s ""Okashi na Watashi to Hachimitsu no Kimi"" are songs that emphasis the show\'s energy as a snack-based comedy more than anything else.\xa0 They\'re not tracks that I would give praise for simply because I just didn\'t care for them.\xa0 They\'re alright I admit, but they didn\'t have anything interesting about them that truly grasped my attention, and for that I personally gave them a pass.Personal Enjoyment:I often put sequel seasons on my list for \'obligatory reasons\', as I call them.\xa0 I\'m usually in it for the long haul and very rarely do I not continue a series, even if I dislike it, whether that reason be its main character or if I get so annoyed by the plot that I flat out refuse to continue it.\xa0 While Dagashi Kashi doesn\'t fall into either of those categories, and even with a shorter runtime so at the end of the day I\'m still watching less of the thing overall, I still don\'t think it was worth it.Honestly, I\'m pinning it on the fact that the novelty of the idea ran out.\xa0 Sure there\'re a million different snacks and/or cheap toys that exist out there, but having that be the primary running joke/focus in the series runs the well dry pretty fast cause it\'s the exact same thing.\xa0 Sure the show tried to spice it up by bringing in new characters, but it did it at the sacrifice of getting rid of the one character that pretty much gave the show reason to exist, which again, doesn\'t help the show\'s case.\xa0 There\'s also a criminally small amount of Saya featured in this season, and that is a downright crime.\xa0 Best girl should not be benched like that, especially during the show\'s ""downtime"".So if you ask me, unless you really like this show, you\'re best skipping this.\xa0 Granted I wasn\'t expecting anything grand from this sequel, but at least let me put ""It\'s a sequel, what you saw in the first season is what you\'re gonna get here"", cause that is not at all what happened damnit, and that\'s the bare minimum you could\'ve done where you instead went directions that didn\'t help your case in the end. half.\xa0 Much of what to expect from this is what is seen in the first season, just toned down because Hotaru being the girl whose sexual preference is snack isn\'t present for a good half of the show.\xa0 It\'s with this lack of hyper energy that season 2 feels dull by comparison, which doesn\'t help its case when its attempt at an overarching narrative at the end feels out of place and poorly executed because up till that point, the show never even bothered to tackle Kokonotsu\'s character or interests since prior to that he was just the guy who was either being talked to or talking about dagashi.So really at the end of the day you\'re left with a show that tries to break out of its mold, but fails to do so because it\'s still stuck and is content with being in it.\xa0 There\'s honestly not much to say about it since the show\'s total runtime is the sum total of half a cour, which while helped me get through it much faster because the twenty four minute runtime of the first season felt agonizing cause it almost felt like nothing was even happening aside from a history lesson on a snack I never heard of.\xa0 Even ads have to be interesting if you want people to watch them.Overview:+/- Pretty much the first season chopped in half-\xa0 Less energetic and therefore became less interesting-\xa0 Poorly executed \'final arc\'Characters:Out of the entire main cast, Kokonotsu is really the only matters?\xa0 There\'s a focus on him in the later episodes, especially the last two that tries to give him characterization due to the polarizing paths that he\'s presented throughout the series, but it just...doesn\'t work out.\xa0 The tonal shift of it felt pretty out of place, especially with how somber the show tried to be in the very last episode, and at the end of day, Kokonotsu still remained as the son of a Dagashi shop owner with very few actual changes in his character despite what the show tries to paint.There are however two new characters that the show presents; Hajime, a new part-timer, and Beniyutaka, a man who seems way too obsessed with the concept of convenience stores.\xa0 In Hotaru\'s stead, these two attempt to fill in the gap by being both the \'Dagashi\' and \'High-Energy\' parts of her personality respectively, which only kind of worked because Hajime managed to be entertaining without being too over the top whereas Beniyutaka proved to be the opposite.\xa0 Apart from them, the rest of the tiny cast involving the Endo twins and Kokonotsu\'s father return with very few changes to them.Overview:+ Saya\'s still kinda awesome+/- Kind of average charactersArt:Production this time was transferred from Feel to Tezuka Productions, which comparing the two is like seeing something in 1080p then going into 360p.\xa0 There\'s a certain lack of quality with how season 2 looks, with much of the colors looking much duller and darker in comparison to Feel\'s work in making everything look brighter and shinier by comparison.It\'s a weird shock with how different the qualities are that honestly I feel was for the worse.\xa0 Yes, Kotoyama\'s style is still recognizable, but it\'s one of those things where you\'re used to one thing, and now seeing it in a different style ends up looking weird because it\'s not what you\'re familiar with, which is especially telling because the series\'s high octane and light hearted comedy is now contrasted by this super dull and dark color palette that doesn\'t match up.Overview:- Overall lower qualitySound:Both\xa0Ayana Taketatsu\'s ""OH MY Sugar Feeling!!"" and Hachimitsu Rocket\'s ""Okashi na Watashi to Hachimitsu no Kimi"" are songs that emphasis the show\'s energy as a snack-based comedy more than anything else.\xa0 They\'re not tracks that I would give praise for simply because I just didn\'t care for them.\xa0 They\'re alright I admit, but they didn\'t have anything interesting about them that truly grasped my attention, and for that I personally gave them a pass.Personal Enjoyment:I often put sequel seasons on my list for \'obligatory reasons\', as I call them.\xa0 I\'m usually in it for the long haul and very rarely do I not continue a series, even if I dislike it, whether that reason be its main character or if I get so annoyed by the plot that I flat out refuse to continue it.\xa0 While Dagashi Kashi doesn\'t fall into either of those categories, and even with a shorter runtime so at the end of the day I\'m still watching less of the thing overall, I still don\'t think it was worth it.Honestly, I\'m pinning it on the fact that the novelty of the idea ran out.\xa0 Sure there\'re a million different snacks and/or cheap toys that exist out there, but having that be the primary running joke/focus in the series runs the well dry pretty fast cause it\'s the exact same thing.\xa0 Sure the show tried to spice it up by bringing in new characters, but it did it at the sacrifice of getting rid of the one character that pretty much gave the show reason to exist, which again, doesn\'t help the show\'s case.\xa0 There\'s also a criminally small amount of Saya featured in this season, and that is a downright crime.\xa0 Best girl should not be benched like that, especially during the show\'s ""downtime"".So if you ask me, unless you really like this show, you\'re best skipping this.\xa0 Granted I wasn\'t expecting anything grand from this sequel, but at least let me put ""It\'s a sequel, what you saw in the first season is what you\'re gonna get here"", cause that is not at all what happened damnit, and that\'s the bare minimum you could\'ve done where you instead went directions that didn\'t help your case in the end.', ""Part 1 EnglishPart 2 Bahasa Indonesia--------------------------------------Alright, let's buckle up and talk about Dagashi Kashi 2, the anime that makes me crave candy like a 5-year-old at a carnival. With a score of 6.8 out of 10, it's safe to say that this anime has some ups and downs, just like my blood sugar after a sugar rush.Let's start with the story. It's pretty simple: our protagonist, Kokonotsu, has a passion for creating manga, but his father wants him to take over the family's dagashi (Japanese snacks) shop. Along comes the eccentric candy-loving hottie, Hotaru, who tries to convince him to inherit the store instead. Honestly,...it's not the most groundbreaking plot, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.Moving on to the art style. It's cute, vibrant, and perfectly suits the light-hearted nature of the show. The animation is decent, and the candy designs are mouthwatering. Seriously, don't watch this anime on an empty stomach, or you'll regret it.Let's talk about the three main characters: Kokonotsu, Hotaru, and Saya. Kokonotsu is your typical high school student with a passion for manga, but he's also the only sane one in the group. Hotaru is an oddball candy enthusiast who's always on a mission to educate others about dagashi. Lastly, Saya is Kokonotsu's childhood friend who has a crush on him, but he's too dense to realize it. Together, they make a pretty amusing trio.The voice acting is solid. Hotaru's voice actor does an excellent job of portraying her quirky and energetic personality. The music is upbeat and catchy, perfectly fitting the tone of the show.Now, let's talk about the experience of watching this anime. It's a fun and lighthearted ride that's perfect for a lazy afternoon binge-watch. It's not the most intellectually stimulating show, but it's guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Plus, you'll probably learn a thing or two about Japanese snacks.In conclusion, Dagashi Kashi 2 is a sweet treat for anyone who loves candy, quirky characters, and a light-hearted story. It may not be a masterpiece, but it's certainly worth a watch. Just be sure to have some snacks on hand, or you'll be left with a serious case of FOMO.--------------------------------------Baiklah, mari kita bahas Dagashi Kashi 2, anime yang membuat saya ngidam seperti anak kecil di pameran.

Still on that matter, there were NONE sexual innuendos this season, I don't know if they were done down on the manga or because a new studio took this anime, but it was disappointing not having any innuendos.The art is a bit different, yet acceptable, but I noticed more ugly animations and drawings than with the last studio.It is a light anime with 12 episodes of 12 minutes you can watch it in a lazy afternoon with any problems, a shame we didn't have more Hotaru though. but she somewhat behaves like how one would expect of Hotaru.

I thought this was going to be another repetitive sequel to the last one but it caught me by surprise like the last episode in “Dagashi Kashi”. Not only did the author finally incorporate that Kokonotsu actual has feelings for Hotaru but it talks more about what he want to do and more about each character. I can also say this was more funnier than the 1st one and I’m not a easy person to make laugh but I will say I was giggling like a little schoolgirl lol. Overall “Dagashi Kashi...2” is way better than the 1st one in my opinion, it didn’t always talk about snacks and how Hotaru love each Dagashi. It was nice to see that this show can take a big turn for the better and become something I’ll actually enjoy, it sucks that each episode was only 12 minutes but the studio knew people didn’t want to always see them talk about Dagashi and that’s why they only animated the “important parts” but I do appreciate them actually listening to the community. I can say this was a 8/10 overall had funny scenes and scenes that made you think “is he/she going to actually go for it” and that built excitement in me.(UPDATE ABOUT SEASON 3): so the one reason the studio made the episodes 12 minutes was also because they were running out of materials to write about, they were actually pretty caught up with the manga and decided to end it short after not knowing what to add or put next. I am sure the manga is still going but there are mixed reviews about the manga, I won’t say much cause I don’t want to spoil anything for you guys/gals but I will say some people are upset about it not being an actual “manga” and more of an advertisement but I’ll let you be the judge of that as the whole 1st season was basically an ad. But I do hope there is a possible season 3 to end this series off in a good note and if not I hope the manga ends good enough were I can not stress about other possible outcomes. 2” is way better than the 1st one in my opinion, it didn’t always talk about snacks and how Hotaru love each Dagashi.

It\'s cheat, it\'s sweet, and enjoyable. However, too much candy ends up making you feel bad, so it\'s always recommended to eat them in small doses and not to overdo it.I\'ve been a fan of the Dagashi Kashi manga since 2015 so I was extremely happy to hear it get an adaption in 2016. I thought it was a good adaption, but the biggest problem was that it was kind of....long. The manga was fun to read in its 8 pages at your own pace, but...when you make an episode 24 minutes long, it can kind of start feel like a chore to watch, and you\'re watching an anime all the way because YOU want to, otherwise why would you even put up with it?Dagashi Kashi 2 fixes that problem by being around 10 minutes long. By feeding the audience in small doses, it\'s much more enjoyable and it makes you crave for more after one is done. You don\'t stuff your mouth with the entire bag of skittles, you grab them in handfuls.Story & Characters:Onto the actual show, it\'s formula from the prior season doesn\'t change too drastically. It continues to revolve around the antics of Kokonotsu ""Coconuts"" Shikada and Hotaru Shidare and her quest to make Kokonotsu run his father\'s candy store. This changes by the time Hotaru, the driving force of the series, magically disappears for months in the story\'s time. Here, we are introduced to 2 new characters, Hajime Owari, a part timer for the candy store, and Beniyutaka Shidare, the owner of a convenience store across the river in front of the candy shop. They\'re both welcome additions to the series as they make the cast feel more bigger without feeling bloated and it feels like the small world of dagashi kashi has a lot going on.Unlike previous chapters/ season 1, this is the point where we see some character development and some changes in Kokonutsu\'s life. Between Hotaru disappearing without a word, Kokonutsu trying fix up the Candy Shop and him taking his dream of being a mangaka more serious, there\'s alot of small twists to the regular formula so it doesn\'t feel like we\'re getting more of the same thing without it becoming too stale. The cast genuinely care for one another and it really shows in the much more serious moments. They aren\'t deep or complex but they feel like good characters.Art:Not much to really say here but it\'s fine. A lot of people seemed to have been iffy about the slightly different art style from S1 to S2 which might have been a result in a budget cut but I think the slightly darker feel fits the series just fine. No complaints.Sound:Mostly just reusing the same soundtrack from S1, it\'s alright. The seiyuu\'s do a great job at making their characters feel like themselves and it was nice to hear Sugita Tomokazu as the convenience store owner because he totally captures the energy that character gives whenever he\'s on screen. Personally I never really cared about S2s OP or ED. I think S1 had it beat. Calorie Queen is still stuck in my head.Enjoyment:Yeah, it\'s very enjoyable, especially if you already liked season 1. S2 does things kind of different while still being dagashi kashi at heart so ultimately if you were hoping that it spices things up, I think you won\'t be too disappointed.Overall, I feel like S2 is a step up from S1 in every way. Although I wouldn\'t rule out a Season 3, I do think most people should continue reading the manga especially since, as of typing, the manga is set to end and Kotoyama has confirmed he\'s finished drawing the finale of the series.

The first season was very systematic in basically just being a sequence of Hotaru showing off and obsessing over lots of different snacks in an incredibly energetic manner without much in the way of any overarching plot, character, or relationship development. This season still has some descriptions of snacks, but it’s minimal and very much not the focus. Which is to be expected, as the character that was driving all of that snack related content appears in...less than half of the episodes. There’s still a pretty high level of focus on comedy but I thought it was quite a bit weaker than the previous season. I really felt that Hotaru was carrying the comedy last season as well, so her being absent kind of knocks the wind out of it. There are new amusing characters, mainly Hajime, who definitely bring things up but they’re not enough to make up for the lack of Hotaru.While the focus on comedy is still pretty high, it’s less than the previous season I would say. What actually gets focused on a good amount this season is character and relationship development. While I’m not entirely opposed to that in concept, I don’t think the implementation here is worth the change. The first season was unique in such a way that I think it was appealing to a pretty limited audience but I think it was quite good at what it was trying to do. This season is a much more standard type of anime and thus I think it has more mainstream appeal, but it’s simply not all that good at what it’s trying to do. I think the largest focus here was on Kokonotsu actually tackling the question that was brought up at the beginning of the series in deciding what exactly it is that he wants to do, be a manga artist or snack shop owner, while also taking into account his feelings for Hotaru and how they play into that.Unfortunately, I don’t think it did all that good of a job at that. There is some development sure, but it feels kind of minimal and I think the show simply didn’t have enough time to do enough. After all, while this season is 12 episodes, they’re half size episodes so it’s more like six episodes. The first season didn’t do much so all the development this season pretty much has to stand on it’s own. So it tries it’s best and there certainly is some development, but in the end it feels like things moved so little that it doesn’t really feel like there was much of a point. The ending felt pretty solid and felt like it set things up to continue well in a variety of different ways and was thus pretty solid in that regard, but this season in and of itself felt like not enough to really do anything.The art and animation are okay. This season was done by a different studio form the first and there’s a different style to things. I prefer the style from the first season, though that may just be a bias do to being used to it. The OP and ED are decent enough in terms of visuals and audio. The soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable. less than half of the episodes.

The soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable.', '""Spoiler alert""  But the things I say are really obvious so your fun won\'t get ruined after reading my comment.This show seriously is under-rated.The episode length is half to that of season 1, but the fun-fact is the fun is twice as compared to season 1.The entry of new characters and the ghosting of Hotaru were really needed and the disappearance of Hotaru turned out to be good rather than bad.Kokonotsu character really turned out to be super awesome at the end.The owner of new convenience store was obviously related to Hotaru and it wasn\'t the twist at all as it was down right...obvious.The mystery like who ordered online from dagashi shop is still a mystery and the hospitalized person identity was really needed to be disclosed.Over-all a great show and it really made me laugh. obvious.The mystery like who ordered online from dagashi shop is still a mystery and the hospitalized person identity was really needed to be disclosed.Over-all a great show and it really made me laugh.', 'I\'ll start with my initial skepticism. I love the first season. I love it a lot! From the pleasant art style and art quality, to the voice acting, to the slice of life, character design, especially the character designs! I\'m rather picky when it comes to waifus but I absolutely love both Saya and Hotaru. I don\'t normally like ""childhood lover"" type characters but Saya is definitely a sweet pick as well.Anyway, getting back to my skepticism. First, the change of art style and art quality from S1 to this S2. I understand that the studio got changed but one can easily judge that the...artistic change is a completely downgrade. On S1, Hotaru\'s hair have more details, but now on S2, Hotaru\'s hair has barely any details at all. The animation, the backgrounds, and overall cinematography is downgraded. Even the fanservice is downgraded in the rest of the 2nd season as well. The decrease in screentime even made me more skeptical. Not only that the art is downgraded, the screentime as well.But since I love the first season, I thought of just pushing/forcing myself to continue after the first episode of S2. Slowly, the I grew to like this 2nd season. And after finishing it, I think I can say I love the 2nd season more than the 1st season.Yes pretty much everything that I loved on the first season got downgraded, but the 2nd season nailed the one aspect that the 1st season lacked: plot.Season 2 actually has a better plot. Every thought I got from Season 1 is somehow ""wrapped"" on this second season. While it\'s a bit of a letdown that Saya didn\'t get much arc, the introduction of Hajime is a major one as well. Hajime is just a sweet interesting girl that I can root for Kokonotsu as well (if it\'s even a possibility)Since a Season 3 is almost absolutely impossible now, I guess I\'ll just finish the manga. I\'m very curious if Kokonotsu really ends up with Hotaru or Saya or even Hajime.Overall, definitely a decent anime for a niched audience. Highly recommended if you got some spare time. artistic change is a completely downgrade. On S1, Hotaru\'s hair have more details, but now on S2, Hotaru\'s hair has barely any details at all.

Highly recommended if you got some spare time.', 'Before I start, let it be known that I do not think this 2nd season of Dagashi Kashi is by no stretch of the word bad. I actually have a lot of positive things to say about it.For starters, I like the new characters introduced this series. Hajime is an interesting character to add to the roster since she has an air of total obliviousness to her and is really likeable, Beniyutaka is an interesting idea of introducing a rival to the Dagashi store and without wanting to spoil the revelation at the end of the series, his connection with one of the established characters...could have been a good way to shake up the formula.But notice I said ""Could have been"", rather than ""Was"".I didn\'t think I\'d last long with getting to what I thought was the biggest problem with this anime. It was a missed potential.The first series was an episodic comedy romp that just tried to make you laugh and feel good about life and all it\'s eccentricity. The 2nd series on the other hand tries to be more serialised and tell a recurring story by introducing new ideas that could give it a bit more depth. But all these components are completely lost in the execution.The episodes of series 2 are significantly shorter than the first, only being at 10-12 minutes tops rather than S1\'s 25 minute run time. This isn\'t a big deal considering the stories of the first series tended to only last that long anyway, the shorter run time becomes a problem with series 2 because it\'s trying to be something more than the first series.The stories told in series 2 are way less episodic such as the continuing development of Kokonutso and Hotaru\'s relationship, the idea of a rival store opening up opposite the Dagashiya and Kokonutso\'s attempt at balancing his manga life goal with also running the store on his own while his father recovers in hospital (which by the way really made Kokonutso\'s inherent skill as a store business manager really blossom this time round).But all these interesting ideas are squandered on a series that has way less run time to fully develop them and most story threads are left unravelled with the series ending on a cliffhanger that is still unresolved 3 years later.Series 2 felt like it was building up to something, it introduces all these new interesting ideas in a really rapid fashion, but without a 3rd season to show us how these ideas can develop the setting and characters further, they just feel empty to see in action. Hotaru as a character bounces off the original cast personalities brilliantly and we never see her interact with Hajime, who is way more oblivious to Dagashi and so it could have been fun seeing her react to the candy-loving Hotaru in interesting ways. Same goes for new rival character, Beniyutaka the owner of the store\'s new rival business, which again without wishing to spoil, when the revelation of these two characters is revealed, it felt like it was a build up without a pay off.Hotaru herself doesn\'t even appear in the series for half of the episodes, and while I don\'t want to sound like a Hotaru fanboy complaining that his waifu has been written out of the show and therefore it\'s wrong and ruined forever, her absence is used as a means to further develop Kokonutso\'s arc further in a similar manner to Kylo Ren and Snoke in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. That didn\'t stop the animation studio putting her face all over the marketing still. The very promo poster for this series has her stood at the front of everybody right next to Hajime suggesting they both get time together but their on-screen interaction lasts all of, what, 12 seconds? So it seemed like a tacky way of advertising a cult anime to rake in as much views as possible before realisation struck that the story was misleading. Or maybe I\'m just being a bit biased.Now I know technically the series ends properly in the manga and the anime is supposed to advertise that primarily. But I can\'t get a hold of that manga so easily so for me, this is where the Dagashi story ends (should a series 3 never materialise in the future), on an unresolved cliffhanger having developed a really strong connection with all these characters and just yearning for more.So while there are loads of moments in Series 2 that could even technically surpass the original series, I feel like I can only give a cautious recommendation of it due to how unfinished the anime now feels after this 2nd series. Had Dagashi Kashi just been one short but sweet comedy series, I.E. Series 1 standing alone, it could have forever gone down as a real hidden gem of an anime series.But as it stands, it feels like if Empire Strikes Back had flopped at the cinema and the entire Star Wars franchise had ended on a pessimistic cliffhanger.I\'m using loads of Star Wars analogies lately I\'ve noticed... could have been a good way to shake up the formula.But notice I said ""Could have been"", rather than ""Was"".I didn\'t think I\'d last long with getting to what I thought was the biggest problem with this anime.

They do provide some small nuggets in most episodes, but they take a secondary place behind an ill-made attempt at turning this anime into a slice of life story when there's really nothing interesting going on.More importantly, with only five characters in the first season, they really couldn't afford to lose two of them for this second season. Nonetheless,that's exactly what they did, and while they brought in two new supporting characters to take...their place, the absence of the familiar missing characters hangs over this season like a shroud.The final episode is pure chaos - whereas the first season's finale seemed clearly designed with a second season in mind, this season's finale looks like they were planning a third season, realized at the last minute they weren't going to get one, and tried to cram together a bunch of unrelated story lines into the final episode.

Digimon Frontier: Ornismon Fukkatsu!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3031/Digimon_Frontier__Ornismon_Fukkatsu,"[""Wow, this is an old story type used for centuries in story's and fairy tales.Our adventure's get into a certain city, were two kinds of Digimon live, the Beast type and the Human type, both have been in a feud for years.

You can tell the anime studio was making a full-lenght film but there had to cut stuff for whatever reason, hence why there only kept the key parts of the plot but without any character development or worldbuilding that could have improved the story.Kinda of a shame since the Human-Beast War was barely touch upon in the actual series, it made me wanting more.While is not a terrible movie is not something you´re gonna missed either.Also what´s up with those Carnival floats? Are those Digimon too? This OVA left...so many questions. so many questions.']"

This was my very first experience ever watching ANYTHING in a foreign language and reading sub-titles. The year was 1999 and I was 11 years old. My local comic store sold bootleg VHS tapes made by the Chinese Triad, including all the DBZ movies. I bought this movie because it had an epic cover art slapped on it that actually had nothing to do with the movie. The Chinese bootleggers just put completely random cover art on all their DBZ VHS...tapes. For most of you, this was one of the shittiest DBZ movies, but for me it was an epic experience!The movie starts with Android 17 decapitating Gero with a roundhouse kick, which was completely edited out of the US version. For some reason, the movie actually adds a copious amount of blood that wasn\'t in the main series version of that scene. Having never watched anime ""uncut"" my 11 year old mind was blown by the shower of blood when Gero gets his head smashed! I mention in some of my other reviews that I rented and bought a bunch of shitty late 80s and early 90s OVAs to bask in the manly violence. THIS was actually the movie that started that path. I put up with bullshit like Genocyber, MD Geist, and all the others like a drug addict trying to chase down that first ""high"" that you never quite feel again. This movie has ZERO plot, but the fights are and fast and furious, the animation is good for DBZ standards, and it is quite enjoyable for any DBZ fan.Even better than the violence was the amazing soundtrack! I had never heard the Shunsuke Kikuchi soundtrack until this movie and only experienced the US soundtrack by good ol\' Bruce.HOLY SHIT! This music was SO much better that it made this shitty movie worth re-watching again and again just to experience it. Youtube didn\'t exist and bootleg VHS was really the only way to listen to the glorious original soundtrack! I\'m not sure if it was ever uploaded to Napster and my computer would have been WAY too slow to download it anyways. The epic music for the battles, the badass character themes for Piccolo and Vegeta, and the absolutely beautiful song that plays when Goku uses the Spirit Bomb (Genki Dama for you fucking Weaboos!) Music plays a massive role in how much we enjoy movies, even though we often don\'t realize the impact that it has. Imagine Star Wars with a shitty soundtrack! It would be a good film, but the experience simply would NOT be the same! I didn\'t fully realize would a monumental difference soundtrack could make until watching this movie and hearing the difference between the Japanese and US soundtracks to DBZ. In that regard, this movie actually was an important step in my development as a film critic by opening my eyes to that fact.Did I rate this film objectively and completely free of nostalgic bias? Hell no I didn\'t! I\'m only human, and we are all susceptible to nostalgia. Knowing this allows me to have empathy and avoid becoming quite as bitter and condescending as some other critics. I may feel a twinge of anger when someone rates Mirai Nikk or Black Lagoon a 10/10, but if that was my first violent anime, my first sub, my first introduction to a Japanese soundtrack, and I watched it at age 12, I would probably have done the same thing.

I decided to download some of the Dragon Ball Z movies partly out of curiosity and partly to watch something that wouldn\'t require much concentration when I\'m eating dinner. This is the first one that I watched. Having seen it, I have to say it did not disappoint. In other words, it\'s as bad as what I was expecting and did indeed provide something to watch that require near zero concentration.""Super Android 13"" has lame jokes, bad voice acting, and worse...of all, a storyline that could have been written by simpletons: Robots programmed to kill Goku. That\'s it. Seriously! It\'s a pretty poor effort even for an action film. There\'s practically no character development (or even characterisation) to speak of, and barely any dialogue, just continuous battling.  But since it\'s an action anime, it would have been redeemable if the action is even half decent. Alas, it isn\'t. It\'s ridiculously unimaginative, and follows the usual hero keeps powering up till he wins patterns with impressive faithfulness. If there\'s anything that I hadn\'t seen before, it\'s the ultra-fast-exchange-of-blows style battles... but the movie used it so much (like 90% of the time) that by the time it finished I was already bored of it.*sigh* I can see why this ""movie"" is only 45 minutes long.

Androids 13, 14 and...15. That\'s it.Apparently Gero\'s Super Computer makes pretty much all the decisions for him as Gero was killed at the start of the movie after setting 17 and 18 free.This movie features some interesting things. While 14 and 15 aren\'t very memorable, we learn quiet a bit about their personality as they look for Goku in the shopping district. Goku and Trunks were pretty much handy capped forced to lure the enemy to a different location.It\'s not the first time a battle in an icy area being featured, but it was a nice scenery change since in the previous movies that area wasn\'t fully taken advantage off. Not that this movie does much with it. But they do make some cool ways for character to enter the battle.The visuals and overall action was good. I enjoyed Vegeta vs. 14 and Trunks vs 15. While their end in similar ways, it was still enjoyable to see. The music and animation is also very fluid.Android 13 as a character started ok. But after his transformation he just grunted and said ""Son Goku!"" like he is Broli from Second Coming or something.Besides the points mentioned earlier, the main antagonists transformation just isn\'t believable. He starts of as a slim guy with long white hair. But absorbing 2 cores and 2 chips of his fallen comrades allow him to become a blue Hulk with Vegeta\'s hairstyle, orange hair and yellow eyes. He also lost his eyebrows. There is no foundation in design that justifies why he looked like that nor why he changed that drastically.And his power also seems pretty random like all Androids introduced so far, minus Cell. The reason Cell worked is because he was made of the components and knowledge of the strongest fights, capable of draining energy of other beings and transforms by absorbing other androids who stabilize himself. Also his transformation felt more organic. While Android 13 doesn\'t feel like he deserves to be strong enough to fight a Super Saiyan.The fight against Android 13 also felt very boring. Every character that tried to fight him did the same thing. Much a few times before being blasted away. Sure, it wasn\'t all boring since there are some iconic scenes like the finale and the infamous punch in the balls, but these are very minimal and can\'t make up for the rest.Btw, what happened to Android 17 and 18? They appeared at the start of the movie and where completely gone. I assume they joined a skater gang or something and enjoy life.One thing that bothered me since I watched this movie is Android 13\'s technique. That weird red ball that can apparently destroy half the planet... Is that suppose to be impressive or terrifying after characters beat up several characters that can one shot a planet casually? It\'s just stupid.I feel this movie would have better worked as a filler arc. Like instead of a movie, we could have a filler arc between the 3 year time before the Androids arrive in which the weaker group of Z fighters try to locate Gero with the Dragon Balls only to end up fighting weaker Androids that cause already lots of problem. This could be great simply because we didn\'t see Yamcha, Tien and Chaotzu put their training into work.Overall the movie is decent. Bombastic finale, some good action, good soundtracks and animation. But the characters are pretty much forgettable like most of the fight against Android 13. And the cliches as well as most of the secondary cast being worthless like Gohan, Krillin and Piccolo. 15.

Sure, it wasn\'t all boring since there are some iconic scenes like the finale and the infamous punch in the balls, but these are very minimal and can\'t make up for the rest.Btw, what happened to Android 17 and 18? They appeared at the start of the movie and where completely gone. I assume they joined a skater gang or something and enjoy life.One thing that bothered me since I watched this movie is Android 13\'s technique. That weird red ball that can apparently destroy half the planet... Is that suppose to be impressive or terrifying after characters beat up several characters that can one shot a planet casually? It\'s just stupid.I feel this movie would have better worked as a filler arc. Like instead of a movie, we could have a filler arc between the 3 year time before the Androids arrive in which the weaker group of Z fighters try to locate Gero with the Dragon Balls only to end up fighting weaker Androids that cause already lots of problem. This could be great simply because we didn\'t see Yamcha, Tien and Chaotzu put their training into work.Overall the movie is decent. Bombastic finale, some good action, good soundtracks and animation. But the characters are pretty much forgettable like most of the fight against Android 13. And the cliches as well as most of the secondary cast being worthless like Gohan, Krillin and Piccolo.', ""I'm not sure if this one was an actual improvement or if I'm getting Stockholm Syndrome, but after two fairly dismal Cooler movies, Super Android 13 is a little bit better, with some enjoyable moments despite, as is now solidified as permanent apparently, the exact same plot as all the other movies.Yadda yadda yadda some bad dudes wanna kill Goku or whatever. What I enjoy is that the first half of the movie takes place in an urban city. The Dragon Ball world shines when it shows off its wacky cartoon world, and I love any time they spend in cities, where tech is...futuristic and all the buildings are domes, but everyone operates as if it's the early 1990s and our POV characters are always a bunch of weirdos in martial arts costumes that everyone eyes suspiciously. Combined with some better fights than the past couple movies, and it's a good time-waster.Though... reaaaaaally iffy on that kinda-blackface robot and I feel like it might be a disservice to give this one more than a 4/10 when there's that there. I've also read that the English dub version of this gives the robot more lines (in the Japanese version he only says about five words the whole movie), and they're spoken with a stereotypical African-American accent. If true... that's... not OK.... But I don't want to watch the dub to find out so whatever.This one comes SO CLOSE to fitting in the series timeline! Weirdly, it would take place BEFORE the previous movie, because of Trunks being there. There's a good gap in the story where Cell has not yet appeared but Androids 16-18 are still on the loose, and three more kinda-weak Androids suddenly appearing and getting the shit kicked out of them could fit, though it'd be a little weird. Sadly, the thing that probably kills it is that Gohan is preparing to enter into summer cram school classes... In a worldwide search for some possibly-genocidal robots, it doesn't seem very likely that the cast would take a break to go shopping at the mall, either. Curse the extremely tight timeline constraints that Akira Toriyama gave his comic books! futuristic and all the buildings are domes, but everyone operates as if it's the early 1990s and our POV characters are always a bunch of weirdos in martial arts costumes that everyone eyes suspiciously.

Well, the other 35 minutes has convinced me the other way.Let\'s just jump into the review, Super 13 is a non-canon movie, meaning it is anime original, and 13 doesn\'t appear in DBZ manga....My positives from 13:1, Art and Sound are in DBZ coat.2, Android 13 is one of the better villains from 1st seven DBZ movies, and he does and says nothing, good job.My neutrals from 13:The fights weren\'t entertaining, it wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t good either.My negatives from 13:1, Intro: I swear if this movie took the pointless intro and invested that time into villains, it could have been better. Android 13 should be the main focus of this movie, not our usual MCs.2, How the hell Z fighters don\'t notice Android 14, 15 attacks on the city, we see numerous loud explosions, and somehow Goku or anyone from Z fighters doesn\'t notice them until they destroy the restaurant they\'re in.3, I can kinda get it with Goku, but why is Trunks holding his Super Saiyan transformation back. In the anime, we\'ve seen on many occasions that Trunks never begin slow, and he always jumps into a Super Saiyan. This just seems so out of character. Same thing with Vegeta, but I am willing to overlook him as he wasn\'t Super Saiyan just for 1st 15 seconds of his fight, speaking of which...4, How did Vegeta get on the North pole? Did he notice Goku\'s power level, or did somebody called him? Same thing with Piccolo. I know he trains in these parts of the world, but with an Android crisis, why is he there?5, Gohan is useless yet again.6, Genki Dama solves all your problems in DBZ movies.7, 90% of the movie Goku and squad are getting beaten down, just to kill villains in an instant, anti-climatic finish.Summary:Super 13 is again a mediocre DBZ movie with some annoying issues. I was quite close to giving it 3/10.Final Rating: 4/10. It\'s bad. Characters do strange decisions. Fights end anti-climatic without any joy from victory, long and pointless intro.

Devil Survivor 2 The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16512/Devil_Survivor_2_The_Animation,"['Neon Genesis Evangeli- I mean, Devil Survivor 2 the Animation, is a great example of an adaptation from a video game to television gone wrong. Having beaten the video game myself, this anime adaptation was a severe disappointment from start to finish in many off-putting ways. The writing in this anime is childish as it constantly uses well-known clichés, character archetypes who never develop past their cardboard cut-out selves, spills melodrama all over the floor, and everything feels rushed and unconvincing. It is rather, to put it simply, a monstrosity. Now, the story of the video game wasn’t exactly original nor was it interesting, so...I wasn’t expecting the anime to have a storyline to be on a whole different tier. However the anime definitely could had improved on the overarching story in various ways. Unfortunately, the anime never really improves anything throughout its entirety and leaves off a trail of poor writing everywhere.The story starts out when a colossal, unnatural disaster hits Japan which pushes civilians and society into desperation, as any major disaster in real life would. Soon, invaders called Septentriones appear and humans must defeat every one of them using demons they can summon in order to survive. Wait a minute, doesn’t this premise sound a bit familiar? Devil Survivor 2 borrows a lot of the same concept from Neon Genesis Evangelion. However the video game managed to blend in its own traditional and original aspects of the Megami Tensei franchise, (Devil Survivor belongs to the Megami Tensei franchise), thereby allowing the game to hold onto its charm. The same can’t be said for the anime adaptation. Unlike the video game, the anime sheds off every inch of strategy in every battle, and replaces it with random attacks that seem to serve no purpose other than for eye-candy and to weakly move the plot forward. The result is mainly dull action and boring battle scenes.One of the first problems that appear in the anime is that it never really genuinely shows how such a monumental impact is affecting the civilians and society. In Devil Survivor 2’s case, world-building is essential in order to allow the viewer to sink in the necessary details so that important aspects such as pacing and plot and character development feel natural. World-building in this anime’s case could had provided more details on the nature of the post-apocalyptic setting, what the order of society is currently like, how various civilians are holding up, the government’s reaction, etc. Unfortunately, the viewer gets none of this in a genuine manner but gets instead various plot devices that jump out of nowhere which feel jarring, unnatural, and in certain cases, make for unconvincing writing in both story and character-wise.Enter Hibiki, the main protagonist. He encompasses everything that many other battle shounen protagonists there ever were. He is the hero who jumps straight into action without rational thought. He is the hero who has to save everyone simply because he has the power to summon stronger demons than anyone else. By the way, why Hibiki has been granted this special power while almost everyone else has been left with much weaker demons is never explained until the last remaining few episodes. Even then, the reasoning for this special power is as cliché as it can get. The unexplained unique powers he acquires acts as plenty of plot devices, as Hibiki manages to defeat foes left and right with the help of his powerful demons, and without any convincing struggles. To hurt the writing further, for the first few episodes, this power is the only reason that drives him to become the typical hero that he is and jumps into every battle he can get his hands on. When Hibiki lacks such motivation for his heroic behaviors, he comes off as a very unconvincing character and becomes hard for the viewer to sympathize or understand with. Other characters beside Hibiki also never properly develop, and this makes for much unfruitful viewing containing melodrama and rushed events. In fact, the majority of the characters are hardly even realized, it’s as if they were put into the anime simply to fill up more cast and time and amount to nothing more.On top of this, well-known clichés pretty much plague many parts of the anime. One notable cliché and theme used throughout the anime is… the power of emotions. Yes, screaming out loud while also screaming cliché lines can save the day in this anime.Devil Survivor 2 the Animation was very disappointing. There is not much of a single redeeming aspect about this anime. Cliches, bland characters, overdramatic scenes due to poor development, weak narratives and overall plot really plague this anime, ultimately coming off childish and dull. And to those who played the game and hoped for a faithful adaptation in terms of story, you will be disappointed. To make it worse for the video game fans as well as for the rest of the Megami Tensei franchise fans, a lot of the Megami Tensei aspects seen in this anime are terribly realized. The anime breaks the laws of the MegaTen universe, such as how Hibiki can somehow summon Byakko as his first demon in the first episode, a high-level demon in the video game. It was also disappointing how the Demon Fusion was actually introduced in the last episode, and it didn’t help that it was intertwined with horrifying writing. Also, did I mention that Jungo is the most awkward character I’ve ever seen in any anime?The video game is very fun and addicting.

This adaptation can leave one with the impression of the exact opposite.', 'I was very excited when I heard a Devil Survivor 2 anime was in the works, having recently played and loved the DS game on which it\'s based. Watching it now, I can say that my feelings for the anime are overall good, if somewhat more mixed than I had anticipated. I\'m certainly enjoying it, but there are a few places it seems to fall a little flat.The anime looks and sounds great. The art is solid; the characters and demons look exactly as they do in the game and the animation is never not satisfying in the action sequences. The voice actors all fit...the characters, who were unvoiced in the game, well. Nothing too jarring. The music doesn\'t do anything wrong and the OP and ED are both pleasant if not overwhelmingly memorable.The story and the characters are where it falters some, and it\'s largely because it has too much to do in too little time. The game on which it\'s based is a 50 or so plus hour RPG that takes multiple playthroughs to explore everything. To fit it all into 13 24 minute episodes means gutting out so much of the build up and character development that the game had going for it. This makes the characters seem rather lifeless compared to how energetic and enjoyable they are in the game and also limits the scope of the story some. Devil Survivor 2 could be a surprisingly lighthearted and often humorous game, something that made the stark revelations about the fate of the world and characters hold more gravity. Without the time to build all that, the story becomes somewhat deflating. It\'s just not as much fun as it should be.I love the characters in Devil Survivor 2, and seeing them fully animated is a lot of fun. Without something like the Fate system in the game to develop them and make their bonds with the main character mean something, a lot of what makes them fun is left out though. It\'s not just that though; the anime changed a few things it probably shouldn\'t have. Joe, who is a part of the group since day one in the game and provides so much refreshing whimsy is reduced to a minor supporting role. Io seems completely different; she smiled a lot more and just came across as a lot less weak. Other characters who can get fully developed in the game are simply killed off prematurely.Worst somehow is Hibiki though, surprisingly. He was your ordinary silent protagonist in the game, but how events unfolded did depend on how he acted. In my first playthrough he never missed an opportunity to joke around, was brash, aloof and quick to side with JP\'s. The anime version could be different from that though, and probably picked the worst way possible to play him, reducing him to your average mopey shounen protagonist. To make matters worse, the anime decided to make him more powerful than his friends and the other characters from the start. In the game, he and his friends are noticed because they\'re resourceful and because it\'s a Strategy RPG and he\'s able to use his intelligence to win difficult fights and become stronger for them. Having him become the focus from the start because he\'s ""the one"" seems much more hollow and moreover pushes his friends more out of focus than they should be, especially since they were the focus of the game.All that said, the anime is certainly not torture for fans of the game. No, it\'s actually quite enjoyable to see all the familiar demons pop up and fight. It\'s especially satisfying to see how the very familiar Septentrion fights, the boss fights in the game, are handled. It\'s not difficult to enjoy the anime, even as I see where it goes wrong and some of the places where it decides to diverge from the game\'s story are interesting.If you haven\'t played Devil Survivor 2, I would definitely recommend that over the anime. The anime on it own isn\'t bad though. For a non-fan, I\'d probably deduct 1-3 points from my overall score, depending on tastes. The characters aren\'t going to come across as what they could be not having the time they needed to grow, and the same goes for a lot of the plot development. Still, there\'s a lot to like, I think. The animation is nice, the action satisfying and the core plot intriguing enough. I\'ve yet to be bored with it at the least.Update: Having seen the series to completion now, I had to dock a point from my initial score. I still think the anime looks great and has more than enough moments to justify a watch, but it really just kept making increasingly poor decisions in regards to story progression. There came a point where I found it harder to separate out the experience I had with the anime from that of the game and it cut into my overall enjoyment. Characters and even whole important themes and events from the game are discarded with increasing frequency just leaving it feeling fractured, while the mood is kept more grim than it needed to be, the amusing sequences of the game cut short, skipped over or drained of fun. Meanwhile, the cool stuff it does do slows down considerably--the last few Septentrion fights aren\'t as interesting or involving and for some reason the show decides to keep the number of unique demons we see in action very limited.I said before that fans would enjoy this, but I don\'t know anymore. If you can effectively separate out the good experience of the game as you watch, the anime can still be rewarding with the right expectations. If not, I can see this being a quite frustrating watch. And for non-fans, who don\'t know how the characters should have properly been developed, the experience is still probably worse. I almost want to say a seven is being generous, but at the same time I\'m glad a great game like Devil Survivor 2 got an anime adaption.

I almost want to say a seven is being generous, but at the same time I\'m glad a great game like Devil Survivor 2 got an anime adaption. I just really wish it had been a better one.', 'I had my share of problems with Persona 4\'s anime adaptation. Actually, I had a truckload of problems with it. Scratch that, I was finding stuff to complain about every single episode. And yet, I look back on it and think ""oh wow they actually didn\'t do that badly, considering they condensed a 70-hour RPG into 25 episodes"". Indeed, Devil Survivor 2: The Animation served to put Persona 4 into perspective for me. In spite of all its issues, it really didn\'t do that much wrong. The story was well developed, the characters all got their moments to shine, and there was still time left...over for fluffy social linkage.Yeah, uh, DeSu 2 doesn\'t do any of that. What we have here is the boring parts of Mirai Nikki with the basic premise of Neon Genesis Evangelion tacked on, infused with Megami Tensei lore. P4 wasn\'t exactly a paragon of originality, but the tricks it played to stay above the typical worked well. Here, however, everything is strictly by-the-numbers. Chosen one, blah blah blah, pointless friends, sexy rival, blah blah blah, end of the world, boss battles, mysterious otherworldly ally, this has literally all been done before. Even worse, this show is as predictable as it is boring. I could see all the plot ""twists"" coming, -especially- the ending. Oh, wow, the ending. Don\'t even try to pretend you were shocked. It was so, so obvious.One of my biggest problems with this is the cast. If your name isn\'t Hibiki Kuze, you\'re shit out of luck. This show doesn\'t care about you, and you won\'t get to do anything, ever. The only other characters to get any screentime are Hibiki\'s two friends, his sexy rival, and the mysterious otherwordly ally. Everyone else is mere decoration, which is extremely sad, because the minor characters happen to also be the most interesting ones. I was charmed by Jungo and Airi from the first moment they appeared, but ""Jungo = chef, likes cats; Airi = kind of a bitch"" is the only thing we ever get to know about them here. This is a huge problem, because when the show starts killing characters off and treats it as a huge deal, I was unable to care. They weren\'t killing -people-, they were killing concepts. None of these characters were developed enough for their deaths to have any sort of impact. Speaking of development, though, not even Hibiki gets that. Indeed, his only privilege is the vast amounts of screentime. He starts the show as a generic, personality-free protagonist, and ends it the exact same way. The protagonist, Yu Narukami, was one of the things the P4 anime did extremely well, so seeing them utterly fail here was kind of sad. Perhaps 13 episodes just wasn\'t enough for such a large cast of characters. Wait, perhaps? There\'s no ""perhaps"" here.I suppose the show being short kinda starts making up for it being incredibly boring. Hey, let\'s be positive some more! Electropop magician kz of one-person music ""group"" livetune composed the opening, and he has, of course, delivered a total jam once again. It may not be a complete banger like his other op of the season, OreImo\'s Reunion, but more kz is good kz. I cherish kz\'s compositions. On a similar note, the ending song (Be by Song Riders) isn\'t bad, either. Both songs eventually found their way into my playlist, where they both got their heavy rotation. Oh and the animation is kinda nice I guess.Let\'s have a bottom line, a line at the bottom. Devil Survivor 2 is boring. Really boring. Uninteresting and bland, even, and I can\'t think of this as anything other than a failure. I suppose it\'s a bit better than Mirai Nikki, one of my least favourite anime of all time, on account of this just being dull, as opposed to face-breakingly bad.Although, technically, isn\'t making a bad impact better than making no impact at all? Mirai Nikki -did- have some absolutely fantastic stupidity...Er, yeah. To close this review, I can\'t recommend this to anyone. To fans of the game, this is a shitty adaptation. Don\'t bother. To fans of the genre, Evangelion is there for a reason. To fans of SMT, just rewatch Persona 4. To everyone else, this is one boring piece of work. I suppose the best way to describe it would be ""mediocre"", but it\'s -so- mediocre that it crosses into being god-awful. After all, aren\'t the worst shows the ones you can\'t even enjoy for their badness?Your anime\'s death clip has been uploaded. This outcome cannot be avoided. Have a nice day! over for fluffy social linkage.Yeah, uh, DeSu 2 doesn\'t do any of that. What we have here is the boring parts of Mirai Nikki with the basic premise of Neon Genesis Evangelion tacked on, infused with Megami Tensei lore. P4 wasn\'t exactly a paragon of originality, but the tricks it played to stay above the typical worked well. Here, however, everything is strictly by-the-numbers. Chosen one, blah blah blah, pointless friends, sexy rival, blah blah blah, end of the world, boss battles, mysterious otherworldly ally, this has literally all been done before. Even worse, this show is as predictable as it is boring. I could see all the plot ""twists"" coming, -especially- the ending. Oh, wow, the ending. Don\'t even try to pretend you were shocked. It was so, so obvious.One of my biggest problems with this is the cast. If your name isn\'t Hibiki Kuze, you\'re shit out of luck. This show doesn\'t care about you, and you won\'t get to do anything, ever. The only other characters to get any screentime are Hibiki\'s two friends, his sexy rival, and the mysterious otherwordly ally. Everyone else is mere decoration, which is extremely sad, because the minor characters happen to also be the most interesting ones. I was charmed by Jungo and Airi from the first moment they appeared, but ""Jungo = chef, likes cats; Airi = kind of a bitch"" is the only thing we ever get to know about them here. This is a huge problem, because when the show starts killing characters off and treats it as a huge deal, I was unable to care. They weren\'t killing -people-, they were killing concepts. None of these characters were developed enough for their deaths to have any sort of impact. Speaking of development, though, not even Hibiki gets that. Indeed, his only privilege is the vast amounts of screentime. He starts the show as a generic, personality-free protagonist, and ends it the exact same way. The protagonist, Yu Narukami, was one of the things the P4 anime did extremely well, so seeing them utterly fail here was kind of sad. Perhaps 13 episodes just wasn\'t enough for such a large cast of characters. Wait, perhaps? There\'s no ""perhaps"" here.I suppose the show being short kinda starts making up for it being incredibly boring. Hey, let\'s be positive some more! Electropop magician kz of one-person music ""group"" livetune composed the opening, and he has, of course, delivered a total jam once again. It may not be a complete banger like his other op of the season, OreImo\'s Reunion, but more kz is good kz. I cherish kz\'s compositions. On a similar note, the ending song (Be by Song Riders) isn\'t bad, either. Both songs eventually found their way into my playlist, where they both got their heavy rotation. Oh and the animation is kinda nice I guess.Let\'s have a bottom line, a line at the bottom. Devil Survivor 2 is boring. Really boring. Uninteresting and bland, even, and I can\'t think of this as anything other than a failure. I suppose it\'s a bit better than Mirai Nikki, one of my least favourite anime of all time, on account of this just being dull, as opposed to face-breakingly bad.Although, technically, isn\'t making a bad impact better than making no impact at all? Mirai Nikki -did- have some absolutely fantastic stupidity...Er, yeah. To close this review, I can\'t recommend this to anyone. To fans of the game, this is a shitty adaptation. Don\'t bother. To fans of the genre, Evangelion is there for a reason. To fans of SMT, just rewatch Persona 4. To everyone else, this is one boring piece of work. I suppose the best way to describe it would be ""mediocre"", but it\'s -so- mediocre that it crosses into being god-awful.

Have a nice day!', ""You know you're in for a ride when you read that first line of the synopsis and realize that the world is about to end thanks to some mysterious invaders. These invaders are called Septentriones want one thing: your life. It all takes place on the holy day of Sunday where the lives of the main characters are in danger. Why? Because the world is about to end and their only chance now is to survive. That's right....Welcome to the world of Devil Survivor 2, where survival is a word that you'll be hearing more than meets the eye.The series is based off the video...game, Devil Survivor 2 of the same name. It is based off of the Megami Tensei so expect some similar themes to its other products such as Persona 4. Otherwise, this series is not a sequel despite being labeled seemingly as such. Rather, Devil Survivor 2: The Animation is an animated series that brings out survival at its finest. Hmm, or does it....Taken from a survival standpoint, the series begins off with a strong promise. In fact, the subway station and the threat of being exterminated after a faithful event seemingly sets the course on its scale. It is on rail as we can tell that the mysterious invaders known as the Septentriones aren't messing around. As a matter of fact, anything coming in contact with them will likely end up a quick journey to the next world; aka death. It presents it visually well too. The way the characters panics in the beginning as well as the deaths of innocent people makes the series seem gruesome. It's not realistic but keeps up with its pace in terms of 'survival'. It holds true to the extent of its main tagline that features two prominent words:Let's Survive.The series follows main male protagonist Hibiki Kuze. The guy is seemingly who attends a normal high school with his normal friends until that not-so-normal day. To me, the character seems just like any other typical boy with no special qualities of notice. Well, except perhaps by that distracting hood he often wears with the funny ears, he is just a student. However, it is noticeable that the boy is fearless against certain situations and is able to make crucial decisions that can potentially lead to important outcomes. Then, there are his friends Io Nitta, the school beauty who comes with a package of both brain and looks. Unfortunately, she too gets caught with the events from the beginning of the story. But hey, friends can conquer all right? Wrong. Well, not entirely they need a little help from the supernatural. This comes in the form of cell phones. If you think today's cell phones are flashy with the latest gadgets, just get a load of the ones in this series.The cell phones from this series comes with a special feature you won't find anywhere. That feature is the prominent device known as a demon APP. Luckily, this APP isn't just for decoration but an important tool to fight off the mysterious Septentriones. Thus, the APP functions as both a tool and weapon for the protagonists to use. They are able to summon demons for assistance, creatures who are not just badass looking but also packs powerful abilities that makes the characters awe of their appearances.As for the demons themselves, they seemingly serve for no other purpose other than obeying their master's commands. In other words, this isn't' a friend/partner relationship between the summoners but rather as master/servant. At the same time, these demons are designed in the way that shows off how powerful they are. Take for example, Byakko the demon that Hibiki commands. He represents the ferocity of his nature through his sabertooth-like appearance. On the other hand, the Septentriones are designed to reflect their strange nature. Most of them are difficult to relate with in terms of realistic nature because of their odd appearances. They don't seem to have any personalities but rather surrounded by mystery. What we do know is that they are the executioners of mankind. Their appearances resembles otherworldly beings being perhaps comparable to Vividred Operation's Alones or Eureka Seven: AO's Secrets. In other words, they serve as the most mysterious factor of the series as they threaten the very existence of humanity.The series takes off with a good start but quickly loses its interest after its memorable first episode. The premise is easy to follow with the key word 'survival' being a central part of the series. However, it's the pacing that causes the problem here. Unless you're a fan of the original game series, it's quick to pick out what happens and its upcoming events. Needless to say, this series follows the more of mindless fun in terms of action rather than anything serious. It's honestly hard to take this series seriously despite the given premise as well. I mean, the characters use cell phones, a tool that should be used for communication rather than summoning. In this series though, we see these kids using them as a tool of war. However, the way it employs it is rather blend. Most of the time, the kids themselves relies too much on their summonings rather than themselves. I mean, they rarely comes up with the thought of 'what happens if I lose my demon?' It's pretty lame to see their summoners just sit back and let their partner do the job.Devil Survivor 2 does pull out some unusual events through the appearances of 'death clips', scenes that depicts a characters' outcomes in the series. Then again, there's the Septentriones flying around causing panic to everywhere with a seemingly lack of explanation of their origins. Although it seems fun to dig clues about the series, it just seems blend through their certain appearances. As for a animated series of only 13 episodes, Devil Survivor 2 is one of those adapted anime that is crammed by its game material. This leads to problems with character development, relationships, world building, and the story itself. To make matters worse, there are even episodes where hardly anything happens but creates a setup of what's to come. It creates barriers that prevents the series to succeed in this way and doesn't help the fact that not every characters gets to shine in the spotlight.The bright side of this series though (I don't mean this literally) with its idea of survival. Characters do actually die off rather than being a tease, at least for the time being. Even the credits played after each episode presents this visually as it removes characters after they are killed. There's also an unusual relationship between Yamato and Hibiki that is hard to paint later on. Yamato is one of the most mysterious figures. Despite seeing Hibiki as a friend at times, he is also brutally honest and makes decisions with cruel outcomes. Speaking of outcomes though, the story comes out as perhaps quite weak. It's problem again lies in its adaptation of being a condensed 13-episode series. It also pulls out the deus ex machina when the opportunities come. Furthermore, it even has bits of fan service by the characters' designs such as Airi and Hinako. To present material like this in a demonic series such as DS2 makes the show more messy than it already is.As for the series' visuals, it represents both a gruesome nature and also one that is hard to take serious at times. Well, there's the way that Hibiki is designed along with other characters such as 'The Anguished One'. The way the characters look doesn't make them look like survivors of anything. They look like people out of a video game. However, there are a few characters who are dressed in an unusual way that may raise a few eyebrows. Our mysterious Septentriones also are presented in a way that is completely out of this world. The apocalyptic nature of the series does fit though so I give some praise to that.Perhaps one of the stronger points of the series is the soundtrack. The OP song, “Take Your Way” takes the stance of an artistic way of presenting the series. We can see the characters digitally with enhanced features of their profiles as well as some depictions of the events. The OST is hardly noticeable though except during more of the crucial or more emotional scenes. Otherwise, the ED song as mentioned before shows the survival theme as when characters dies off, they are removed from the credits. It's all about survival people.All in all, this series is fun for some full shock violence and action. It reflects the idea of survival and gives it away immediately. However, its story is dry as paint and its cast of characters seems unbalanced with their weak development or structure. Furthermore, the series seems to be rushed and has some nonsense as it loses energy. The first episode had my eyes glued to the screen but quickly changed my mind afterwards. It's one of those series where patience is a key to getting it through. If not, then tough luck. It's just like the main characters too where they need everything to survive whether it's strategy, power, and luck. Well, for luck, they're going to need it. game, Devil Survivor 2 of the same name.

As someone that hasn't played the Devil Survivor games I was somewhat pulled into this anime but it still feels like it is lacking something. By reading this review I have only seen 6 episodes and so this review wouldn't be valid but can be credible to the anime itself.StoryThe story is fine and there isn't too much to complain about. The anime presents itself with our usual high school protagonist with his high school friends. It's pretty basic and isn't anything new or...ground breaking. Long version is that our main character Hibiki and friends download an app that allows him to summon demons and also see other peoples predicted deaths. The apocalypse happens and since our main character is the one with the powerful demons it's up to him to make sure no one gets killed. Pretty basic plot but watchable.ArtI can't really judge artwork to me it looks pretty and there's no complaints just normal anime art style for the anime but set in 2013 standards.SoundThe sound is good but the only thing I like out of sound is the opening and the ending but osts aren't memorable for me and so it doesn't have much of an impact but the opening and ending are enjoyable to listen and watch.CharactersThe only problem with the main character at this point is that there is no defining feature for him (except for his bunny hoodie) he's just your typical shounen character in which once he realises his power he thinks he needs to be the hero in which can protect everyone. There's nothing wrong with it as it does play in the story, who should Hibiki work for, for the greater good, the JP's or the resistance but it's just your typical shounen protagonist. The other problem is just with the side characters. I have trouble in remembering their names and Hibiki's best friend is just annoying. Overall characters aren't the best part of the show but it's still watchable.Overall as someone that has not played the game I say that the anime itself is still watchable the story itself is fine and the struggle with what the main character is going through is interesting but side characters bring the anime down but it's still watchable and I would recommend it as just an anime to watch and put on the list. ground breaking.

What starts off seeming to be similar to Mirai Nikki as the characters’ cell phones are given a “future sight” ability quickly turns into a “save the world from demons” kind of show. Unfortunately, DS2 has many problems with pacing, characters, and just an overall confusing plot. It is based off of a game by the same name, which I have heard is much better.First I want to mention one thing. Whenever I say anything is bad in this show, it excludes Jungo and Airi who are two supporting characters and who are gems that...really stand out in this mess of a show.Story – 4/10The story begins with Kuze Hibiki and Shijima Daichi, two best friends in high school who are preparing for college. One day as they are about to board the subway, a strange message comes onto their cellphones. It shows a video to them of the subway train derailing and crashing into the station they are standing on killing everyone around them. As they stand there freaked out at the video, the train comes into the station and proceeds to do exactly as the video showed. The two boys barely avoid being crushed by the crumbling station and were much more fortunate than the people around them. Still, they’re not safe yet. Strange monsters have appeared and are attacking a classmate of theirs who also happened to survive the incident, Nitta Io. Nitta and the two guys all saw the same video and all soon find out that that’s not the only thing their phones are now capable of doing. They somehow manage to fight off the monsters surrounding them by summoning demons from their phones, much to their surprise.After escaping from the subway, they learn that similar events have happened in other places. Everything starts to turn chaotic as monsters appear in the streets and start attacking. Still inexperienced with the new abilities of their phones, the three somehow manage to survive with their own strength before being found by members of an organization named “JP’s.” They learn all about the demons which are called “Septentriones” and that the world will be destroyed in a week by these Septentriones. JP's was created in order to fight the Septentriones and try to protect the world. However, the leader of JP’s, Yamato Houtsuin, seems a little untrustworthy to the trio.While I admit it is a good setup, the plot is heavily confusing. It is never explained very well what the Septentrione are and only adds more confusion later on. All I can figure is they are similar to the Angels from Evangelion (one even resembles humans). The characters jump around between sides a lot as well. By that I mean that the people surrounding Yamato never really understand his reasoning for things, and he is one of the most confusing parts of the story. The show is very indecisive on whether it wants to portray him as a villain or a hero. Yamato, while apparently trying to protect the world from the Septentriones, will use any means necessary to stop them, and he sacrifices people without showing a single ounce of regret.One last major issue is the disconnection you have with the important fighting demons of the main characters. Aside from Hibiki’s, Yamato’s and Daichi’s main demons (just one from each), I don’t remember a thing about any of the other characters demons (even Jungo and Airi’s). Having not played the DS2 game, I don’t really know how important they are, but I really wish more focus had been given to the powers and abilities of each of the demons. As similar as they are to Pokémon or the “box-weapon animals” from Katekyo Hitman Reborn, there’s just nothing in the show that helps make them memorable like in those other shows.The first two episodes of DS2 are pretty good, but from there, the story just dive-bombs lower and lower and never recovers. Even at the very final episode, I have no clue what this Polaris thing is or whether it's good or bad, and the ending itself is weak.Art – 7/10Aside from some scenes being a little too dark and difficult to follow, the art is fairly standard. While it has some great moments, the action scenes are nothing special. In addition to the poor explanations of the demons, in many cases, the characters send them out to fight and then the story focuses on the drama between Yamato, Hibiki, and everyone else instead of showing the action in detail. The character designs (excluding Jungo and Airi) are not very original. There’s one woman, Hinako, who kind of takes a motherly towards Nitta and the other characters. Her design (which I really did not like) is just bizarre as I have no idea how the two flaps that are her shirt stay on her breasts.Sound – 6/10I noticed in Episode 12 that there were a few great songs playing during the action scenes, but other than that I hardly noticed the music at all. The voice actors for the most part are decent at best. Daichi’s voice is really annoying, but at least the VA cast has Sawashiro Miyuki as Makoto who is one of my favorite voice actors (she also voices Celty in Durarara!!). I also found Hibiki’s voice to be sub-par for a main protagonist. As much emotion as he shows, he never really sounded the part to me during those scenes.Character – 5/10This would probably be a 3/10 if not for Jungo and Airi. Despite being supporting characters who are not even introduced until around episode four or five, to me Jungo and Airi were really the best characters in DS2. Their relationship was more of a big brother (Jungo) and little sister (Airi) relationship than anything romantic. Jungo is a fairly quiet, tall man while Airi is kind of a brat who talks a lot and gets embarrassed easily. When I first saw them, I thought they were kind of similar to Jesse and James from Pokémon (they’re first seen sneaking into a rebel building), but they quickly show that they are much more than that. Like every other named character in this show, they have cellphones which can summon demons to fight.Now onto the main cast. The main cast greatly resembles the cast of Durarara!! (main trio who look very similar, long-time rivals, and Makoto and Celty have the same VA and similar roles). I thought Hibiki was a pretty weak and stereotypical protagonist. He’s thrust into a supernatural world he doesn’t understand with an unusual amount of power and he is basically forced to save the world with said power. Daichi is just annoying. He’s Hibiki’s best friend who can only summon small useless demons at first. Nitta is a girl who has trouble comprehending everything at first as she is thrust into this world while worrying about her family. She also has a strong desire to protect everyone. I already talked about Yamato so now I’ll talk about his “rival” who he has known for years, Alcor (Ureu Mono). Alcor is a Septentrione who has the form of a human (though what’s up with his huge white eyelashes?). He is interested in Hibiki and wants to help him save the world (I think, like Yamato, Alcor’s motives are a little confusing).One thing about this show (which you’ll notice as you watch the ED after a few episodes) is that it is not afraid to kill characters. I already mentioned that Yamato sacrifices people (tens of background characters get wiped out from a single attack from Septentriones many times), but this show does not give you much time to grow attached to a few characters.Enjoyment – 5/10I just barely enjoyed it enough to finish all 13 episodes. To me, this show is a butchered mix between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Mirai Nikki for the plot and Durarara!! for the characters. It’s confusing, only has two strong characters with a weak main cast, and does not even have the art or sound to really back up these huge faults.Pros:+ Jungo and Airi+ The first two episodes are not badCons:- Weak main characters- Confusing plot- Music is never very strong- Weak action scenes- Demons are forgettable due to lack of screen timeI would recommend avoiding this anime. Similar things such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and the Yumekui Merry manga did the “save the world from mysterious creatures” concept better, and I would recommend them over DS2. really stand out in this mess of a show.Story – 4/10The story begins with Kuze Hibiki and Shijima Daichi, two best friends in high school who are preparing for college.

Yamato, while apparently trying to protect the world from the Septentriones, will use any means necessary to stop them, and he sacrifices people without showing a single ounce of regret.One last major issue is the disconnection you have with the important fighting demons of the main characters. Aside from Hibiki’s, Yamato’s and Daichi’s main demons (just one from each), I don’t remember a thing about any of the other characters demons (even Jungo and Airi’s). Having not played the DS2 game, I don’t really know how important they are, but I really wish more focus had been given to the powers and abilities of each of the demons. As similar as they are to Pokémon or the “box-weapon animals” from Katekyo Hitman Reborn, there’s just nothing in the show that helps make them memorable like in those other shows.The first two episodes of DS2 are pretty good, but from there, the story just dive-bombs lower and lower and never recovers. Even at the very final episode, I have no clue what this Polaris thing is or whether it's good or bad, and the ending itself is weak.Art – 7/10Aside from some scenes being a little too dark and difficult to follow, the art is fairly standard. While it has some great moments, the action scenes are nothing special. In addition to the poor explanations of the demons, in many cases, the characters send them out to fight and then the story focuses on the drama between Yamato, Hibiki, and everyone else instead of showing the action in detail. The character designs (excluding Jungo and Airi) are not very original. There’s one woman, Hinako, who kind of takes a motherly towards Nitta and the other characters. Her design (which I really did not like) is just bizarre as I have no idea how the two flaps that are her shirt stay on her breasts.Sound – 6/10I noticed in Episode 12 that there were a few great songs playing during the action scenes, but other than that I hardly noticed the music at all. The voice actors for the most part are decent at best. Daichi’s voice is really annoying, but at least the VA cast has Sawashiro Miyuki as Makoto who is one of my favorite voice actors (she also voices Celty in Durarara!!). I also found Hibiki’s voice to be sub-par for a main protagonist. As much emotion as he shows, he never really sounded the part to me during those scenes.Character – 5/10This would probably be a 3/10 if not for Jungo and Airi. Despite being supporting characters who are not even introduced until around episode four or five, to me Jungo and Airi were really the best characters in DS2. Their relationship was more of a big brother (Jungo) and little sister (Airi) relationship than anything romantic. Jungo is a fairly quiet, tall man while Airi is kind of a brat who talks a lot and gets embarrassed easily. When I first saw them, I thought they were kind of similar to Jesse and James from Pokémon (they’re first seen sneaking into a rebel building), but they quickly show that they are much more than that. Like every other named character in this show, they have cellphones which can summon demons to fight.Now onto the main cast. The main cast greatly resembles the cast of Durarara!! (main trio who look very similar, long-time rivals, and Makoto and Celty have the same VA and similar roles). I thought Hibiki was a pretty weak and stereotypical protagonist. He’s thrust into a supernatural world he doesn’t understand with an unusual amount of power and he is basically forced to save the world with said power. Daichi is just annoying. He’s Hibiki’s best friend who can only summon small useless demons at first. Nitta is a girl who has trouble comprehending everything at first as she is thrust into this world while worrying about her family. She also has a strong desire to protect everyone. I already talked about Yamato so now I’ll talk about his “rival” who he has known for years, Alcor (Ureu Mono). Alcor is a Septentrione who has the form of a human (though what’s up with his huge white eyelashes?). He is interested in Hibiki and wants to help him save the world (I think, like Yamato, Alcor’s motives are a little confusing).One thing about this show (which you’ll notice as you watch the ED after a few episodes) is that it is not afraid to kill characters. I already mentioned that Yamato sacrifices people (tens of background characters get wiped out from a single attack from Septentriones many times), but this show does not give you much time to grow attached to a few characters.Enjoyment – 5/10I just barely enjoyed it enough to finish all 13 episodes. To me, this show is a butchered mix between Neon Genesis Evangelion and Mirai Nikki for the plot and Durarara!! for the characters. It’s confusing, only has two strong characters with a weak main cast, and does not even have the art or sound to really back up these huge faults.Pros:+ Jungo and Airi+ The first two episodes are not badCons:- Weak main characters- Confusing plot- Music is never very strong- Weak action scenes- Demons are forgettable due to lack of screen timeI would recommend avoiding this anime. Similar things such as Neon Genesis Evangelion and the Yumekui Merry manga did the “save the world from mysterious creatures” concept better, and I would recommend them over DS2."", 'Overall the anime was good I enjoyed it, I watched it in one day which may skew my perception of it.  Probably if I had to wait week by week for this anime I would have dropped it at episode 3.  I do not know anything about the game, nor did I read the synopsis of the anime beforehand, so I had no expectations.Story (7/10) The story was very shounen like, if I could compare it, the 13 episodes seemed fairly similar to a first arc in a shounen manga.  The characters are introduced, the main character is more awesome that the...others, and has to rise to the occasion to battle it out against the ""evil"".Art (7/10) The characters were pleasing to the eye.  There were alot of scenes in which spoke volumes in terms of the story.  While Alcor and Hibiki are talking on the bridge the scene of the void taking over was pretty meaningful especially with the dialogue.  The fights in episode 10-13 were a bit different.  I felt like some of the fights were reminiscent of Neon Genesis and also GANTZ.Sound (8/10) I am just rating this on feelings.  I liked the theme song a lot.  The ending songs were okay, but I didn\'t listen to them every episode or anything.  The sound during the anime was good, although I am not an elite on sound, so I wouldn\'t be sure.Characters (8/10) I really feel Hibiki, Daichi, Io were lacking in this series as far characterization goes.  We get a flashback of the reason why Hibiki is such a do-gooder, but the director I feel did not direct it properly because it did not come off as either sentimental or that you knew more about the person.  You just came away with the feeling that he use to go with the flow of his parents expectations than one day his friend was talking about what he wanted to do in high school and BAM he changed? I don\'t get it. Io is the archetypical girl that you feel sorry for and gets lured into traps etc so the main character can create a miracle for her (she doesn\'t cry that much though so that\'s good).  Daichi well what can I say he is like the idiot friend that has good intentions but is just not as strong or intelligent as the main and merely becomes comedic relief.  The other characters are better, Alcor was by far the most interesting.  Some of the characters I felt were purely fan service and could have been done away with, though I am sure they appeared in the game so they had to be included.Enjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed it, I think it was good that it was not made into a 24 episodes.  In fact I think it would have been better as movie or 3 part OVA.  Since there are 13 episodes I expected more either character development or fight scenes, but instead air time was wasted on useless character to character dialogue on food or building up supporting characters like the Airi and Jungo, and the person with barely there clothing.  While fans of the game probably liked this, I thought it was worthless and had no point in anime adaptation.  I also liked the philosophical aspect of it, I felt that it could have been done better rather than spelling it out, it could have been symbolic but, I guess it fits shounen-like genre to spell it out for people. others, and has to rise to the occasion to battle it out against the ""evil"".Art (7/10) The characters were pleasing to the eye.

The series is similar to Mirai Nikki and the two Persona adaptations. Unlike said series the plot of DS2 doesn't flow well at all, so I know the problem doesn't lie with it being an adaption off a game, particularly since both Persona adaptations turned out well despite being a game. I've also seen a few other series with a similar plot line and I was quite fond of said series. This though I was not, and that is...not a reflection on the game at all.Going into the series I didn't realize that the series' plot line involved tricking fate, but after the first episode I knew that it shared a similar plot line as quite a few other series I had seen involving tricking fate.

Opinions about this anime will be different from person to personThis review shall be made taking into account the game, I played it long before seeing this adaptation.The anime had potential to become one of the best of this year 2013 if the creators had taken more seriously the game, in my opinion i believe that neither they played it and only guided themselves by summaries of the game (who knows? Seems like it to me).I'll start by comparing the anime and the game in several areas:Story: The story in this anime...goes way too fast.The game had many missions that didn't belong to the main story but that affected the course of history and all of them were not shown in this animation.The anime is just 13 episodes and that affected the character/character development and the moste important, the finale ! I would not mind if the anime had 2 seasons if that meant covering all parts of the game.I still don't believe they skipped the battle beetwen Hibiki and Polaris (major flaw!).Characters: The characters are not well developed and some even only appear in 2 or 3 episodes and the relationships between some are a bit forced due to the reduced number of episodes. In the game, you have the opportunity to socialize and get to know better each character and their problems and their life before the invasion but the reduced number of episodes made it impossible.Sound: In my opinion the soundtrack from the anime meets the recommended and has a great ending (better ending in this summer for me), as well as the OST fits well.Battles: The battles in this anime were good but could have been more and better, if the anime had traversed the whole game we would have the opportunity to see more demons and various attacks.The final battle (i do not want to spoil) is too short in my opinion and could have more drama and more action.The games of the saga shin megami tensei are famous for having a great story to develop and its interaction with all the characters and addictive battles but the anime was slightly below expectations but i disagree when people say it was a failure because i found it nice to see one my favorite games adapted for television.Who knows  if they do not make the adaptation of the first game Devil Survivor, but this time done by taking better account of the game.I hope this review helped you in some way and always remeber :LET'S SURVIVE ! goes way too fast.The game had many missions that didn't belong to the main story but that affected the course of history and all of them were not shown in this animation.The anime is just 13 episodes and that affected the character/character development and the moste important, the finale !

There is a strong theme of power and hierarchy, although it is not overwhelming as it has the portrayal that the power would be easily taken away.This anime is one that you can...fall into, you lose yourself in the story and it's not very often that an anime can actually do that for me.

I tried my best, but I can\'t really give a good critique without implementing them.Furthermore, I could not avoid comparing this to the game. Still, I reviewed this on its own merits. I have played Devil Survivor 2: Record Breaker for the 3DS for 100+ hours, so I have a good grasp on the game’s strengths and weaknesses.I’ve sometimes wondered why Shin Megami Tensei games don’t get adaptations, but then a bit of thinking always leads me to the answer: many of them would be the same. See, since the core SMT series typically boasts multiple endings, the...studio would have to adapt one, and the one it chooses to adapt would be the Neutral route, as that would probably have the most story. This is why we see more linear games (plotwise) like Persona 4 get adaptations. Devil Survivor 2, the second in the Devil Survivor branch of SMT games, has a tone right in between SMT and Persona. The game is considerably more lighthearted than its parent series and its predecessor, and even though it has multiple routes, they’re very similar to each other. So, how does the anime adaptation work out? Not well, I’m afraid.Devil Survivor 2 the Animation is based on a manga that is based on the game. It follows the main character, renamed Hibiki Kuze, a bunny-eared hoodie wearing high schooler. After signing up for a macabre site, Nicaea, that promises to show death videos, or clips of people dying, the world seems to turn upside down; a subway train crashes, monsters only describable as demons pop out of peoples phones, and mysterious invaders called the Septentriones threaten the balance of the world itself. Hibiki, who has a greater potential than others, can summon stronger demons like Byakko; as a result, he and his friends are forcibly enlisted into the government agency JP’s (pronounced Jips) to fight against these monsters. Hibiki often comes into conflict with the cold and ruthless leader of JP’s, Yamato Hotsuin. He also comes into contact with a number of different people, most noticeably the Anguished One, an enigmatic being who knows more than he’s letting on and is decidedly not human.The plot of the original game was never its strong suit (with plenty of dumb anime tropes and stuff like ""The Dragon Stream""), and for the most part, the anime doesn’t strengthen it. Urgency and despair are rarely felt, despite it being a Shin Megami Tensei title; honestly, this doesn’t play out as anything other than a disaster-based anime, much like films such as Twister and San Andreas. Where the game did excel, however, was with its characters. A total of 14 main characters rounded out a robust cast in the game, and each character had enough time to be fleshed out. Even Hibiki bucked the trend by being a rather witty hero, calling people tsundere, nicknaming them, and flirting with everyone to no end. The cast was creative.The anime doesn’t do that. Almost every character is reduced to a singular trait or trope, or even less so.Daichi? Good friend of Hibiki, and dumb comic relief (A recurring gag has him yelling ""My Demons are weak!"" which gets old fast).Io? Dandere who seems to like Hibiki.Makoto? Serious.Fumi? Uncaring.Ronaldo? Justice.Characters like Joe, Otome, Airi, Jungo, Hinako, and Keita don’t even get an iota of development to make you give half a shit about them. Joe\'s a guy, Otome\'s a doctor, Hinako dances, whatever. Not a shred of their personality or motivations are retained from the game. The most we get is maybe one or two stills (quite literally stills, not even a scene) worth of flashback for Airi and a short scene for Makoto. Hibiki might be one of the worst off; after having such a creative personality in the game, and then having the voice actor to be able to match (Hiroshi Kamiya, who also did the manic Araragi from the Monogatari series). Hibiki is reduced to nothing more than a serious shounen hero who wants to save everyone. Hooray for a generic hero.And, well, it also doesn’t really help that pretty much everyone dies in an extremely haphazard manner. In the game, Death Videos were supposed to be avoided by arriving in a timely fashion. And while the game had time to let you feel the weight of your incompetence, no such element exists in the anime other than Hibiki beating himself about it, as you can\'t connect to many, if any, of the characters. In one of the early episodes, the character Keita is introduced, only to die in that same episode. The end of the series gets particularly dumb, when pretty much everyone dies in rapid succession.(Incidentally, during a fight with the Anguished One, Yamato avoids getting killed. Somehow. Despite being exploded upon. Never explained.)As far as characterization goes, it’s not an entire wash. The Anguished One is roughly the same as his game counterpart, but the clear “winner” is definitely Yamato, who’s roughly the same as he is in the game. However, he’s significantly more ruthless in this anime than he is in the game, and that produces mixed results. On the one hand, Yamato is permitted extra development even over the game, especially through his childhood and his interactions with politicians that led him to his meritocracy beliefs. On the other hand, Yamato is hard to sympathize with on almost any level; the game, which allowed you to join him in his quest for a meritocracy, included a few light moments, made him a much less “evil” character than he is in the anime.It’s because of this overall weak characterization that prevents the extremely talented voice cast from reaching their full potential. There’s a dynamite Japanese voice cast featuring a very strong list of A-list seiyuus, but bland characters can’t really be saved by good voice acting. No one performance is bad (far from it!), but the only one who stands out is Junichi Suwabe as Yamato, even if his great performance only serves to make Yamato more unlikable.Ultimately, all of this can be attributed to rushing, only highlighting the plot points. A playthrough of a route, even quickly, can take around 15 hours, and while not all of that is plot all the time, everything feels stuffed into this 6 and a half hour adaptation which focuses only on the major plot points. If I had to appreciate the plot in any way (besides them somehow paying a lot of attention to the fusion recipes: they were all correct!) it would be the fight with Lugh, which was much plainer in the game.Thankfully, we have some strong animation here. Maybe after seeing a bunch of semi-static sprites all of the time in the game lowered my standards, but the animation is always clean and consistent. A-1 manages to make the demons look terrifying, and the character models by Durarara!! and Danmachi artist Suzuhito Yasuda are brought to life here, with a focus on details. While other aspects of the anime may be suspect, Seiji Kishi does a great job of directing this series, and the cinematography is quite well done.The fight scenes are a mixed bag, much like the Persona 4 animation; like that, it feels like glorified Pokemon, which is definitely not what Shin Megami Tensei is. To its credit, the fight scenes look pretty enough, but their length, choreography, and character interactions (which is mostly reduced to yelling stuff like “Go Byakko!”) leaves plenty to be desired.You shouldn’t have much of a reason, if any at all, to watch this anime unless you’ve played the game (or fall into a group where you don’t own a 3DS but like the SMT and Persona series). Maybe for morbid curiosity, but not much else. My main reason to watch this was to experience the Japanese cast, which is unavailable to me unless I buy a Japanese 3DS and a Japanese version of Record Breaker, but thanks to the uninspired characters, even that isn’t a good enough reason. I’d recommend you skip this series. It has its strengths, but its weaknesses far outstrip them.

Sexism is alive, folks. Corrected to doctor. studio would have to adapt one, and the one it chooses to adapt would be the Neutral route, as that would probably have the most story. This is why we see more linear games (plotwise) like Persona 4 get adaptations. Devil Survivor 2, the second in the Devil Survivor branch of SMT games, has a tone right in between SMT and Persona. The game is considerably more lighthearted than its parent series and its predecessor, and even though it has multiple routes, they’re very similar to each other. So, how does the anime adaptation work out? Not well, I’m afraid.Devil Survivor 2 the Animation is based on a manga that is based on the game. It follows the main character, renamed Hibiki Kuze, a bunny-eared hoodie wearing high schooler. After signing up for a macabre site, Nicaea, that promises to show death videos, or clips of people dying, the world seems to turn upside down; a subway train crashes, monsters only describable as demons pop out of peoples phones, and mysterious invaders called the Septentriones threaten the balance of the world itself. Hibiki, who has a greater potential than others, can summon stronger demons like Byakko; as a result, he and his friends are forcibly enlisted into the government agency JP’s (pronounced Jips) to fight against these monsters. Hibiki often comes into conflict with the cold and ruthless leader of JP’s, Yamato Hotsuin. He also comes into contact with a number of different people, most noticeably the Anguished One, an enigmatic being who knows more than he’s letting on and is decidedly not human.The plot of the original game was never its strong suit (with plenty of dumb anime tropes and stuff like ""The Dragon Stream""), and for the most part, the anime doesn’t strengthen it. Urgency and despair are rarely felt, despite it being a Shin Megami Tensei title; honestly, this doesn’t play out as anything other than a disaster-based anime, much like films such as Twister and San Andreas. Where the game did excel, however, was with its characters. A total of 14 main characters rounded out a robust cast in the game, and each character had enough time to be fleshed out. Even Hibiki bucked the trend by being a rather witty hero, calling people tsundere, nicknaming them, and flirting with everyone to no end. The cast was creative.The anime doesn’t do that. Almost every character is reduced to a singular trait or trope, or even less so.Daichi?

Sexism is alive, folks. Corrected to doctor.', 'Devil Survivor 2: Dubious Massacre TooAfter Seiji Kishi\'s wildly successful anime adaptation of Persona 4, it was only natural we would see him tackle another popular Atlus video game franchise, right? That\'s what we got with Devil Survivor 2, a 13 episode series produced by a relative unknown in the anime industry, Studio Bridge. Considering the success Kishi had with Persona 4, we could expect the same great things with Devil Survivor 2...ah expectations...how you never cease to fail me.This series is the very definition of the phrase ""all style and no substance."" Devil Survivor 2 is a GORGEOUSLY animated series with production values through...the roof. However, Kishi faces the same problem he had with Angel Beats...he tried to cram way too much into too little of space. Devil Survivor 2 is supposed to be a character driven series with well fleshed out characters to drive a dark, horrifically bleak plot. However, since Kishi only had 13 episodes to work with, this series felt rushed in its character development (or lack there of) and it resulted in the series not having the ""impact"" it should\'ve had. I will warn you right now (as if you couldn\'t tell from the title), there is a lot of death in this series. However, like I stated, due to the characters not being fleshed out, their deaths have very little impact, at least not as much impact as they should\'ve had.As far as the story is concerned, it revolves around a graduating high school student named Hibiki Kuze, who is hanging out with his best friend Daichi Shijima after college entrance exams. While hanging out, Daichi shows Hibiki a phone app that shows people their faces when they die. While waiting for their ride in the subway, they encounter a girl from another class named Io Nitta, someone Daichi has a crush on. While waiting for their ride, they all get messages of their dead face clip of the train derailing and killing all of them, and all given the choice by the app if they want to live or die. By choosing to live, they avoid a near death experience when the train does derail, but their worlds will never be the same after this event as they discover that the end of the world is at hand and they\'ll have to fight to survive. Overall, I did find it to be an interesting plot that at least kept me interested in how this world was coming to an end. However, in my opinion, a story is only as good as the characters that drive it...and that\'s where this series took a turn for the worst.The characters were so underdeveloped that it was sad. While I don\'t think the cast nor the characters themselves were necessarily terrible or unlikable, the problem was ALL of them were underdeveloped. After the first few episodes, Kishi gives us the impression that we need to be invested in Hibiki, Nitta, and Daich and their growing friendshipi. However, other than learning about all three of them trying to get into college, we learn next to nothing about them. We don\'t learn anything about what shaped their personalities or their motivations, and other than a short flashback later on in the series, there is absolutely nothing displayed about Hibiki\'s back story. That\'s where the problem with this series lies. The nature of Shin Megami Tensei games for the most part, is the choices you make to develop your character. However, when you have a contained anime series, the choices need to be made by the production staff...but in this instance, Kishi didn\'t make any choices and left the characters open for the viewer to make their own interpretation about them. That sort of practice works fine for a video game, but not when you\'re telling a story, especially in an anime series format. It was an odd choice because in Kishi\'s prior work (Persona 4), Yu Narukami, the series lead was fleshed out and the production staff did choose how to develop him. I\'d say this is one instance where Kishi should\'ve followed his own prior example. While I mentioned it earlier, this series had way too many notable characters to completely cover in a 13 episode format. There were 14 notable characters that were either main characters or incredibly important supporting characters. However, when you only have 13 episodes to work with, it\'s impossible to flesh out every single one and when you have a story as active as this one, there just wasn\'t enough time to cover both bases. I\'ll give this series a little bit of credit though. Alcor was one hell of a memorable character due to his bizarre appearance and unorthodox behavior...but even that feels like a drag considering how forgettable all the rest of the characters are.The MAJOR saving grace for this series should come as no surprise. It\'s the animation and music. The production value of this series was incredible. The animation was crisp and provided a dreary setting and the high-quality music provided a bleak mood (even if the characters didn\'t). While this series only had 13 episodes to work with, I\'ll at least admit Studio Bridge went all out with it. I found the demon designs and the fight scenes to be incredibly fascinating and certainly does justice to the wonderful universe Shin Megami Tensei has to offer. My one complaint (albeit minor) is I found the character designs, primarily the costume designs, to be rather silly for a series of this magnitude. While I know it\'s probably derived from the series directly, I found some of the character costumes to be downright hilarious, from Kuze\'s rabbit eared hoodie, to Hinako\'s breast flop top, to Fumi\'s swimsuit with a full-length cape. It\'s pretty sad when a series this ominous can make you chuckle from just mere costume designs.All-in-all, I can\'t help but feel disappointed by this series. This was one series I was looking forward to the most when this season started and it left me feeling discontent. When a character driven series has really shallow character development, you have problems. It\'s just hard to get invested in a series where there is such little development between the characters throughout. I will say this series did have a pretty strong finish with its last two episodes, however, by then, the damage was done. While I thought the final episode was a strong finish to a weak series, some people might get a little turned off by its Mai-Hime-esque conclusion. I\'m not sure how this series works as an adaptation since I\'ve never played the video game, but as an anime series, it failed to deliver in a lot of ways. Now, the question is, who would I recommend this to? Well, I\'d say if you liked other video game adapted or inspired anime like Persona 4 or Persona: Trinity Soul, you might enjoy this. However, a viewer that loves being invested in character over plot is more than likely going to find this to be a difficult watch. I hate to say it, but I have a feeling that I\'m going to say by the end of the year that Devil Survivor 2 was unfortunately one of the more disappointing anime of 2013. the roof.

The game is one of my favourites and I enjoyed it thoroughly. But this anime adapatation is a downer, to say the least.The story is quite simple, the world will end in seven days, demons have appeared in Tokyo, there is a website that tells you when your friends will die, each day there is a boss. Now, that premise works well on a videogame, since everyday there are lots of optional events you can do, like a free battle, talking to a party member,...training, etc.The one thing that they handled horribly was the pacing. The game isn't long, but not short either, but there was no possible way 7 days of gameplay could fit into 13 chapters. As a result, the pacing was too rushed, with boss battles every two chapters or so and little time to develop the characters and story. And since they couldn't spend too long on anything, most of the battles are won by asspulls, like stronger demons out of nowhere or the power of friendship. The moral dispute between the characters is handled poorly because there is no development.Since it also strayed from the original source, many important characters were reduced to mere fodder. The 13 summoners are your party members, each with interesting personalities, roles and skills. But only a few are explored and the rest, well...don't expect more than 10 minutes of screen time. One of the problems when adapting rpgs with silent heros is giving them personality. In game, they are a reflection of what you think, YOU decide what to do.

Rating: 5Enjoyment. I don't really recall some 'fanatic' moment with me and the anime. Let's just say we just want to watch how it ends. Enjoyment is fair. Rating: 6Overall Rating: 7The story, art and sound are awesome. Characters are messed with, boo. Enjoyment, really not much. But you have to admit, we all want Hibiki's jacket."", 'Seriously, what is the meaning of life?Honestly, when it comes to game adaptation, I always have the lowest expectations because I know most game adaptations might not fulfill the requirements the game had to offer which results in poor ratings. I have completely forgot about 4/5 of this anime. But as I think about this anime, I am leading into a more ""I don\'t like this anime"". I will explain them as I move along.STORY (2):The 3 protagonists Hibiki, Daichi & Nitta were thrown into a virtual world whereby in order to protect Japan, they have to defeat the Septentrions. Yamato Hosuin, the leader of...JP, recruited 3 of them to join their force in destroying the Septentrions and many things start to happen.The story was full of plot holes and cliches and the battles were not epic at all. I couldn\'t get invested in the story and the characters which is very sad because when I watch anime, I am always interested in the story and characters and how they deal with life. I will explain in full detail on the animation, characters and my final thoughts of this anime.ART & ANIMATION (1):The animation is so dull which means the animation was so bright on some parts while the animation was so dull on some parts like watching a near-black screen.The anime also made use of ""Baka & Test"" when they summon beats and especially when Airi summons ""Caith Sith"" a reference from Final Fantasy 7. However, in FF7, Cait Sith was designed with a cat on top of a huge monster. Well, I don\'t even know how to describe that. These references are negated by the dull animation.If you want to pull the audience in, you have to make the animation look fantastic, not dull.SOUND (3):The opening and the ending was forgettable. I just forgot about the opening and ending theme. Even the music in the anime was not memorable, I just didn\'t care about the music.CHARACTER (1):Oh boy! Don\'t get me started on the characters. The characters are all unlikable and annoying with the exception of Yamato and Alcor. The 3 main characters are like Twilight characters.To me, Yamato and Alcor are only the most developed characters in this anime but then they got pushed aside and that was the last we ever seen of them.Hibiki Kuze was one of the worst protagonist I have came across in an anime. His character was like Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki. He just couldn\'t think straight and he always value his life more than anyone else. He always sulk a lot. The only think that his character develops is that he forms a good relationship with Daichi & Nitta.Daichi Shima was always overreacting.Nitta Io, a crybaby, who always cries when things go wrong. She never grows as a strong character. In fact, she relies on Hibiki too much. Just another Orihime, damsel in distress.The most annoying girl is Airi. To me, she always never care about the situation and the world. She always complain a lot.I just can\'t believe that the 3 protagonist are just babies and they value their life more than protecting others. They really have no goal in life. In fact, I don\'t feel that their situation was dire. There is no weight to the situation.CONCLUSION (2):The characters all just go through the motions with this anime and I didn\'t get invested in their cause and dilemmas. The characters just stayed the same throughout the anime.In episode 11, they mentioned Jack Frost but it was supposed to be pronounced as Black Frost in the game. Though I haven\'t played the game yet.The anime just neglects the appearance of Polaris and the 3 protagonists\' parents. If their parents were there in this anime, why didn\'t I get to see them. It leaves me with a sour feeling of the ending.And speaking of the end, this is one of the worst endings I came across. By the end, I came to realise that the characters that go though the battles, relationships, their causes, struggles and mysteries, it was all for NOTHING!By the end of the series, the characters just go on with life as if nothing had happened. Which means to say that this whole adventure didn\'t matter at all. It was just an illusion after all so we might as well just forget about it.I was so angry about this ending that everything that they work for is for nothing. The more I think about this anime, the lower the score gets.So overall I give this anime a 2 out of 10. I sat through 13 episodes and I realised none of that really mattered.

The more I think about this anime, the lower the score gets.So overall I give this anime a 2 out of 10. I sat through 13 episodes and I realised none of that really mattered.', 'I started this anime without really high expectaitions, so I was positively surprised when I watched it.First, the story:I really liked the setting, though I expected something diefferent. I thought it would be more game-like, because that\'s what I read in an recommendation before. But it isn\'t really a game in wich they have to survive and there wasn\'t really the goal to win against the other ""players"", they fought more or less together against some god-like things. But I think it was better like this. The story was well-paced and though it were only 13 episodes, it didn\'t proceed to fast. It was...exciting when they fought and you couldn\'t tell already 5 minutes earlier if someone was about to die or not. Also, I liked the development it took towards the end. Only the end as such was not too great. I don\'t know, but it wasn\'t so exciting. Just the few last minutes could have been a little bit more...how to put it without giving spoiler...well okay, you\'ll see. If you don\'t, that\'s okay, too, But it left me a little bit like that: ""Oh, it\'s over. Okay."" I wasn\'t dissatisfied, but I didn\'t think: ""That was it, Great! Just..Great!! I\'m impressed!!"" And that is somewhat what a really good ending should be like.So now the art:I really liked the art. It was nice to look at and the characterdesings were really cool. I especially liked Alcor\'s design, he looked kinda special. Okay, his eyes were strange because they were white around them - I identified it as extreme long white eyelashes but some people also say it was makeup. I don\'t care, it was strange but gave the character a very special feeling and I liked it. Okay, the women were all a bit too curvy if you\'d ask me, but it didn\'t really annoy.The sound:The sound did what it should do, I wouldn\'t say it was very special but it delivered the mood, so it\'s okay. I liked the opening. But all in all it didn\'t really stand out.The characters:Those were really, really cool, I think. My favorite is definitely Alcor. I think he was somewhat really cute and I liked the way he cared for the humankind. It is difficult to write about him wothout giving spoilers, but all I can say is, he really, really is cool and his way to see things was interesting to me. Also, he had a quite nice character-development.Hibiki was cool, too, but he didn\'t have that certain something that made me like Alcor that much. He was calm and that without being heartless - I liked that. But there wasn\'t much more to him than that, to be honest. Then there was Yamato. He was somewhat cool, I must admid, buuut - in the end he just pissed me off. He is a good character and I didn\'t lose all sympathy for him \'till the end, but...in the end, he was just so...you will see. His extreme stubbornness and elitist thinking were pissing me off in the end. Daichi was not obviously special, but his uncertainity made him somewhat liekable. He didn\'t really develop in the beginning and to be honest, he didn\'t develop in the progress of the Anime, too... but when he did in the end, I was somewhat proud of him and liked him even more. Plus, he was important for the character-setting, I think, because he somewhat lightened the mood. I think this anime could have been somewhat depressing without him...I don\'t really know, but there was really no woman I really liked in this anime. There were good composed characters, but I just couldn\'t really like them. Io was somewhat boring, but not annoying. Makoto was okay, no, she was actually quite cool. She wasn\'t so ""perfect"", if you know ehat I mean. She had to handle an inner conflict and always struggled between what was ""right"" and what she wanted to do. Yes, she was really okay, but I didn\'t really care for her.. And Kanno Fumi was okay, too. But I didn\'t sympathize with her. I think that was because her motivations and stuff were never really explained, if she even had something like a motivation...she didn\'t really seem to care.In the end, I\'d say the male characters were definitely cooler, but the female characters didn\'t annoy, either and that is already something if you watch at all the annoying anime-girls in so many animes....So my conclusion:It was a really nice Anime worth watching it. I liked the conflict it thematized; the question what was right and what wasn\'t, and I liked the way the characters were. I had a good feeling with them all and Alcor was just great. The Anime didn\'t get me too excited, though...it was good to watch, well-paced and had a certain depth. Well the fights were exciting, too, but the whole Anime didn\'t make me feel too strong with the characters..I didn\'t cry and wasn\'t happy with the characters, like it is with some other animes. Okay, I felt with Alcor, but he is special. *^*In the end, I\'m really glad I watched it and would recommend it to everyone who likes apocalypse-settings, interesting charakters and big monsters/demons. exciting when they fought and you couldn\'t tell already 5 minutes earlier if someone was about to die or not.

It\'s kind of mix of digimon mixed with yuigoh except people summon with their phone instead of cards, etc. Seems less childish and corny that way I guess. While the summoned demons are pretty cool, the characters are ehh.The main character is such a goody too shoes I just can\'t ever relate to him. He\'s just TOO good to be true in my honest opinion that it makes him seem unrealistic, childish and foolish. They did show us a bit of his past as it being a rough...childhood, but it just wasn\'t enough to really give us any relation. The rest of the characters are just your typical run of the muck characters you find in a ton of anime. I really didn\'t get the relationship with the main character and the main antagonist at all. The Main (Hibiki) referred to the antagonist (Haruto) as his friend when I never really saw any sort of relationship whatsoever in the anime between these guys other than ""Hey you Hibiki do my bidding or else..."" and like a moron Hibiki complies. It seemed more like a bully pushing around people instead of trying to understand each other. So the way they ended it was just plain dumb.Story wise it just seems to just pop out of nowhere without explain certain characters, monsters, etc. It just seems to have left so much unclear. Just a small minor explanation with no certain motives on why the Septenriones and their master wants to destroy humankind other than the typical ""humans are destructive"" moniker.In all I thought this could\'ve been much better. Music and artwork was pretty good, but just like Guilty Crown it completely falls flat in the characters and story departments. In the end it just ends up a mediocre anime at best. 5/10 childhood, but it just wasn\'t enough to really give us any relation.

But looks can be deceiving, and that\'s certainly the case with this anime in particular. It\'s a show that bubbles with potential but only ends up fizzling out in the end.Story: 5/10Believe me, the plot of this anime is in no way original or ground breaking. It\'s pretty predicable if you ask me. But I found that even...with it\'s flaws, it was just good enough to make me want to complete the series. It starts out slow, but eventually begins to pick up about halfway through.Art: 8/10The art is probably the strongest aspect of this anime. I thought the art was pleasing to the eye, and the battles against the Septentrions were always very entertaining and looked fantastic.Sound: 7/10I really like the music they used for the opening and the ending. The soundtrack for the anime really fit the anime and fit with what was going on.Characters: 3/10This is where the anime really crashes and burns. The biggest problem with Devil Survivor is that you feel nothing towards the characters. There\'s pretty much no character development, no back story. You don\'t really care what happens to them. If one dies you don\'t cry or feel much of anything but, ""Aw, they died, that\'s too bad."" I feel like this anime could have been a lot better if they had given us some insight into these characters and what they were really like.Enjoyment: 4/10This anime had it\'s enjoyable moments, but for the most part it wasn\'t anything that I was super excited to watch. I wasn\'t addicted, I wasn\'t hooked. Really I just watched it because I had too much time on my hands.Overall I give this anime a 6. It\'s characters and story were pretty bland, but it\'s art and sound saved it from being a complete train wreck. I\'d say unless you are completely bored out of your mind or have nothing else better to watch, try to avoid wasting your time on this show. with it\'s flaws, it was just good enough to make me want to complete the series.

Similar to Gantz, the main characters die in the first episode and get the chance to live again.  However they have to defend themselves against the demons that now plague the land, known as Septemptrians.  The story really gets rolling about halfway through, the ending is especially awesome.  It reminds me of Wolf's Rain in a lot of ways.Art: The animation was good, I really have no complaints.  I...love the designs of all the demons and creatures.  They all looked badass and awesome.  Especially Cerberus and Byakko.Sound: This is a sentai dub, so naturally I enjoyed it for the most part.  I'm pretty much a sentai fanboy.  I shamelessly bought the series blind because one of my favorite actors Greg Ayres was in it.  He played a very good Daichi.  Peter Poole as Hibiki was especially awesome, he's even a newer voice actor.  That makes me very excited for his future rolls.  And then Jessica Boone played Io, and did a fantastic job.  I loved her in Princess Tutu, as well.  I also like Illich Guardiola's role as Alcor.  He's another talented actor with a very unique voice, he's easy to pick out in a show.  John Gremillion as Yamato was a surprise.  He did so much better than Hakuro in Utawarerumono.  It's great to see how he's grown.My only problem with the dub is that the minor character performances were a bit bland.  That could be the lack of character developement, however.  Which is the result of time restraints.The opening and ending themes were catchy.  I can't get the opening out of my head, currently.  It made it hard to get to sleep last night.  Totally going to find them and listen to them over again on youtube.Character: With the exception of the three main characters, the rest of the cast was mostly uninteresting.  I only really got attached to our main leads.  As previously stated, the supporting cast struggled to stand out for me.Enjoyment:  In the beginning I only somewhat enjoyed it.  It was enough to keep me watching, but I wasn't dying to watch more.  Only when I got to the last half of the series did I really find myself liking the characters.  It made me cry, which I wasn't expecting at all.Another thing I enjoyed was the philosophy at the end of the series.  I won't go into too much detail,, but that was the most interesting aspect of the series.  The biblical references also added to the philosophy of living and wanting to survive.Overall: This series surprised me immensely.  Especially one based on a video game.  I enjoyed the story and main cast, and the dub was solid, albeit had it's flaws.  If you're going into this show without expectations, you'll probably enjoy it.  I haven't played the video game franchise it's based off of, so I can't say if that's a reason to watch it.  It's at least worth checking out in that case.  If you're looking for a fun show that gets darker as it goes on, and if you like philosophy, I would definitely recommend Devil Survivor 2.

Please support the official release."", 'The Shin Megami Tensei franchise is probably my favorite franchise of all time, and I honestly can\'t recommend it highly enough. There\'s something in the franchise for everyone, whether it\'s the post-apocalyptic setting of the main SMT games, the technological themes present in all of the games, the mythological aspects/themes, the contrast between order and chaos, the alternate history of the Devil Summoner games, the psychology of the Persona games, incredibly complex storyline of Digital Devil Saga or the subject of the review in question, fascinating perspectives on disaster striking in the Devil Survivor games.The franchise, with the potential exception of the main SMT games,...excel in making their characters feel and act extremely human and realistically. The games avert many common anime-related and fictional (as well as historical and religious) archetypes, which is done very differently from game to game.Before you read the rest of my review, I propose you start playing a MegaTen game (if you haven\'t already) and hopefully you\'ll understand exactly why this adaptation irritates me to no end. You can start from Persona 3, Digital Devil Saga or the first Devil Survivor ideally speaking, and don\'t be hesitant in asking for help or assistance from the fanbase (the games are very well-known for being extremely difficult).Now, I was extremely excited for the Devil Survivor 2 adaptation. The game deals with how a society reacts when it\'s on the verge of losing everything, deals with various complex political themes and aspects of government with a great deal of balance and moral ambiguity, and has one of my favorite cast of characters out of a video game. Even if I felt 26 (later reduced to 13) episodes weren\'t enough, I felt I can at least enjoy it as a fan of the game, just like I did with the Persona 4 adaptation (which was nowhere near perfect, but still fairly enjoyable as an adaptation and as a standalone anime).These expectations weren\'t much, but they were not met. In fact, the only thing that met my expectations in this mess was the soundtrack, which is really good and fitting of the mood of the show, and the artwork (designs being the same as the game) as well as the animation quality, which looked very pleasant to look at throughout the show.This is where my praise for the show ends. The story resembles that in the game on a basic and superficial level, that being the premise. While many aspects in the story resembled Neon Genesis Evangelion in the game, the game focuses more on the setting and how people react to the disaster striking. The themes were handled masterfully and carefully, from the various factions and their flawed ideals, their reasons for fighting and a lot of small scenes between the characters where they voice their doubts and question their reason for fighting in a world that has been razed to the ground.This is gone in the adaptation, as the futuristic aspect that was so important in the game is shoved aside and treated as a tool for drama rather than slowly but surely dropping hints about the nature of the plot. The fights against the Septentriones are not as satisfying as the fights in the game and lack the strategic depth that one would expect from a game adaptation that revolved around predicting your opponent\'s future strategies.I don\'t expect the fights to be the same as the game, but a lot of thought goes into beating those bosses and I at least should expect some strategy involved. Instead, the adaptation resorts to a lot of yelling and screaming to beat the bosses, which is extremely bad and makes the characters look like a bunch of idiots rather than them coming up with plans.The story doesn\'t resemble that in the game in terms of explanations either. Almost nothing about the demons or the events are explained, very little foreshadowing is present and almost no perspective or focus on the setting is present. I can think of only 7 minutes present in the entire show that attempted to present the setting properly, but even those are only within the first and second episodes, which are paced completely differently from the rest of the show.Speaking of pacing, have I mentioned how bad the pacing is? The first few episodes are slow paced and attempt to build up carefully. This isn\'t a bad thing, mind you, but you can get the impression from them that this show was going to be 26 or more episodes, because the events of the game happen in 8 days, while episodes 2 to 4 (4 is where I\'d argue the series completely lost it and started rushing to hell and back) focuses completely on the second day. The pacing feels inconsistent and nothing feels natural or planned out, almost as if the script was constantly being rewritten and the writers weren\'t entirely sure what to do.The writing in this show is pathetic. The game knew when to be happy, when to be tragic, when to be dramatic and balanced switching between the tones extremely well. This is all but gone in the adaptation, and there is absolutely no subtlety or balance in tone.The futuristic aspect doesn\'t work here the same as the game either, since the characters only, and I mean ONLY receive notifications in the game if someone close to them dies in the immediate future rather than receiving a notification every time someone is put in anything slightly resembling danger in the adaptation. It\'s similar to a small extent to how future diaries work in Mirai Nikki, except that it\'s more consistent and logical. In the adaptation, the power is inconsistent and weak, and the characters hardly react when someone is in danger or about to die, which means that the notifications about their future are more common and not taken as seriously by both the characters and the viewer.This brings us to the characters, who are mere shadows of their former selves at best and absolutely different people from who they were in the game at worst. The characters were very well-fleshed out and far from their basic archetypes in the game, and there were a LOT of small interactions that humanized them and made them more likeable and made us see them in a different light.This is completely gone, and the characters have been reduced to mere archetypes of who they were before. Hibiki was reduced from a snarky, flirty, random and sarcastic yet loveable and brave main character into a typical shonen hero, Daichi was reduced from a hesitant and rather cowardly but constantly gets braver character into the typical best buddy who says dumb jokes and is nothing more than a running gag, Io was reduced from a fairly shy young lady, hesitant about sharing her thoughts with others but straightforward and increasingly opens up to those around her to just the shy character archetype, and I can go on and on but I\'m pretty sure you\'ve gotten the idea by now.The characters never speak to one another and never act in any way resembling the way they acted in the game, and hating the characters here doesn\'t mean you\'ll hate them in the game considering that they share almost nothing in common with the exception of their appearance. They do resemble their characters in the game slightly in the beginning but honestly don\'t expect any normal or sane character interactions while watching this, because you will not find anything resembling that here.The Devil Survivor 2 ""adaptation"" is a complete and utter abomination that does not resemble the game in any way, shape or form. Everything has been reduced in both scale and implementation and is simplified for an audience that can just watch something better. The show doesn\'t resemble the game in any way, shape or form, and I honestly recommend you just start playing the Devil Survivor 2 video game instead of wasting time on this trash.As far as I\'m concerned, this adaptation doesn\'t exist and it\'s a shame, because this show could have been very popular and well-received if a better studio and production team was responsible. I wouldn\'t mind a remake in the future, but the chances of that are slim considering that the first ""adaptation"" didn\'t sell well in Japan and messed up as far as ratings are concerned big time.Oh well, back to playing my copy of Devil Survivor 2: Record Breaker, I guess... excel in making their characters feel and act extremely human and realistically. The games avert many common anime-related and fictional (as well as historical and religious) archetypes, which is done very differently from game to game.Before you read the rest of my review, I propose you start playing a MegaTen game (if you haven\'t already) and hopefully you\'ll understand exactly why this adaptation irritates me to no end. You can start from Persona 3, Digital Devil Saga or the first Devil Survivor ideally speaking, and don\'t be hesitant in asking for help or assistance from the fanbase (the games are very well-known for being extremely difficult).Now, I was extremely excited for the Devil Survivor 2 adaptation. The game deals with how a society reacts when it\'s on the verge of losing everything, deals with various complex political themes and aspects of government with a great deal of balance and moral ambiguity, and has one of my favorite cast of characters out of a video game. Even if I felt 26 (later reduced to 13) episodes weren\'t enough, I felt I can at least enjoy it as a fan of the game, just like I did with the Persona 4 adaptation (which was nowhere near perfect, but still fairly enjoyable as an adaptation and as a standalone anime).These expectations weren\'t much, but they were not met. In fact, the only thing that met my expectations in this mess was the soundtrack, which is really good and fitting of the mood of the show, and the artwork (designs being the same as the game) as well as the animation quality, which looked very pleasant to look at throughout the show.This is where my praise for the show ends. The story resembles that in the game on a basic and superficial level, that being the premise. While many aspects in the story resembled Neon Genesis Evangelion in the game, the game focuses more on the setting and how people react to the disaster striking. The themes were handled masterfully and carefully, from the various factions and their flawed ideals, their reasons for fighting and a lot of small scenes between the characters where they voice their doubts and question their reason for fighting in a world that has been razed to the ground.This is gone in the adaptation, as the futuristic aspect that was so important in the game is shoved aside and treated as a tool for drama rather than slowly but surely dropping hints about the nature of the plot.

After Dachi and Hibeki finish their mock exams, Dachi decides to show Hibeki a mysterious phone app called Nicaea. Nicaea is similar to Laplace from Devil Survivor. If you and a friend is registered on the Nicacea, then either of you can see the other’s death live. Nicacea prediction rate is 100 percent accurate.While Dachi and Hibeki were on the way home, the subway train crashes into them resulting in a new app being added to the cellphones. The cellphones...they use allow them to summon powerful demons from the original game. The demons can only be summoned in times of danger. This however, brings the attention a clandestine government group known as the “JPS” who are assigned to supernatural cases and also to keep an eye on the geothermal activities of Japan.Shortly after the subway accident, mysterious otherworld beings known as Sephritones start to appear and cause more chaos and disaster in Japan. Within a week, the Sephritones will destroy the world. It is up to Hibeki and friends to destroy the invading Sephritones and save the world.The story is accessible to those who hadn’t played the first game as the events happening during the game sets up its own story. The story is more linear than the game due its multiple branching points. It also contains the series themes of the occult and the coming apocalypse and our roles in these traumatic events.Anybody can die in every given moment of the show. When somebody dies, it does the same thing that Danganronpa, the anime has done and remove a character during the ending of the show. The devastation and apocalyptic events in the series can be compared to countless disasters throughout history. However, it is nothing compared to Dead Leaves where disasters randomly happens for no reason.The atmosphere is extremely tense and unnerving even more so than the manga adaptation of Devil Survivor 1 due to the shonenized elements in it. The body count is extremely high and corpses and destroyed buildings are decaying more with each passing day. The sequel focuses on the inner workings of the government of Japan and especially how they are clearly involved in shady activities in the occult. Just like in the first game and in the manga, they knew exactly what was going to happen and they let the terrible events unfold.There is no filler or padding and the story is fast paced although this makes the story feel rushed at times. The dialogue often appears to go in circles repeating obvious plot points. In fact, the comic relief dialogue was distracting from the main story. The way the series approach who lives or dies is the best thing of the Devil Survivor series along with its sense of suspense and deeper layers behind the events.Yamato Hotsuin the current leader of the JPS is very delusional and has a massive savior complex. His goal is to create a meritocracy where the strong rules the weak and he is very manipulative and always persuades others to do his bidding.   He is very preachy about his beliefs and if you don’t agree with even just one of the beliefs, he has he will consider you to be trash that deserves to be killed. Part of his belief in meritocracy is that everyone who has talent will be welcomed and because of this his, Darwanian viewpoint on life makes him believe that anybody who is a pawn should be discarded once they served their purpose. Yamato always sees himself as right and is close minded to different ideas. His ego is his biggest downfall and to him, the deaths of civilians is a small price pay for his ambitions. Nothing gets in his path for the JPS to rule the entire world and keep it in the state of a corrupt meritocracy.The dark and edgy animation style is incredible and the use of shadow and light effects for the visuals was perfect for the show. The digital special effects were brilliant as well. The artwork and character designs were faithful to the original game. The demons were impressive as well. The world design was nicely drawn and highly detailed while the musical score added another element of enjoyment to the anime.Everything else with the story goes downhill from here. The show throws multiple plot points all in once without connecting it in a cohesive manner. The relationships felt forced in and not properly developed just as the character backgrounds in the show. The action in the anime is hit or miss and while the animation itself was superb, it is easy to predict the winner of any combat. This predictability was boring and the fights were too short. The show cut out the final boss fight of the game. Instead, its Polaris asking Hibeki what is his wish. Even in Devil Survivor 1 manga, there was a climatic showdown between Metatron and Kazuya. The show is fairly short and has about 13 episodes. Plotholes and story inconsistencies were quite easy to find.The characters were really underdeveloped and completely one sided and uninteresting.  The anime also does not show fully on what life is like after the catastrophic events except for one scene where Dachi, Io and Hibeki were in one of the shelters trying to contact their relatives. The Sephritones are a bit of a mystery as the series don’t offer much information about them. The splash panels in Devil Survivor 1 managed to take its time explaining who and what kind of demons are but here they barely explained any.Personality wise, the characters aren’t multi-layered but more simplified. Hibeki in particular since he has the power to summon powerful demons, this automatically makes him the savior of the world.  Everyone else has demons that are weaker than Hibeki’s. He is the fortunate hero. He is incredibly preachy with his beliefs just like Yamato. Hibeki’s actions indirectly causes more deaths due to his recklessness.Airi another character, was poorly developed. She was just as annoying, reckless and stupid as Yuzu from Devil Survivor 1 and she creates unnecessary fights that could have been avoided. In addition, her voice was really high pitched and very grating to hear literally every time she speaks.  Character backgrounds for both Airi and her companion Jungo, were not fully established either. Jungo was lackadaisical and appeared unconcerned about what was going on around him.The voice acting was uninspiring and the dialogue was poor especially when compared to the original’s well written dialogue and story. The humor of the show is really badly placed. Lighthearted comedy during tense moments such as the scene in episode 3 where Dachi’s demons ran away from the more powerful demons seemed out of place. Dachi and other characters did not contribute much to driving the story and plot.I mentioned this in reviews like in Black Butler 2 and in Parasite Eve The Third Birthday, I have zero problems with fanservice if it makes sense in the story but in this case, it doesn’t as there is a bit of it in the show.It is fairly short and can be completed in a week or so. This contributes to the underdeveloped characters and story. There was unestablished plot points and parts of the story were not fully elaborated on. The plot was also disjointed and seemed to lose focus as it keeps jumping from one character to the next.Some characters get more screen time than others and this is what made the characters so unappealing and poorly written. Jungo had so much wasted potential as he was the only level headed and calm character in the entire show.With the unique idea of death being handle in the show you really don’t care much if certain characters die because of how one sided and flat they are. The show has an extreme amount of cliches seen in many other shonen works such as with friendship, every single obstacle can be overcome and the hero will always win.  The JP’s is really just another shady government group who wants to bring their supremacy to the entire world. There is so much shonen aspects in the story that if not for Shin Megami Tensai name it, would have been another run of the mill anime you see in Shonen Jump.Hibeki can easily win any fight he has because of how powerful his demons are. Not even in the easiest Shin Megami Tensai game like the Safety mode of Persona 5 can you easily defeat enemies with just a few hits. Scenes can be even more melodramatic then they already are because of the cliches.As someone who really is starting to get more into the Shin Megami Tensai series now this is certainly not the worst video game anime adaptation I watched but not the best either.You are better off buying the Shin Megami Tensai Devil Survivor games on the 3DS instead of watching this show. they use allow them to summon powerful demons from the original game. The demons can only be summoned in times of danger.

It hardly developed the characters in any proper light, nor did it give any adequate or interesting background to any characters. The viewer is just thrust into the world their in with little knowledge. The anime does not explain the plot well, a plot which is lacking. The entire idea of the anime is people can summon demons through cell phones & these people have to kill other demons. The actual...idea of demons fighting demons is not a bad one, but the way the anime does it is incredibly dumb, i mean summoning through a cell phone?, which has little weird guys that pop up in the phone that shows ""dead clips"" of your friends? it\'s a bit much. The sound for one is not entertaining, and the art is severely lacking. The animation if good, but the costume designs are so very stupid. The main character was wearing a bunny hat for gods sake, retarded. I would only really advise watching this anime if you have nothing else, otherwise go masturbate or something. idea of demons fighting demons is not a bad one, but the way the anime does it is incredibly dumb, i mean summoning through a cell phone?, which has little weird guys that pop up in the phone that shows ""dead clips"" of your friends? it\'s a bit much.

The main character was wearing a bunny hat for gods sake, retarded. I would only really advise watching this anime if you have nothing else, otherwise go masturbate or something.', ""Devil Survivor 2: the animation.What if you do the exact opposite thing from what Odert(Black rock shooter)? Instead of creating a anime that completely depends on the fans from a franchise, you create a anime that is practically only watchable if you do not know the history of the franchise but imply to it in the title in the first place? An anime that's quite good to follow and okay to watch, as long as you won't hold any grudges because of the comparation with the manga or initial game. I'd like to explain some more further going subjects about the anime in this review;...therefore, you are encouraged to skip the parts which do not imply on you as reader or gamer.For the ones that followed the franchise;I understand your ''i don't even--''  feeling. It's a dissapointment. Instead of actually putting a grip on the scenes which were important, they just left them out and mainly focused on thematic problems they encounter which are just part of the story; not the big line which MAKES the story in the first place. To avoid any spoilering; What the worst part is, is that they not only didn't left out most important scenes, they also  made the adaption contain scenes from either the game as the manga; WHILE these two aren't even close to insynchronized. And i keep the same feeling as you. However; Didn't you ever asked the question of ''Would this anime be good if we couldn't compare it to the franchise?''In otherwords; Comparing a anime to something that isn't a anime in the first place but a game and a manga, Is that correct?It's a bad Adaption, yes; i give you that. but as a stand-alone anime it could've gotten further than just a bad sis-com with triangle breasts.( the horror, the horror!)For the ones which are completely new with the series;The first thing you should notice is that the anime seems rather... usual. School kids gaining a super power to save their homes, lives and world. It's a pretty standard set-up and can actually bore alot of people. Now if you add the frustration i explained just up above to the ones that  actually played the game and/or read the manga, it doesn't end up well. What we CAN say, is that the anime itself isn't that horrificly bad. By the quality it delivers, it can be a good show to amuse yourself for some few more hours. I'm not implying here it's actually in the big ratings, No. However; It doesn't deserve the immensely negative aura it has these days.(both groups just continue here, please :3 )What really blazed my mind was the fact that several forums over the internet (Animelist, Bakabt, Crunch) had all kinds of conversations about this anime; The ones who didn't watch it and mainly praised the anime that it ''wasn't that bad'', while the ones who played the game and/or read the manga werefrom average to very, very negative about the adaption.Art.For the decency of our year, 2013, it's way to present anime got better and better. DS2 didn't stay behind and also used the best technique's for  the beauty of their anime. however. they used supreme animation skills, but lacked detailed backgrounds and details in many scenes. their action is very smooth, but yet again they left out details they could've added with just a few more weeks of editing.7.7/10Story.It's stripped, it's alot smaller, and quite dull. a Hero between the civillians, saving his friends.  It leaves out plotholes and story content. It's a bit saddening, but that's just how it is.The critique is mainly on this part and i have to agree with them.it's a story that you find in most romcons or harems; it's been done before, and  the originallity can be only found back in the game.5.9/10Sound.However. hey did apply alot of music themes and effects to boost up the animation. it's refreshing, skips rapidly and doesn't seem repetative. The intro theme is just fine as it is, and not over or under attended. Voice overs are okay, no one particulary good or well done.7.9/10Characters.Again, very dull.There is some character development and some slight flashbacks to ''their life what they HAD''. But once again, it misses out quite a lot.even for the people who didn't read the manga or played the game there seem to be something wrong or missing.It's just because this is one of the most important parts that the adaption is a dissapointment, but it's enough to substain a anime that can attract fans. you might want to call it a positive side to get them to play the game and read the manga, right? as a ending-tackle; most of the interactions seem to be forced and unnatural. i understand that if you present a half season (12 episodes),you do not have alot of time. But don't cover all your time up with mostly action, then!6.2/10enjoymentThe point here, is that most of the side-subjects are all scoring average. so no matter how you look at it or whatever you're searching for in a anime, there is not alot you can get out of this one. it might be a time-consuming anime whenever you have too many, and it's definatly a adaption you can skip as a DS-Gamer. However. It is more troublesome to watch Romcon anime's because this one is JUST as well made as a summon/survival as all others. For the fans who really enjoy these kind of anime; please go ahead. The rest; most of the specs are average. Most anime have their good attributions and their bad ones; Atleast a reason to find a specific audiance. but this one just has everything put on average. What you get as a result, is an anime that's more dull and boring than special or atleast interesting in SOME way. Ontop of the fact that the fans from the manga and games are just poking their eyes out after seeing the first episode already.Dissapointing for some, and average for others. just a small group might enjoy this till the very end; and to those: i wish i was you.3/10scoresArt: 7.7/10Story: 5.9/10Sound: 7.9/10Characters: 6.2/10Enjoyment: 3/10Overall: 6/10Thank you for reading my review.I'll see you next time ;)- Zumorito therefore, you are encouraged to skip the parts which do not imply on you as reader or gamer.For the ones that followed the franchise;I understand your ''i don't even--''  feeling. It's a dissapointment. Instead of actually putting a grip on the scenes which were important, they just left them out and mainly focused on thematic problems they encounter which are just part of the story; not the big line which MAKES the story in the first place. To avoid any spoilering; What the worst part is, is that they not only didn't left out most important scenes, they also  made the adaption contain scenes from either the game as the manga; WHILE these two aren't even close to insynchronized. And i keep the same feeling as you. However; Didn't you ever asked the question of ''Would this anime be good if we couldn't compare it to the franchise?''In otherwords; Comparing a anime to something that isn't a anime in the first place but a game and a manga, Is that correct?It's a bad Adaption, yes; i give you that. but as a stand-alone anime it could've gotten further than just a bad sis-com with triangle breasts.( the horror, the horror!)For the ones which are completely new with the series;The first thing you should notice is that the anime seems rather... usual. School kids gaining a super power to save their homes, lives and world. It's a pretty standard set-up and can actually bore alot of people. Now if you add the frustration i explained just up above to the ones that  actually played the game and/or read the manga, it doesn't end up well. What we CAN say, is that the anime itself isn't that horrificly bad. By the quality it delivers, it can be a good show to amuse yourself for some few more hours. I'm not implying here it's actually in the big ratings, No. However; It doesn't deserve the immensely negative aura it has these days.(both groups just continue here, please :3 )What really blazed my mind was the fact that several forums over the internet (Animelist, Bakabt, Crunch) had all kinds of conversations about this anime; The ones who didn't watch it and mainly praised the anime that it ''wasn't that bad'', while the ones who played the game and/or read the manga werefrom average to very, very negative about the adaption.Art.For the decency of our year, 2013, it's way to present anime got better and better. DS2 didn't stay behind and also used the best technique's for  the beauty of their anime. however. they used supreme animation skills, but lacked detailed backgrounds and details in many scenes. their action is very smooth, but yet again they left out details they could've added with just a few more weeks of editing.7.7/10Story.It's stripped, it's alot smaller, and quite dull. a Hero between the civillians, saving his friends.  It leaves out plotholes and story content. It's a bit saddening, but that's just how it is.The critique is mainly on this part and i have to agree with them.it's a story that you find in most romcons or harems; it's been done before, and  the originallity can be only found back in the game.5.9/10Sound.However. hey did apply alot of music themes and effects to boost up the animation. it's refreshing, skips rapidly and doesn't seem repetative. The intro theme is just fine as it is, and not over or under attended. Voice overs are okay, no one particulary good or well done.7.9/10Characters.Again, very dull.There is some character development and some slight flashbacks to ''their life what they HAD''. But once again, it misses out quite a lot.even for the people who didn't read the manga or played the game there seem to be something wrong or missing.It's just because this is one of the most important parts that the adaption is a dissapointment, but it's enough to substain a anime that can attract fans. you might want to call it a positive side to get them to play the game and read the manga, right? as a ending-tackle; most of the interactions seem to be forced and unnatural. i understand that if you present a half season (12 episodes),you do not have alot of time. But don't cover all your time up with mostly action, then!6.2/10enjoymentThe point here, is that most of the side-subjects are all scoring average. so no matter how you look at it or whatever you're searching for in a anime, there is not alot you can get out of this one. it might be a time-consuming anime whenever you have too many, and it's definatly a adaption you can skip as a DS-Gamer. However. It is more troublesome to watch Romcon anime's because this one is JUST as well made as a summon/survival as all others. For the fans who really enjoy these kind of anime; please go ahead. The rest; most of the specs are average. Most anime have their good attributions and their bad ones; Atleast a reason to find a specific audiance. but this one just has everything put on average. What you get as a result, is an anime that's more dull and boring than special or atleast interesting in SOME way.

Personally, as someone who has yet to play the Shin Megami Tensei games on DS, I cannot say whether it stays true to the game or not but personally, I found this game enjoyable. Perhaps some others felt that the game was much better, but for me I loved this anime nonetheless.At first, I was contemplating to drop this anime because the beginning seemed quite boring and plotless. The real hype was when they began to summon the demons and fight against the Septentriones in their endless and...overwhelming battle for 7 days as well as find the truth as to what should be done when the apocalypse has ended. There is strife between the protagonist and Yamato Hotsuin regarding what steps should be taken after they have defeated the last Septentrione. I admit that there were parts where I was just bored with the whole thing because those moments seemed pointless for those with short attention spans like me.Nonetheless, after I finished the anime I felt that it was incredible and that I loved it very much (Mostly due to the magnificent fight at the end which made me super excited). The plot is great and I recommend this for people who love fantasy anime. overwhelming battle for 7 days as well as find the truth as to what should be done when the apocalypse has ended.

Having played the series I had very high hopes for this anime and sadly it just didn\'t cut it for me. I mean sure the whole idea of trying survive ""God\'s Ordeal"" is there but I think it\'s lacking in a sense that it didn\'t hook me into it as the game did.The anime\'s \'flow\' if you get me is too fast paced which in my opinion leaves those that know nothing of this series confused and very likely to stop watching this anime. I mean what I saw in the characters were...not entirely the same as the game. Anyway I can\'t give this anime too much heat because I did enjoy seeing some of the choices that the MC A.K.A Hibiki Kuze made as they were similar to what I chose first. Also I also liked how they turned the game that I really loved (love so much that I finished all the available routes in the game and am still playing it >.>) into an anime.So all in all I think this was a decent effort, but I just wish that they didn\'t rush this anime too much and tried to take it how it\'s meant to be a slow paced, well-planned anime and polished. Then I would\'ve been a bit more happier.*Just so you know this is just my opinion and this is completely biased so I don\'t mean any offense if you totally loved this anime or have worse views on it than I do. not entirely the same as the game.

I have to shoulder all that, and survive."" - Hibiki KuzeDevil Survivor 2 The Animation is from the game Atlus produced(Nintendo DS), which brought us Persona 4 The Animation(PS2 console).Most of the game nowadays that\'s been turned into an animation don\'t pan out. Wonder why? I seriously think you can\'t cramp a 30+ hour gameplay RPG on a mere 12 or even 24 episodes. But let me tell you something, Atlus did just ""THAT""! They\'ve crammed 30+ hour games into 13 episodes! But worry not my dear friend, this time, it actually panned out. Of course they didn\'t include minor...details in the animation, but its still worth watching. Oh, and in the game, there\'s a lot of options/choices to choose from(typical SMT game).. And of course, at the game, you get to have your privy time with the supporting characters! Yatta! Oops, forgot I was making a review about the ""animation"". Sorry about that. Back to the main topic, the retelling of the story in the animation is a lot different from what\'s in the game. So even if you played the game, you can still enjoy a quite different story in the anime. Like I\'ve said, they\'ve cramped a lot of hours into 13 episodes, so expect a fast-paced story when watching this. Unexpected things which weren\'t common in the game is always present in the anime version, and that\'s what made the animation good.Although there have been slight difference on telling the story, the main plot doesn\'t change from where the game has led to. So I can safely say that what came out of the animation is on par within the game\'s story.The story doesn\'t quite drift away from most shounen shows nowadays, we have our Protagonist stuck with a difficult problem. It\'s about friendships, fighting monsters, conversations of hot guys, and finally, conversations with hot guys.Martyrs, martyrs everywhere. That\'s what I\'ve noticed on most of Devil Survivor 2\'s characters. It\'s not a bad thing though, definitely not a good thing either. But what can you do? The world\'s ending and you want to do something for the sake of your friends, that\'s not bad. But getting help from others is waaaaaaay better. Shouldering everything is pure heroic BS, that\'s why humans were made weak, so they can rely on other humans.Hibiki Kuze, O Sparkling One! Why the hell do you look like a rabbit(just kidding)?!The series is chuck full of bishounens and bishoujous(most of any series are.)! But the most crucial part and disturbing thing that destroys my whole mind, is that THERE ARE NO PETTANKO(s) at all! How could they do such a cruel thing?! Didn\'t they know that FLAT IS JUSTICE?! They said they\'re fighting for justice and humanity; but they\'re not FLAT, they\'re just flat out lying! Well, I knew it was coming anyway, since the game didn\'t have one either. Don\'t mind me, I was just ranting some BS.Devil Survivor 2 is a good series. It\'s not that great though, but it\'s not that bad either. It had its up and downs as far as entertaining the viewers. There were episodes that didn\'t make any sense(if you didn\'t played the game or any SMT game, you wouldn\'t quite understand what\'s going on.), well that\'s the hard part cramming up a long game to an animation. Like I\'ve said, many games that were animated didn\'t pan out. But Atlus does a fair job doing it. All in all, Devil Survivor 2 is a good watch(especially if you\'ve played the game). Not that long, has action-packed scenes, has great art, not so complicated plot. Plus you get bonus Yaoi materials on it, so feed your inner fangirl within you.Let\'s all survive!

Oh yeah, we need some chawanmushis too!', 'As someone who played the original game, I watched Devil Survivor 2 for what should of been a great story about fighting fate, death, and the end of the world. Instead what I got was a generic, carbon copy of Neon Genesis Evangelin that removes Mech\'s and changes them to Persona\'s. I\'ll admit the game was that way to a extent but it removes the key part of the game: depth and comedy.The biggest flaw with this show is how it ruins a good game by not treating the characters right. The characters are reduced to simple character traits instead of the more complex depths....Daichi is a comical coward who has weak demons, instead of the unsure, but determined friend who acts as the audience surrogate. Yamato is turned into a villain instead of a complex Anti Hero/Anti Villain depending on how you view while also making his obsession with the protagonist, Hibiki, be played up to homosexual subtext combined with Yandere control. By far the biggest offender is Joe, Otomoe, Ronaldo, and Fumi, who all are used for three episodes each and die with no build up. Fumi also dies in the worst way, doing one thing to help fight before being one hit KO\'ed.The lack of comedy also is a big slap since the game is filled with comedic moments to break the tension and suspense. When a character cracks a joke in game, it\'s to reassure and lighten the mood but also to raise morale. In the anime, it\'s fanservice jokes and nothing much.The story has no foreshadowing to it\'s obvious ending. Obvious being that they had to do the expected ending because they messed everything else up. The problem is that it isn\'t set up right and the anime treats it as the right and natural path. As if saying ""This was the intended route guys!"". It also doesn\'t explain our Angels-I mean Septentrions, since it makes Yamato the Final Boss instead of the main, real threat thats established in game half-way through. It\'s a big F-YOU to the fans of the game, especially since it doesn\'t add up once put under the analysis lenses. Basically it abridges the game but instead of using a shortcut, it blows the whole bridge and shrugs it\'s shoulders.Then there\'s the inconsistent story points. For example, main character Hibiki has super strong, level 40 in game demons at the start with no context why yet other characters get around the same level of demons in relation to the section of the game. There\'s no justification in story and the fact that the strategic team fighting is reduced to ""Hibiki can save us were team fodder"" is stupid.All in all the only good things are great animation, soundtrack, and voice cast on the subbed verison. If you watch the dub, don\'t. It\'s a horrible dub. Everything else is just horrible, offensive, and sad to see because Devil Survive 2 is a great game. It\'s avaliable on the 3DS with a great voice cast and storycontent. Daichi is a comical coward who has weak demons, instead of the unsure, but determined friend who acts as the audience surrogate.

And that\'s what I like. It has a mysterious side on it such as what will happen at the end of the world. I think, the concept of 7Days judgment is pretty unique and the way of fight is cool enough from the start till the end.One of the protagonist also exceeds my expectation since I really give up thinking that...he\'ll be useless until the end. And that\'s what breaks my ""BOREDOM"" on this anime. I think it\'s really a great anime.One thing I find is uncool is how they get to fight one after another demon/septentriones that it actually gets ""Yeah. I already know it"" feeling.Though I think, it\'s really the concept of the story. But somehow, i find it repetitive.Also, I don\'t really side on the protagonists state of mind since he\'s acting like a hero whatever who shoulders every burden of the world. So dramatic. But yeah. He\'s powerful. I know that.I like Hotsuin Yamato the most.ART - 8The art is quite good. But I don\'t know if it\'s just me or it\'s quite messy.Though the fighting scene\'s are ok, the expressions on the characters face is kinda lacking. But other that that, I think it\'s ok.SOUND - 9I really don\'t have a problem with the sound. I love the opening and ending song. And the voice actors, I think, did a great job on portraying the character\'s emotion.CHARACTER - 8The character is humane.Their decisions is based on their emotions. And it\'s great.The only one I find annoying is one of the protagonist. Though he\'s really strong, I find it crappy that he insist his way in and burden himself on too many things.It\'s like he\'s too perfect. And no one\'s perfect so it really isn\'t mvy type of character.But expect for him, the other characters successfully show their human emotions and decide to grow because of the problems they\'ve encountered.ENJOYMENT - 8I enjoyed it. Yeah.Most of all, the last episodes.There are some episodes I find quite boring to watch. Since as I said, it\'s quite repetitive.But yeah, I won\'t deny that I enjoyed it.OVERALL - 8Overall, I scored it very good.I enjoyed it.I like how the author didn\'t fail my expectation on the helpless protagonist.I like the concept of destruction and day of judgment.That there is hope in humanity.That human can still fight for each other.That there is a future waiting for them.And well, there\'s a second chance to change our ways. he\'ll be useless until the end. And that\'s what breaks my ""BOREDOM"" on this anime. I think it\'s really a great anime.One thing I find is uncool is how they get to fight one after another demon/septentriones that it actually gets ""Yeah. I already know it"" feeling.Though I think, it\'s really the concept of the story.

Anyways, this is yet another one of those videogames where teenagers summon monsters to defend the world. It has the same director of the Persona 4 (P4) adaptation, which is also a spin-off franchise of this one. I really liked P4 despite its cheesiness and expected Devil Survivor (DS2) to be around the same level but turned out it is a waste of time.So, the premise is sort of typical for the franchise. Some demons invade the word and some teenagers fight them with their own demons. The problem is that...despite the apocalyptic set up, nothing seems to make sense or feels important enough for you to care. You are just thrown into this mess and no real hooks exist for you to give a damn. I mean the main three characters look so dull and typical. As retarded as that other show with cell-phones and future predictions was, Future Diary had a very wimpy boy and a very psychotic girl; extreme enough for you to notice them. Plus you had a freaking god giving them a clear picture of what they have to do right away. This doesn’t happen in DS2 since it has bland main characters and the premise is not anything special or even clear.Another problem is the action part. It is so simple and boring to the point you again don’t give a damn. They just summon random monsters to fight each other and after a couple of energy attacks it is all over. P4 had similar battles but even there the choreography was more colorful, the bosses were relevant to the main characters, and the characters themselves were funny enough for you to care. Over here you feel nothing, even if the demons kill people by the hundreds in each battle. Who are these people for you to care? Who are these mass-produced identical demons with no relation to the main characters? So what if hell takes over Earth?Another thing which annoyed me are the cell phones. In this setting they are gateways to hell and all demons invade with portals created by them, or in other cases computers with access to the net. The heroes just press buttons on them and POP appears a monster to fight for them. They can do that as many times as they can and then they expect you to think it is hard or taxing. I mean, ok, in the game you have magic point consumption but the show doesn’t show that and all you get is a bunch of cardboards saving the world by playing videogame applications on their cell phones. GAH WHAT’S UP WITH ALL THE VIDEOGAME SHOWS? When I was a kid you needed to know martial arts or be affected by gamma rays to become strong enough to defend the world. Nowadays it is always about skinny dorks button-mashing consoles. WHERE IS THE FARTING CHALLENGE IN THAT?The facepalms continue with the obligatory secret organization which is fighting the demons. They have all this super technology and they still are unable to do squat next to three bland gamers. It doesn’t even seem that hard enough to stop them anyways; if the internet is a gateway to hell, then why don’t they simply cut the internet? Or if necessary, the electricity too. Yes, it would throw the world back a few centuries but it is still better to mankind be chopped to little pieces by demons, right? And you know what? It would make a bloody good conflict if that option was available but the corporations or addicted gamers were vertically against cutting the internet or the electricity. WE DON’T GET THAT!Yet another BS is the artwork itself. Not only the budget is rather low but the character designs are generic and the only thing that stands out is the fan service. Yes, you have demons from hell killing screaming people being less eye-catchy than some random cleavage shots. The main heroine has a huge rack, the videogame has a cosplay mascot girl and the secret organization is run by a half naked slut. JUST BECAUSE! Well if that is the case, then the anime should instead be called Drooling Saliver 2DEEP4U!!!And even if you somehow endure all the sleep-inducing plot, and the completely uninteresting revelations, you reach to a final showdown where the whole world is basically destroyed and made anew… exactly as it was before. Yup, they took the retarded time reset route where everything is back to normal and the apocalypse is like it never happened. Boy, that sure made the world to realize technology is not to be toyed with. Oh wait, it didn’t since NOBODY REMEMBERS IT!Meh, what a waste of funds. Atlus, go adapt Persona 2 and make sure to include Hitler. despite the apocalyptic set up, nothing seems to make sense or feels important enough for you to care.

Yes, it would throw the world back a few centuries but it is still better to mankind be chopped to little pieces by demons, right? And you know what? It would make a bloody good conflict if that option was available but the corporations or addicted gamers were vertically against cutting the internet or the electricity. WE DON’T GET THAT!Yet another BS is the artwork itself. Not only the budget is rather low but the character designs are generic and the only thing that stands out is the fan service. Yes, you have demons from hell killing screaming people being less eye-catchy than some random cleavage shots. The main heroine has a huge rack, the videogame has a cosplay mascot girl and the secret organization is run by a half naked slut. JUST BECAUSE! Well if that is the case, then the anime should instead be called Drooling Saliver 2DEEP4U!!!And even if you somehow endure all the sleep-inducing plot, and the completely uninteresting revelations, you reach to a final showdown where the whole world is basically destroyed and made anew… exactly as it was before. Yup, they took the retarded time reset route where everything is back to normal and the apocalypse is like it never happened. Boy, that sure made the world to realize technology is not to be toyed with. Oh wait, it didn’t since NOBODY REMEMBERS IT!Meh, what a waste of funds. Atlus, go adapt Persona 2 and make sure to include Hitler.', 'Dylan BurnsJust finished Devil Survivor 2: The Animation. I must say that was one good piece of work. Animation was great, characters were great, the plot was great, it was overall such a great anime. This really comes to show that video games can really have such a great plot, cause video games are awesome. LolIt had some epic battles, humanity had to fight demons the god Polaris sent to earth to test and were given demon summoning apps on their phones from one of gods mechanisms to help earth overcome the test for without them, they were doomed. Yamato and Hibiki were pretty...much the chosen ones although one chose the path that the strongest must rule and the other,i the path that everyone should be equal strong or weak and live side by side and work together. The plot is pretty much humanities struggle to overcome this 7 day test and meet Polaris , in the meantime the world disappears bit by bit within the 7 days.Was such a great anime10/10 much the chosen ones although one chose the path that the strongest must rule and the other,i the path that everyone should be equal strong or weak and live side by side and work together.

Idk about you but i haven't played this game and cant judge by how the game went compared to this but i have got to say for first impression. I want to buy this game. The plot is amazing. 7 Days of Judgement, Monsters/Beasts coming Once a day and having to destroy it. It was amazing. The idea of controlling Devils and using them to battle monsters. i have only seen one anime similar to that and that was Owari no Seraph. Anyway back to the point, the story seemed original (from what I...have seen. i can't say much because i haven't seen much anime), the Game seems awesome but overall, its great.

Well, by their will to live, friendship, and strength, of course.-Personal Opinion-This anime, Devil Survivor 2 The Animation, was based off of the DS game, Devil Survivor 2.I don't care about how others think about the animation after beating the game; I care about how I view it and how epic it was. I mean, I do have the game of Devil Survivor 2 and I haven't finished it yet... but I loved the anime more than the game.The game made me die, the anime made me cry, the game made me mad, and...the anime made me sad. Why do you do this to me?!Since I haven't completed the game, when I was watching this anime I had the urge to play it cause I was a bit jealous of the characters' demons... But then I remembered, I have to level myself up in order to not die... (Dang it)OKAY! Enough about the game!------------------------Things you should know-There was some parts in this anime that are disturbing because a lot of people die. Just be prepared to cry or at least be upset. (No spoilers)Overall: 9/10It is full of epic action and surprises in every episode. It's a very emotional anime and has a happy ending but it makes you sad/cry. Prepare for the feels.Recommended for people who like Sci-fi and/or supernatural anime with a twist (the twist is the feels, of course). the anime made me sad.

Great character design.The Bad: Mediocre story-telling. Boring plot.Conclusion: This anime has an interesting pokemon-like concept, where certain individuals are able to summon demons via their cell phones to fight for them. It starts out strong; but the plot just gets more and more boring after episode 4. The characters are generic. I found it hard to care about them. Unless you're a fan of the video game, I recommend passing on this one. "", 'Devil Survivor 2 isn\'t a mind blowing anime, nor does it try to be one. The anime is based on a game and feels very rushed at times, though it should be stated that it can\'t be helped, with only 13 episodes to work with. This doesn\'t mean the anime itself isn\'t enjoyable, on the contrary, I liked it enough to get angry at everyone whom rates this with a 4 or lower so I decided to write a review, forgive me for my clumsiness at it.Beware of slight spoilers from here on.The story is fairly simple: an ordinary high school boy is fighting...for his life, those of his friends and eventually for the fate of humanity itself. Personally I think that\'s where the strong point of the anime lies, the battle about what should happen with humanity in the end. The world is put through 7 days of trials. If humanity survives this, they can request an audience with the ""god"" of this world and get their wish fulfilled. But with the fate of humanity at stake, which wish is the right one?Yamato Hotsuin thinks that those with power and talent should rule and doesn\'t think twice about sacrificing people for the greater goal. The rebel leader believes everyone should be treated equally yet has to admit that Yamato\'s radical actions work. During the battles and life threatening situation our main character has to find the answer to the question ""how should humanity advance after this?""Now I won\'t say the anime is a very deep psychological one, it doesn\'t seem to want to be one, but if you think about it, the story itself is rather interesting. Sure, the rushed pace and the ""obvious"" choices the main character makes aren\'t ground breaking but honestly; they\'re very human-like. The main character is a normal high school boy whom suddenly, without him wanting to, has to decide the fate of humanity itself. He isn\'t like Lelouch or Light, he isn\'t driven by some ultimate goal nor has he ever wished for things to turn out like this. He\'s simply a gifted with power and bound by ""Noblesse Oblige"". And that\'s what makes him, if you ask me, so likeable. He\'s a normal high school boy whom simply doesn\'t want the people around him to get hurt.Art: I don\'t know anything about ""fluid"" animation or high quality movements but my personal opinion is that everything is fine. Sure, there are shows with better and smoother animation, yet there are ones with worse ones. I like the character designs a lot and the colors they used for the anime.Sound: The background music is well done and fits the atmosphere of the anime. I especially like the ending, for some reason it seems to really fit the overall feeling of the anime.Overall Enjoyment: As I said earlier, the story isn\'t very complicated yet if you\'re willing to think about it yourself, it\'s actually rather deep, I personally liked that a lot. The characters are fine, not everyone gets a chance to develop through the anime as much as I wanted to yet they\'re all likeable enough. There is enough action and even though it\'s a bit rushed; it\'s honestly a fine anime that doesn\'t deserve the bashing it gets.The best point of the anime is, I guess, the fact that the main character seems to be so very human-like. He isn\'t able to turn a blind eye on someone suffering right before his eyes and his way of thinking might be ""simplistic"" yet it\'s also so very, very human-like. Just think about it, if you yourself would be in his position, would you honestly be able to do things differently? I bet most people wouldn\'t. He\'s not flashy and isn\'t overly optimistic, he just tries to do whatever he can to change the fate of his friends. And honestly, how can you dislike him for that? for his life, those of his friends and eventually for the fate of humanity itself.

Is pretty good to be doing a review about my actually favorite anime.- Story -*Score: 9The story is really original, like, cmon, have seen a anime where the people go to take battles with their cellphones? Well, if not, i can tell that this is a show for you.Is scored as ""Great"" because is really hard to see a story like this, i dont like the typical idea that mentions something like — ""So, the anime is just starting, and by one moment to another, everything got destroyed"".Thats a generalist idea of most of the "" Harem - Shonen"" you can see nowdays, but,...taking that out, is a damn good story.- Art -*Score: 8Talking about animation, i dont see problems with the animation, but, why it is scored with a 8? That\'s simple, is just because im a huge fan of the monogatari series, and to be honest, if you do a comparation, you are just going to get that the animation of Devil Survivor 2: The Animation, is ok, but is not the best art to give it a 10 or a 9.- Sound -*Score: 10I dont have too much to talk about, if we\'re talking about the ending/opening, i just can\'t say anything, the opening\'s name is Take your way, you don\'t need to actually read the translation of the song, because, it gives you that sensation of tranquility that you need, that message that says ""everything is ok if someone is with you"".The ending, well, it does have a interesting detail, but, i don\'t want to do spoiler \'bout the show, so, im just going to say that the feeling that the opening gives to me, is exactly what the ending does too.- Character -*Score: 7Ok, Andre, you gave me a nine on story, but, why a 7 in character?Well, y\'all know that, not because the story is that good, the development of the characters is going to be exactly the same.Devil Survivor 2: The Animation is actually a game-based anime, so, isn\'t weird that the characters aren\'t that good tho.- Enjoyment -*Score: 8The anime is really good, but it gets boring at some moments, you can\'t expect that this show keep that ""good emotion"" all the course, but, is not that bad, not all the animes are that perfect, and this one is not a exception.But, almost all the anime is really interesting, highly recommended.--- OVERALL ---*Score: 9The anime gives you that emotion, that feeling that the anime wants to pass to all the world, this anime wanted to say something to me, and it got it.I really recommend it, is not perfect, but for me, is a really masterpeace.Thx,— Chang. taking that out, is a damn good story.- Art -*Score: 8Talking about animation, i dont see problems with the animation, but, why it is scored with a 8?

The show is solid.Story, it was interesting enough, nothing made me think ""Now that is cool"". The story consists of some fairly mediocre writing that is held together by its strange pacing by just quickly moving onward when things don\'t quite make sense.Art. Generic is the first word that comes to mind. The animation quality is not so bad as to cause me any noticeable discomfort, but nothing struck me as amazing.Character. The characters in this show just sorta exist, they don\'t really act like people or feel very...human or nuanced, I think this is because content would have been cut from the larger game to make this animation but honestly that\'s a best guess. They have no major inconsistencies though.Would I say I enjoyed the series, yeah probably, but not all that much. It is something that really borders on the edge of whether or not something is worth watching but I think in the end the show is solid enough all around it can be enjoyedUltimately I find that this show is passable in all regards, nothing in this show stands out as amazing or horrible. I believe that it is truly middle of the road, however this elevates it slightly because something that is done well in all things elevates it slightly. As someone who never played the game, I think this show is worth the time it takes to watch it however it is forgettable in every way. human or nuanced, I think this is because content would have been cut from the larger game to make this animation but honestly that\'s a best guess.

Genres and themes include action, fantasy, supernatural, demons, friendship, free will, apocalypse scenario, and in an indirect way, survival game. The anime was created by Studio Bridge, known for being the studio of the ever popular series Fairy Tale. Fifty thousand users on myanimelist.net have ranked Devil Survivor 2 at 7.05, with reviewers giving it a fair mix of votes from 3 to 10. While few people have rated it on Crunchyroll, the average is four out of five stars. In contrast,...on IMDb, users have only rated it 6.4 out of 10.As you can see, the popularity of the show is not great, and opinions on it differ significantly. To start with, Devil Survivor is based on a game, so the average viewer who hasn\'t played the game may not appreciate it as much. On the other hand, some of those who did play the game and reviewed the anime online seem to be unsatisfied with the adaptation. Other complaints were that the show was too similar to the classic Neon Genesis Evangelion and lacked originality. For me, these reasons either don\'t apply or are not enough to make me dislike the show. I have never played the games, so I was not expecting a perfect adaptation. I found the anime perfectly understandable without having to play the game. In addition, I liked the similarities to Evangelion and I felt that Devil Survivor had just enough originality to make it not seem like a rip-off.Story and StructureI thought the story was excellent. Saving the world from demons or otherworldly invaders might be unoriginal, but there were enough other elements to it to make it good, such as the story of Mono Ureu, the Anguished One, the friendships between the characters, the character of Yamato and his ultimate goals, and the ""magic application"" system on the phones. More than being a story about saving the world, it was the story of a boy who believes in free will (Hibiki), a man who believes that might makes right (Yamato), and a being who has developed human thoughts and emotions when he was not programmed to do so (Mono Ureu). How do the three of them interact, what is their relationship, what makes them enemies, and what could make them friends?The story structure was well-done too, divided into _ days. Episode 1 covers Sunday, episodes 2-4 cover Monday, episodes 5-6 cover Tuesday, episodes 7-8 cover Wednesday, episode 9 Thursday, episode 10 Friday, episode 11 Saturday, and episodes 12-13 Sunday. Major plot points can be thought of as each major battle: the first Septentrion in episode 1, the second Septentrion in episode 4, the third in episode 6, fourth in 8, the battle with Lugh after the sixth Septentrion in 10, and each of the three major battles in 11, 12, and 13. This structure is n0t quite as effective as the 1-3-6-8-10-12 structure, but it is used without problems here because of the number of battles that need to be shown (there needs to be time for Yamato\'s fights with Mono Ureu and Hibiki after the seven Septentrions).ArtI am not an artist and don\'t know a lot about animation, but for me, the art was enjoyable. The character designs in particular I liked. Hibiki\'s rabbit hoody is kind of unforgettable, and even minor characters, such as Tico, were memorable in design. At first I thought the character design for the Anguished One had elements that were overused for his character type, such as stripes and white hair, but it grew on me over time, and it turned out he was much less of a stereotypical character than I had initially assumed. The fantasy battles were amazing to watch. When CG is used, it is mostly used well, and does appear too jarring. A lot of thought must have gone into the designs for all the demons, not to mention the Septentrions and their attacks. I love mythological creatures and animals, so I loved seeing Suzaku the Phoenix, Byakku the white tiger, and Yamato\'s lion demon (who was strangely named Ceberus).Sound: Seiyuu, Songs, and ScoresDevil Survivor 2 had a fantastic cast. Famous seiyuu Hiroshi Kamiya played main character Hibiki Kuze. He has played various unforgettable roles such as Yato in Norigami, Levi in Shingeki no Kyoujin, Araragi in the monogatari series, Nozomu in Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei, and more. He plays any character well, even the idealistic and sometimes naive Hibiki. Daichi is played by Nobuhiko Okamoto, now known for voicing Rin in Blue Exorcist.  Various other talented seiyuu appeared. A favorite of main is Ami Koshimizu, voice of Kallen in Gode Geass and Ryuuko in Kill la Kill, playing Hinako in this series.I enjoyed the opening and ending themes as well as the scores in this anime. Ending song ""Be"" by Song Riders was a special favorite that always moved me emotionally. On YouTube, the only OST available for Devil Survivor 2 is the OST for the game and not the anime. So it\'s hard to say much about the scores used in the series. If memory serves me, I believe they were beautiful and appropriate.CharactersOnce again, the characters were enjoyable and well done in this anime for the most part. At first, some development is lacking, such as working out the character of Nitta, but she eventually gets her time. This is a short series with quite a few characters, so Devil Survivor 2 naturally doesn\'t develop them as much as shows with fewer characters or more episodes, but given the restrictions, the show does an excellent job.The three main characters to consider end up being Hibiki, the humanist, Yamato, the power-driven, and Ureu Mono, the questioner. How these characters interact and play out during the show was entertaining and thought-provoking for me. I felt that although Hibiki is characterized as the ""good guy,"" the other two were not demonized or anything, and it\'s possible to enjoy the show while agreeing with them more than wih Hibiki if that\'s the way of your personal values.EnjoymentAs usual, enjoyment is the most important element for me in rating an anime series. I enjoyed nearly every moment of Devil Survivor 2. One specific thing I liked was the theme that to be human is to question, and that the continued questioning will lead to mental and emotional anguish. I believe life is very much like that, so Ureu Mono was my favorite character. I also liked that Hibiki had strong friendships in the anime without there being canon romance, so you can either pick a shipping or consider them platonic friends. My inner yaoi fangirl enjoyed some thoughts of Hibiki and Daichi, but when I take the story seriously I feel that no romance is really needed. It might make for a good fanfiction though. on IMDb, users have only rated it 6.4 out of 10.As you can see, the popularity of the show is not great, and opinions on it differ significantly.

It might make for a good fanfiction though.', ""Episodes 1 to 9 *Yawn*Episodes 10 to 13 *Okay things starting to get slightly more interesting*The above is basically my very simplistic summary of my experience with Devil Survivor 2. But obviously I'm going to go more in depth about this show, first off lets begin with the story.Pretty much Devil Survivor 2 is about a group of people attempting to survive and fight back against enemy demons, defeat seven Spetentiones (if I spelt that right haha) and prove themselves to an all powerful being. To be honest it sounds cliché but, it's one of those stories that are fun to tag along when done...right. And I mean when it's done right. The problem with this show is that it's boring as hell for the first nine episodes, they basically rinse and repeat five to six battles with Spetentiones. Now obviously the battles aren't copy and paste, in matter of fact the battles in this show are quite entertaining to watch. What brings the story down in this show are the lacklustre backstories of the characters and the non-existent side stories, you're left bored out of your mind until they get to the battles with the Spetentiones. What makes it even worse are the characters themselves but, we'll get to that later. If you want a glimpse at how bored I was for the first nine episodes it took me almost a whole year to watch them, yeah I know. Thankfully from episode 10 and onwards the story gets slightly interesting not very much though, the conflicting moral ideals of both Hibiki and Yamato peaks your interest and the ending sort of leaves you wondering what happens next other than that the story doesn't get much better. The show always seems to be rushed and missing essential scenes like you'll be watching one episode then in the next the interactions between certain characters seem to be different to previously as if they threw a huge chunk of content out the window between to episodes. On and end not for this section I also hear the show is based of a game, and by god I hope it isn't as average as this show because if it isn't I feel sorry for fans of the license.Art wise, the show does good on the backgrounds aren't amazing but, not terrible either so you can feel thankfully that they got that part right. The character were okay however they weren't anything to marvel at unless you're me I did like Alcor's design of I dunno retro style whatever it was I liked it. On the other hand where the art style truly stands out is the battle sequences you're met with a nice spectacle of light shows I must say though sometimes it can be quite the cluster fuck so be prepared to lose sight of what's happening in some of these scenes.As for the sound it was above average, I really liked the shows choice of opening song one of the few reasons I came back to finish the show off. However the soundtrack beyond isn't really memorable except for the battle scenes. Finally I do have to say that the sound effects for powers or fighting from demons was pretty damn good and I could say the same for the fights between humans.Hahaha, now we come to the part where I was so close to giving this section a 2 or 1 for its characters but, I'll tell you why I didn't. One name, Alcor. He was the only character I was ever interested in, the only one I wanted to find out more about as he had an interesting back story granted it still wasn't amazing, however on terms of the other characters he'd be rated 7 or higher. It wasn't only that one reason why I liked him, it was because of his presence in scenes he made the other characters a bit more likable and interesting. He's basically the glue of cast that keeps it all together when he's on screen when he's not the show just falls apart.There isn't much to say about the other characters except they're your normal everyday life people. On the other hand I have to make a comment about *I quote* the 'Boring Scumbag Duet' what I mean is Yamato and Fumi (I think that's her name at least) those two are soooo boring it got to the point where I wished they'd trip over a nail impales their throat. So you can hear the sounds of them choking on their blood in the background, their personalities were that of douchebags and I had a habit of sleeping when they spoke. Granted Yamato does get interesting a tiny bit from episode 10 and onwards but, not enough to warrant liking him.Enjoyment wise it really depends on your expectations, if you go into this not expecting much it might be a fun show to waste some time. But if you're like me expecting a good show then you may be disappointed with what you get. If you're a fan of the Devil Survivor games (yes they're games and I hear they're favourable received in Japan) then none of this may affect you or sway your decision to watch this, as for me this is my first exposure to the license.Overall the show is just average, it doesn't get better or worse just stays in that mid line the whole to time with a few dips up and down here and there. I would only recommend this on two situations 1) you have no other anime to watch in one of the anime seasons (even though there are betters shows to watch that you may not have seen. And finally 2) if you're already watching one or two shows in an anime season and you just want to past the time between them.Ultimately I'm just viewing my opinion I can't tell you whether you'll like it or not, all I can say is check out a few episodes then decide. right. And I mean when it's done right. The problem with this show is that it's boring as hell for the first nine episodes, they basically rinse and repeat five to six battles with Spetentiones. Now obviously the battles aren't copy and paste, in matter of fact the battles in this show are quite entertaining to watch. What brings the story down in this show are the lacklustre backstories of the characters and the non-existent side stories, you're left bored out of your mind until they get to the battles with the Spetentiones.

Well, I was immediately attached to the characters and the opening theme. This anime carries good quotes and the fights between demons are just thrilling. My main disappointment would be how there were only 13 episodes. I feel like they could have added so much more, like showing more interaction between the characters. I recommend this anime and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. ', ""I went into the show with absolutely zero knowledge of the game(s) and still was able to enjoy it quite a lot.Some of the visuals are really pretty and the music slaps. The characters, especially Alcor, are what really made the show. The relationship between Alcor, Hibiki and Yamato is what especially stood out to me.The supportive characters are alright as well, not super amazing but also not extremely annoying.I also really really enjoyed the ending of the show. In general I'd say that the show gets better as the episodes go on and the story progresses.Also, yes, it does show similarities to Evangelion but...it is still very, very much different from it.Over all I'd say that the anime is indeed no master piece BUT in my opinion very well suited for a casual watch. it is still very, very much different from it.Over all I'd say that the anime is indeed no master piece BUT in my opinion very well suited for a casual watch."", 'I have gone through the 3ds game with my friend and we both decided to watch the anime adaptation dubbed to see why people didnt like the anime. Well after watching it we both see why.Ill start with the few good things I actually liked about the anime adaptation. The animation itself was actually quite good, it moved well and the art looked like how the games looked for the characters. The opening song is a banger and def worth a listen on its own. Finally there was one scene in the anime I thought was actually a good inclusion because it showed a little...bit into the childhood of Hibiki.Now onto the bad stuff: First off I know the anime came before record breaker, but it was surprising to hear both have completely different voice actors and actresses as atlas is known to usually have the English voice actors and actresses be the same from game to anime, like the persona 4 and 5 adaptations, though I feel it was a good choice because most of the voices in the anime version dont sound as fitting as the games voices. Secondly it was baffling to hear them mispronounce alot of the names and outright say the wrong demon name in episode 7 as Daichi summons a Black Frost, yet calls it Jack Frost.Finally The story Itself felt very empty since they basically took away all the free time events that the game has. This basically means that all character development of most of the cast is thrown out the window in favour of just the struggles between the cast and the septentrions, as well as their own free time events that only develop 5 of the characters (That being Hibiki, Io, Daichi, Alcor and Yamato). Now the issue with that is that they expect you to care about the others when they die, which works well for the game but does not work in the anime.This could all be not so bad if Hibiki was not the most whiniest teen in the show, going from ""Im gonna save these people"" to ""Oh no they are dead, let me go be sad for a bit"" and then back again over and over. Also its quite funny to see Hibiki summon a demon with an electricity ability and then mainly just stick with it throughout the anime, only summoning 2 other demons and with one of them being the big bad demon that ends it.Another thing that bugged me is that apart from Daichi, the rest of the cast only summoned one demon at a time when the game allows you to summon 2 demons at a time, and Daichi\'s demons were mostly weak apart from when he summons Black frost (they rely on that joke alot, kinda got boring after awhile)If you have played the game and are also curious, dont bother watching the anime adaptation, and if your new to the whole devil survivor thing, please play the ds or 3ds version of the game, or even play the first devil survivor game, you will have a much better time doing that bit into the childhood of Hibiki.Now onto the bad stuff: First off I know the anime came before record breaker, but it was surprising to hear both have completely different voice actors and actresses as atlas is known to usually have the English voice actors and actresses be the same from game to anime, like the persona 4 and 5 adaptations, though I feel it was a good choice because most of the voices in the anime version dont sound as fitting as the games voices.

Just watch the anime in 2024. LmaoThe animation is good enough. I read couple other comments. For my personal opinion. It's okay anime. The trio MC act looks real enough. If you irl suddenly throw in chaos and miraculous get second chance to life and with monster stuff. If you play game in your life, you can grab what happened quicker.I just don't know why they not checking the application more. Lol, maybe for the ending. (About the mixing demon.) And why the monster limited(you can use 3-4 in battle. I think)I can get Io nitta feeling...and she's fictional human with human emotion. She worry, crying. And even become try to be brave to save other.For other characters. Irl human even do stupid things.

Dragon Ball: Ossu! Kaettekita Son Gokuu to Nakama-tachi!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5152/Dragon_Ball__Ossu_Kaettekita_Son_Gokuu_to_Nakama-tachi,"[""This is my first review, so please don't take it too seriously. This is the first Dragonball animation in 11 years. I don't know about you, but I was really looking forward to this when I first heard about it.-Story-Nothing too revolutionary, But not as boring as the older Dragonball Z movies. Its kept the Dragon ball Z fighting and humour style.-Art-I thought this was going to be just like the old Dragonball Z series, but I was wrong. They re-did it, it now looks new and clean. The animation is great and the fights are good also.-Sound-At the beginning you get introduced with the...classic music, but with a new opening. It still has the same good punching, kicking and energy blast firing sound effects. The Japanese cast (this isn't dubbed in english...yet) did a very good job, although I wasn't too fond of Goku or Gohan's voice.-Characters-It has the original cast. Goku is still funny and always hungry, Piccolo is a loner, and Vegeta is still really angry at something. Master Roshi is still the same old pervert too. There's a particularly funny scene where he pulls up a lewdly shaped turnip. Goten and Trunks also fuse into Gotenks to fight the invaders.-Enjoyment-I got a kick out of this. It was good to see Goku and friends in another adventure, even though it probably will be their last (unfortunately).-Overall-I recommend this to any Dragonball Z fan. If you are new to the series, you might want to watch the Episodes before going into this movie to know all the characters and their personalities. I give it an 8/10 classic music, but with a new opening. It still has the same good punching, kicking and energy blast firing sound effects.

I give it an 8/10"", ""I cannot believe it has really been eleven years. It seems like just yesterday I saw &quot;Wrath of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;A Hero's Legacy.&quot; Though it's true, Goku and company are back in the latest installment of Dragon Ball: Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!First off, I'm going to solely recommend this to existing Dragon Ball fans. 9/10's of the enjoyment of this special is the nostalgia it emits. For starters, almost the entire main cast is featured, from Goku and Vegeta to Old Kai and Bubbles the monkey (who, as we all remember, passed on many a year ago thanks to...Goku). However, there is the odd absence of Tien and Chaozu. This really bothered me, not because I am a particular fan of the Crane School, but just because I respect the roles they had to play in both &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. Although, seeing the faces of all the other characters did warm my heart.Another nostalgic aspect of this chapter, is that they revive the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; humor and incorporate it into &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; style fighting sequences. You might say they took both series and did a fusion-ha....no applause please.The story of &quot;Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!&quot; isn't that impressive. However, the audience does get to meet Vegeta's long lost little brother, Tarble. This is as interesting as it is cheesy but I'm just glad to know there was at least one more stupid monkey out there that Freeza wasn't able to finish off.The old theme song is back with new animation to fit the time period and I honestly believe it couldn't have been done better. However, I do take up issue with the Japanese voice acting. Though, this is probably just because I grew up watching the dub on Cartoon Network, I just can't get over the fact that Goku sounds like a little girl. And it's not just because the voice actor if Japanese and has a higher pitched voice than we westerners do, Goku actually sounds like he's being voice by a twelve year-old girl.Now the animation is the one aspect of this special that fails in almost no way. It's wonderful to see Bird Studio breathe new life into classic characters. If nothing else, watch this anime to relive something that you've possibly long forgotten, I promise you won't be disappointed, unless you're a Tien or Chaozu fan, then don't watch it. Goku).

Although there is no a big fight with powerful enemies I felt that this special was just to bring the anime back to life in the memory of many fans, after 11 years. I loved the way they redid the opening ""Chala-Head-Chala"" introduced the current characters (Goten and Trunks). The comic side still remains, with the ""brawl"" between Goku and Vegeta. At the end everyone ends up participating in the battle. is a great special, more not as interesting as the ""Episode of Bardock"". ', ""Now don't get me wrong here, i am a huge DBZ fan. I recently joined this site a few days ago and came across Yo Son Goku n Freinds Return so i had to check it out.On the good side The animation definitely is cleaner and more well done.Now for the cons...Goku did not act like Goku at all, Vegeta cant have a brother that young, his father died when he was only about 5 years old, remnants of the Frieza force would NEVER be able to last a second against Goten or trunks, who each at that time have an individual fighting strength...of about 30 million, Gotenks..... now where the hell does he get off doing the wolf fang fist????? LOLAll in all i would give this a 3/10... thats all its worth... think about it.... how is it possible for vageta to have a yunger brother.... lol its not, that is why if you go to the dragon ball z web site he is no where to be seen!!!this whole movie was a contradiction to DBZ, and well, pretty much this movie spitts in my face and in DBZ's face.. its pathetic... save your self the time of about 30 million, Gotenks..... now where the hell does he get off doing the wolf fang fist?????

This is pretty good fodder for an actual plot, you know! But instead it\'s a silly ""lol these dudes are weak so let\'s not take it seriously at all"" story where the characters banter...with each other and not much else. Vegeta\'s brother completely disappears from the story about halfway through! I wanna know more about this dude!But whatever, back when it came out in 2008, it was probably a welcome sign for fans that the franchise hadn\'t been completely abandoned.

The special takes place in between the end of the Buu saga and (at the time non-existent) Super, and really it's just an excuse to see our characters we like hanging out only to transition to a low stakes action setpiece predominately featuring (kid) Trunks and Goten. I mistakenly skipped over this when I watched Battle of Gods but now that i've circled back around, I feel like Battle of Gods actually might have taken...from this special, mostly in terms of structure and focus (ie, old weaker characters mattering, a focus on comedy and the action setpiece at the end). I think overall Battle of Gods did a better job with this formula, but I do prefer the production aspects of this special, which surprised me with consistent art and a lack of garish digital coloration/bad CG (which means above average for digital Toei). The characters all felt a little flanderized, but never too ridiculously far that it felt offensive (though Vegeta was getting there). Overall this is a low stakes, simple side story with the characters you know and love from the manga and original anime. Totally skippable, but totally watchable too.Random additional thoughts:-Launch was remembered!-Vegeta having a little brother stretches belivablity in canon a bit-Power scaling is a bit fucky (main villain should have been obliterated in two seconds lol) from this special, mostly in terms of structure and focus (ie, old weaker characters mattering, a focus on comedy and the action setpiece at the end).

Fate/stay night TV Reproduction,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7559/Fate_stay_night_TV_Reproduction,"['Wow. Just wow. Jamming such a story as vast as Fate/Stay Night into two hours is not a good idea. It definitely isn\'t. Fate/Stay Night TV Reproduction is basically a summary of the 2006 series. While it includes most of the important bits, so much of the much needed dialogue and scenes were just missing. This is not meant to be seen before the TV series.Story [6]: Not good. While it does somewhat convey the overall storyline, it still leaves many things unanswered. So many plot points have been removed that it just doesn\'t feel like the story was really engaging at any point. Scenes...will just jump around and you will be left wondering how this or that happened. For example, Shirou and Saber are recovering from a battle and then in the next scene, they\'re fully healed and already in a completely different location fighting another battle. What happened in between? How did they get there? Why are they suddenly healed so quickly?

It\'s still crisp and clear and it conveys the what is supposed to be colorful characters in the anime.

The music from the VN and the anime are still here. A nice blend of mellow tunes that kind of fits into the shortened disjointed scenes but lacks to really draw us back in to the world of Fate/Stay Night.Character [6]: This is where this two part summary really falls. So much of the dialogue between the characters and their developments were removed for the sake of time. Barely any characters had any development whatsoever. The only characters to even get a sliver of development were Shirou and Saber but even that was just nearly non-existant. The dialogue between all of the characters was what made them great but alas, without it, we don\'t really care much about them at all.Enjoyment/Overall [7/6]: While I enjoyed immersing myself into the world of FSN once again, the disjointed and heavily cut direction really distracted me from keeping up with the story. The scenes were just jumping around so fast that they don\'t let you absorb what had actually transpired then. This is a poorly made summary recap of the original FSN. While it will remind you of most of the important things that happen, it doesn\'t really pull you back in the world of FSN.

Read the novel instead.  It's significantly better than either of these anime.If you have seen the Fate/stay night anime, don't bother watching this, either; the only new material is the OP+ED, and although I'm a fan of Tainaka Sachi, this new remix of disillusion wasn't great.I watched...this because I spotted [Doki]'s fansubs and thought it might be worth a re-watch.  I guess I was hoping in vain that these OVAs would be an improvement on the original anime.  They're not.  If I weren't nerdy enough to remember the plot of F/sn in its entirety two years after reading it, I'm sure I would not have been able to follow the story of TV Reproduction.  Many scenes are skipped entirely.  Others appear as minute-long clips with one or two lines, thrown in with absolutely no transitions or explanations or anything.  DEEN didn't do such a bad job the first time around when it came to keeping crucial plot points (aside from Bondage Sakura and some other tidbits), but in TV Reproduction they're waved aside under the assumption that the viewer already knows what's going on and doesn't really care.Story:TV Reproduction follows the same story as the anime it's based on.  There are no new scenes.  There are, however, so many cuts that if you didn't know the story to begin with, there's no chance you'd figure out what was going on.Fate/stay night does have an excellent story, though.

Standard DEEN fare, I suppose.  Fate/stay night is something you read/watch for the story, so this isn't that important.Sound:The highlights of TV Reproduction are the all-new OP and ED themes sung by Tainaka Sachi.  The soundtrack has otherwise been copied directly from the original anime, which sounds great in theory but ends up being quite disappointing in practice.  You'll hear a momentary snatch of a track from the TV series' OST at a dramatic point, but it will play for a minute and fade away as the next character's theme turns on due to the extremely rushed nature of the OVAs.Character:There is little to no characterization in TV Reproduction.  Given the amount of material that DEEN had to cram into two hours, this makes a lot of sense: we never have time to look into the characters' heads or watch them chat with one another.

However, for those who haven't watch the original Fate/Stay Night series, I don't  recommend Fate/Stay Night TV Reproduction.From my point of view, Fate/Stay Night TV Reproduction was meant to be only a brief nostalgia material to millions of Fate/Stay Night fans out there. The whole 24 episodes worth of a story compacted into only a pair of 1 hour episodes? Of course it seems like a forced attempt on a series re-animation to make money.The truth...is, there was so many scene deletions in this reproduction that the storyline itself lost its charm and plot development. Sometimes, the scene loops far away out of the blue, leaving us in a state of confusion on what happened a moment before. For a moment the setting takes place in a house, but after a few seconds everything changed into the end of a supposed-to-be-good fight with another powerful servant. These kinds of loops really wasn't a pleasant experience, even to fans.Putting the plot aside, the animation has improved so much than before (of course), and the musics are as good as ever. The characters suffered from lack of development (probably because of the loops), but they're still amazing and fun to watch. At least for me, it was very nostalgic to see those characters in action, although within a whole different kind of animation and angles.In short, Fate/Stay Night TV reproduction could be a relieve for those who missed to re-watch the original series, but didn't have the time to.

So I decided maybe I could gain some interest by watching the 2011 prequel; Fate/Zero, and did I ever enjoy the heck out of it!Fate/Zero had a better opening, better pacing, more fleshed out graphics(which did wonders for the actions scenes) and enough characters with depth to keep me going.

This is not true, as if you plan to watch this, you CAN buy it, as opposed to the entire series set, and you will get a story that stems from beginning to end.The intro and story fit well where the prequel (fate/Zero) left off, as it begins with Rin, and the boy from the final moments of the prequel.  What follows next is something I like to call ""the short and sweet effect"". Since this is edited down from an estimated 8 hours down to an estimated 2, a main concern was the editing.At times I felt dizzy since I knew a large chunk was left out, but it was well done on how they give you the pieces to connect the dots. For example, a character by the name Emiya was trapped in a perfect, black sphere. Where did the sphere come from? Well from the priest, of course! Who is the priest? The same priest from the Fate/Zero; but would I have known he had history with previous events if I haven\'t SEEN the prequel? Yes, because they take the time in the 2 hours that is this reproduction to keep you up and going.In other words, yes, the editing gives it justiceDon\'t expect a lot of depth from the antagonists, though, as you won\'t get much outside of which side they pledge their loyalty to, and a quick reference to their goal. Besides the silver-haired little girl, most of the bad guys feel like fluff and filler, since they aren\'t ever explored, and the Masters are forgettable almost as much as their intentions.

My humble opinion is the TV Reproduction wasn\'t meant for you, though please note, I am not telling you not to watch it.Fate/Stay Night...TV Reproduction is fast paced, moving quickly from one scenario to the next, with no time to absorb what is going on.  But that is ok.  What I found in this version is if you are needing to fix that Saber jones but don\'t have the time to re-watch the series much less marathon it, then this anime is for you.  This 2 episode series you can marathon in one night fixing that Saber jones you got that needs fixing.  For some strange reason, the fast pace nature of this anime slows down a bit during the ""tryst"" between Shirou, Rin and Saber....or was that just my imagination....One of the items that solidified the series Fate/Stay Night as a 10 for me was the op theme, ""disillusion"".  In the TV Reproduction, it gets a re-make as ""disillusion -2010-"".  Most musical re-makes , to put it bluntly, suck.  Not so with the re-make of ""disillusion -2010-"".  Like the TV Reproduction, it is fast paced, to the point and is well worth downloading.Enjoy this this two part series for what it\'s worth, a quick paced shot in the arm.

The original had amazing and absurd climaxes  that this just didnt have, the climax wqs anti climactic, confusing (partially because of the reason above) and just wasnt super satisfying.The film takes a different approach from the conman style of the original its kind of an action...drama? Not a lot of conman stuff beyond on character.

Did is something or did he just do nothing.As for visuals,its great pretender, this film is beautiful and I recommend watching the film just for the beauty of it alone, its a style i cant get enough of and if this film exiated purely to give us more of that id say it was worth it.Overall this is a mixed bag and i cant say it lives up to the original, however id recommend a watch if you just finished a watch/re watch of the series or if your really hankering for more GP, i know i was. drama?

For a series that blew me away repeatedly over its run, this felt pretty tame, focusing its attention instead on some of the inner workings of a drug smuggling mob element as a central character finds himself drawn away from his life of crime. We don't get a lot of backstory on these characters, and since we've only seen Dorothy before, that makes it difficult to get invested in what's going on. And it really does feel like a side story rather than a capstone to this series, with a couple...of main characters from the series only making small cameos at a few points. In that respect, it does feel like we missed out on some opportunities here, since Dorothy had some interesting relationships with the crew and none of them get further exploration here.That being said, this is Great Pretender and, even if it's only surface level, I'm still fond of the elements that linger. The color palette in the movie pops, the character models are all great and dynamic, allowing for some solid comedy that wouldn't feel out of place for Lupin III either, the machinations are many and there are some double-crosses thrown in for good measure (even if they feel like shadows of what the original series pulled off), and the adventure ends in somewhat satisfying fashion... even if everything feels way too neat. Sure, it doesn't reach the heights of the original series, but it succeeds in being an enjoyable time with a little bit of a nod to the audience. It's a good time, and even though it doesn't satisfy my cravings for more of this series, I enjoyed the ride one last time. of main characters from the series only making small cameos at a few points. In that respect, it does feel like we missed out on some opportunities here, since Dorothy had some interesting relationships with the crew and none of them get further exploration here.That being said, this is Great Pretender and, even if it's only surface level, I'm still fond of the elements that linger. The color palette in the movie pops, the character models are all great and dynamic, allowing for some solid comedy that wouldn't feel out of place for Lupin III either, the machinations are many and there are some double-crosses thrown in for good measure (even if they feel like shadows of what the original series pulled off), and the adventure ends in somewhat satisfying fashion... even if everything feels way too neat.

The formula they have in having these twist and turn of events that conveniently line up to showcase these character development works a charm (even if its ridiculous)The music is a recipe of setting up success in giving those moments in the series its playful, sentimental and thoughtful moments. I really can't fault their use of the OST time and time again, and some of the new tracks for this ONA is just *chef kissLook I got baited into this series, and ironically it is about scams and everyone trying to outwit each...other... so seeing dorothy in her element here with some new characters and old returning to fuel this series mystery of this syndicate working to take down the big guys is nothing short of amazing.

Like, everything just gets rushed through at the end and wrapped up way too easily.  It's like they just threw everyone together and called it a day.  No twists, no surprises, nothing that really makes sense for the characters.  Seriously, what were the directors even thinking? The whole thing feels phoned in. Such a disappointment after how awesome season 1 was. I wanted LAURENT, CYNTHIA, ABBY & MAKOTO (he was there only...for a few seconds, well can't consider it) back in action.... for a few seconds, well can't consider it) back in action...."", ""Actually so nice to see some Great Pretender stuff after so long, I freaking missed the series, and this time we get to see some Dorothy content WI loved the music so much, I missed hearing it. I'm not sure if I have dementia but I think there is also some new music in the movie. I love that we get to see a little bit of edamame too lmao, was pretty funny seeing him here. Really loved the characters from this, for some of them you kinda just see them as meh at the start but they really quickly grew on me. Liked...some of the fight scenes, some of them were kinda small or just little attacks but they were pretty cool to watch.  Laurents connection to the whole thing was actually so funny, the ending to this movie was good. As much as I wish they did more stuff with Edamame though, it was nice to see he was in here even for a few minutes.Really hope there is some more stuff for the series that comes soon. Again it was sooo nice to see Great Pretender anything again, I MISS THE SHOW RAAA  😭😭😭Anyways, watch the movie if you are a Great Pretender fan.

Devils Line,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35928/Devils_Line,"[""This was a really good anime. But so unsatisfied with the ending. I feel like it should have been dragged a little bit.

There are sometimes after ED scenes so don't forget to watch'em.I'd give it a 7 on 10.For those who are having second thoughts on watching it, please give it a try (like 4 episodes at least).

This in terms of outlook if not by moral values and social norms: what is and what is not the ""right"" thing to do. But enough about our politicians. Devils Line is a show about vampires and it sucks ass harder than any of its characters suck blood.The story is just really great. Kaneki Ken\'s long lost vampire brother wants to drink human blood, but not because he is a pervert or hungry, but because if he does not, he turns into a monster...and will kill everyone and anyone surrounding him.

The main girl has no personality to speak of. Only thing we know about her is that she is a college student, her eyes get wide every-time she sees the main vampire guy. She is basically a collection of generic responses that you would expect from the least developed girl in a badly written Dating Sim. Even those responses have been muted so much and have no real emotion behind them. I have never seen such a weak-willed character with absolute...absence of agency. She is like an empty shell designed to stumble along wherever the plot takes her.The main vampire is the generic dangerous vampire with a bleeding heart. He has an intense, raging, vampire hard-on for the main girl. His character is just a mish-mash of every conceivable trope that you can find in a ""Vampire Love interest"". He is an overprotective, aggressive, over-bearing, rapey, creepy, stalker (but we are supposed to consider him mysterious, tortured and kind).Their relationship being the main focus is atrocious and is one red flag after the other. Their first encounter was somewhat rapey that made the girl ""smitten"". Then the vampire repeatedly shows up at girl\'s apartment balcony, watches her in her sleep, follows her on her way home, shows up at her college etc. The girl is completely Ok with this because those vampiric dark-circled eyes make her wet, I guess. All actions or sexual advances, by the vampire, towards the girl are neither resisted nor encouraged by the girl in any way. Her only response is staying still with her eyes widened. This makes the supposed ""Romantic"" scenes too uncomfortable.You don\'t feel invested in characters at all, so whenever the plot kicks in you don\'t even care anymore.The art, animation and sound are Ok but barely. The action scenes are lackluster and poorly directed.This is a bad Twilight rip-off with some Tokyo Ghoul like elements. It did have some potential, though. But extremely poor execution. If main characters and their relationship were better written then it could have been a decent dark romance. But what a waste of opportunity! considering we rarely, if ever, get to see a good anime romance with mature themes.This anime has no redeeming quality whatsoever.

Devil’s Line adheres to a exploration about the nature of humans and vampires in a modern world society. We got humans and vampires (otherwise, known as “devils”) living in our everyday neighborhood. Coming into this show, Devil’s Line felt like a copy-paste that I’ve seen in many vampire theme shows before. It isn’t anything special.There’s a joke out these days that falls in the line of “still a better love story that Twilight”. Devil’s Line does have vampires...and some romance elements after all. However, the show itself gives a more mature feeling that is beyond just teenage romance. What Devil’s Line fails to do is make a story that stands out on its own. The story connects a vampire named Anzai together with a college student named Tsukasa Taira. She is saved by this mysterious character after being attacked by a vampire. It also turns out that Anzai is a vampire himself and has to control his bloodlust. The catch is that the show tests his nature as a vampire while also being hunted down by a vampire extermination organization known as the CCC. Sound familiar?Now the show itself does take itself quite seriously. I say this because there’s hardly any jokes and most of that similar content relies on dark humor even when there’s room to throw in those moments. In essence, you should expect a mature anime that deals with interspecies romance. The main characters, Anzai and Tsukasa are not much alike beyond just their origins. From the start, I can say easily that Anzai is a brooding man without much words. On the other hand, Tsukasa is a type of girl who is very open to others and isn’t afraid to speak her mind. However, she is still very shy and not capable of dealing with dangers on her own most of the time. Anzai has to play the role of a protector in the series. It also puts Tsukasa in danger whenever the two are together because of his own bloodlust. The series adds tension and psychology nearly every episode as we see how he struggles to control his urges. I think on most part, it’s a repetitive gimmick that most vampire series relies on these days. Series such as Vampire Knight and Tokyo Ghoul has done that before. Even real life popular drama TV has done so in the past such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The Vampire Diaries. They all carry the burden of a character having to deal with their inhuman nature. Devil’s Line isn’t too different as the show tests the water between Anzai and Tsukasa’s relationship. Unfortunately, it fell flat because of how dry and empty it is. There’s no doubt they have chemistry but their relationship feels unreal and I find it hard to root for them as a couple. The two are hardly compatible either because of their circumstances. It’s a forbidden romance not meant to be.As a story about two different races, you can definitely expect conflicts to erupt in their society. There are several episodes that involves Anzai being targeted in assassination-style operations. It seems members of the CCC aren’t afraid to take any risks to kill vampires such as the case of sniper Zero Seven (Nanako Tenjo). As a main protagonist, you can definitely expect Anzai to be protected by plot armor. He’s not going to drop like a fly even despite fighting against the odds. Anzai is definitely not “OP” though as he struggles to survive but to me, the show doesn’t make his survivalist role any unique. The plot is stale as we don’t learn too much about his character. There’s definitely some background storytelling in the series for the main characters but none of them felt compelling. Tsukasa is also too human for a character that goes under little changes throughout the series. The only other character that may arouse curiosity would be Kohannes Kleeman, a mysterious white hair man. He appears in the show in later episodes and makes the audience wonder what his real intentions are. Unlike Anzai, he is quite blunt and behaves carefree around others. I’d say that he is perhaps too honest to point where it’s hard to tell whether he is telling the truth or lying. To me, Kleeman is an antithesis of Anzai. He is difficult to manipulate and always seems to be in control of himself. His behavior brings in a lighter side of the show although I really can't find that appealing. The show is still very moody and pushes the idea of a dark modern fantasy at every chance it gets.Platinum Vision is a rather obscure studio that I don’t think many fans are familiar with. Their previous work actually includes another vampire series called Servamp although that is far more lighthearted than this anime. Unfortunately, the overall animation quality is mediocre at best. This is my honest impression as the character designs looks generic to the core without any special features about them. The setting takes place in a modern city that you can find in just about any similar shows. Oh but you’re wondering, what about the vampires? Do they look convincing? On the surface, the answer is yes but that doesn’t make them stand out much. The characteristics of these vampires includes fangs and their bloodlust nature that feels like if you’ve seen it once, you’ve seen it all. There’s also a lot of fan service that teases the relationship between Anzai and Tsukasa. Some episodes really flirts with the idea of whether they will or will not have sex. Thus, expect a lot of kissing and it leaves some to the imagination. There’s not much censoring in terms of the graphic violence although isn’t never really ventures into the gore territory.To carry a show like this, you would definitely need some acceptable characters. Anzai and Tsukasa’s voices are a total contrast of each other. Anzai sounds like one with little emotion while Tsukasa’s voice sounds alive. On some instances, I wonder just how much the creator wanted us to accept them. In the meantime, the OST is mostly eerie with a melancholic quiet tune during some of the more emotional scenes. The theme songs are what people would easily designate as edgy. I don’t like using that word around much but it is what it is.After watching Devil’s Line, I felt like walking out of a theater realizing I could have done something else better with my money. I can literally go around online and find another show under the “vampire” tag. To me, Devil’s Line took the risk of trying to revitalizing the horror genre of interspecies relationship. What ends up happening is a show with few surprising twists but instead loses to underwhelming horror formulas. Maybe someday, we’ll get a memorable horror series of where we can look back and say “that’s pretty cool!’ and some romance elements after all.

Contains spoilers !!From what I read before, this anime sounded fairly promising for the vampire genre. ""It’s not your typical Twilight story"", they said. That’s right. It’s worse than that.The first 15 minutes were decent, the art isn’t my favourite but it’s not something that ticks me off much. Then we have a few characters, one that we thought would be the main, then gets arrested 5 minutes later. And the best part: your local vampire cop sexually assaulting Tsukasa; the mc who, of course, falls in love with him and...has wet dreams each night. Just wonderful. And this while Tsukasa is “afraid of men” (I understand why after episode 2). Guess she just has a thing for half vampires.Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind cliché love stories, but uh, not this way. And let’s not forget that our vampire cop is also a stalker and probably watches our round-eyed mc sleep, just like his cousin Edward.Don\'t spend your time watching this if you want something of decent quality. I have a hard time dropping a series I already started with so I\'ll suffer some more in your place. has wet dreams each night. Just wonderful.

I have a hard time dropping a series I already started with so I\'ll suffer some more in your place.', '[SPOILER WARNING]So far I\'m really enjoying this story. Vampires live alongside humans but have to be super careful because they are stronger and can easily hurt humans and also go into frenzy and will rape and kill if they see blood. Naturally there is discrimination against them and harsh laws restricting their lifestyles because they are dangerous and it is very easy for them to lose control. Despite that vampires are essentially humans underneath and most just want to live their lives, go to work, fall in love, and not be hated by everyone.The problem is how easy it is for them to go out...of control and hurt someone and get hooked on blood sex and rock\'n roll. The story being told is very interesting but it has been done before: Halfbreed police officer stuck between both sides falls in love with a regular human. That said some new twists get added onto the story that make it different than the other series that have covered the same outline. When the main character goes out of control and gives in to his vampire half those around him are actually in danger for one, and he isn\'t always in control; they really sell you on the struggle. Also while he is trying to regain control it isn\'t all epic action series ""the power of friendship will conquer all"" moments, there are sad pathetic ""better lock myself away"" moments that strike me as far more realistic than I\'ve seen the situation depicted as in other series.Naturally this story is ""edgy"" but I think it has the right amount of edge and isn\'t just edgy for the sake of being edgy. They get the little touches right like making the main character look sleep deprived all the time because he isn\'t getting blood and not looking like a glittering prettyboy despite being a dangerous, starved, killing machine. I feel like they might be telling a tragic story for the sake of telling a tragic story and it may turn out that way but so far it has been pretty dang good so I\'m in it for the ride to find out.The atmosphere and tone of this show fits a dark romantic thriller with berserk vampires blending in to the population. To describe the atmosphere as best I can I would say it reminds me of old detective stories where everyone is smoking heavily.Other than being worried in the future the show will cross over the finely walked line between gritty realism into ""edgy""/""stupid emo fantasy"" territory my only immediate problem with the show is I really have a hard time believing the female lead is anything other than a living fleshlight. In the first episode she gets some truly horrible news and she recovers from it almost immediately and seems to get on with her life just fine. (Spoilers for the first episode to follow) I feel like it is totally unrealistic to find out that your best friend has a crush on you and because you rejected him (even though you didn\'t actually dislike him) he went berserk and raped and murdered other women to avoid hurting you in his out of control state and not blame yourself for it. She neither blames herself for it nor her former best friend and one or both of those things should definitely be going on. To make matters worse she then falls for the guy that arrested her best friend. That\'s a whole new level of friendzoned. It just feels like other than being a nice girl that cooks a mean hotpot she has absolutely 0 personality. As it is still early in the show I hope this is something they expand upon in the future.The male lead going after her becomes even more questionable as his female coworker is constantly flirting with him and has way more personality. She\'s a 10/10 future trollmom. Not to mention she is also a vampire so he wouldn\'t need to worry about seeing her blood and eating her alive one day or hurting her on accident. Sure the female lead is nice and the shy girl with big tits flavor of pretty but underneath the tropes there isn\'t even a skeleton. All she does is act shy and blush. (Spoilers for episode 2 to follow) She almost gets raped by a guy and guess what she does the entire time? Acts shy and blushes. I don\'t dislike the female lead because there really isn\'t anything to dislike but the partner clearly shows they can at least make a female with some personality so I really hope they develop her character in the future.Right now I\'m giving it an 8/10 overall and suggest watching it if you like a good tragic romance story or gritty vampire thriller. It feels a lot like a cross between Blood+ and Psycho Pass (season 1). of control and hurt someone and get hooked on blood sex and rock\'n roll.

She\'s a 10/10 future trollmom. Not to mention she is also a vampire so he wouldn\'t need to worry about seeing her blood and eating her alive one day or hurting her on accident. Sure the female lead is nice and the shy girl with big tits flavor of pretty but underneath the tropes there isn\'t even a skeleton. All she does is act shy and blush. (Spoilers for episode 2 to follow) She almost gets raped by a guy and guess what she does the entire time? Acts shy and blushes. I don\'t dislike the female lead because there really isn\'t anything to dislike but the partner clearly shows they can at least make a female with some personality so I really hope they develop her character in the future.Right now I\'m giving it an 8/10 overall and suggest watching it if you like a good tragic romance story or gritty vampire thriller. It feels a lot like a cross between Blood+ and Psycho Pass (season 1).', ""Yes, only 4  episodes are out, but it was enough for me to figure out what it's made of. (1 episode was more than enough though, the rest of 3 was torture I had to go through in order to write this review)This is a blatant Twilight ripoff with some obvious Tokyo Ghoul ' borrowed ' elements and on the top of that has an awful borderline attack on titan opening that doesn't even suit what it's trying to sell. Do I need to say more? Perhaps a bit, in order to strengthen the conviction that this title is yet another waste of time...that you cannot recoverThe premise sums up the concept of this schlock, a concept that has been done to death before and that was never fantastic to begin with.Vampire/ Devil or whatever the MC identifies as falls for bland walking plot device that is the female MC and he's facing struggles to maintain his humanity blah blah blah and we're supposed to rot for their awkward relationship , because it's so authentic and totally not forced for the sake of fitting the shoujo quota, truly mature, innovative and not some cookie cutter romance! 3/10The art is fairly well done, but who could care about it when anything else is plainly rubbish. 6/10Believe it or not, even in the sound department I have managed to loathe it, especially those nauseating sound effects like moans , groans , sobs that reminded me of a tortoise mating with a croc shoe (you could Google that to have an exact idea about what I'm referring to)As I've mentioned above, the opening is an uninspired borderline attack on titan attempt and doesn't even fit the thematic of the show, the choreography of the visuals makes no sense whatsoever.Not that the voice acting would be the major flaw of this title, but the way the lines are delivered falls flat and makes the wannabe emotional moments embarrassing to witness.Characters...exactly what I was talking about above , bland, generic, cannot sympathize with them , obnoxious and awkward to watch. 3/10As for the enjoyment, there wasn't any , not even a second , I'd rather stub my toe in the furniture every ten minutes than watch 20 minutes of this atrocity per week.There are a lot of bad shows out there , but this one tops them all through the fact that I cannot see a single positive in it, not even if I turn my brain off while watching , it's cringe worthy in every single way and deserves to be the punching bag of the season. that you cannot recoverThe premise sums up the concept of this schlock, a concept that has been done to death before and that was never fantastic to begin with.Vampire/ Devil or whatever the MC identifies as falls for bland walking plot device that is the female MC and he's facing struggles to maintain his humanity blah blah blah and we're supposed to rot for their awkward relationship , because it's so authentic and totally not forced for the sake of fitting the shoujo quota, truly mature, innovative and not some cookie cutter romance! 3/10The art is fairly well done, but who could care about it when anything else is plainly rubbish. 6/10Believe it or not, even in the sound department I have managed to loathe it, especially those nauseating sound effects like moans , groans , sobs that reminded me of a tortoise mating with a croc shoe (you could Google that to have an exact idea about what I'm referring to)As I've mentioned above, the opening is an uninspired borderline attack on titan attempt and doesn't even fit the thematic of the show, the choreography of the visuals makes no sense whatsoever.Not that the voice acting would be the major flaw of this title, but the way the lines are delivered falls flat and makes the wannabe emotional moments embarrassing to witness.Characters...exactly what I was talking about above , bland, generic, cannot sympathize with them , obnoxious and awkward to watch. 3/10As for the enjoyment, there wasn't any , not even a second , I'd rather stub my toe in the furniture every ten minutes than watch 20 minutes of this atrocity per week.There are a lot of bad shows out there , but this one tops them all through the fact that I cannot see a single positive in it, not even if I turn my brain off while watching , it's cringe worthy in every single way and deserves to be the punching bag of the season."", 'I think this is a show where we all have a common, itching thing going for it:An awful Twilight-esque story with Tokyo Ghoul elements that are meshed in and didn’t really fit well with bad to poor execution.Devil’s Line tells the story that was founded on Twilight…only that there’s coherent but sometimes confusing or misunderstood storytelling, but nothing exciting nor engaging. It’s the equivalent of “Hey, you’re a vampire with your fang teeth and I’m a normal girl, let’s date!” And that sums up how I felt with the entire premise of the series. Not to mention that they have added the police-like feel of...betrayal and camaraderie just to get you invested in the series, and guess what? It added a tiny breath of fresh air, though I can tell that most people will not care for this, and for that, I will tell you to read the manga adaptation that’s not as great, but you will understand what I mean.So…ok, human and vampire. What could go wrong? The answer? Anti-vampire groups, that’s why! Most notably the CCC, who works as a police target group in disguise under the boss Kikuhara Kirio, monitoring the main group’s vampire movements and executing what they feel is right of a vampire-free world.The characters literally write the same story as Twilight, only that the former does it WAY better than what’s found here. Tsukasa Taira is NOT the equivalent, but a dumbed-down version of Bella Swan, mute, expressionless, and there as a plot device to keep the story entertaining as its romance-supernatural genre can go. The same could be said for the MC vampire, Anzai Yuuki, a half-vampire, the dumb-down version of Edward Cullen, trying to control his half-demon, half-human powers and constantly breaks the mold for his police group (Public Safety Division 5 F Squad) into trying to live in a world that’s Twilight (where humans and vampires can co-exist). Johannes Kleeman as a half-vampire, I’d say he is only the handful of good characters that doesn’t have a backstory, but yet is kind to everyone, is intelligent and is able to discern stuff very well. Other characters are generic, bland and uninteresting, the only one-liners I can say about characterization (if there was ever any to begin in the first place).I have never personally heard of the new studio Platinum Vision before, most particularly they made Servamp (with Brain’s Base) and the spin-off from the Saiyuuki Reload series, but this anime just proves that just like many 2nd or 3rd rate studios, it falls in the category of being mediocre and bad. The manga-to-anime adaptation…is quite frankly nothing more of good. I get it that the producers tried their best to replicate the manga, but try as hard as they can, it still falls short. The animation is less than Tokyo Ghoul quality, more so than ripping it off, it’s bearable to watch but when the action gets heavy, RIP animation quality.The sound is another story in and itself. I get it that the setting has to be the super “edgy” feel, but they are only OK at best, nothing to write home about. Both the OP and EDs are unmemorable, but if I had to decide the good out of the bad, it will be Mamoru Miyano’s ED that takes the icing on the cake. Action scenes feeling empty, there’s not a ton of sound and sometimes poorly used.At the end of it all, is Devil’s Line a worthy “Twilight: The Animation”? Certainly not, and it doesn’t come close to touching anything that is noteworthy nor remembering about. I’d guess for die-hard fans of Twilight, give this series a try and see how fast it sweeps you off so much that it becomes unwatchable.Was it engaging?

Vampires. Sounds pretty basic, one could even say it's a topic done to death. This is where the show gets it right. Vampires and devils were creatures that made you cry when you were a little boy/girl/other, they were scary, frightening, horrifying, one would even say spine-chilling. Looking back when I was a little child, there was nothing more scary then a pair of big fangs sticking from my uncles mouth. He used...to put fake fangs around and bite me all over, it really hurt like hell. I remember trying to tell me parents about it but they didn't believe me. Anyways, I digress. The show does a good job in portraying the dark world in which the story unravels, devils are threatening creatures and are something the characters are constantly reminded of. What I like particularly about this show and what really makes it stand out are the references. The thing I value in a show that focuses on references,(like Gintama for comedy example ) is that it awards people who pay attention. They get to experience the show in it's true fullest form. While people who just watch it halfheartedly miss out on half the experience.The characters are compelling and realistic, there is a lot of blood in this show, which only shows it's not advisable for young children to watch it. Without getting into spoilers, the main cast has an interesting dynamic which works off the dark setting. I won't call the show profound but I won't pretend It didn't make me stop and think about certain things.The animation is solid, nothing spectacular but nothing to laugh at. Same with the sound, it does it's job and while it's not something I would listen on my free time it did grow on me, especially the OP.To conclude, I think this show is pretty underrated, MAL scores really don't do it justice. And unlike the horrible Tokyo Ghoul:re, which is also airing this season and shares similar themes. Devils Line at least isn't laughably awful. to put fake fangs around and bite me all over, it really hurt like hell. I remember trying to tell me parents about it but they didn't believe me.

The romance among the main characters,Tsukasa and Anzai.2. Conflicts among the vampires themselves and the relationship between humans and vampires-The romanceRomance is probably one of the most exciting things in life,probably Tsukasa has the same feeling and she's a kinda shy type of person,who don't have much ideas about vampires and Anzai.Generally,people saying that the romance scenes are kinda awkward,but I think it's kinda realistic,since to a young-hearted girl,who don't have much experience in facing romance,it's pretty sure that she'll feel kinda nervous,like the scenes from the show,so I expected she don't have much feelings during romance moments.In fact,I feel the another way around,which I feel they're kinda realistic.Among the events happened,the bond between Anzai and Tsukasa become stronger.They wanted to protect each other in several dangerous situations at all costs even though they're being restricted.The romance is pretty well made and exciting,it doesn't conflict with the events happened and it developed through with the mysteries (which I will go through this later)-ConflictsIn Devils Line,humans may have bad feelings about vampires,since they can't control themselves when they see blood and may destroy people's life.Others may understand their needs and provide their needs,different people have different opinions about vampires in this show.On the other hand,vampires themselves also know some people have bad impression to them and feel worried,yet for Anzai,he's in love with Tsukasa,a human girl,which is pretty sure will have large conflicts among them.These are the features that this show has to offer.It's later revealed that there're several mysteries about the settings itself,Anzai's co-workers and his past,(Who's controlling behind the scenes?What's Anzai's real character?),which I'm not going to spoil them,since it's relatively interesting and can't be explained in short.All I can say that it's very entertaining to resolve these questions one by one,especially for mystery anime fans.Devils Line did tried to explain the questions one by one throughout events and romance,an interesting combination indeed.In a nutshell,Devils Line surely has great character and story development,especially on Anzai.I'm surely that you'll find certain amount of enjoyment.My personal opinions on the endings are pretty positive,although some people may find it unsatisfying,it does feel logical and realistic and I didn't find the ending bad,though it could be better if the mysteries can be resolved more completely at the end.There're a few things I do think Devils Line can do better,like the story presentation.Although I just mentioned that Devils Line has lots of things to offer,it's in a relatively fast pace in several moments,probably because of the episode limit,it has to be done quickly.Also,at the end,though throughout events,the relationship between Tsukasa and Anzai developed well,I do think that Tsukasa isn't developed pretty well,especially about her personal past and her feelings about vampires before.The animation and sound are fine in this show.The colour visuals are well made in this show,this show is pretty good in portraying the dark scenes,but it'll be better if some of the actions can be done smoothly,rather than in a weird slow motion.They have a strong voice actors base,which is awesome for voice actors fans,but they don't have put much efforts on soundtracks,the amount of soundtracks in this show is pretty insufficient.Op and Ed are fine though.I could say that Devils Line isn't a masterpiece,but it did well in many aspects and satisfying the romance,mystery anime fans.Do give it a try for at least finishing half of the whole series and don't judge the book by its cover.Perhaps at the end,you maybe appreciated with this series.Story:7/10Animation:6.5/10Sound:7/10Characters:7/10Enjoyment:8/10Overall:7/10 (B) -Rich story content,but the story presentation can be improved-characters can be described more,like the round-eye girl,named Tsukasa-inadequate soundtracksIn general,Devils Line can be summed up within two subjects.1.

Four simple words: rub it out, man.Since the dawn of humankind, men have been dealing with unyielding pent-up sexual energy, matched only by those squeaking dolphins who use eels as fleshlights (look it up people!).  To prevent oneself from looking like a crazed, sex-driven “vampire.”  It is necessary to use thy hand to complete thy deed; thus, returning oneself to a state of poise, and level-headedness.That may sound a bit convoluted for an edgy, vampire love story resembling that which shall not be named *cough* Twighlight *cough*, but think about it: they spent twelve episodes with Anzai...avoiding or having limited/monitored contact with Taira, just because the dude couldn’t control himself.  Not exactly original when it comes to the vampire medium, but they did manage to throw in a handful of interesting nuances to captivate the viewer’s attention.  Whether or not those ideas worked, is another story altogether.Taking inspiration from today’s outrage culture, Devil’s Line injects an aggressive, militant public, who despises the presence of vampires in their society.  They shout, they scream, and they annoy a hell of a lot of people.  But it does provide an accurate representation of how people would react, when “threatened” by a superior being.  That being said, what Devil’s Line fails to do, is hone in on this aspect from the viewpoint of one of the victims.  Anzai’s dad killed 10 innocent people when he entered his state of vampire-rage; however, we are only given a perspective of how he was provoked into this egregious act, by humans that killed his girlfriend.  Why not show the families that were affected by his “blind” atrocities, highlighting the odious nature of provoked vampires.  The way it is presented, more or less, makes an unequivocal assumption that all humans are vicious creatures, and vampires are ethical, pacifists, who only attack because of their predisposition for consuming blood.The paucity of character development is a severe hindrance in this series.  With the exception of Anzai, everyone adheres to a formulaic routine, evaporating much of the intrigue from the viewer’s perspective.  Anzai, however, displays a certain level of growth, especially when he shows affection towards Taira, forcing him to restrain himself from the fear of losing control.  The scene in the bedroom, when they are being monitored from the outside, exemplifies Anzai’s internal struggle with himself, and how he must always maintain his concentration to inhibit his vampiric tendencies.  In addition, the scene where Taira force feeds Anzai with her own blood, demonstrates the dissociation Anzai feels when his vampiric-self seethes to the surface.  This sort of hints at the rage-blinders we all experience when our emotions assume the driver seat, and rationality gets thrown out of the window.  The anime, in my estimation, would have had better success if Taira’s emotions were investigated with equal exploration.  It is understood that she is devoted to Anzai, but she seems too careless with her own personal safety around him.  Her love for him is unquestioned, but one has to wonder if someone in her position would really act this faithful when her arm is nearly bitten off.All things considered, it’s not a particularly bad series, it just fails to capitalize on its own conceptual themes.  Oddly enough, the series emulates Taira and Anzai’s relationship: a gentle foreplay of emotions, but nothing substantial ever happens. avoiding or having limited/monitored contact with Taira, just because the dude couldn’t control himself.

It was very fresh and new for me and i absolutely loved it.the dub for this did at times feel awkward or strange and feel thats due to loss in translation,but it didnt completely ruin the whole feel of the show.i\'m really hoping there will be a season two as there is soooo much left unanswered and so much i want to...see adapted from the manga. see adapted from the manga.', ""After rewatching this anime, i still cant put my finger on what it is that sucked me in so much. It is definitely an underappreciated anime, but one with flaws that put people off.Even with that said, i still love it. I am always looking for more adult anime, and gore and vampires tick the box for me. This had sexual chemistry from the moment the main met his love interest, in some ways this anime was very sexy. The story was interesting and definitely more adult. The MC had so many complexities to him, and i felt his vulnerability and basic human need...for comfort made him very interesting to watch as he battled with his more feral powerful side and the repulsion he felt for himself.I feel like the biggest failing of this anime, is like so many others, it didn't get the chance to complete its character arc and development. I have no doubt had the anime been given further seasons it would have been a fantastic anime. im definitely going to be getting the manga, it is just a shame that the anime is left feeling incomplete. for comfort made him very interesting to watch as he battled with his more feral powerful side and the repulsion he felt for himself.I feel like the biggest failing of this anime, is like so many others, it didn't get the chance to complete its character arc and development.

I never heard anyone talk about it, nor did it have much advertising. Honestly, it wasn’t even on my recommended page! I just happened upon it while searching for exclusively dubbed anime, make fun of me all you want “subbers”. The main reason I chose to even give it a chance was it’s title art appearing similar to Tokyo Ghoul, and I’m a pretty big fan of Tokyo Ghoul. Needless to say, I was surprised at how well each episode was crafted and how intriguing the storyline...was.I’d like to establish a few reasons for my appreciation in this show, but I think a baseline of the shows plot might be necessary. The setup is simple enough by anime standards, we all know how in depth some shows can get. Almost identical to Tokyo Ghoul, we find out that vampires, in place of ghouls, are harassing normal humans more and more frequently. By harass I mean assault and death to put it bluntly. The show does a good job of establishing a reasonable fear of the local vampires, along with establishing their place in this “new” world (I’m not actually sure when vampires became enough of a threat within the story’s timeline though).So we’re introduced to our main heroine Tsukasa living in this new world. She’s in college and has her own place, but the more relevant aspect to her personality (which the writers make certain you know) is she has problems dating (why? I’m not sure). I suppose this might’ve been intentional to make a point on what her type actually is. I have to say though, her character design is so cute and innocent, you honestly can’t help but root for her from the get go. Anyways, it’s not as if she doesn’t have her suitors, i.e., a friend Shouta that walks her home after class at night and is clearly interested in her romantically…to which she declines of course. On their nightly return from class, they are stopped by a young sluggish fellow named Yuki, with bags under his eyes but still handsome…if you’re into pale mysterious types. He begins revealing information about her college friend Shouta, and eventually outs him as a vampire. Not just any vampire though, since its mentioned Shouta was on the run and had already killed 3 women in a horrific manner. He feigns ignorance of course but the truth is revealed in absolution once we see his transformation and the cause of it. Long story short the man who identifies the vampire is a “vampire detective” both in the sense he is a detective against vampires, while being a vampire himself working as a detective. Eventually, Yuki ends up protecting Tsukasa once her friend is identified as a suspect and begins to lunge at her with aggression undoubtedly. After Shouta is arrested, Yuki ends up carrying her home due to the experience she just went through. The rest is basic enough, they slowly build a relationship and are clearly into each other from first sight. Then moving forward are forced to deal with abnormal situations while getting to know each other. If that’s not complicated enough, they are also forced to tackle prejudice within society against vampires, and quite often end up having to deal with issues regarding human/vampire relations.Almost my entire explanation of the plot was so I could better portray the likability of these characters. I can easily say that I was rooting for the almost saint like girl. It’s been awhile since a character was able to grab me with their charm so quickly. And as for her love interest “Vampire Detective” , he also has a unique appeal. Down on himself and not knowing his self worth, while also being almost saint like similar to the heroine. Both are in love at first sight, and the only thing holding them back is there shyness and humility, and society at large I suppose. It’s very nice to see how often they want to see each other and how frequently one rescues the other, either physically or mentally (being a vampire or girlfriend of a vampire can be hard!).The shows sound design is incredible as well. I didn’t like the intro music but the outro was always pleasant. Usually a show will wait to play the outro song during the credit scene, but Devils Line will start the same beautiful melody around 30 seconds before the credits. It doesn’t seem like much, yet every time that music begins I’m not only reminded that the show is ending, but I’m also flooded with each heartwarming or despairing ending prior to that episode. It’s difficult to explain why that’s appealing, but the familiarity of it is just pleasant, and I’m glad they choose to queue the credits song before the credits actually play. As for sound design in general? Everything is done well, even the action scene themes or the romantic. Sound effects feel real and raw, so much so I wonder where they acquired said sound without using the real thing.Devils Line is unique in its delivery, gory in all the right ways, has great character development, and has a great story/setup. The only complaint I have is how long the relationship of the main couple took to evolve. Spoiler for the ending, the writers waited to show us a happy conclusion for the END CREDIT SCENE! Like can’t we have one victory for the beautiful couple? On top of that, the plot pushes a mandatory minimum of, I would assume, 2 years that they are separated. I just don’t get why anime’s insist on not showing a happy couple by the end. Someone always has to die, or get shipped off, or anything to prevent them from being together (See You’re Lie in April, Weathering With You, Your Name, Fate, Guilty Crown, I could keep going). At least there is a happy ending though and the show is great even with the mediocre ending. was.I’d like to establish a few reasons for my appreciation in this show, but I think a baseline of the shows plot might be necessary. The setup is simple enough by anime standards, we all know how in depth some shows can get. Almost identical to Tokyo Ghoul, we find out that vampires, in place of ghouls, are harassing normal humans more and more frequently. By harass I mean assault and death to put it bluntly. The show does a good job of establishing a reasonable fear of the local vampires, along with establishing their place in this “new” world (I’m not actually sure when vampires became enough of a threat within the story’s timeline though).So we’re introduced to our main heroine Tsukasa living in this new world. She’s in college and has her own place, but the more relevant aspect to her personality (which the writers make certain you know) is she has problems dating (why? I’m not sure). I suppose this might’ve been intentional to make a point on what her type actually is. I have to say though, her character design is so cute and innocent, you honestly can’t help but root for her from the get go. Anyways, it’s not as if she doesn’t have her suitors, i.e., a friend Shouta that walks her home after class at night and is clearly interested in her romantically…to which she declines of course. On their nightly return from class, they are stopped by a young sluggish fellow named Yuki, with bags under his eyes but still handsome…if you’re into pale mysterious types. He begins revealing information about her college friend Shouta, and eventually outs him as a vampire. Not just any vampire though, since its mentioned Shouta was on the run and had already killed 3 women in a horrific manner. He feigns ignorance of course but the truth is revealed in absolution once we see his transformation and the cause of it. Long story short the man who identifies the vampire is a “vampire detective” both in the sense he is a detective against vampires, while being a vampire himself working as a detective.

It would have been even better stretched out into two seasons because the ending felt very rushed and there were multiple story lines that never got to fully develop. I think its a very unique take on vampires that kept me interested the entire time. The progression of the romantic relationship seemed a little too fast but, again, thats due to there only being one season. The emotions shown by the characters felt real and made sense.If you are a fan of sexual tension or forbidden love you should...give this anime a try! The art style is great, the music is great. Overall its one of my favorite animes and actually got me to start reading manga because i couldnt get enough of it! give this anime a try! The art style is great, the music is great.

I wasn't into Twilight or Vampire Knight. But that is NOT what this show is. Devils Line is surprisingly deep and how I would imagine a society with vampires would behave after learning of their existence. (I'm thinking the biggest parallel is with American society, but that's just me) I think shows are best when they explore both sides of the main conflict and although the anime didn't quite get that far you could really understand it. The only reason the viewer felt differently is that we...saw the vampire's story. The show handles mature themes and does it well. Most cases with Vampires is that the focus is on their beauty or their struggle not to suck blood. While there is a focus on (a bit of a spoiler here) the romance and the struggle to not drink her blood, it is not the ONLY focus. The anime does a good job of expanding the view and show what else is going on around the couple. Society's response is what makes this show so (oddly) realistic. It's not a cut and dry story where everything is so straight-forward, of course, some aspects are a little predictable, but most romance stories are. It reminds me somewhat of Tokyo Ghoul (No hate please, that's just how I feel). I suggest this show to EVERYONE and even if you don't love it as I do I still think you can at least enjoy the opening song. Also, it's twelve episodes so what the heck! If you've got the time, watch it. :)< As for my ratings of everything probably aren't as helpful so forgive me for that. Please, note that I don't give out 10s for nothing ;P saw the vampire's story.

MAL doesn\'t have ""opinion"" tab and the forum is full of people lashing at each other so this is the only way to convey my ""feelings"". It will also be spoiler-free as I won\'t mention any specific events from the anime. I might end up using word ""shallow"" a lot.Very short TL;DR at the bottom, I do suggest to read it all if you wonder whether this show is worth your time.I pulled this show and wanted to watch...it because of the theme. I love more adult-oriented shows with dark theme and proper romance, I also like vampire-ish themed shows. Another thing the show has going for itself are the voice actors and actresses, bunch of very good names.The show is bad though and it isn\'t my opinion as I\'d call it a statement/fact and I am going to vindicate what I just wrote.1. The supernatural(setting) and first episodes. The show throws you into a world with fictional elements as a main theme without explaining anything. This can in theory work if it\'s written/used well, the elements are explained as time passes (or not at all in some cases) to not dump everything on reader/viewer (and to keep the show/reading material mysterious) but it doesn\'t work here because they throw you into a world, hint at supernatural as ""urban legends, stories ..."" in conversations and then have those elements take literally 98% of the screen-time. You are blind and confused which completely destroys any bond you may be trying to build with the show (characters/story/lore/trivia). The writing is very very shallow, there is nothing to it, it is extremely rushed to a point where it starts making no sense which in connection to what I just wrote just...The characters - Weird. Hell I\'d even like the weird if they weren\'t just empty shells (no personalities, no explanation, no build up, no background fuuu). You aren\'t properly even introduced to them and that doesn\'t change as the episodes go on, you are basically as blind in episode 6 as you were before you even started watching. You get nothing and are supposed to care (and the shows acts like you care from the episode 1) just like with the theme/setting.2. Drama, romance and musical background. While the show does qualify as both drama and romance both aspects are completely hideous.Drama - the ""dramatic"" scenes are escalated from nothingness (and from the get-go) and you as a viewer are supposed to care but you rationally can\'t. You don\'t know what is happening, why is it happening, you don\'t know the characters that are taking part. As explained in first part, you know nothing about the world or anything else actually so how are you supposed to care about dramatic scenes? Rushed is too simple of a word n so is shallow.Romance - The show contains romance straight out from the beginning. There is no build up, you don\'t know the characters (and they don\'t know each other either btw) but are thrown into ""romantic"" situations which come out of nowhere without any sign or buildup. To make it even worse (and this applies to the drama part as well) the music (except op which is nice) completely ruins any and all scenes (as if they weren\'t ruined enough already). I have no idea whether the person picking the music and putting it in is a genius or an intern. To elaborate on that, the music and it\'s timing is horrible but on the other hand it completely fits the shallow writing and badly put together scenes.Comedy - The show isn\'t labelled as comedy (although it seems to be one big joke) there is a comedy. There are ""funny"" situations to lighten the ""mood"" but I don\'t get why they are there, this show isn\'t supposed to be  rom-com with questionable humor. I will say though, that I did actually smile during those but that\'s only because Yoshitsugu\'s dry laugh makes me smile under any circumstances.VA - God bless the voice actors. The only good part of this but not even their hard work can redeem what this show is doing.To give you a TLDR; The writing and composition are shallow and straight out horrible in all of their aspects which kills everything else. You are thrown into a world with characters and themes but the show fails to explain and establish a(ny kind of) connection.Despite all I just wrote I am not saying that people can\'t or shouldn\'t like it. Everyone is different and people like many things (good or bad, regardless of the quality) but that doesn\'t change quality of this show (or the things) but I feel like people take show rating here as an expression of their enjoyment which they shouldn\'t (as according to tool-tips it in no case should reflect that).Some people also compared this to twilight which is fair compaction actually. Speaking strictly about the movies, the quality of writing and composition is very similar (in a bad way). As I am writing this the ""average"" rating is 6.5, which according to MAL is between fine and good. This show is nor fine nor good, the only things I\'d consider even average is the art and voice acting rest is bad/LQ.I haven\'t touched everything that can be said which may change if I turn this into full review. This was supposed to be very short to just give people heads-up (and to vent my thoughts), looking at it, it already is longer than expected.EDIT; This review has the show rated as 3(poor) while my personal rating has it rated as 4(bad), that is due to the difference in tool-tips.

It was subtle but it did manage to achieve it's own tale within it's narrative, which kept me interested.Overall, had a lot of potential but still couldn't quite deliver in the end.PROS:+ Relationship between Anzai and Tsukasa was the strongest facet of the series. It was down-to-earth and mature.+ Interesting reactions within the society and how the force arranges protocol with the 'devils.' I found it to be more towards the lenient side of things unlike Tokyo Ghoul, which was an interesting spin.CONS:- First episode was poor. Introduction could've been a...lot stronger.- Cliché vampire story and characters.- Wasn't the worst ending, but the climax was rushed and bland.- Too many Tokyo Ghoul concepts.OVERALL:Fairly ordinary but had action, fondness and intimacy. Could of went on for a longer period but understandable due to budget and marketing. Probably recommend the Manga to continue unsatisfying loose ends. lot stronger.- Cliché vampire story and characters.- Wasn't the worst ending, but the climax was rushed and bland.- Too many Tokyo Ghoul concepts.OVERALL:Fairly ordinary but had action, fondness and intimacy.

I didn't like the music too much. The intro was kind of weird. I also was hoping to get more information on the main character and what happened to him in the past. So that was also a little unsatisfying.The most entertaining part of the show for me personally was the relationship between the two main characters. I always enjoy when the guy is trying to control himself for his lady and is trying to protect her.I enjoyed the show throughout until it came to the ending. The ending was not really as good as I was hoping. I...believe it is still worth watching but know that the ending will be eh. But overall it was a good show. believe it is still worth watching but know that the ending will be eh. But overall it was a good show."", 'When Devil\'s Line started airing, I definitely wanted to like it, but as it continued, it got harder and harder to make excuses for how mediocre it ended up. At first, watching Devil\'s Line felt kind of like a guilty pleasure, you know the kind you get when you\'re enjoying Twilight or something similar, but the pleasure bit faded as the show continued came to a conclusion. There were times that I considered dropping it, but I\'m glad that I didn\'t. It wasn\'t that Devil\'s Line was terrible, it was just that it was inconsistently good. More on what I mean in a minute.Technically speaking,...Devil\'s Line was a bit of a mixed bag. Sometimes the animation was pretty solid, but other times, it was really choppy. I would love to say that the choppy bits were few and far between, but in reality, it was pretty consistent. That being said, it seemed to be isolated to mostly the beginning of the series, but it could be that I just got used to it\'s choppiness. The sound was strange too, especially when the someone went full ""Devil Mode"". I get what they were trying to accomplish with their sound mixing in those segments, but it ended up being less creepy in the way that they wanted and more creepy in an amusing way. However, the sound isn\'t all bad, most of the music was pretty good, especially then ending, which kept me going for a couple of those weird episodes towards the end.I\'d be lying if I said that I didn\'t enjoy the premise of Devil\'s Line, especially since that\'s what drew me to it anyway. In fact, the themes of racism and segregation between Devil\'s and humans were the most interesting parts of the show. Unfortunately, those interesting themes got pushed to the side for a mediocre love story for most of the run-time. Not to say that Tsukasa and Anzai\'s dynamic wasn\'t interesting at first, but it got shallow and generic pretty quickly.One of the major problems Devil\'s Line fell into had more to do with its overwhelming cast of side characters. And by that, I don\'t mean that there were countless side characters, but more that they were indistinguishable. Most of the designs were generic and they\'re referred to by name most of the time, which makes it extremely confusing, since you don\'t have a clear face to put with the name. Every time a side character\'s name was mentioned, I would struggle for a few minutes to figure out who they were talking about. Maybe I\'m exaggerating this issue, but it certainly felt like they weren\'t doing a good job at making the designs unique enough to stand out, especially the police force characters.I think that illustrates Devil\'s Line\'s inconsistencies well enough, and I haven\'t even touched on the story at all. I won\'t go into detail, but I\'ll say that it\'s the same as everything else in this show, inconsistently good, with quite a bit of bad. I wouldn\'t not recommend Devil\'s Line, but I would definitely not tell anyone that it\'s a masterpiece. Your enjoyment depends on your interest in the relationship of the main characters and how much the premise and themes hold your attention. If those aren\'t enough, you aren\'t going to find much else. Devil\'s Line was a bit of a mixed bag. Sometimes the animation was pretty solid, but other times, it was really choppy.

Most of the designs were generic and they\'re referred to by name most of the time, which makes it extremely confusing, since you don\'t have a clear face to put with the name. Every time a side character\'s name was mentioned, I would struggle for a few minutes to figure out who they were talking about. Maybe I\'m exaggerating this issue, but it certainly felt like they weren\'t doing a good job at making the designs unique enough to stand out, especially the police force characters.I think that illustrates Devil\'s Line\'s inconsistencies well enough, and I haven\'t even touched on the story at all. I won\'t go into detail, but I\'ll say that it\'s the same as everything else in this show, inconsistently good, with quite a bit of bad. I wouldn\'t not recommend Devil\'s Line, but I would definitely not tell anyone that it\'s a masterpiece. Your enjoyment depends on your interest in the relationship of the main characters and how much the premise and themes hold your attention. If those aren\'t enough, you aren\'t going to find much else.', ""Usually, I'll watch an anime at least twice before writing a review, taking notes the second time on specific qualities (variations in the art, nuances in the dialogue, actually paying attention to the soundtrack etc). However, I really feel like I need to leave a positive review on this one after my first watch, because I think it's greatly underappreciated.Very few animes introduce an entirely new concept as a focal plot point. The vast majority of stories are some combination of existing tropes, and even some animes that are considered revolutionary in some way are just two existing tropes put together in a new way....There's nothing in this anime that I've never seen before. Similar stories that come to mind are Toyko Ghoul, Ancient Magus' Bride, Claymore, and yes, Twilight. However, it's not the same as any of these, and is unique in the way that it pulls various aspects from each of those together. It also throws in a political element that I've seen before but can't recall where from.There were a few things I thought were exceptional about this anime. Despite being a fantasy anime about vampires n stuff, the human elements were often incredibly realistic. In particular, Anzai's self hatred, his relationship with Tsukasa, and the public response were all exactly as I would expect real people would act in those circumstances. I also thought that the human-nonhuman issue was shown through a very balanced representation, including romantic, professional and friendly relations in mostly equal amounts. The subjective and variable triggering of demon transformations was also a subtly unique touch that added a lot to the story, characters and depth.My biggest complaint was the pacing, especially the ending. Probably a top-10 worst ending in my book. I also would have liked to see more about Tsukasa's background, along with some of the supporting characters (Sawazaki and Juliana, in particular). I think this anime would have been a lot better given 24 episodes to explore those backgrounds a little more and allow for better separation into distinct story arcs.If you leave your Twilight bashing and vampire romance preconceptions behind, I think you can really enjoy this anime. I don't think you could write a balanced, negative review about it without comparing it to certain stories of the past, which isn't the fault of the anime in any way. Forget about all that, and watch it for what it is. There's nothing in this anime that I've never seen before.

It\'s both confusing and flat out disappointing as you traverse through randomly put together fight scenes and the sad excuse for a plot direction. Avoid this watch, unless you\'re looking for a series that makes vampires fight and do vampire-ing stuff (or you want another drop on your list).Scores~ Story [2] Art [5] Sound [4] Character [2] Enjoyment [1] Overall [2.8]Story [2]The best way to describe the story in devil\'s line is a confusion.

This anime is what the love child of Tokyo Ghoul and Twilight would look like. It copies world-building and moral dilemmas of the former but keeps them generalized and bland. Likewise, a good chunk of the couple drama is lifted straight-up from a generic vampire romance book. Mix that with inferior storytelling and overly detailed explanations and you will get this well-lit dumpster fire of the show. Either you break psychologically by watching how scrambled and inconsistent everything is or you accept the ride and start howling into the pillow while trying not to smother yourself out of self-hate. This hits that sweet...love-to-hate spot perfectly for me. <3 Enjoyment – 4Summary. It pretty common story. A smart girl meets a handsome, gloomy boy and falls in love with him on the spot. Boy saves a girl, so she double likes him. The boy starts liking her back and shows her a more devilish, uncontrollable side of him. The girl still wants to be with him, so he double likes her. They grace us all with the sweetest of anime hugs. But their happiness is cut short by the terroristic organization that tries to manipulate the public into killing/segregating all the devils. So said girl gets dragged into a series of unfortunate events to save all innocent devils in the land of the rising sun, all while trying to support her boyfriend and safely date him.In anime where people LOVE to explain things in excruciating detail (like 99,9% of the time), it's a strain on any brain to process that information overload. There are tides of unimportant information. Presently, I still had a very little idea what was happening a good chunk of the anime's running time, especially in the later episodes. The story feels too convoluted and every character's attempt at explanation made things even worse.However, what made me really enraged was the treatment of anime's main female lead. Tsukasa didn’t deserve this personality overhaul. She started as a rational, intelligent and independent woman, but ended race as a helpless, supportive observer. She is described as Ph.D. material but never has any meaningful contribution to planning or offering a fresh look at things. Sadly, from lines such as „silence doesn’t mean consent“ and being a metaphor for female sexual awakening, writers reduced her to a common insecure and over-dependent girlfriend that foolishly runs into the arms of a boyfriend seized by bloodlust.Dub voice acting was really...educational. Usually, I don’t pay attention if the performance isn’t amazing. But, boy do I now know how to spot a botched job. There isn’t any effort at acting, just people reading in the microphone. My theory is that those voice actors just wanted for a workday to end, so they could go home and contemplate career decisions they made.So, how could I enjoy this? Well, by turning my brain off and doing some light multitasking in the background. The most embarrassing moments made me laugh like a hyena to the point of having my lungs hurt. I also argued with the screen and had some beer, too. love-to-hate spot perfectly for me. <3 Enjoyment – 4Summary. It pretty common story.

The thing is that by watching shitty stuff you can find a lot of hidden comedy gems, this type of show that is so terrible it ends up being funny as fuck.

(This is my first review, just saying)', 'Spoiler Free:Devils’ line has several well executed elements - a terrific story, a solid romance, well animated, full of great dialogue without sacrificing action, SOME good characters, but there is one aspect which brings others down with it: the female lead, Tsukasa.The story is phenomenal.  There are multiple compelling sub-plots woven into the romance seamlessly making the anime appear as a single, multi-faceted story.  The dark atmosphere is perfectly captured visually and through the voice acting. The pacing is fast which amplifies the drama, but perhaps at the cost of characterization.  Also, in the first few episodes, the story felt...a bit rushed.  Devils’ line can hold its own on the story alone, even without the romantic component.  The romantic aspect is good with respect to everything except for Tsukasa.This is the entirety of what the audience knows about the female lead: She is in college; she takes good notes; she lives alone; she seems to be uninterested in guys; one of the classes she is in is a history class. She’s quiet.  That is everything – we don’t know her hobbies, passions, family, after college plans, or anything about her personality other than being relatively reserved. That’s it.  She seems to be made as generically as possible so female audience members can self-insert.  However, if there is one thing Yuri On Ice should have taught the anime industry, it is you do not need a generic, female protagonist devoid of personality in a heterosexual relationship to create a romance appealing to a heterosexual female audience and becoming a massive financial success.  The other characters were made quite well, and their personalities are portrayed in a “show don’t tell” way.This anime could easily be 8 or 9/10 if only for slightly more character building of Tsukasa.  Some have compared the story to Twilight, which I believe is unfair, as it is superior in many ways.  However, they share one commonality outside of being a vampire romance, an uninteresting, underdeveloped female lead. a bit rushed.

You could compare this anime to a series like Tokyo Ghoul, Twilight, or pretty much anything that has the storyline of ""teenage girl falls in love with a vampire"" or ""inhuman protagonist struggles to live with themselves"". Devil\'s Line is basically a combination of the two. Despite it\'s lack of uniqueness, is it bad? In my opinion, no.I don\'t see much of a problem with the story. (I\'ll only touch upon surface level stuff.) Taira\'s a human girl who finds herself falling in love with a devil (or vampire) after discovering that one of her friends is a...devil as well. This one incident has already drawn her into the world of devils. When she\'s rescued by Anzai, she becomes involved with the police (and her relationship with Anzai begins). Because of this, the story doesn\'t seem to be all over the place or anything like that. You can pretty much expect the future events in the series. My only issue is the ending. It was good but I would\'ve been nice to see what happened to everyone else as well.Other than the times when the characters do something stupid, they\'re relatively good. Taira and Yuuki are likable characters. Despite this, there isn\'t much development. The male and female lead characters seem to have little to no change...separately. I feel like their relationship changed more than they did. (It was still nice to see them get closer to each other though.) Everyone else either wasn\'t very important or they got no development. The only exception to this would be Nanako.The sound is almost always good. I really like the opening and ending songs. ""Eclipse"" had good visuals but the ending song...the visuals look so awkward. The dramatic music was good as well. I wish the voices could\'ve sounded better though. During some scenes, usually the ones when he\'s transformed into a devil, Anzai just makes some pretty weird sounds. They sound like gurgling...Anyway, the art is usually good. The bags under the eyes could look better. Also, I think they could\'ve did better with the scenes where the devils are transformed. The animation looks weird sometimes, I admit that. For some people, it may be distracting.Story: 9Art: 8Sound: 8Character: 8Enjoyment: 9 (Things such as certain sounds and visuals were a bit off putting.)Overall, I don\'t think Devil\'s Line is as bad as it may seem.

With famous anime like tokyo ghoul or good anime like parasite, here we have one of the weaker genre representatives. While the anime mentioned above focus on our society, the human reaction or what makes a human itself, we're following a couple in love that doesn't know what to do in their strange situation and get in trouble with the police and a terror organisation. But let me start at the beginning:Story 5/10Tsukasa Taira, a college student, is rescued from an attack by a devil, one of many vampires that blend in among...the human population. Yuuki Anzai, her savior, is a half-devil who utilizes his devil-born gifts as a member of a shadowy police task force specializing in devil-related crime in Tokyo. As Anzai continues to keep guard over Tsukasa, the two are quickly confronted with unacceptance and terroristic activities by the society.The story is pretty weak, as it doesn't really know where to go and what to focus on. Romance? Politics? Action? Police? It seems it wants to do all these things at the same time, but isn't able to give us a good feeling about any of these points. On the other hand, the series isn't afraid to shift it's situation drastically. From a normal live to police work and later about terrorism, the series follows all these themes and situations at the same time. It has no problems actually switching it's set to a point it get's unpredictable. And it even likes to play around, both with the characters and the in world logic.Characters: 4/10Anzai is a 21 year old hybrid male meaning he is half devil half human. He works for the police force under F-Squad in Division 5. He struggles containing his rage and blood-lust as both cause him to transform into an uncontrollable demon.Taira is a 22 year old female human. She studies hard in school and lives an ordinary life that was all changed one night when she falls in love with a certain police vampire.Johannes Kleemann, he grew up at the same place as Anzai, is also a demon but he can control his wish for blood.Besides them, most of the side characters are forgettable, unnecessary and don't improve the story in any notable way. You shouldn't expect character development or surprising choices watching anime either. The surprisingly well done main cast almost saves this part of the show.Art/Sound/Voiceactors: 5/10The art style in Devils Line isn’t too far out of the ordinary. Characters have soft faces and the colours mix in well with each other. The anime splits it’s time being indoors and outdoors and priority at night when outside. It’s rather dark which adds to the theme of vampires, devils, and darkness. This also allows emphasis when a brighter colour appears on screen. The biggest example of this is when we see blood. Blood is prominent throughout the series and when it is shown on screen it is usually the focal point. The choice of having dark background and bright blood throughout the show makes for great continuity.Expressions are shown well of major characters, but a lot of the devils have the same expression or idle faces. The same toothy smile is used in just about every devil other than Anzai. One thing I was looking for that I was pleased to not see is that there is different blood patterns used in different episodes. For example, minor spoilers, when Taira gets a cut on her face halfway through the story she bleeds a certain way. When the cut is reopened and her face bleeds a different time, the blood doesn’t flow the exact same way, nor do we see a repeated shot.The music chosen for Devils Line is very fitting and compliments the aura of the show well. The opening theme is ‘Eclipse’ by Souta Yanagawa commonly known as Shouta Aoi. The ending theme is ‘Sotto Tokete Yuku You ni’ by Mamoru Miyano, a very well known name. Both are well known for their works in the past and another job well done is presented here.Interesting enough, for an anime that wasn’t considered ridiculously popular, Devils Line has some well known voice actors. The voice of Anzai is done by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka. Notable works he has done are ‘Sora’ from No Game No Life and ‘Kirito’ from Sword Art Online. Taira is voiced by Yui Ishikawa. Notable works she has done are ‘Mikasa Ackerman’ from Attack on Titan or ‘Violet Evergarden’ from the very popular Violet Evergarden.Overall: 4/10Weak plot and characters with no growth make this anime already pretty bad. It has some good points speaking for it like the music or voice actors, but finally fails at the most important parts. If you want to watch a story about monsters in human form, you should watch tokyo ghoul or parasite. For a vampire story, you should try out shiki, which is far better thought out and developed than Devils Line. the human population. Yuuki Anzai, her savior, is a half-devil who utilizes his devil-born gifts as a member of a shadowy police task force specializing in devil-related crime in Tokyo. As Anzai continues to keep guard over Tsukasa, the two are quickly confronted with unacceptance and terroristic activities by the society.The story is pretty weak, as it doesn't really know where to go and what to focus on. Romance? Politics? Action? Police? It seems it wants to do all these things at the same time, but isn't able to give us a good feeling about any of these points.

I really love seeing what the next person\'s idea is going to be for this concept, and am usually disappointed to some extent.Devil\'s Line met my expectation for that, but also pleasantly surprised me in that the disappointing elements didn\'t ruin the show for me!I started Devil\'s Line with the manga when it was first released, and was initially extremely disappointed. The story was choppy, the plot pacing/ ordering was disorganized, and there are so many holes in the story that you can slap this tale on a sandwich and call it Swiss cheese.With that, I was more than rewarded...by the direction of the anime.Starting with where these devils come from, Devil\'s Line is an anime based off of the manga written by Ryo Hanada. The manga started in March of 2013 and is still on-going, so if you want to figure out what\'s going, on, you can try there, though I doubt it will help. The anime premiered in April of this year and ended this past weekend, being directed by Yoshinobu Tokumoto and released by Platinum Vision.To start with my general thoughts not related to the review in particular, I\'m more than mildly surprised that Platinum Vision took this show on. Considering how new they are in the world of hot topic anime, and how well rounded their others have been, (including one other vampire title, ""Servamp"") I was taken aback by the studio\'s decision to pick up such a lopsided plot.IF YOU DON\'T CARE WHY I LIKE/ DISLIKE THE SHOW, SKIP DOWN FOR THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION!Story: 9/10- The story is really good. It\'s nothing we haven\'t seen before, but there\'s just the right of melodrama to make the tale what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed watching how it was going to go. There were moments that took me by surprise, and kept me wondering what was going to happen, which is something I can only give credit to the director for considering what a mess think the manga is.Art: 10/10- I think the art in this show is beautiful: from the way the faces of the characters are drawn, to the bags under their eyes, to the way blood spatters when someone is shot. There was a lot of thought put into how each character should look, and why they look that way. On top of that, the animation had admirable qualities of it\'s own. I\'ll bring back the blood spatters for this point. It has been an extremely long time since I\'ve seen blood depicted realistically the way it was in this show. That along with any face to face violence, the animation team (I feel) went out of their way to make the dramatic action scenes as realistic as contextually possible.Sound: 4/10- I had a lot of trouble hearing certain parts. Or it sounded like the voice actors were too close to their mics in certain scenes. I wasn\'t a fan of how the sound went with what was happening in the show at all. I changed the servers I was watching the show on twice and had the same problem, so be prepared for that. It started happening to me around episode 5 or 6.Character: 6/10- Lordie, they need some serious work and some better development pacing, but I actually really appreciated the characters and how different they all were from each other. Each character had a very distinct personality, even characters that didn\'t have major parts. With that, though, each character design was EXTREMELY underdeveloped and the only person we know more that a handful of info about, is Anzai. Be prepared for how frustrating that\'s going to be.Enjoyment: 8/10- This show isn\'t hard to enjoy if you aren\'t picky about having your preferences met. If you are, I highly suggest not wasting your time. I mean that in the kindest sense. It\'s enjoyable and catches your attention, willing you to finish the story (regardless of how good you think it is). I find the reality of the romance, violence, personality differences, and animation to be endearing despite all of the large holes we\'re left with.OVERALL RATING: 7/10          RECOMMENDATION: Watch- All in all, this show was a good watch and if I was bored enough, I\'d probably be willing to watch it again. I think it\'s a waste of your time if you\'re easily riled up by an incomplete story, but I think if you\'re looking for something to watch that has an overall good story concept and direction then Devil\'s Line isn\'t the worst thing you could put on your watch list!Until next time!Ciao =^-^=- Ama_ by the direction of the anime.Starting with where these devils come from, Devil\'s Line is an anime based off of the manga written by Ryo Hanada.

Love between to different species, they killing, the hard part of being a vampire because you can’t get a job etc.) I really don't think everyone is actually watching and understanding the concept of the whole story, I have already read the manga, I’m actually...current with it, it’s actually interesting but again everyone has there likes and we have to respect it.I’m loving the voice characters, they choose such great ones.

If you like your anime to be straight to the point, you'll enjoy it.Also the VO is exceptional I reckon."", ""A love story better then twilight? I don’t think so. Devils Line is a show about the love story of a normal college girl named Tsukasa and a half vampire named Anzai. In the world of Devils Line, vampires live among humans. They don’t look any different than humans, but when they are exposed to blood, they turn into bloodthirsty monsters.That’s as far as the synopsis goes on MAL, but it goes a bit farther than that. Devil’s Line is a police drama, romance, action series following Anzai, a  half vampire detective. Vampires have dark circles around their eyes, have more sensitive senses and...physical abilities, and transform into a monster with blood red eyes, sharp claws, and huge fangs at the sight or smell of blood. Once a vampire gets exposed to human blood, they tend to get addicted and look for more. You may ask a question about Anzai, is it a vampire that is also a detective, or a detective that hunts vampires. The answer is, it's both. Anzai is a vampire investigating vampires. He is part of a government organization that specializes in tracking down various devil threats. Devil are the common name for vampires in the world. One night, Anzai is tracking down a devil serial rapist and murderer. Anzai finds him and stalks him for a while, until the murderer meets with a girl that fits his M.O., Tsukasa. Anzai then intervenes and fights the murderer in front of her, introducing Tsukasa to the world of devils and Anzai.The rest of the anime consists of the relationship of Anzai and Tsukasa, Devil human relations, and an organizations working to eradicate all devils. Tsukasa and Anzai’s relationship is the most like twilight. Complete with Anzai stalking Tsukasa, Anzai almost raping Tsukasa, Anzai saving Tsukasa from being raped, and Tsukasa liking him back despite all of that. Although, a devil human relationship is dangerous, because a simple cut can trigger a devil to kill their partner. But Anzai and Tsukasa make it work. So as you can see, the romance aspect of Devil’s Line is not very good. I find the devil human relations more interesting. As stated before Anzai is a devil detective, so he has first hand experience with what the devils struggle with on a daily and when they come in contact with blood. The general populous don’t know about devils. If I say anything more it would be major spoilers. But how the world reacts to the appearance of devil's is the most interesting part of this show.Unfortunately, aside from the stalking that takes place, the cast is stupid. They make stupid decisions and conclusions are very predictable. Information that should be known by doing any amount of experimentation is treated as a brand new thing revealed to the cast. Anyway I can’t recommend for the love story, which the anime focuses on a lot, but for the world. It's also an edgy mess, if that isn't clear from the vampires. The art isn’t very good, but there are times where the animation really shines. The music is not worth mentioning. Characters are retarded and don’t make good decisions, but that's to be expected from this type of show. I give this show a 4 out of 10. This has been PixEFit’s spoiler free, but not really review on Devil’s Line. physical abilities, and transform into a monster with blood red eyes, sharp claws, and huge fangs at the sight or smell of blood.

But I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did.This anime is all about vampires and has some Tokyo Ghoul elements in it (which I enjoyed because I also like Thokyo Ghoul). I think it suits the series quite well and makes it more interesting. However I read some reviews and people are complaining about that. If you are NOT interested in vampire stories, you shouldn't watch it (it doesn't make sense...to watch a genre you haven't even liked in the first place and then complain because the anime is about vampires, or because it reminds you of Twilight).I like the way they showed vampires in a different and more modern way.Personally I'm not a vampire-lover, I just watch fantasy-romance animes that seem interesting.If you are interested, just give it a try. Taste's different. But I think people should be fair and not combine Twilight with every vampire story (that has also some romantic parts in it).Have a nice day.

One thing I was to applaud it on is it following closely to the manga. I watched mainly because I really wanted to watch a vampire romance that wasn't somewhat similar to Twilight, the whole love triangle trope with no solid main couple romance development was getting boring. The main thing that I loved about this is that, I saw them actually have romance, though some would thing it was a quite fast pace way for them falling in love, but...for me it was better from the usual slow snail pace and then at the end their wont even be a kiss scene and the series just ends like that.Character wise, I kinda had a feeling that the main girl wouldn't be this badass human, but she at least wasn't annoying, (well to me honestly) I would recommend this to someone who isn't expecting much and just wants to get away from the over used vampire tropes.  It does hint it of course, but it doesn't throw it in your face like a pack of potatoes. for me it was better from the usual slow snail pace and then at the end their wont even be a kiss scene and the series just ends like that.Character wise, I kinda had a feeling that the main girl wouldn't be this badass human, but she at least wasn't annoying, (well to me honestly) I would recommend this to someone who isn't expecting much and just wants to get away from the over used vampire tropes.

Being a nerd of horror related things and having a lack of shows to watch at that given time, I figured I would give this show a try.The show was only 2 or 3 episodes in, and I'm a pretty impatient person, so I decided to look at the manga. The subject matter seemed interesting to me, so I figured it wouldn't hurt.This series definitely falls victim to the original content being sacked/cut out for time. If I remember correctly, episode 12 ends around chapter 40? Each...chapter is approximately 30-40 pages. That's a lot of content to cover for 12 episodes.I hate to be that guy, but if you were/are hoping for stronger character development, read the manga. I binged all 59 available chapters that were currently out in about a week. I originally had the impression that Devil's Line was a Tokyo Ghoul copycat, but the story itself evolves into something completely different. It'd be a little rash to compare devils and ghouls, too.This isn't a manga review, so I'll be talking about the anime from here on out.The animation at times was weak and awkward. It was noticeably choppy more than once. The coloring of the characters and the background didn't mesh sometimes either. It looked like you were looking at two different scenes at once.The ending really upset me. I won't mention what actually happened in the manga, but even if you didn't read the original content; the ending was horseshit. It was terribly rushed and wasn't believable in the slightest. Given how timid and stubborn Anzai is, he would not have reacted the way he had, nor would he have easily let go how much he hates himself despite how persistent Tsukasa is.This is my own personal opinion, but I really disliked Kikuhara's voice. Not how I envisioned this originally well written psychopath's voice.Now for the positives, I did like the music/OST/opening. I thought the ending was kinda lame, but I didn't hate it. I'd include the characters here, but for me they just weren't fleshed out enough in the anime. Lee wasn't as good of a comic relief either. Ishimaru is also one of my favorite characters in the show/manga. He's written more as a complex guy as well as someone who I enjoy to see because of the fact I find him to be pretty well written. The anime made him seem one-dimensional and boring. I was really exited to see him, but I was only let down.Honestly, 6 is a generous rating. chapter is approximately 30-40 pages.

It was the fundamental idea around 'devils'.I have not watched anything that has attempted what Devil's Line has; the link between blood lust and sexual desire and how they proc each other.

It is a little bit gory which I...also enjoyed.The art was nice, the shot angles and such worked quite well and the art of the devils themselves was reeeeeally cool.The main characters are both a bit... boring? But they do get a bit more interesting as time goes on and the character development can be seen quite well through this method.I personally enjoyed this so much, I went and bought the manga.

The manga was great. It managed to combine both the romance and vampire plot lines together without one overshadowing the other and I loved that. I watched the first episode of this and knew I was in trouble.First, the plot line. The biggest problem was they always either shortened the plot lines, or lengthened them for absolutely no reason. I mean they had one fight continue for 15 minutes when it lasted maybe 4 pages in the manga. And as I said it was...for NO REASON! Also, the plot went all over the place. One second there's a vampire attack, then there's a romantic scene with absolutely no transition into it. They explained some things so fast even if it was super important???

From what i have seen of Vampire animes, this is one of the bloodiest so far and shows the divide between Vampires and Humans. It also shows the interpersonal relationships some have with humans.I can see however how some might regard this as similar to twilight, but I over looked that and watched it for what it was. It was great to watch a vampire...anime without constant comedy or over fantasizing. It was good to watch a vampire anime set in the present day with modern struggles.If you want to watch a more realistic ( if that is a term ) vampire anime a with blood, story and romance element this is for you.If you want over fantasised vampire anime without any story go look elsewhere.

I have been reading the manga for a while and though the character development in Tsukasa's case is...well, non-existent, I can't stop myself from enjoying the story as a whole.There are underlying elements to the story, like the world, that really draw me in. But this has been in terms of the manga.In terms of the anime...someone help, please. (I have watched all that has aired as of today.) I find the animation a bit wonky and the music is abysmal in my opinion.

I feel like this could have been done a bit better maybe by making it a 24 ep season where we could maybe see a bit more progression with the main character's romance while also working with the cloak and dagger aspects, to make it a bit more relatable to the audience.The animation really wasn't all that great, there were parts where you can tell...where you put a lot more work and quality but it was never consistent throughout the series.Unfortunately, I was just really disappointed. :( Didn't want to be but I am. where you put a lot more work and quality but it was never consistent throughout the series.Unfortunately, I was just really disappointed. :( Didn't want to be but I am."", ""Okay so, this is my first review.

I only stumbled upon this anime yesterday and I've already watched 5 episodes and started reading the manga as well. There's something about it that just keeps my interest up. Let's talk about the different aspects of this anime in more detail!The plot is pretty good if you like the vampire genre even though it's nothing unheard of and there are a few differences compared to usual vampires. There's definitely a lot more blood in the fights between the 'devils' and humans than there is blood-sucking. While the...vampires here don't NEED to drink blood, their thirst gets the best of them whenever they SEE human blood. The animations during fights are neat and the overall art is very neat, but nothing especially unique.Turns out that Taira's childhood friend has been a vampire all along and at the point where events begin, he takes our dear, naive female protagonist to a rather isolated street of the town. That's where Anzai, who is half devil, half human, and part of a special team that focuses on solving (murder) cases involving devils, saves the heroine from her good friend. The two of them more or less immediately fall in love and that's where I find some things rather inedequate. First off, Anzai is really hot (ngl I LOVE his character design), but he already got his hands all over Taira shortly after they met because of a bruise on her lip. And Taira, who has never had a big interest in men enjoys it and even starts dreaming about Anzai who kind of starts stalking her, which she doesn't mind either. Whatever the occasion, she just goes along with the flow. It's completely valid to see her as a bland character because that's what she is, more so for a protagonist. At the same time I can accept that since she sometimes jumps over her own shadow and I've seen way more annoying characters.Other than that, I can say for sure that I will continue watching this anime. I'm curious on how the relationship between the main protegonists will develop and what else there is to offer, story-wise. vampires here don't NEED to drink blood, their thirst gets the best of them whenever they SEE human blood.

I believe that this element is the anime\'s weakest point. The main protagonists are boring cheap copies of other vampire-human romance.Taira is an empty shell of a character, whose only purpose is to act as Anzai\'s love interest. Seriously. A Mary Sue character, just as forgettable as my pending assignments. I would even say that if she...was to be taken out, the anime would\'ve still flowed the same way.Anzai is your typical brooding mysterious vampire. Though it is the cliche, ""I am a tortured soul with a dark past"", he is far more interesting than Taira.I can\'t support the romance between the two at all. I prefer a slow burn romance, and their insta-love story is quite rapey and creepy too. In the first episode, literally probably an hour after they first met, Anzai kisses Taira. You would think that Taira would pull away, probably smack some sense into him and stay the hell away from him. But no! She just sits wide-eyed, and even catches feelings for him! I will at least give her a single clap for hitting him with her bag, but she hits him for using tongue in their kiss! Nope, that\'s not it. There\'s more! Anzai is not only a sexual assaulter, he also is a creepy ass stalker! Surprise!He freaking visits her through her balcony at night, smells her hair while she\'s sleeping, and get this, he scolds her for trusting a stranger! Haha, as if he was one to talk. I just feel plain uncomfortable in the ""cute"" scenes. She stares at him wide-eyed, blushing lots, as this rapist-stalker kisses and hugs her. But that\'s okay, he\'s hot anyways!

Anzai being a police officer brought a lot of excitement for me, thinking that I will be swept into an enticing mystery. I thought that it had a lot of potential to go into a similar storyline of Death Note, wherein there is a conflict of ideals from both ends. Unfortunately, the writer chose to highlight the lack luster romance more. I almost dropped this series as the first few episodes was dedicated to developing the relationship between Anzai and Taira.

I will delve into this more in the character section)I will say, though, that by the 4th episode, the storyline begins to pick up, bringing a thrill for the viewers.

I consider it a drinking game anime, ESPECIALLY if you've read the manga first.The anime has little world building leaving characters underdeveloped and lacking motive for their interactions. Most plot points don't have consequences as context is missing along with half of the manga's story, which is not an exaggeration. The anime ends with plot from volume 8 of the manga, ignoring the next 6 volumes. You don't see acts 2 and 3 or even learn about the primary...antagonist. Continuity takes a big hit for this. The romance scenes are awkward, the same song is used in every moment of tension, some scenes look like they were animated at 5-8 frames per second and are generally flat unless there's a filter effect, and the ending is very sour. Oh yeah, and the OVA does nothing to rectify the plot.If you wanna enjoy the story, or you tend to fall for harlequin romances, read the manga. Watching the anime back shocked me as to how much was cut to make 12 episodes. Easily could have had 30 episodes if fully fleshed out, which was probably the problem to begin with.Personally I've bought the physical manga and have enjoyed re-reading it.

They tried to make it elaborate and then they tried to rush it and it didnt work. If you're going to try to be so deep with the story then do that don't just tell us how deep it is and just not go anywhere with it.Its the same with the romance. There was proper romance (not just flirty nonsense). But again they could not follow through. Even though i wasn't full content it was better than most.The characters needed work on them. I'm sick of...this self-loathing characters.the music was on point though. Loved it! same with the art, it looked really well drawn and the movements was really well made.But show itself was entertaining enough to give it a shot. Not a memorable but not terrible either. this self-loathing characters.the music was on point though.

But right the first episode, and I bet it went the same for all people, I realized this was a through and through josei series. Handsome guy, short fused, cares about someone he didn\'t know, then afraid of hurting her so went on pushing her away, thinking it was for her own...sake, got told that he needed to control himself, rather than pushing her away. After going through some more danger, they finally confess to each other and start being a couple. But then, some bad guy just have to mess it up for them and they have to find a way to deal with it as the climax.That was basically what the series was about. I didn\'t know this title, both in Manga and Anime and only decided to watch it since I didn\'t know what to watch at the time. It was bad, but rather decent.Sure, plot line was predictable. Vampire guy and human girl romance? Oh? Where have I heard of that idea before? Right. Almost everywhere. To top it off, it was so predictable, I was even able to predict a lot of it, just going by meta thinking instead of plot clues despite it involved investigation by police and what not. Still though, it targeted a genre which was so familiar and well liked, speaking objectively, I can see that it can\'t be going anywhere too bad.Despite all that, as someone who was familiar with works dedicated to female audiences/users of the culture, I have to say, this was as bad as it can get around the problems.First off, after heading down the road of predictable plot line, which you see like, everywhere, character building was awful. Well, it was awful overall, saved for one character, main protagonist love interest, Anzai Yuuki. He was actually complex by standard.Starting off, he actually looked like he was a bad guy, following the two who seemed like main characters like a stalker but was in fact a police officer who went to arrest a serial killer and rapist. +Is basically strong enough to apprehend a vampire. Oh, so that means he\'s going to be stronger than most bad guy. +For personality, he was cold as snow, easily push protagonist away from danger like nothing. But then, that snow quickly melted as he took her home. Ok? He\'s a good guy, just not the friendly kind. ++He then almost ""raped"" protagonist at her door but controlled himself. Yeah.... Hot and actually able to control himself. +++As he pulled himself back by sedative, he shows that he was desperate. Now he\'s attracted to protagonist and have to resort to foreign elements to control himself. Well, that\'s cute. +Then he admit it himself that he is a vampire. A HALF vampire, to be exact. So? You are going to give him 3 more points just by that setting? +++After that, he was so concerned over the girl that he had to go back to see her so very often. Now, how are you going to top it with building one hell of a hunk in one episode? +++++Just like that, Anzai got himself 16 pluses in just episode 1. Wow. Now that\'s a guy I want to fall in love with and date him. Yay! - is what I pretty much expect all female audiences (physical sex may vary) to think, say, scream or fangirling about him. That is not talking about his design. I myself can\'t  quite score him on that, so he actually have more score than I can measure.Compared to that, protagonist was a college student, fairly cute, have rather nice personality, can easily accept everything, never felt in love before and is innocent but able to take the initiative.Uhm? Why so much of a blank sheet? Well, not my problem I guess. It\'s a series directed at women after all.Then, the rest of the cast was even worse. All of them were simple. Their reasons for actions are staple as well.Well seen plot and staple character? Let\'s say, art and animation was good then, since character design... was... good...... Ok? I needed like 15 minutes to get used to 2D hand drawn art style. That\'s even longer than Seikai Suru Kado and Ajin. Enough to say I guess.Sound? What about sound?Well, not that good but it was good. Especially, the vampires who lost their control sounded scary. Just like a bunch of zom...b..i...e...s? Ok, am I just watching to find faults now? That\'s not even with sound, it was in story, damn it.And don\'t even get me started on that ending where the protagonist  could have done something, more like almost everything to help at the very end. Yet she only saw what was in front of her and started doing shits the long way around. It\'s fine, I\'m not triggered by that inaction.TLDR: I tried to find a way to raise the score I can give to this series but I can\'t, despite thought it could have been good.

Thought so to even watch all 12 episode. Only thing is, I couldn\'t do it.', ""First review ever written. Watched only 6 of the episodes. Let's start.The story: 6/10It is actually quite basic story about romance and vampires. Nothing unique and new I can say. If u have watched Tokyo Ghoul, you can definetely tell that they are placed in it some elements from the anime. Maybe that was the reason I gave it a chance after the first episode. Vampires are represented with many cliches, which is one of the minuses. Generally, the vampires are always or too overburdened with qualities or they are missing. No middle position. Here, though, there are not as many qualities as it...should have been, except that they drink blood. Perhaps, if the story was not made on a vampire theme, it would've been more likely to be liked by the people. But of course they are and some good things about the story. Its actually really exciting the whole love thing between the two charachters, at least for me. The story is proceeding rly fast which is maybe not so good, but for an anime which is not going to be probably continued, i think is fine.The art: 7/10Its good. Nothing which I havent expected. Dunno what to tell more here.The sound: 4/10I am quite dissapointed with the opening. The rhythm goes fine with the story and everything, but just..something is missing. Maybe the vocals just dusturb me. I dont know. I cant say anything about the ending, just because I haven't listened it properly. Its kinda sad tho.Charachters: 6/10Here it goes.. Lets start with the girl here. Well, the girs is basically a normal student  who only studyies and doesnt have any interests in men. What really bothers me about her is that she kinda doesnt have character. For a main personage, just without something unique, whats the point?The boy. Well, maybe he is the one who compensates the character of the girl with his actions and intentions? He is the lonely wolf u can tell, who wants to protect everyone by suiciding his own life. The story is mostly about him and his feelings. He is that kind of a characher who is always searching for some kind of answers not asking the questions, if u know what I mean. He kinda attracts all of the attention when the anime should be spinning around the girl's life, cuz everything starts with her. Kinda confusing I can say.The other personages. Well, the boy with the white hair is definatelly the one who gives the dynamics in the anime. He is the one who brings the whole story back to life. The savior. He brings back this entertainment. Thats why I like how they make him. And the cops and the others who are left.. well they are this kind of boring charachters that are just there to slow down the motion. They could be made so much funnier to give u that enjoument, cuz actually the anime holds only on the white haired guy, which is rly sad.If they did actually put and some other main charachters, the raitings would be higher.Enjoument: 7/10I give 7 just because I am kinda interested in this love story. The action and everything are rly not satisfying. The whole dynamics is kinda lost, but because of the main boy there and the white haired guy, i will give higher raiting.Overall: 7/10Give a chance to this anime. First watch the first episode then come to read the reviews. All of the things said here are with a rly low ranking, but after I watched it, its not so bad. Yeah, u can definatelly tell its kinda miserable at first point. Yet, i am still watching it. Try and then judge it. should have been, except that they drink blood.

The characters have no background and you cannot connect with them at all. The plot is compressed in 12 episodes and doesn’t even have a real ending to it on the last episode. Nothing gets resolved and no answers are revealed. More questions are introduced and the plot thickens but then it just dies. End of story. The only reason why I liked to watch this to the end is because of the cute girl being with a “bad boy”...who is “troubled” by his inner thoughts and self. The art is super bland where everything is stand still except for one character’s mouth movements. They go from one thing to another in less than a second and they start to introduce some sort of resolution to the main problem and then just cut it off like, “nope, I’m bored already, lets just let it die and see what happens next.” I hate it when anime ends with no resolution and where the protagonists are separated with no answers as to if they are ever back together or what happens to the bad guys. Just a waste of my time to be honest. who is “troubled” by his inner thoughts and self. The art is super bland where everything is stand still except for one character’s mouth movements.

Nothing deep or having the needs to make theories (no necessity to be critical), this could be the perfect vampire story for you. Therefore, please lower your expectations if you are looking for something with heavy themes.It focuses on romance, police, investigation, injustice, prejudice (between human and vampires) and much more. I have to admit that I dropped this series due to my own disappointment. I was hoping things to develop more strongly, especially the main characters (Tsukasa and Anzai). However,...they did not. The plot is also quite predictable and a bit sudden. You know, where Tsukasa continuously gets dragged into some messes that are related to Anzai.Enjoyable? Yes, it is! If you love mature (more serious-type) romance between vampires and humans, you'll definitely love this. Initially, I personally thought that Anzai was attractive (until later when he really looks like he needs some proper sleep). And Tsukasa started as a lovable character who is smart, independent, realistic young lady... until... (sighs) she became so dependent. Quite a disappointing development I'd say.Overall, I would only recommend this if you love vampire/monsters, police themes. The voice actors/actresses did a great job and the animation itself was pleasing! I'd definitely try to finish the remaining episodes soon. ^^ they did not.

It seems like you are just getting into the meat of the plot in the last few episodes when suddenly it ends. Major plot points are not even remotely resolved, and some are only brought up in that last episode. Leaves the series feeling unsatisfying. This is not aided by the very generic relationship between the two main characters in this kind of dangerous relationship that otherwise could distract you from the world building. The after credits final scene is somewhat baffling, leaving you wondering what has happened in terms of plot. It seems clear this is...certainly the end of the anime as they have changed several things from the manga, omitting scenes and even characters, that would otherwise be progressing the plot forward in this final episode. certainly the end of the anime as they have changed several things from the manga, omitting scenes and even characters, that would otherwise be progressing the plot forward in this final episode.', ""First time i saw the trailer, I was so excited for this anime cause the love story between human and vampire always makes me curious.Unfortunately, this anime is quite disappointed. For the story, it's just too much, there are many characters and they have similar look as each other (luckily our main characters are somehow different from the others). The main girl doesn't give me any impression except her love for the vampire, the vampire - the girl's boyfriend - in my opinion is quite weak, who loves breaking the rules, jumping and can not control his desire for blood. No impression on this character,...too. But the supporting character did a great job, he is funny, helpful and he knows his strengths. I like the way he lives his life.About this anime, it's quite entertaining and that's it :) too. But the supporting character did a great job, he is funny, helpful and he knows his strengths.

He is afraid by losing control and becoming a beast. In the begining there is a man who cut himself to keep control. They exactly act like people who can\'t accept their sexuality.

Not anything major, but hard to give a decent review without mentioning some things, so read at your own risk. I\'ll try keeping them at minimum.Story 7/10The setting is a world with humans and vampire-like creatures (called ""Oni"" which means demon in Japanese) that look like humans but basically go crazy after seeing or drinking blood. Oni try to live their lives (well, most of them do) normaly without killing or drinking blood and are afraid of going crazy and hurting people. The MPD Public Safety Division 5 is in charge of handeling the Oni and investigations and the...CCC (Chosen Civil Community) is an organization with the goal of exterminating Oni. The story revolves around a half-human-half-oni MPD investigator Yuuki Anzai and Tsukasa Taira - a human who he saved from an Oni. They fall in love and go through several moral dylemmas and tough situations together. While the story itself is interesting, the plot is rushed and this would have been a lot better if it were a 24 episode anime. There\'s lots of things left unexplained and I doubt we\'ll get another season considering the ending (not spoiling).Art 9/10The artstyle and animation are on point. Hard to find a bad remark about them. The dark colors work really well with this kind of setting.Sound 8/10The voice cast does a good job on this one, especially for the main character Yuuki Anzai. The deep and warm voice really suits him.Nothing really special about the background music, but it fits the scenes well and keeps the dark atmosphere going.Interesting opening and ending themes.Character 7/10Like I mentioned in the story section, this would have been a much better anime if it went on for 24 episodes. Lacking in character developement. Tsukasa falls in love with Anzai at first sight and follows him uncoditionally everywhere, even gets hurt because of him or to help/save him. There\'s no real reason for this nor is there enough time for their relationship to grow to such lengths. One might say it\'s just her character, but I\'ll go ahead and say it\'s just a lack of her character and rushed writting.Character design is really cool though.Enjoyment 9/10Having said all that, I really enjoyed this show, along with it\'s ups and downs. Not exceptional, but really good for me.Overall 8/10Maybe 8/10 is exagerated in terms of raw quality, but my overall rating is always influenced by how much I enjoyed the anime, so in terms of objective quality I\'d say the rating should be around 6.5-7/10, but with enjoyment being 9/10 for me, I give it a 8/10 total.

I would recommend that you watch this anime with an open mind and just know that if you came here for any kind of intimate or intense story you are in the wrong place, sadly.I don't like being too critical about anime as at the end of the day it's whether you found some kind of enjoyment out of it but DL had me constantly wondering when I was going to receive concrete answers to many of the...mysteries surrounding the MC, when in actuality they get pushed to the side or answered very briefly/vaguely meaning that they could have developed a story that got the viewers more involved but chose not to. However, DL has a tendency to re-use and recycle very basic character traits that in the end just make it a very round-about anime making you feel that you wasted a large amount of time. mysteries surrounding the MC, when in actuality they get pushed to the side or answered very briefly/vaguely meaning that they could have developed a story that got the viewers more involved but chose not to.

She goes to university and knows how to cook. Wow.Serious lines that made me laugh out loud because of how poorly written they are were not an uncommon occurrence. The actions the characters took were either completely predictable and formulaic, or made absolutely no sense from a logical standpoint. Also, cheese. A lot of cheese.You'll watch the same scene with the hero and the heroine play out over and over again with barely and progress in their relationship.The Japanese...voice acting was surprisingly much, much worse than the English one, with the English one not standing out positively either. Thus I watched the show dubbed. The male MC sounds like what 12-year-old me would want my voice to sound like if I was a vampire.The animation and colors did sometimes look pretty good, but the bad moments vastly overshadowed the good ones.The story was mostly predictable, but there were a few twists here and there that caught me as a surprise. It wishes it was deeper than it actually is with its message about racial issues, but all it comes off as is pseudo-intellectual. A few anime have filled out the same template a lot better. Tokyo Ghoul and Darker than Black come to mind. The main MC reminds me of Kyoukai no Kanata's Akihito, but a lot worse.It's a missed opportunity for another good vampire show that we've been oh so dearly missing in anime.

It has a lot of problems, but the rough start develops into an actually decent action flick.Well, the beginning is awful and may put off many people (including me before I came back to it a couple years later) because of the romance which is unfortunately the highlighted focus of the anime. I myself am not truly devoid of making the Twilight connection in my head because the first 3 episodes had established so and ended the 12-episode cour with that in my mind. But I\'m...getting ahead of myself, let\'s start from the beginning.The start of Anzai and Tsukasa\'s relationship feels unnatural, forced, and rapey, even. The girl had trouble with dating and couldn\'t reciprocate the feelings her classmate had for her only to later randomly fall in love with a dude who kissed her all of a sudden. The dynamic between them had to start somehow, but it did on a bloody fan-fiction level of writing. A formerly closed-off girl falls in love with an emo vampire with bags under his eyes who ""saves"" her - how can you not compare it to Twilight after seeing this mess?Just when I thought I would end up laughing watching the remaining episodes, the fourth and fifth episodes happened. The introduction of Lee (which I find to be the best character in the show alongside later introduced Ishimaru) spiced things up, as he expanded on the whole vampire thing. Shortly after, we were introduced to a certain fraction, which really started the world-building process. It took me a couple more episodes to realise that Devils Line wasn\'t strictly about romance anymore and instead focused on the grand moral issue of humans and vampires coexisting, all the while slowly but surely connecting the dots and characters which purpose was to build upon the narrative.Now, I must say, the characters aren\'t the best, and they seem to be lacking proper treatment, but it\'s not like they are complete cardboards either. What I like about the show is that it doesn\'t throw away characters, and many of the supposedly episodic ones end up returning at some point. They also have their own motives and don\'t exist only to serve a single purpose.There are some pretty exciting twists in the story, and I like how everything smoothly transitions. Unfortunately, the romance thing hadn\'t died off. It\'s still a fairly promiment matter that I\'ve purposely omitted to show the good sides of the anime, which I cannot understand how everyone fails to see. And even despite the romance not dying off, it\'s now handled way better. The couple tries to understand each other, and they show some kind of maturity (Anzai\'s a little bitch, though, lmao). The other thing that showed potential is that their love story serves a purpose to Anzai trying to fight off his inner demons, and in that sense, it makes sense. I won\'t, however, forget how cringy some of the scenes could be, and I just really wish there was no romance at all.I also had slight problems with the animation, as the characters didn\'t look great and had these weird white outlines. The background was pretty plain most of the time, and the action sequences were meh, but it wasn\'t anything jarring, and I doubt it will bother you that much.The adaptation isn\'t full, so the ending left much to be desired. They went in an interesting direction, but the entangled cheap love-dovey aspect was, sadly, sigh-inducing. I can\'t help but get frustrated at how unnecessary this romance thing ended up being most of the time.But even despite the noticeable flaws which a lot of people have also pointed out, I realised halfway through that I was simply having fun. I became interested in the plot outside of the silly romance, and it was my intention writing this review to shed some positive light at the story and the world-building. getting ahead of myself, let\'s start from the beginning.The start of Anzai and Tsukasa\'s relationship feels unnatural, forced, and rapey, even.

Well, a pretty good vampire cop story about human hatred toward vampires and terrorism, characters you will enjoy watching, combined with a decent love story that at first is the forefront, but ends up taking the backstage. The MC is the A-typical emo vampire...who hates being one, so it isn't without its troupes.It's a good watch if you aren't sick of vampires and want something with political intrigue. But it really should have had a second season, as it is now it isn't very satisfying at the end. who hates being one, so it isn't without its troupes.It's a good watch if you aren't sick of vampires and want something with political intrigue.

I ended up binging all 12 episodes in one go, because it was really good!The characters are well written and likable, the plot was really interesting with a few twists along the way, the pacing was great and the animation was good too. There was not a single episode that I disliked or that bored me.I only have one complaint; the ending wasn't satisfying, which I was prepared for beforehand from reading reviews. But...other than the unsatisfying ending, I really enjoyed this anime and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an anime with romance, occasional intense violent scenes that make you grasp your seat and some exciting plot twists.

Over the course of around two weeks, I forced myself through about four episodes before giving up. After giving up, it practically vanished from my head for so long that I am just now posting my thoughts on it (~05/2021).

The plot is effectively Neo-Twilight; need I say any more?"", ""Angsty vampire stories about them being angsty and self-loathing of their nature and being in love with a human are nothing new for me to see within media, even in some instances within anime. This recent example of the premise involves said vampire being a member of a secret police division tasked with halting vampiric threats and preventing their existence from becoming publicly known, and finding himself become drawn to a young woman in college who encounters him apprehending a close friend of hers who she wasn't aware of being a vampire. The anime mainly involves the two attempt to start up a relationship complicated...by Anzai's loathing of his vampiric nature, and complicated by anti-vampire terrorist groups attempting to wipe his kind out.The major shortcoming to Devils Line would involve the execution of its storytelling. It's largely pretty clumsy in the handling of elements to its story with many of the characters too immersed into the archetypes they personify and there isn't much dimension to them to a large degree as a result. Anzai largely angsts about his vampiric nature and continually has internal conflicts on whether or not he wants to be with Taira. Taira is largely defined by her persistence at trying to get Anzai to not be overly protective of her and being sympathetic toward vampires as she learns more about them. Maybe the only character I gave some hoot about was the other major vampire of the story, Johannes Kleeman, who seemed content with his vampiric nature as such to have control over his bloodlust, knowledge on their capabilities, and still be rather sensible in his interactions with other characters. Other characters are largely unremarkable, mostly settling into whatever archetypes and roles they have within the anime.The plot's no different in this regard in regards of awkwardness. Devils' Line tries painting the vampire phoenomena as a rather grey area since they are attempting to overcome their bloodlust to attempt coexisting with humans. But while a decent amount of fleshing out is provided to those supporting of coexistence, the same isn't given to those opposed to them because of the anime's rather shallow characterization, thus making the conflict feel more black-and-white as a result. Adding to the plot's issues, events in the series breeze by at a pretty brisk pace and give the audience little breathing room to take in things with major plot developments. This likely has to do with this adaptation trying to cram 40 chapters of manga material into a 12-episode anime and ending inconclusively due to the manga still ongoing during the time of its airing.The presentation also has its fair share of awkwardness to it as well. Visuals are largely pretty subpar with generic looking character designs, a city landscape that's been done plenty of times for anime trying to be suspenseful, and nothing too engaging for animation despite the title's presence of vampires in it. In terms of music, I have to wonder what the creators of this series were thinking with the choices for it as the light, slow scores clash badly with the dark and serious aesthetic Devils' Line was trying to push for with its focus on vampires in modern Japanese society.In short, Devils' Line is a rather shoddy and clumsily executed anime due to its brisk pacing, shallow characters, and sloppy handling of the title's story.

The show is flat out trashy so if you enjoy stuff like that you might get a kick out of this show but it wasn't for me.The story is about vampires that are mixed into human society and the authorities and third parties revolving around dealing with them. They act completely indistinguishable to humans until they witness blood and in which case they turn into these bloodlusty monsters. And I mean lust in the literal sense. They obviously get violent but they also get aroused by blood. This leads the series to have a...lot of sexual assault in it.And on that note I have to mention the main character Tsukasa who is probably my main complaint about the show besides the undertones. She gets into these awful situations constantly (violence and rape) but somehow is always okay with all of it. The show never mentions her having any mental issues but I cannot fathom a normal human being reacting to the things she has experiences the way she does.A lot of the times the show just feels like a rape fantasy by the author.

I just feel that all the horrible deeds were the main focus of the writing which really made the characters feel like they were AI or something. Just constant reactions that make no sense.Outside of the main duo, there were some okay characters but another big issue was that the designs are way too samey.

My point being that this anime presents problems and plot points that more often than not are INCREDIBLY easy to solve, however, instead of taking the easy route and solving the problems without much drama attached, the anime decides to take the most painstaking route out of every other path you could take. It's...incredibly frustrating to watch, but I wouldn't have minded this as much as I did if it wasn't for the characters.Because, oh boy, are the characters dumb: every single character in this anime is like a shell of itself, the relationships are incredibly rushed, to the point that nothing makes sense. Especially the relationship between the two main characters is strange, there's no coherent reason why they would be like that toward each other SO QUICKLY AND WITHOUT ANY FORM OF DEVELOPMENT WHATSOEVER.Besides that, like I said, the characters don't particularly have any more charm than a piece of cardboard, they're, in fact, so one-dimensional that they might as well be a piece of actual cardboard.

No matter how silly or action-filled the anime is, a goal or something that should be in some way resolved by the end of the anime is clearly stated at some point. usually, the plot will go around it and replace the goal...with something equally satisfying to the viewer. for example again: like said earlier, in ouran high school, the goal was for Haruhi to pay for the broken vase through work in the host club, but instead the goal is replaced by the romantic relationship and development of senpai and Haruhi. by the end of the anime, the first goal was replaced, but still the ending is somewhat satisfactory and the first goal's resolution isn't needed.in this anime, the goal was clearly the acceptance of vampires in the community while also dealing with and destroying an evil organization. another goal that can also be presented is for the main character to gain control over his own power and let his relationship with the love interest develop. well... the ending had neither. it was a confusing and totally unsatisfactory ending. none of the goals earlier established by the mood or the development of the episodes are resolved by the end. I'm pretty sure this anime was supposed to have a second season but it was canceled, but even without a second season, the ending was so wrong in soo many ways.SPOILERSbasically, the evil organization was never destroyedthe bad guy got awaythe love interest and main character didn't end up togetherthe mc never controlled his vampire ability or powerswe don't know more about the orphanagethe clear wish to allow for humans and demons to have intercourse and the many episodes stuff was planted out in order to let it happen or defend it just for the goal or topic to be dropped and disappears completely in like the 8th episodeno one knows shit about the other characters at the endand society still hates vampiresthis ending is so bad honestly. if you were going to make an ending so bad please retire from making anime for the rest of your life. how is this ending supposed to make the audience want more? no wonder it got canceled with something equally satisfying to the viewer. for example again: like said earlier, in ouran high school, the goal was for Haruhi to pay for the broken vase through work in the host club, but instead the goal is replaced by the romantic relationship and development of senpai and Haruhi. by the end of the anime, the first goal was replaced, but still the ending is somewhat satisfactory and the first goal's resolution isn't needed.in this anime, the goal was clearly the acceptance of vampires in the community while also dealing with and destroying an evil organization. another goal that can also be presented is for the main character to gain control over his own power and let his relationship with the love interest develop. well... the ending had neither. it was a confusing and totally unsatisfactory ending. none of the goals earlier established by the mood or the development of the episodes are resolved by the end.

This time I dared. Thank God I did!! The score cannot be so low. Why ?? Because it has wonderful art, soothing music, and above all, thought provoking and mature story.

On the other hand, humans can\'t escape from the punishment of a single unforgivable crime. This is the lesson you will get from this OVA.

I realise that not reading the manga beforehand means I most likely do not \'fully comprehend\' the context, history and motivations of certain characters, but like I said, this review will focus on the movie as it is, a standalone from other adaptations.StoryReincarnation is a fascinating subject, combined with Buddhism\'s perspective of karma, and you have an interesting combination of the two; especially when it\'s used as a...plot device to further the story or a character\'s development. Sadly however, \'Houou-hen\', does not adequately portray this plot device as much as I hoped it would. We\'re introduced to the \'Phoenix\', the embodiment of reincarnation and overseer of karmic retribution, yet the all too convenient timings of its appearance honestly lessen the impacts of certain events in the story. For example, a certain character being visited by the \'Phoenix\' to motivate them to do their duty for whatever banal reasoning is a pretty lame way to move the plot forward.The story for the most part was easy to follow, however, it just was not as engaging as I thought it would be. There are constant time skips and we\'re not given enough background information on our two protagonists to really comprehend their situations.CharactersThe \'Phoenix\' is portrayed as an enigmatic, awe-inspiring deity, however, the motivations or should I say, judgements handed down by the \'Phoenix\' followed no reasonable or logical reasoning. I realise that this story is a take on Buddhist beliefs of reincarnation and karma, but I honestly could not understand any of the reasonings behind certain decisions of the \'Phoenix\'. To illustrate, we have a character who\'s possibly killed dozens or hundreds of innocent people, why? Who knows, the movie does not go into depth, but because of a certain incident with his lover (who might I add, he raped and captured her), he all of a sudden has a change of heart and goes on some sort of \'disillusioned pilgrimage\' to change his ways. All the while, we are made to feel sympathetic towards this scumbag of a character, while on the opposite end, we have our second protagonist, a wood carver who by all regards is literally just a normal person with normal aspirations but instead the movie paints him out to be a villain lmao.As I am not a Buddhist, I do not fully comprehend the cause and effect of the karma system, however, I do realise that the moral or theme this movie tries to portray is that no matter how many wrong deeds one has committed, there will always be a way for them to repent? Or maybe not, because as I recall in the movie, when the \'Phoenix\' is talking to Gaou, our reformed mass murderer, it informs him that he will ""suffer eternal pain, sadness, and hate for all eternity"" despite him already changing his ways. As for our second protagonist, the woodcarver, he is reborn into a ""small fish"" lmao just because he didn\'t follow his original dream of finding the \'Phoenix\' and because he outed the mass murderer for being well, a mass murderer.All in all, I fail to see any sort of deep meaning or message behind the movie. If repentance gets you nowhere, then why even bother, and if a momentary lapse in moral judgement dooms you for eternity, then I guess we\'re all doomed. The only take away from this I can really surmise is that the \'Phoenix\' is an all around dick to everyone. plot device to further the story or a character\'s development.

His S.A.C. series is by far the best take on the Ghost in the Shell IP in my opinion, it\'s one of, if not THE one all time favorite anime of mine. I always hope this guy could get more attention and get more things done.However ""Hirune Hime"" is kind of underwhelming. It\'s not really a bad film but the pacing is weird, the narrative is kind of childish, and the dialogue said too much.In parts it kind reminds me of some of Kon Satoshi\'s...work, with the theme and the way it was approached, sadly it\'s not done nearly as good.The animation is decent but not spectacular, the music is serviceable. Again, it\'s not really bad. But the story and the narrative just don\'t work... I can\'t help but see a better film, a great film buried deep within it.I guess I was expecting way more from the man and the trailer. But how can you blame me? work, with the theme and the way it was approached, sadly it\'s not done nearly as good.The animation is decent but not spectacular, the music is serviceable. Again, it\'s not really bad. But the story and the narrative just don\'t work... I can\'t help but see a better film, a great film buried deep within it.I guess I was expecting way more from the man and the trailer. But how can you blame me?', 'Ever since my childhood, one of few things which intrigued me the most is these weird visions i had during my sleep, that is, dreams. Its quite funny that we don\'t know what has been in stored for us be fore we sleep, and what had happened after we woke up, even though everything just took place inside our heads. Hirune Hime (napping Princess) , the movie in question, Also tried to explore this concept of dreams in a interesting way, But unfortunately failed at properly executing the idea.Well, Before watching it, I really had no idea what the movie is going to be about,...But after the curtains dropped, I have to say, I still have no idea what it was about.Honestly, I had really high hopes from the movie, given that its made by the director of ghost in the shell, BUt i was really disappointed with the result. The major problem is that, The movie lacked direction. It had a promising start, But it just scatters off in all directions afterwards. The movie tried to showcase a mix of different genres, but it failed at doing so properly and the way everything happens, you couldn\'t really take anything that happened seriously.The Movie itself is quite ambitious. It tries to explore quite a variety of genres and had a unique way of story telling. It made quick transitions from reality to dreams ,  resulting in a change of scenario in between the scenes but the way of progression of the events was still the same. And all of this could have resulted in something good, if it was not for the poorly written story.The story can get difficult to describe, Its a mix a different things unrelated things mixed in a hog-pog manner. It follows kokone, a high school girl who sees this weird dream every day where she is the princess of a world of cars. Her father is a genius mechanic who was arrested for false charges and now in the process of saving him, she discovers the truth about him and her dead mother and how her dreams are not just her mere imaginations. Also in the background, another story is taking place in a different world, which is in kokone\'s head.The events that take place are mostly same in both of them, but the other one is more a fantasy based world with magic. Occasionally, Both worlds come together, Tho things still happen  inside the girls dreams . They try to bring together  both of them by the climax, and to be honest, that part was still good.Honestly ,The beginning part was not half bad and I kinda Liked it. It gave a vivid description of the unique world of kokone\'s dreams and also a bit about her normal life. The things were also going fine till the airport part, but from there the movie started to scatter around and I just couldn\'t bring myself to enjoy the rest . However the little  transitions between dreams and reality were still really fine and it was also an interesting way to show scenes which, otherwise would have been very plain .The characters are yet another weak link here. They are really plain and are mostly one dimensional and there is no development,Tho this part can be overlooked . Most characters do not have well defined personality and do not really fit the roll they are doing. The antagonist, for example, is just very poorly made with no clear motives and a stupid personality And so can be said for Morio. Despite having a major part, he pretty much seems useless and I am still not sure for what reason he was there in the movie anyways.The father is also a bland character, There is nothing special about his personality or there is rather pretty much nothing to say about him .  Kokone is simple girl in her last year of high school and is planning to go to a university in Tokyo . However she also has a secret life, The one in her dreams, where she is a princess of a country and has magical powers thorough which she fights wit the bad people along with a pirate.There is not really much to praise or complain about her character,Tho I quite like her, for some reason.One of my favorite parts was the ending credits, where they showed the past of kokone\'s mother and father and also how they met. The few scenes shown were enough to convey a lot about their history, and also song was great too.I don\'t usually talk a lot about art style, as, the opinions vary for different people. The color palette is made of solid colors. and is quite bright . It fits really well and  creates a good atmosphere during  the transitions to the fantasy world. The animation is fine for most part, but there are a some visible inconsistencies and its not really fluid either, But to be honest, I can overlook that, as it is not really prominent. The character design is good and I don\'t really have any complains. The ending theme, ""daydream believer"" is extremely well done and I really like it. Tho it would have been better if it was played during the scenes too.In conclusion, The movie is quite different from what you might expect it to be. Its not bad and had a promising start, but it couldn\'t really hold that for for long.The way things happen is a result of poor writing and execution of ideas. Most of it is pretty forgettable and there is not really a lot to praise it for.It is also that, I had some good expectations from the movie during the start, and it didn\'t really stand up to my expectations, and it might not be as bad As I make it out to be.So,Just don\'t really go in with high expectations, You might not like then. Also  this movie is  not something i would really recommend to people unless you have absolutely noting else to watch. But after the curtains dropped, I have to say, I still have no idea what it was about.Honestly, I had really high hopes from the movie, given that its made by the director of ghost in the shell, BUt i was really disappointed with the result. The major problem is that, The movie lacked direction. It had a promising start, But it just scatters off in all directions afterwards. The movie tried to showcase a mix of different genres, but it failed at doing so properly and the way everything happens, you couldn\'t really take anything that happened seriously.The Movie itself is quite ambitious. It tries to explore quite a variety of genres and had a unique way of story telling. It made quick transitions from reality to dreams ,  resulting in a change of scenario in between the scenes but the way of progression of the events was still the same. And all of this could have resulted in something good, if it was not for the poorly written story.The story can get difficult to describe, Its a mix a different things unrelated things mixed in a hog-pog manner. It follows kokone, a high school girl who sees this weird dream every day where she is the princess of a world of cars. Her father is a genius mechanic who was arrested for false charges and now in the process of saving him, she discovers the truth about him and her dead mother and how her dreams are not just her mere imaginations.

Scenery is extremely well done and detailed here, I appreciated it all the way throughout the movie. The final ending pan gave a bit of life into the town they live in, which is a really nice touch.Sound [7/10]It\'s good, not much to say here as it\'s just good and borderline average, or not memorable as I heard it. I don\'t think it detracts from the movie at all and the OST does its job sufficiently in setting some tone.I think some of the VAs, mainly Kokone and more noticeable with Morio, a bit raw with their performances, but it was still good. I didn\'t want to not hear them talk, it was more along the lines of noticing some small thing about their voices.Character [6/10]This is a really story/plot heavy movie, so character development and exposition is low. Sure you get to know everyone is by the end, but their motivations to act are kind of generic or not really memorable; slight exceptions can be made for Momotaro. With that being said, you don\'t really grow to dislike or like much of the cast because of how little you know or relate to them.Enjoyment [9/10]The story and art are the most memorable parts, I just personally found them to be very appealing. Really liked the way the two worlds combined in the end, the fantastic art/visuals reinforced the imagery of everything. I wouldn\'t mind rewatching; this story lends itself well to rewatches given that not everything\'s explicit to the viewer.I don\'t think everyone will enjoy this, not everyone\'s interpretation of the story will be the same and thus the conclusion they draw may lead them to believe it wasn\'t that good. However, I think it\'s worth a watch for most people as it\'s trying something different. had a bit of detail sacrificed (shadow and lighting) and gained at the same time with more facial features.

Its screen name in my country is translated ""Decoding the dreams"". Knowing that shouldn\'t judge a book by its cover but I didn\'t expect much about this movie in the first place.The best thing of this film is its beautiful visual (but not that breathtaking).Mysterious, adventurous, fantasy, are what I can say about its genre.Sounds like a Ghibli movie but I considered much worse.The concept of this movie reminds a lot about Steamboy (the dream of automation) and Paprika (dreams - reality blending).I have to say the story is its ultimate weakness. It...tends to be confusing, mysterious but there are too many plot holes and tons of details that make me wonder: ""What is it for ?"", ""Why is it so cringy ?"". Ehhh....and the mecha parts....I don\'t have a word to say =.= . In conclusion, the story is quite childish for me but at the same time it is filled with symbolic images which makes it\'s hard to understand what\'s going on for kids.The music was good but not that outstanding (8/10). So far, my most favorite ost from anime movies are from Kimi no nawa and Mononoke princess.Finally, I have a huge impression on Kokone, the main character. That\'s another bright point of this movie.Overall rating: 6/10 tends to be confusing, mysterious but there are too many plot holes and tons of details that make me wonder: ""What is it for ?"", ""Why is it so cringy ?"".

The production is pretty solid with generally-nice animation, a good setting (though the Olympics tie-ins are very sparse), and likeable characters, but the fundamental premise is just a stinker and the movie goes practically nowhere. Why did any of the napping segments even exist? Did the studio really just want to make some CGI mech fights? Did they think their plot for the real-life story was too thin (it was)?I can't say I'm disappointed since I went in knowing this movie doesn't have the best of reputations, but I sure...wish this was a better movie. wish this was a better movie."", ""I have sense lowered my overall rating for this Anime. When I saw that this Anime was coming out I got really excited. The reason that I did not like this Anime that much was that I felt it was a bit boring. I think it was also partially my fault. I had high expectations and the it turned out being just OK.Spoiler Caution:At the end of the day this is a cute story about family that warmed my heart and I really appreciated that. I enjoyed the optimism of female protagonist. At times it made her look 2 dimensional, but at the same time...it was refreshing.If you watch this anime, I am sure you will be confused by two different stories and how they mix together. In my opinion, it is not important what is or what is not real. The point is, there are story elements that move the plot forward and it arrives at a resolution. The fact that I couldn't make sense of parts of the story, or how it fit in didn't bother me. But I am sure it will bother some.It was a decent show, please watch it.

Cheap, pointless fanservice, stale dialogue or anime tropes that just won't die - the list is large. These things are usually strewn across the majority of titles, even the ones I like.As a result, however, I started gravitating towards the titles like the Napping Princess, which can definitely brag as an original piece of work that has at least some heart and soul put into it, rather than following a formula so many have tried, and so few have nailed.But Napping Princess reminded me of...one crucial thing that is much worse, way more damaging than the average formulaic approach that proves to, at the very least, entertain me for a few hours. What that might be, you ask?Napping Princess is bland as fuck.It is truly amazing how a relatively simple but intrinsically interesting setting this movie has, can end up with a plot both convoluted and so very empty. Not to say I didn't enjoy it at all - but by the end of the movie you are left with so many loose ends that you can't possibly feel satisfied neither with its resolution nor with its setting.I had to begin to wonder - how is this possible? The animation is nice and fluid. The soundtrack, I understand, can be engaging, even though I personally found it occasionally jarring. The setting is, again, interesting enough to get invested.But then you realize that's all there is. There is the plot, the music, and the looks... and no solid theme to explore.The movie, in fact, showers you with themes... themes that never get a chance to shine.A car making millionaire that chases profit? Resolved with no input.A relationship between a girl and her mother, whom she only know though her father's stories is set up to be a huge plot element, only to never be properly addressed or discussed by the end.A father, clearly distanced from his daughter, and traumatized by the events of his life... never gets a closure.There is a borderline sentient self-driving vehicle that gets a heroic moment for no reason besides its name, without its role being properly presented to the audience. I mean you can understand its role, by the end... you just end up wondering, 'when the hell was that established?'... So who the hell is the protagonist in here? The girl who carries that title could easily pass it around to either her friend, her father, or even the vehicle she drives, and the story wouldn't lose nor gain anything because everything about it was bland.In conclusion, you could argue that the movie is pretty to look at.  It has an occasional funny or interesting scene. I would even argue it got fun for a minute or two.But it was bland, and nothing can save a feature that doesn't dare to go deep enough into a single one of its several themes.... As an afterthought, the film should go by it's secondary title of 'The Story of the Unknown Me'; the protagonist indeed remains sadly unexplored and unknown, and the only Napping Princess during the time I watched this movie, turned out to be me. one crucial thing that is much worse, way more damaging than the average formulaic approach that proves to, at the very least, entertain me for a few hours.

By the plot format of Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari utilizes Kokone\'s dreams of her own fantasy world to somewhat show events in Kokone\'s real life and vice versa in the effect of both dreams and reality being...interlaced in main driving (pardon the pun) force of this movie. That main driving force mainly involving Kokone\'s father Momotarou voiced by Yosuke Eguchi being embroiled in a business conspiracy and this translates into Kokone\'s dreams as Momotarou being a pirate and him being taken by the kingdom\'s forces with Kokone being the Princess and wanting to have her help Momotarou in the kingdom\'s corruption.See how LA sees Kokone\'s dreams quite literally spilling into reality is kinda the charm to Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari, almost like Kokone\'s dreams correlate to the real world of hers and how it both affects Kokone\'s current situation as well as Kokone\'s dream self current situation, the easiest non spoliery example being how Kokone and Morio (a friend of Kokone) managed to get from Tokyo to Osaka, was that Kokone\'s motorbike had a self-driving program that accidentally took them to Osaka, this translating into Kokone\'s dream is that well Kokone and Morio are driving their bike/small mech to find Momotarou. To this end LA can say that it kept LA\'s suspension of disbelief of how any of this can be achieved in Kokone\'s reality as they give these hints afterwards, they just don\'t handwave it away like it\'s nothing, the only part however is near the finale where it almost swayed and almost pushed off LA\'s suspension of disbelief but nonetheless Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari managed to keep it\'s own rules it formed in check....for the most part.Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari is but a simple story of a business conspiracy of a self-automated program for cars and because of Kokone\'s dreams translate into something bigger to the point of trying to save a kingdom from both the kingdom\'s own corruption and defeating huge lava monsters with mechas. But deeper down it\'s also a family-issue plot with generational gap differences, family and business disputes as well as wanting to protect your family, as much LA really doesn\'t like these issues or is annoyed by them (mainly how frequent this topic is in Japanese media) , HOW Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari portrayed it and in it\'s subtle ways through it\'s characters were enough to quell LA\'s ire rather quickly.If there were some flaws LA found, well the only one LA could defend is ""uhh Kokone\'s dreams don\'t translate well to reality"", to that, no there are little subtle hints that MAKES it that way, that or you can just imagine it in a ways with what hints were given to make this, yes even the huge mecha\'s fighting lava monsters counts as this, metaphorically speaking...it is dreams after all, the other would be if the minor or main characters are bland, to that LA will say that no, if you can read between the lines both in the dream and reality subtext some of the most character developments you\'d see in Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari would go to Momotarou and Kokone, yes the minor characters do support for the majority of the part but for the solid character development of this movie would be in bulk go to the main characters to which it has a focused narrative on (of course some minor characters development would be shafted with the narrative Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari has). The ONLY flaw LA could take as a small downfall to Hirune Hime: Shiranai Watashi no Monogatari would be the main villain of this movie, Ichirou Watanabe voiced by Arata Furuta mainly for the sake of him be rather an idiot in terms of villainy, sure his plans are thought out and he wants to cover his tracks and everything but damn is he incompetent to the point a TEENAGER thwarts him at EVER turn...just damn is this main villain deliberately incompetent for the sake of the plot.In terms of animation by Signal. MD, the animation was decent as well as consistent for the most part and even better is how the animation incorporated it\'s fantasy and reality elements into the mix into something rather schizo-tech and genre-bending in it\'s animation style. With it\'s distinct character designs able to be noticed who\'s who in BOTH dream and reality aspects, the battles mainly the mech battles were an awe to see and even the animation taking liberties in showing real life Japan (see Tokyo and Osaka) just made the animation pop that much more.

Well, this is the anime version of it. In broader terms, this movie looked like it was made for kids, catering for the whole family. Let me explain why.First, the plot structure is suspiciously similar to western movies targeted for children (This doesn't count as a spoiler, by the way. I'm just explaining how the plot structure works): Parent gets in trouble, kid discovers a treasure-worthy possession, travels the country, beat the bad guys via deus ex machina, saves parent and returns the possession, and they all live happily ever after. Heck, this structure...doesn't fit anime at all. It seems more fit for a live-action. But you may argue that it's set in a fantasy world, so it's more appropriate for animation. Yes, it would've been... if it weren't following a predictable structure that almost every kid has seen in every movie.Next, we have the characters. Same thing. MC's your typical girl who's left in the dark until she discovers a valuable item and plays around with it, dad's secretly an important person, bad guys are klutz and greedy idiots, and side characters only show up for like a minute or so. Literally every character had a flat personality and there wasn't enough time for them to develop.And don't even get me started with the soundtrack. I cannot emphasize how Hollywood-ish it is. I mean, the ending song sounds like it was written by a guy who recently watched Sharkboy and Lavagirl and was inspired to make music for the sake of mimicking western film melodies.The only redeeming factor was the art style, which was not as good, but at least it still reminded me that I was watching an anime movie.I'm sorry if I keep comparing it to western children's movies. There's just so much similarities that I just couldn't turn a blind eye on it. Did I enjoy it? Yes, but only because it reminded me of the good ol' times. Do I recommend it? For newcomers, maybe. But if you're looking for an unforgettable anime, then you might wanna reconsider. doesn't fit anime at all. It seems more fit for a live-action.

This film does a great job at balancing the two worlds. As a kid, I was a big fan of the book Holes, and Napping Princess achieves much of the same effect. I love the parallelism between the worlds and I felt the scene selections were perfect. Each plot device was used effectively. They really let the viewer pick up on the little bits of information throughout the story and for them to come with their own interpretation, but...it never gets too surreal. Often times with dream related films it becomes a little too surreal, but this uses the dreams just right in my opinion. The music is also fantastic. Seriously, do not miss out on this. it never gets too surreal. Often times with dream related films it becomes a little too surreal, but this uses the dreams just right in my opinion.

Seriously, do not miss out on this.', 'Probably the best Ipad commercial ever.Pros:- Voice acting is very good.- Very creative take on the old ""your dreams become reality"" thing we\'ve seen a few times in movies before.  I like how in this the lines are so blurred that at times you don\'t even know which is real life and which is the dream.- The description was not lying when it said this was a ""blending of genres"" to paraphrase.  The weird blend of slice-of-life, mecha, and fantasy really add something to what I would otherwise consider a mediocre film.- The climax of the film is so stupid it enters the...realm of ""so bad it\'s good"".  Incredibly entertaining ending.- I like the Japanese version of ""Daydream Believer"" at the end.  (although would somebody please explain why this song seems to be almost more popular in Japan than the US.)- I quite liked the animation and character designs, also.Cons:- Villain is extremely boring.  Typical rich, evil, businessman we\'ve seen a million times in other things.- While the soundtrack isn\'t bad, it isn\'t anything too spectacular either.  Some of the cartoon-y sound effects also are a bit distracting and unfitting.  (SPOILER: the sound effect for the villain\'s death being a literal toilet flushing, though, I thought was so random, yet hilarious. SPOILER END)- While it wasn\'t THAT difficult to follow, the plot could get a bit confusing at times.Overview:This was a somewhat strange, yet still quaint and enjoyable film.  It\'s not a masterpiece by any means, but it\'s still a good watch that I would recommend.  I especially recommend it for some of the incredibly odd choices they make in certain parts that range from being cute to being simply utterly random and kind of laughable at times (either that or I\'m just really tired).  Quite creative artistically.  A bit cliche in some areas, but not so much so that it\'s unwatchable.  7/10. realm of ""so bad it\'s good"".

My initial reaction to the film was that it was visually interesting and entertaining, but also a little childish for me. I found the story to be mildly confusing at times, but with the help of some analysis of my friend who was a film critic, I appreciated what it was doing. Hearing from the creators themselves was especially...eye-opening, and I gained even more appreciation for what the film was doing. Essentially, it is a creative adaption of an old Japanese tale, which is partially why the story feels simple: much like how disney adaptions of fairy tales, while very beautiful, told simple tales historically. I wouldn't elevate this to Studio Ghibli levels, but I would urge you to consider that there is much more intention behind this and as a foreigner, we don't have the full story. Give it a watch for a fun family-friendly adventure with a multi-layered meaning. eye-opening, and I gained even more appreciation for what the film was doing.

The dreams involve Ghibli-inspired adventures of fantasy mixed with the modern, and are very charming and child-like, much like fairy tales. The waking world is then mundane in comparison, but it uses the tone of the dreams to make a mostly relaxed...atmosphere that is more pensive than action-packed.However, this tone is not consistent throughout the movie. It attempts a more action-packed plot of car chases, miscommunication, and family secrets that does not fit the tone established in the beginning of the film. What you might expect to be a sort of Slice of Life about this Napping Princess exploring her dreams turns into something more ridiculous and unrealistic. And that\'s where the plot falls apart.The fundamental story is not bad, but the weaving together of dream and reality sequences turns it to mush. I do not think an audience will enjoy every aspect of both of them, but they are represented equally. Some people will enjoy the calm dialogue in the reality segments, discussing the girl\'s family history, and life in general. The dream sequences are action-packed and bursting with enemies, guns, mechs, and magic. The ""villain"" is a comically evil, hands-wringing man with a Satan-beard who orders his lackeys to capture an 18-year old girl... in both the dreams and real life. It\'s silly and it should\'ve only been in the dream sequences. Why mix the two, only for that character?The visuals are good, no complaints from me there. The animation is very good and uses its digital medium to make for some very nice motion and angles. The sound design is good but not very noticeable. Voice cast never stands out, but they never bothered me either.Do I recommend Hirune-hime? Not really. If you\'re tired of Ghibli and want something a little more modernized, go for it. It\'s not a waste of time. But if you haven\'t seen all the Ghibli films, or even Summer Wars (which is similar to this movie in many ways), go watch those instead.

I found myself curious to see how things would connect between the two and was searching for these interconnections as the story progressed. Honestly, I was pretty satisfied by the end of everything. The story isn\'t anything fantastic, but it served it\'s purpose.I have two...main complaints for the film. Firstly, and most importantly, I really disliked the main voice actress (and I wasn\'t particularly keen on the main male VA either). It didn\'t grow on me even by the end, which was a shame. I think I would have enjoyed the film more if she didn\'t grate on my nerves whenever speaking. Secondly, there is a point in the film where the two worlds are effectively blending together that left me confused. I could get the gist, but I felt myself so distracted by trying to understand what was happening that I couldn\'t really enjoy the scene. Perhaps a second run-through after seeing the film would rectify this.Overall: it\'s a film I worth seeing once. I\'ll probably go with friends to see it again for the general theater release here in the states, but I doubly I\'ll seek it out again thereafter. main complaints for the film.

This is a positive and negative directing choice. The addition of the dream world gives life to the story, but sometimes it felt like the story was becoming hard to follow due to the switching from reality to dream world.The art is nice. The score is nice.The main character is well developed. The other characters are okay.This is more of a plot driven story. It will feel as if the world created is guiding the protagonists by some unknown force.I found the movie enjoyable....If you are thinking about watching this, I would recommend trying it out.

However, the inclusion of Morio is the biggest failure—he offers nothing to the story that the plot itself couldn’t have covered for. Kokone’s also just a crazy person whose condition worsens through-out until she nearly dies..So, the story begins by establishing a realm of mechanics and magic. But the magic is really just a tablet’s search functions/commands that bring machinery to life. Interesting but not really a good term to use. Nonetheless, the world is a convoluted Capitalistic society with no satisfaction within...even for those at the top. And then, it returns to more-or-less our realm, but based in Japan. These two realms are the setting for the story to come. The magical realm is a more loose style and is the “dream” realm, whereas our realm is a crisp style and is the “awake” realm.Our MC is Kokone, an undiagnosed-with-something 11th grader. She’s always napping away yet can run for miles with a smile on her face, full of lungs to even have passing-by conversations across the street and then some. She has a poor reputation with teachers due to always falling asleep and her classmates think poorly of her father who wears a “strange” leather jacket. There is no depth to her character beyond being an idiot... which is a good excuse given she sleeps so often, there’s nothing really for her to absorb contrary to being 17.The story kicks-in pretty early into the movie rather than offering more background for the cast beyond the two realms, right after a light foreshadowing how her dreams may be a form of memory.Kokone’s father gets arrested by Tokyo police, an old work acquaintance of her parents steals her father’s tablet, she steals it back with Morio’s help, and then the begin the trek to Tokyo. During this time, Morio shares a dream with Kokone and learns it’s a lot deeper than merely her napping all the time, and they both learn that the tablet contains some major tech coding which creates self-operating automobiles such as Kokone’s father’s motorbike they used as travel.In the end, the adventure concludes on a good note of reconciliation with the maternal grandfather she never knew existed. All without addressing how messed-up Kokone’s mental health is wherein there was a long, false ending while she began to plummet to her demise. Fun. even for those at the top.

Fun.', 'This definitely wasn’t a bad movie but it had lots of room for improvement. The quickest way to describe it would be by comparing it to a Ghibli movie with the amount of fabricated fantasy-like elements and overall mystical tone of the movie. While it wasn’t bad, its biggest issue overall was the narrative and the way the plot was told. The main plot line was unique, though nothing unheard of, but had a lot more potential had they executed it better. It got confusing at a lot of points when reality started to merge with the main character’s dreams and you didn’t know if...she was awake or asleep or what was actually happening or not.I think they tried to go for a smooth transition between reality and the dreamland every time to steadily mesh it all together in order to add to the magic atmosphere of the film and blend the two worlds together, but it actually just ended up being really confusing. A few times I would just disregard everything happening as being “fake” (because it was part of the character’s dreams) but it would just carry on into the real world, making me wonder what the heck actually happened. And whatever was happening with the giant robots was extremely confusing to me, I couldn’t figure out what the counterpart of that was in the real world.The movie started out with a pretty straightforward goal, but after halfway through the plot is just all over the place. The main goal of “stopping the bad guy” and “saving the dad” are still in progress, but the narrative becomes slurred;  instead of making her own choices, the main character is just dragged from one mess into another at the end and it becomes unclear what she’s even trying to do anymore.Another issue was that it was difficult to decipher the audience of the movie given that some parts were so childish and cliché yet most of of plot would go over a child’s head. I personally hate when films or series don’t have a clear audience and mix both childish humor and appeal into a more mature plot, which is what felt like what happened here. Granted, there was no mature content or anything inappropriate for a younger audience, and the mystical elements and visuals of the story would certainly appeal to a younger audience, but, as I mentioned earlier, they wouldn’t understand most of the movie or the actual plot line.Visually the movie wasn’t bad at all. I rather liked the art style and the animation was pretty fluid throughout the whole thing. There were a few quick moments of awkward cgi that would’ve been better off having been fluent with the rest of the animation but nothing too bad overall. Some finishing touches on the animation such as shadowing and lighting and such on the characters were absent, leaving a little more room for improvement. However, detail in the film was very well done; there were many shots of the interior of a house or a building, their rooms having an incredible amount of detail and work put into them. The promo art for the movie is gorgeous, though, as I’ve seen many times before, turns out to be more promising than the actual film itself.Characters were written well for the movie and all carried their roles just fine but that’s about it. They don’t have a ton of character development or any lasting impression on the viewer but in part that’s due to only getting a little over an hour of screen time; series always have more potential for their characters to grow due to the amount of time they get to flesh them out compared to movies so it wasn’t unexpected. The main character was pretty simple but fun to follow the story with. Overall none of the characters stand out more than others and you don’t really get to connect with any of them, just kind of watch them do their thing.In conclusion, I’d give the movie a 6/10 due to the list of improvements it could make and elements it was lacking. It started out pretty enjoyable but felt dragged on and got really confusing by the end of it. It was visually appealing throughout its entirety but had no memorable aspects or anything to really impress.

There's even the same stereotypes, much like Sayla Mass in the original Gundam (even though her brother is one of the most powerful Newtypes, she can't even pilot a Gundam), there’s the stereotype that women can't pilot robots because, y'know, they're women. Go Lion is definitely a period piece, if you...want to call it that.• First, the characters are literally just empty stereotypical husks that talk.

It stands to reason that my favorite character is this entire series is Buffalon. The giant buffalo alien, hell yeah!• My love of kaiju aside. The story is forgettable. It's just another tyrannical, alien ruler and his asshole son. You're not going to find a Dessler or Gihran in this series. The story was pretty discombobulated because of the episodic nature, but what was more jarring was that there is little to no continuity, except for multi-parted episodes, and the characters don't grow and aren’t affected by anything at all.• Even though, on some planets, the bargain bin Zendradi are, I don’t know, mass-murdering and enslaving people. But, hey, who gives a fuck about that, this is a kid's show and we have combining robots.• With that description out of the way, this series is more of a Power Rangers thing than shows that actually have heavy political messages like Space Battleship Yamato.

I\'ll keep this spoiler free.Story: The overarching story is okay, but nothing super original or anything to write home about. Pretty much your standard ""heroes need to overthrow a tyrannical, alien ruler"" story. Most of the episodes are formulaic with a few exceptions that hint at the overall plot. But I still wish that there was more continuity in this series and it had a serialized structure like a lot of modern shows.Now is a good of a time as any to bring this up. This series has...some dark elements such as: excessive gore, people drinking the blood of the dead, decapitation, cannibalism, off screen rape, suicide, animal death and things like that. This didn\'t both me as much, since I\'m a fan of a lot of darker animes and tv shows. But if you\'re squeamish, this is something to keep in mind before watching this.Characters: This is pretty scattered across the board.The heroes, outside of a couple exceptions, are pretty meh. They\'re aren\'t hateable. But they\'re rather sterotypical and nothing to write home about.  Amue are my favourites in the cast, being the most fleshed out of the core cast.The villains, for the most part, were completely one dimensional. Outside of doing disturbing actions, they had very little character and lacked any motivation for their actions. They came off like pieces of cardboard for the heroes to fight more so than anything else.The only exception to this was Sincline. While his character concept was rather interesting and he was the most complex out of the main three villains, he\'s nothing to write home about. Parts of his backstory also make no sense when you think about it. (Not gonna get into why, because spoilers)Hys and Raible, who are both more heroic characters, were flat out unlikable. Not in a ""love to hate them sense"" like a villain. But they were such unlikable douchebags that it made me want to launch them into the sun. Hys was very condensing to the main characters and super sexist. And Raible was pretty sexist himself.The side characters were okay, but nothing to write home about either.Art/Sound: Voice acting was decent. Nothing amazing, but nothing super horrible either. I could always make out what the actors were saying and what the sound effects were.Character designs are were decent as well. Although, I question some of the character\'s fashion choices.Same can\'t be said for the art and animation, which shifted back and forth being okay to being pretty bad. Characters like Sincline would often go off model a lot of the time. Even the OP animation wasn\'t the greatest. Some of the backgrounds and shots were good, but those were a rarity in this series.Enjoyment: This a decent anime with a bunch of good, bad and outright terrible aspects. It was interesting to see where elements of the reboot originated. I had fun predicting where the reboot might go by what went down in this series while it was still airing.Over all: If you\'re a fan of any of the Voltron series, including the reboot, you should be able to get this through this fine. For everyone else, however, I recommend giving this series a pass. Because there are far better mecha series that are worth your time over this.Story: 6Art: 3Sound: 4Character: 4Enjoyment: 5Overall: 5 some dark elements such as: excessive gore, people drinking the blood of the dead, decapitation, cannibalism, off screen rape, suicide, animal death and things like that. This didn\'t both me as much, since I\'m a fan of a lot of darker animes and tv shows. But if you\'re squeamish, this is something to keep in mind before watching this.Characters: This is pretty scattered across the board.The heroes, outside of a couple exceptions, are pretty meh. They\'re aren\'t hateable. But they\'re rather sterotypical and nothing to write home about.  Amue are my favourites in the cast, being the most fleshed out of the core cast.The villains, for the most part, were completely one dimensional. Outside of doing disturbing actions, they had very little character and lacked any motivation for their actions. They came off like pieces of cardboard for the heroes to fight more so than anything else.The only exception to this was Sincline.

There's a variety of weapons that evolve with time. The finishing blows are all uniquely animated*Characters: I was surprised by how well certain characters are fleshed out and their dramatic stories. Significant recurring characters, episodic characters, and more. Admittedly, the central male protagonists felt less developed by comparison, but I still found myself getting invested in characters that I wasn't expecting*Mature themes & imagery: You probably know about Voltron,...but these aren't the same. Golion really wasn't suitable for being edited into a kids cartoon. They removed apocalyptic wars, slavery, death, blood, lots of violence, SA, and more.*Plot: it's probably going to feel slow for the first half, but it really picks up towards the end. If I were to rate each quarter, I'd say it's 6,5,6,8. It comes off like an episodic super rorobt anime, and many of its episodes truly are episodic, but there's also characters, technology, history, etc gradually revealed through these episodes, so it kinda snowballs towards the end.*Conclusion: Golion had a really solid final quarter. Conclusive and enjoyable ending I felt somewhat emotionally attached to.CONS:*Characters: Central male protagonists could have been fleshed out more in comparison to the other characters*Opening scene: Each episode starts with an opening scene set in the distant past, I felt this gave me false expectations and felt like the anime was poorly planned. I suggest not putting much stock in it, and just watching the episodes for what they provide.*Plot: First half does feel slow and a little boring at times, but I think it's worth finishing*Action: Although there's a variety of weapons, it seems like the lions were supposed to have specific elements, and they do explain this to some extent, but I felt it was poorly implemented as the water lion would be seen shooting fire out its mouth, the fire lion shooting air attacks, etc. They do some cool elemental combination attacks like fire tornado, but they don't really experiment with the elements as much as i'd like. Most of the weapons are generally rockets, lasers, swords, etc.Overall: I know this is a little barebones, but I have a full video review on my youtube and I'm honestly tired of talking about it by now. I just wanted to leave something positive for Golion since there were 0 recommended reviews at the time of posting. I think it's a good anime that often gets overlooked because of Voltron and its slow start. I was a little bored at first, but I'm glad I stuck with it, and I think It's one of those anime that I'd appreciate more with time, as I venture through 70s and 80s super robot anime.Other recommendations: If you like fun SR, check Daitarn 3 and 1980s Tetsujin 28. If you like the dark/mature elements of this, check Space Runaway Ideon. but these aren't the same. Golion really wasn't suitable for being edited into a kids cartoon.

Ichigo 100% OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/981/Ichigo_100_OVA,"[""Well...the OVA's are suposed to be the continuation where the TV series have left it...I liked the most ep 2 and 3 from the OVA's...they were hell too good...Had lot's of funny moments....Ep 1 was decent...not perfect...but decent...But...the last episode...It fried my brains...I didn't get it was was all that rubish about...some stundes beeing filmed as they were thinking what movie they should do...Just in the end to know that it was all planned...Strawberryes panties alliens....It suck's big...So...my recomandation...Don't watch the last ep...it will fry your brain if you watch it T_T "", 'Story : 9And the story between the girls and Munaka Jumpei continues. The same style of comedy with more ecchi than you could see on the prequel TV series and on the 2 specials. It was pretty good actually (if you forget the fourth episode of this series).In the three episodes you can enjoy the plot seeing very funny situations where you can laugh a lot. Moreover, in the second episode you can see Ichigo 100% in ""his best shape"": for me really was the best of the entire anime.Art: 8Being this anime made at Madhouse studios, you can expect great art with outstanding...animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves. And that is exactly what happens in this serie. You can enjoy the story without seeing huge mistakes in the design of the characters.Music: 8Both the opening and the ending is fine, despite prefering the opening, not only because the music is more stirred, but because of the voice as well. But that is about personal taste and I guess it isn\'t that important. Furthermore on this kind of anime since there aren\'t those actions moments that need a strong music to make some kind of impact on the viewer.Character: 10The characters are really unique, and considering that this series was made in 2005 it\'s obvious that another series was kind of inspired on the spirit of the characters presented in Ichigo 100%.Starting by Munaka Jumpei, he\'s just the normal highschooler that isn\'t popular. However there are some personality traits that make him special to the girls who are with him every day, like his sincerity and humility towards the girls that confess to him, or even before confessing.About Toujo there are some qualities that make her different from the other girls that Munaka know: her shyness and the way she adopt in order to be ""low profile"" combined with her great skills at school and the same interests about moviemaking make her a person who Munaka can talk about his dreams and future.Mishino is a popular girl that every guy would like to date, but her conservative personality causes her to keep firmly to her principles and to her first love whom she dated in the previous serie: Munaka.Yui it\'s like the younger sister that Munaka saw growing up since they are childhood friends, she hasn\'t such a big role on this OVA comparing the importance that was given to her in the TV series.Regarding Satsuki, she is a girl that tells whatever she thinks and that keeps her loyalty towards Munaka, despite being the possessive type, she is kind and pretty, skills that make Munaka completely excited.Enjoyment: 9I had so much fun with this OVA, even in the last episode, that was kind of weird, I had tons of fun. It was worth to see this and I really recommend this anime to everyone, even the ones who think that the episodes is kind of ""always the same"". The situations are so different one to each other that makes even the most serious and angry people laugh a lot!Overall: 9It was a serie that made me be continually hooked for 2 days (refering to the all Ichigo 100% episodes). This 2 days were marked by intense fun and huge laughs and a feeling that I wanted more of this. I really really really recommend everyone to watch this serie because it\'s worth it! animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves.

The manga is the only place where you're going to find an end to Junpei's indecisiveness. The OVAs are, in essence, standalone fan service with innumerable ecchi situations; Junpei finds himself with a single girl alone repeatedly followed by being discovered by everyone else and thereafter being used as a punching bag.Animation:Overall, the quality is similar to the TV series. Detail and clarity could be better but Satsuki and Toujou make up for it somewhat. Again, expect lots of ecchi situations and expect your screen to be covered by panties...quite a bit.Sound:The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better. The BGM is the same and the VAs are the same. The VAs do a great job again so fairly good overall.Story:Each episode is essentially a stand-alone filler episode, each one featuring Junpei and one of the girls in a precarious position... To be exact- Satsuki x 1, Toujou x 2, Nishino x 1. Sadly, these are truly filler episodes which just displays Junpei's inability to choose. In all, expect a minimal story and no conclusion to the series whatsoever.Character:No new developments on any of the characters take place here. Just finding our protagonist on top of different girls in different episode. It really gets annoying when he decides whichever girl he is on top of at the moment is the one he likes best, then at the beginning of the next episode he decides on another girl and repeat x 3.Overall, the girls are fine but this just reinforces how horrid of a lead we have.Value:If you're all for ecchi situations, this is your watch. If you're looking for closure to the series, stay away unless you just want more of the characters in general. Quite a few close scenes between Junpei and the girls but I went into it looking for him to make a choice and he just utterly disappointed. Onward to the manga... quite a bit.Sound:The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better.
