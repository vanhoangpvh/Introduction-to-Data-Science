Goal FH: Field Hunter,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5217/Goal_FH__Field_Hunter,"[""Esta review también está en español.Football Chronicles, Chapter 1: Goal Field HunterYear: 1994. The World Cup was being held in USA... and again, Japan couldn’t make it to the biggest event. But, the interest in soccer couldn't be bigger: just two years before, the j-league was created (replacing the little amateur league), and with that, things could finally be serious (and it actually happened: from 98, Japan got to every world cup, and is getting better and better every time). And in this big furor was created Goal Field Hunter. And to make things clear, this one is a few months older than Captain Tsubasa...J, so this isn't a cheap rip off like a lot of people say. No, GFH has its own style...Story: Hikaru Tatsumura is a japanese teen living in Brazil, and has great talent in football (but a big way to go). Hikaru's a pretty nice guy in general, but he's also a proponent and selfish player, and in the end he's kicked out of his team. And not only that: his ex- club president told the other presidents (and managers, and coaches) to not let him play in other teams, for his discipline problems. Very annoyed for this situation, Hikaru did the opposite way of the legendary Tsubasa: with the (involuntary) advice of his friend Takuya, he decided to go and play in the reserves of the Shimizu S-Pulse. There, he will meet with lot of teammates and other people, but everyone think in the same things: first, win the reserve tournament. Second, play in the first team. And, of course, the final objective: join the Japan national team, and classify to the France World Cup.Animation: Good for its time. It look a bit old now, but the animation is fluid and the characters are well done, and they're different from each other (unlike Captain Tsubasa, which has a maximum of 15 faces in the whole manga xD).Don't expect super special effects, fire shoots, broken nets or impossible physics: here everything happens like in the real world. That's probably the biggest appeal, or at least, the thing that make it different to many other shonen sports. This means, a lot of shoots go outside, the players get tired, no six kilometers courts, etc.).Sound: Sorry folks, I have no idea how this sound in japanese. I watched the Latin-American version (which was pretty good, by the way. Bob Sponge was Hikaru's voice actor xD).Verdict: GFH is an interesting series. Back in the old days, the sports animes weren't too close with the reality (things like Captain Tsubasa were the norm, or at least, those were the series that make it here), and a thing like this one was almost necessary. Yes, there's less spectacular stuff, but more realism: it's impossible to make a shoot (area to area) that destroy the net, shoots can be inefficient, even for the most skilled players, and there's no replete stadium for a reserve match. Yes, there's less emotivity, but there are rules: here, if you hit a rival with a flying kick (a reference from CT's Makoto Soda, and others players too), its foul, and probably red card. To give you an idea, this series is closer to Hungry Heart (this one has a few flashy stuff, but nothing big) and Giant Killing than to Captain Tsubasa or Inazuma Eleven (this one is a utterly ridiculous, the characters only need ki to become Dragon Ball material).The bad thing (in this is similar to Captain Tsubasa J...) is that it has an inconclusive ending... Yet, this is a very recommendable anime for any football fan out there, and also to a sports fan who doesn't like the flashy stuff.--------Crónicas Futbolísticas, Capitulo 1: Goal Field HunterEl año es 1994. Se disputaba la copa del mundo de Estados Unidos, y nuevamente, Japón no podía clasificar. Pero el interés en el futbol no podía ser mayor: solo dos años antes, se inauguraba la J-league, la primera división de futbol japonesa (reemplazando a la liga amateur), y ahora las cosas si podrían hacerse en serio (y así fue: del 98 en adelante, Japón se clasifico siempre a la copa mundial, y su rol va haciéndose cada vez más respetable). Y es en este gran furor futbolístico que se estreno Goal Field Hunter o Goleadores, como la conocimos en Latinoamérica (en España no, la serie que ellos conocieron con ese nombre es Moero! Top Striker). Y para aclarar las cosas, este anime salió antes que Captain Tsubasa J (solo un par de meses), por lo que no es un plagio barato como muchos dicen. No, Goleadores tiene lo suyo...Historia: Icaro (Hikaru Tatsumura), es un joven japonés que vive en Brasil, y que juega al futbol con gran habilidad, aunque le falta mucho camino por recorrer. A pesar de ser un buen tipo en general, Icaro es un bocón agrandado, prepotente y egoísta a la hora de jugar, por lo que termina siendo expulsado de su equipo por el dueño del club. Y no solo eso: este individuo le informa al resto de los presidentes de que no lo acepten en sus equipos. Muy enojado con esta situación, Icaro decide hacer la inversa de Tsubasa: por el consejo (inconsciente) de su amigo Rei (Takuya Miyamoto), termina yendo a Japón a jugar a las reservas del Shimizu S-Pulse. Ahí conocerá a diversos personajes, pero todos piensan en lo mismo: primero, ganar la liga satélite (así le dicen a la reserva). Después, subir a primera. Y obviamente, el objetivo final: jugar para el seleccionado japonés, y clasificarse al mundial de Francia.Animación: Buena para la época, y aunque hoy parezca una serie vieja, la animación es fluida y los personajes están bien hechos, y son unos bien diferentes de otros (a diferencia de CT, donde hay un máximo de 15 caras en todo el manga xD).Acá no esperen súper efectos especiales, tiros de fuego, redes rotas o física imposible: acá todo pasa como en el mundo real. Tal vez ese sea su mayor atractivo, o al menos, lo que la hace diferente de la mayoría de los shonens de deportes: es realista (o sea, muchísimos tiros se van afuera, tiros leves que se desvían en alguien entran, los jugadores se cansan, las canchas no miden seis kilómetros, etc).Sonido: Las voces latinas son  más que correctas, con una buena entonación y todo eso. Tal vez reconozcan a Luis Carreño, el seiyu que le dio su vos a Icaro, es también el mismísimo Bob Esponja (la segunda vos). Ni idea de las voces de España. La música no está mal, el opening es pegadizo y no perdona a las excusas ;), y cada vez que Icaro agarra la pelota escuchamos zamba. El punto negro es el audio: hay veces en la que se escucha muy bajo.Veredicto: Goleadores es una serie interesante. Por esos días, los animes deportivos no estaban muy apegados a la realidad (siendo el máximo exponente Oliver y su grupo), y una serie así era casi necesaria. Cierto, acá no hay espectacularidad (que sí, es una palabra), pero hay realismo: es imposible hacer un tiro de área a área que destruya la red, si agarras la pelota de abajo va a salir para arriba y se va a ir muy, muy afuera, y si están jugando dos equipos cualquiera, las tribunas no están repletas como si fuera Real Madrid vs Barcelona. Tal vez allá un poco menos de emotividad, pero hay reglas: acá si le metes una patada voladora a alguien (lo digo por el señor Makoto Soda, de CT, entre muchos otros) es foul, y probablemente roja. Para que se hagan una idea, esta serie es más cercana a Hungry Heart (que tenía sus cosas, pero dentro de todo creíble) y Giant Killing que a Captain Tsubasa o Inazuma Eleven (en esta última se va todo al diablo, los personajes prácticamente tienen ki!). El punto malo (y acá si se parece a Captain Tsubasa J) es que la serie termina prácticamente en la nada... Así y todo, es una serie muy recomendable para los fans del futbol en general, y también para las personas que les gusta el anime deportivo sin mucha parafernalia.

Cardfight!! Vanguard Movie: Neon Messiah,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23991/Cardfight_Vanguard_Movie__Neon_Messiah,"['tl;dr: If you liked the four seasons of cardfight vanguard and liked it, it\'s very likely you will dislike this movie. + oversaturated confusing camera shots and tricksSo, after four seasons of a great anime about a card game called Cardfight Vanguard, comes this movie. After watching all 4 seasons of CFV, I watched this movie and honestly, this was one of the biggest let-downs I had with any series so far.But, let\'s start with the good stuff:1. Characters - Most of the characters from this movie were taken directly from the series and have complex designs and unique personalities. While very little of...it can be fleshed out with a time restriction like in this case, the characters are represented well. There is ofcourse a new character, Ibuki Kouji. His character is well designed (not so much his cards), his backstory well explained and he, as a villain, represents a real threat, which makes him relevant.2. The ending - If any of the CFV season had at least one thing in common, that would be a satisfying ending. This movie is no exception. While I won\'t spoil it for now, I\'d say that it does redeem the movie a bit.3. Voice acting - While this is hadrly its own topic since it mostly belongs under characters it might be worth noting that it is on point and well acted.And that\'s pretty much all I can come up with for the good stuff. Next comes the stuff that makes me feel that 3 is a very generous score for this movie.1. The cardfights - Oh wait,... this is wrong,... there are no cardfights! Oh, yeah, that\'s what I actually meant. ""The lack of cardfights"" would be more appropriate. This is why people who liked the series might not like the movie. And one of the main reasons I didn\'t like it. So, what basically happens, CARDFIGHTS GET REPLACED by weak Half-CGI BATTLES, that will make your head spin an make you wonder wtf just happened. Also lots of gore-like stuff, ripping through people\'s stomacks with one\'s hand etc. (tons of unneccessary violence, in my oppinion)So, no points of power, no trigger checks, no clever skills, basically nothing that make vanguard special as a card game. Instead, we get our character\'s avatars flying around cray clashing weapons and smashing into their enviroment at nausiating speeds with weird camera angles, even weirder camera angle transition and just in general cluster**** action. If you like that kind of stuff, then great, but in my oppinion, slapping the name ""Vanguard"" on it is an insult to the original. Especially since the villain is apparently so overpowered that noone can defeat him without an actual miracle (minor spoiler), yet there is no explanation how he does it or what makes his cards so strong. Sure, the word ""delete"" gets thrown around, but unless you\'ll go read the game rulebook it won\'t help you at all.2. General cinematography - It seems to me that the director of this movie just went a bit crazy and tried to squeeze every camera and perspective tric he could possibly imagine. Some of them look really cool, but when the cool shot lasts for two seconds only to immediatly and awkwardly transition into a new camera gimmick, the good shot loses most of its appeal. Most certainly not one of Shin Itagi\'s finest works.Personally, this ruined my viewing experience the most if I ignore the lack of cardfights. Lots of potential wasted.3. Nagisa - That annoying little girl that won\'t stop obsessing over Kamui. Well, at least they can\'t make it worse, right? Wrong. Now she also showers the screen with imaginary hearts everytime she appears.I\'m gonna stop here. I could go on, but I\'m too lazy and many things might not apply to everyone watching this. And in the end, it\'s just my oppinion. I hope you don\'t waste time on this bad excuse for a vanguard show, but if you do, I hope you\'ll at least enjoy some of it. it can be fleshed out with a time restriction like in this case, the characters are represented well. There is ofcourse a new character, Ibuki Kouji. His character is well designed (not so much his cards), his backstory well explained and he, as a villain, represents a real threat, which makes him relevant.2.

I hate it. the reason is well to tell the truth, Cardfight!! Vanguard is a card game anime, Not Dragon Ball Z. but this is wrong. There AREN'T Any Card fighting in here in this movies at all. I should call this Dragon Ball Z Vanguard.A little talk like telling your unit skill and flip the card over for attacking would be more appropriate. but here, you are transform into...unit itself, and I saw Aichi Sendou and Kai dodge the attack and counter the attack. not even mention about there are a few tons of unneccessary violence like GORE in the movie.in cardfight rules, for each attack from your vanguard attack. you'll be able to pull card(s) for triggers. in this movie, I witness no trigger checks, no skills reveal to activate it. basically this movie is not a vanguard card game. I heard that Ibui use Deletor deck which allow him to delete opponent vanguard. which is flip vandguard face down and its text and power are lost. I didn't see it in the movie. Daunting Deletor, Oksizz I love this card so watch. I was hoping to see how the card works by counter blast 3 and put card in RG into soul and delete opponent vanguard and unit get +10000. um.. I didn't see that stuff mention in here.Overall: 4/10 to be honest. I can't enjoy this movie. the way our character flying around and slashing and dodging is not really a cardfight. if this movie call Dragon Vanguard Z Movie Neon Messiah then I have no problem rating 10/10 lol unit itself, and I saw Aichi Sendou and Kai dodge the attack and counter the attack. not even mention about there are a few tons of unneccessary violence like GORE in the movie.in cardfight rules, for each attack from your vanguard attack. you'll be able to pull card(s) for triggers. in this movie, I witness no trigger checks, no skills reveal to activate it. basically this movie is not a vanguard card game.

But because of quarantine, I just recently got back to casually watching Cardfight!And oh boy. I have a lot to say after finally watching the movie for the first time.Many characters from the original show appeared in the movie: Ren, Leon, the OG Q4 members, the three idols, Emi, Nagisa, Morikawa, and many others. I thought it was sort of cool to see all of them. Sadly, many of them held very little role in this movie. I do think it’s...kind of understandable though, since a movie (compared to a show) doesn’t have as much time to flesh out characters. However, in my opinion, it would have been better to show only the characters that have slightly-significant to significant roles in the movie to leave more room for strong characterization.This leads me to wondering about the target audience. I’m pretty sure someone who hasn’t watched the show at all would probably have a difficult time enjoying Neon Messiah because of having little background knowledge on all those characters as well as the game itself.So, of course, we would assume that the target audience is people who are fans of Cardfight! Vanguard’s animated show or manga.Assuming that a fan was watching the movie, we would expect that the fan watches not only for the characters themselves, but for the great cardfights between the characters. Of course, that’s where a huge chunk of the action lies in the many seasons of Vanguard. Not only who the winner is, but also the process of how the winner wins the cardfight. The show holds an advantage in a way; in a story form that is long-running, it’s not always easy to guess who would win a cardfight and how the person would win.However.When there are multiple gameplays in a single movie, it’s expected that the characters will not be able to defeat the antagonist until the end of the movie (if there is a happy ending). It’s very hard to shock a watcher by only showing who wins and loses since it’s easy to predict.So, to tackle this, one would assume that the storytellers would show the crazy process to how one player will win.I think this would be the place in the movie that needs the most improvement.I noticed that in the movie, there was a lack of talk about critical triggers, strategy and specific moves, number of points to a card, abilities of the cards, etc. Basically, there was a lack of the stuff you would normally expect to see when watching a cardfight, especially when seeing the new cards the antagonist has and the card that made its way to the name of this movie.Neon Messiah.It was like watching a game that you know how to play, yet not understanding exactly what’s going on on the game board. All you know is that there are two people going against each other and who wins in the end. Why this person won, you don’t know.The actual cardfights were replaced by well-animated scenes of the cards and the players taking the form of their cards, physically fighting each other and flying around and stuff. As much as I appreciated how badass the cards and characters looked in those scenes, I wish there was more talk about the actual gameplay and process to victory to give the battles the protagonists face more substance and meaning.There were also a few other things I felt could have been expanded on, since for me, it’s easy to miss out on small details and bits of important info that’s only briefly mentioned.I would have liked to know more about where the antagonist acquired the power to wreak havoc and just more about that power in general.What exactly happened to Leon, Misaki, and Ibuki in the rain when they could have ran indoors?Why did only certain people get “the dreams”?Why was getting knocked out a side effect to losing?Why didn’t the antagonist strike earlier instead of only just now?What sort of powers and secrets does the prized grade 4 card hold?But because this is a movie with limited time compared to a show, it’s understandable how the makers of the movie couldn’t cover everything, including the cardfights. However, I think it would have been nice to see at least one cardfight where the players actually demonstrated strategy.~~~I talked a little earlier about the animation. I actually think the animation is one of the strongest points of the movie.From what I saw, the lines were very clean, and the color palette was very vibrant. This really made the characters and backgrounds pop. The characters’ faces and bodies had good proportions and remained consistent throughout the movie. The animators also added some, I don’t know what to call it, light spots and shadows to each panel which made the characters appear more 3D-ish (I don’t mean CGI. I know that “3D-ish” is probably not the best word, but basically they didn’t appear “flat”) compared to the original show. I think it’s easier to simply see it by comparing a shot from the film to a shot from the original show from 2011.In terms of animation alone, one of my favorite scenes would have to be the little snippet of the battle between Ren and Ibuki, where Ren is falling and destroying buildings. And after the cardfight, I thought the animators did a great job with animating Ren’s reaction and facial expression. This scene gave off some sort of mature vibe that wasn’t in the original show.There is one other scene in the movie I really liked.As the audience, we see this scene through a young kid’s eyes rather than in third person.The kid is on the floor with cards scattered all over the floor while above him there are other boys frowning at him, saying mean things, and walking off. We see the slow movement from the kid’s hands as he’s crawling on the floor begging for the other kids to not leave.This scene really stood out to me from this movie. I’m not entirely sure why, but I think seeing through the slightly blurred eyes of the victim increased my empathy for the character. I thought it was a very tasteful choice the animators made.Other things I liked about the movie were all the flashback scenes. This really gave some more interesting background to the characters, especially Kai.It was also fun to see Aichi and Kai interact in the first half of the movie. But speaking of interactions, it would have been nice to see Kai interact more with Ibuki than he did in the movie.Storywise, there were many things I feel could have been worked on before the movie’s release, mainly the cardfights. However, I personally didn’t hate the movie. I think lots of stuff from the movie would make good GIFs! kind of understandable though, since a movie (compared to a show) doesn’t have as much time to flesh out characters.

Why this person won, you don’t know.The actual cardfights were replaced by well-animated scenes of the cards and the players taking the form of their cards, physically fighting each other and flying around and stuff. As much as I appreciated how badass the cards and characters looked in those scenes, I wish there was more talk about the actual gameplay and process to victory to give the battles the protagonists face more substance and meaning.There were also a few other things I felt could have been expanded on, since for me, it’s easy to miss out on small details and bits of important info that’s only briefly mentioned.I would have liked to know more about where the antagonist acquired the power to wreak havoc and just more about that power in general.What exactly happened to Leon, Misaki, and Ibuki in the rain when they could have ran indoors?Why did only certain people get “the dreams”?Why was getting knocked out a side effect to losing?Why didn’t the antagonist strike earlier instead of only just now?What sort of powers and secrets does the prized grade 4 card hold?But because this is a movie with limited time compared to a show, it’s understandable how the makers of the movie couldn’t cover everything, including the cardfights. However, I think it would have been nice to see at least one cardfight where the players actually demonstrated strategy.~~~I talked a little earlier about the animation. I actually think the animation is one of the strongest points of the movie.From what I saw, the lines were very clean, and the color palette was very vibrant. This really made the characters and backgrounds pop. The characters’ faces and bodies had good proportions and remained consistent throughout the movie. The animators also added some, I don’t know what to call it, light spots and shadows to each panel which made the characters appear more 3D-ish (I don’t mean CGI. I know that “3D-ish” is probably not the best word, but basically they didn’t appear “flat”) compared to the original show. I think it’s easier to simply see it by comparing a shot from the film to a shot from the original show from 2011.In terms of animation alone, one of my favorite scenes would have to be the little snippet of the battle between Ren and Ibuki, where Ren is falling and destroying buildings. And after the cardfight, I thought the animators did a great job with animating Ren’s reaction and facial expression. This scene gave off some sort of mature vibe that wasn’t in the original show.There is one other scene in the movie I really liked.As the audience, we see this scene through a young kid’s eyes rather than in third person.The kid is on the floor with cards scattered all over the floor while above him there are other boys frowning at him, saying mean things, and walking off. We see the slow movement from the kid’s hands as he’s crawling on the floor begging for the other kids to not leave.This scene really stood out to me from this movie. I’m not entirely sure why, but I think seeing through the slightly blurred eyes of the victim increased my empathy for the character. I thought it was a very tasteful choice the animators made.Other things I liked about the movie were all the flashback scenes. This really gave some more interesting background to the characters, especially Kai.It was also fun to see Aichi and Kai interact in the first half of the movie. But speaking of interactions, it would have been nice to see Kai interact more with Ibuki than he did in the movie.Storywise, there were many things I feel could have been worked on before the movie’s release, mainly the cardfights. However, I personally didn’t hate the movie. I think lots of stuff from the movie would make good GIFs!']"
Bakuten Shoot Beyblade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/288/Bakuten_Shoot_Beyblade,"[""STORY: 7/10Though it begins as a team of boys merely wanting to be the champions of the Beyblading world, the story of Bakuten Shoot Beyblade soon branches out into various &quot;arcs&quot; that give you insight into a particular character, and through each of their individual ordeals the group as a whole become closer to one another. While there's also the somewhat cliche issue of global takeover to deal with, it seems primarily to be a tale of friendship and, discreetly, cultural diversity. Though the main protagonists all band together to represent Japan, each comes from a different corner of the globe, and the friends they...make during their travels also originate from various countries and socioeconomic backgrounds. So if nothing else, the themes certainly make this a good anime to watch. There's also a little bit of supernatural awesomeness in the form of &quot;bit beasts,&quot; for those who love their fantasy and enjoy a hats-off to mythology.ART: 6/10I'm not much of an art or animation guru within the anime industry, but I thought the animation was decent enough. The style made for some cute and funny expressions on occasion, and it was somewhat amusing for me to watch the cat-like eyes of the entire White Tigers team adjust in moments of anger or annoyance.SOUND: 2/10I sincerely wish I could get my hands on a Japanese sub, so I could really judge the music of the original untouched anime for what it is. But as I'm stuck with the dub, I'll say this: the music is nothing interesting. In fact, it can be irritating on occasion, as the same songs are constantly on repeat through different battles. The score is also severely underdeveloped, and barely even noticeable. Doesn't do much for the show at all.CHARACTER: 8/10For a &quot;sport&quot; anime directed toward a younger audience, the characters have an unexpected level of depth and story. None of them are as one-sided as they seem to be at first glance, and the majority have to cope with issues that are by no means light; divorce and betrayal being just a few. Most of the characters go through some form of change, becoming either more mature or more accepting of the differences between themselves and other people. While I think that the central character Tyson and his friend Kenny should have been expanded on a little more like their teammates, it seems that their primary development was saved for a later instalment, so I supposed I can't be too dissatisfied.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 8/10While it may not be some grandose tale of hardship or an action-packed epic like most other anime (but then, &quot;most other&quot; anime usually means viewing for mature watchers), Beyblade is good for what it is: a fun comedy with the occasional 'touch of darkness.' I'd definitely recommend it to your kid sister or brother. make during their travels also originate from various countries and socioeconomic backgrounds.

And I love how they made it into an extreme professional sport. If you were to explain the story to someone who has never seen the anime, it would come off as silly to them.Art:The art style is pretty unique.

And for once English dubbers picked the right voice actors.Characters:The BladeBreakers are pretty much the most memorable characters I've noticed in anime.

I did enjoy it, but even 12-14 years old kid can see why is something happening (for the coolness and for money) and major...failures.Story:Take Yu-gi-oh, make the deck with one card, that is getting stronger (Pokemon?) and make a basic toy. Add something techy and here you go - you have a Beyblade! No, the story isn\'t that bad, but that is just because it is MADE for being bad. Who cares actually? The bad are bad, the good are good, one good guy is...becoming bad (Sasukeeeeee!) and then good again. Friendship, love and peace always prevail.Art:Since it is MADE to be like an average Yu-gi-oh+Pokemon shonen it has to have something to catch the eye. The battles have effects, the Beyblades have very good animations, the creatures are very good too. So far 9. But the overall animation is not that good, static backgrounds are common issue and are very different from the battles. If you have watched Code Geass you know that the animation can be much better in that direction. But are there 12-14 years old kids have seen it?Sound:The fact that I can\'t remember anything bad about the sound (except ""Let it rip"" or common curses and screams) is the reason for the 6. I remember the good voice acting, good sounds when they have ""Let it rip"" and the screams of the monsters.Characters:Very shonen, very immature and pretty well developed. Another strong point.

They pretty much behave like humans and not like the average shonen idiots (Goku, Lufy, Naruto, etc.).Enjoyment:You know when a thing is something more than the sum of it\'s parts. Well, here it is less. I liked it, but I didn\'t really enjoy it nearly as much as other shonen titles.

But it is not. And even a 12-14 years old kid understood that.Overall:The overall score is a little higher, because it is unfair such a good, pure shonen anime to be hated that much. It is unreal, but who cares?! Hellsing: The ultimate isn\'t. Berserk isn\'t. But they are good, aren\'t they? So if you like animes for kids - go ahead. I like a little more realistic and mature titles.With a friend we made an army to take over the world - Pokemon hooligans, Bayblade Pedobears and cards-cerebral-destroyers.

What did you expect? It\'s obvious that it\'s a show designed to give the audience some mindless entertainment and nothing else. Do I think that Beyblade is a fantastic Anime? NO!! Did I enjoy watching Beylade? YES! At least, parts of it. You see, sometimes the point of watching cartoons is to just kick back, relax and have...some ""mindless"" fun. In my opinion, Beyblade succeeds in providing us with such an experience. It is not, by any means, the sort of Anime that you will take seriously but if you watch it for the right reasons, you might be surprised at how fun it can be.Sure, the concept of kids taking ""spinning tops"" seriously is ludicrous at the very least. But since when is it any less ludicrous for Yagami Light to have the ability to kill people with a notebook, or for Lelouch to have the ability to control peoples actions with his eyes, or for Naruto to act like a Neanderthal whilst managing to beat opponents with twice the brute strength and a hundred times the intelligence as his? Lets face it!! It\'s all UNREALISTIC and SILLY, but that\'s not the point is it? Sometimes its fun to just watch something that doesn\'t require a great deal of thinking, and Beyblade is a good match for that.So stop whining about how bad this Anime is. When you are having one of those days when you just want to unwind after a busy day of studying or working, just take off your smelly socks and give Beyblade a go. In other words, LET IT RIP!!!! some ""mindless"" fun. In my opinion, Beyblade succeeds in providing us with such an experience.

In other words, LET IT RIP!!!!', 'Where to start?! Beyblade was a huuuuuugeeee obsession of mine when I was younger, and I still hold a soft spot in my heart for it. I remember watching the very first episode when it aired, and them announcing the show as ""BEYBLADE"" with no images of the show yet. I was intrigued, since I\'d never heard of the title before, thinking it would be some lame American tv show...but from the first episode, I was hooked.Yes, the whole concept seems moronic....Who would have thought that you could stretch a storyline about spinning tops to three 51-episode long seasons and a spin off sequel? But...it worked (at least for the first three seasons, MFB\'s a totally different story)!Story:It might not be the most creative storyline out there, but I must give them kudos for making a story about spinning tops somewhat interesting. I did watch the English dub, so I can\'t say for sure what I may have missed out on due to editing, but for the most part the storyline was enjoyable, albeit mostly predictable. Kind of like Pokemon, but with spinning tops.Art:The art in this season isn\'t a style from anime that I typically like; the characters, especially Tyson, can sometimes look kind of grotesque and just strange...In fact when I started seeing the artwork of the second and third seasons unveiled, I thought that the first season was a version specifically created by a western company, because it was so different from most other animes in terms of colouring and design. But, in the end, when compared to the other two seasons, I do like this one the best, and I am upset that they decided to change the art each season. I like the characters\' designs the best in this first season. And yes, like many other fangirls of the franchise, I did fall in love with Kai and Tala, whose designs this season were the most appealing to me out of the three.Sound:I watched the English dub for all three seasons. I heard the Bladebreakers\' voices once in Japanese and refused to EVER watch it in Japanese. I really liked the way they sounded more mature in the English dub, and their voices suited them well. Yes, I also enjoyed the music...the English sk8tr boi music...some of it is pretty decent.Character:The characters MADE this series. If they had chosen a less bishounen group (case in point--METAL FIGHT BEYBLADE) this wouldn\'t have been so successful in the fan community. It\'s the characters that made me want to keep watching the series to find out what happened to them, how things turned out for them and so on. I found that even characters I wouldn\'t typically like I ended up loving--there was no one in the series I can genuinely say that I hated. Plus, I would be remiss if I didn\'t give this category a 10 for Kai alone....Enjoyment:The fact that this was such a huge part of my life means of course I enjoyed it! But obviously I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to just anyone. It\'s kind of difficult to enjoy unless you had some connection to it while you were younger. For example, if you\'re 25 and began to watch Pokemon for the first time in your life ever, you would be pretty weirded out to say in the least.Overall, I really did enjoy this anime, and yes this season holds a soft spot like no other season of Beyblade (especially Metal Fight *shudder*).

Some of the character concepts are pretty good, but they arent the most 'original' of characters. Theirs the usual types of this kind of anime but then there ARE some pretty unique characters.Ok, so far i have really enjoyed watching this, i just hope it doesnt slope down hill from here, i will report back after watching all episodes, although i have gotten bored on occasional episodes, i think its safe to say overall this anime is worth watching if you like this type of anime.

Everything had the potential (even though top toys are not the toy of choice of influential children), but nobody bothered to spend some resources to make it."", 'Ok Imma start out by saying im not much of a writer so I may say something that sounds confusing or etc etc. I guess.....live with it?Anyway the point of my reviews are to give people a clear understanding on whether or not to watch a series or not. If i can achieve this then i think my review done its job. I try not to give any details to the story itself (That is in theory what a summery is for) I just try to state Pro\'s and Con\'s.First I think anybody who is planning on watching this or that is about to watch...this use to watch Beyblade back when it was out in America (or wherever you live) I like to assume for this series not many people just randomly wanna ""pick it up"", moving on Beyblade is a pretty good show it has its moments and it\'s pretty enjoyable overall to old viewers.Story: The story is pretty Mediocre *cough* Like seriously it turns from the ""We are Beyblading for fun YAY!!!!!"" to ""WE HAVE TO BLADE TO SAVE THE WORLD!!!!"" It\'s is another Yu-Gi-Oh scenario where the world in Theory is relying on kids for probably the most kiddish thing. This wasn\'t a real bump for me when watching but I know many of people who would have complained and bitched about this..... If you are one of these people I guess stay away? Also worth stating this series is pretty fast the average match takes about 15 minutes and although there is alot of talk it honestly never feel ""Overwhelming"" (Ok, Ok u got me......maybe ONCE or TWICE but that is it)Art: I personally enjoyed the art style and the Animation is pretty fluid imo. Compared to this series sequels i can honestly say i enjoyed this series art style the most. I think it is a pretty average art style that many can like without being annoyed. As stated the art style as stated is pretty fluid and pretty stable there wasn\'t a moment/ Episode where the animation seemed really cheap or even really expensive just to go back down to average.Sound: I personally enjoyed the sound this series OST was pretty good (Dub (im not sure if the Japanese Version has different Sounds)) it had its own music and also it would que at the right times (Sad Music in emotional times, Power Music when things where starting to speed up again etc etc).Characters: The characters in this show is what would most likely make this show shine, most most defiantly the best part in this series. This is one of those series where the main character grows on you and just watching them Beyblade SOMETIMES feel rewarding since they usually always pull through in the end.Overall: Hmm. Watching this series from episode 1 to the end is pretty enjoyable. You  may run into series with deeper stories and better characters and etc etc. However if you are looking for a simple series to watch that isnt to complex then Beyblade is a pretty good series.... I can honestly say it wont be the most rememberable series you watch but you wont regret watching it. this use to watch Beyblade back when it was out in America (or wherever you live) I like to assume for this series not many people just randomly wanna ""pick it up"", moving on Beyblade is a pretty good show it has its moments and it\'s pretty enjoyable overall to old viewers.Story: The story is pretty Mediocre *cough* Like seriously it turns from the ""We are Beyblading for fun YAY!!!!!"" to ""WE HAVE TO BLADE TO SAVE THE WORLD!!!!""

Many cliché elements happened to be enjoyable as well and every region gave us pleasantly cringy enemies who are participating in each region of championship to be the greatest Beyblade champ. Even if these characters are in a team and intended to win together they mostly want the victory to themselves. The competionists and ability measurement is present also in a time when the teams are...in the middle of a leasure business like reach a hotel, traveling, talk to new friends or enemies who introduce each other, the characters happens to reach our hearts in a unique way. So sad that the artstyle is wastly different after the 1st season which killed the passion inside me to continue the series despite it has a really healthy length for a series. I recommend Beyblade to everyone, who wish to see a unique artstyle and a passionate anime, where the characters develop in personality pretty well. in the middle of a leasure business like reach a hotel, traveling, talk to new friends or enemies who introduce each other, the characters happens to reach our hearts in a unique way.

Adults have kids. Kids like toys. Kids watch cartoons. We can make toys. We can make a TV show. We can make a TV show about the toys.Kids. What do kids watch? What do kids like? Kids like friends. Kids like competition. Kids like superpowers. Kids like heroes. Most importantly, kids like toys. So the show can be about this sport where these kids compete with their toys which have superpowers and eventually, they save the world from evil and preach about friendship every single episode.And then it worked. Those poor little rascals never saw it...coming. They definitely bought the toys. And I am one of them too.Looking back at Beyblade it is fairly obvious that this form of binary logic was used. I remember how much I liked the show and how interesting I found the toys. I definitely did not understand why. I was young, naive and impressionable, and Beyblade was an experience I have never had before. And even now, even if after rewatching it I see it as something that was built with the purpose of selling toys, I still remember it fondly and can still enjoy it for what it is. There\'s two things that I enjoy about it as it is now. How these attempts at being ""cool"" fail miserably, how the english dub can get quite silly at certain points and seeing how much of the show was built around selling Beyblades to kids.How much of the show is dedicated to selling the toy? Well, pretty much the entire thing. And the binary logic I used extends further to it but I won\'t have you suffer through it again. First of all, to ensure that Beyblades will be considered cool by kids, in the show they will be associated with other things they find cool. In most cases, it will be animals, as every Beyblade has a bitbeast, which is this thing that gives them superpowers which is essentially a spirit. The main characters bitbeasts\' are designed after the Four Saint Beasts from chinese mythology, with each representing an element. in the mind of me as a child they were essentially: A dragon, a tiger, a phoenix and a turtle. Turtles were cool at the time because ninja turtles were popular. They also get to live 100 years and have solid shells, so shut up. But the beyblades were not only associated with animals, but with other things kids found cool. Like for instance, there are beyblades themed after sports, after historical warriors, and so on. There was even a beyblade that was drawing its power from rap. Yeah, I told you, the show can get quite lame at times and it really just tried to associate things with things kids might find cool and that appeal to them.Afterwards it tried to overexagerate characteristics associated with these things, like making the beyblades able to use those four elements or giving the beyblades unrealistic abilities or features. Like having beyblades wrapped in wool cloth because they have a sheep bitbeast.Aside from associating beyblades with ""cool"" shit to give them more appeal to kids, the series also tries to make beybladed feel like they have a lot more value, by having the characters learn valuable life lessons mostly concerning friendship. They are also added the weight of good vs evil, where the main characters have to defeat the ominous evil. It isn\'t something with much depth, just the generic importance of friendship plotline.Another element that beyblade likes to present a lot is the fact that beyblades as toys are customizable, through the guise of needing a strategy to win. So essentially this means that every time you have to optimize your beyblade based on your opponent so that it will perform optimally against them. This in truth is supposed to have the effect of: Having every character change their beyblade from time to time, this creating even more toys to sell in various different other variations and not keeping the kids bored once they have bought it, since if their beyblade doesn\'t do well or is not that impressive, buying another and combining its parts might fix that.In truth, Beyblade is an experience you can only enjoy as a child or someone that has watched it when they were a child. Because that is who it is marketed towards. Having these same tactics applied on an adult, would fail miserably because they would not fail to see it through. Its story is nothing you haven\'t seen before, it\'s kids playing with their toys to defeat evil and become better at the game they play as well as better friends. The world of beyblade is exaggerated and focuses as beyblade as an international sport and a historical grand reaching activity that has been practiced since ancient times. Every episode the characters learn a lesson about friendship or being sportsmanlike. It is enjoyable to see how it has not aged well since as I have said, it has a lot of lame into it. It is filled with corny lines and things an adult thought might sound cool to a kid at the time s well as a lot of Sum 41 knock off songs that are replayed in almost every battle. It\'s the ""swag yolo"" attitude of the 90\'s that carried in the early 2000\'s.I recommend watching Beyblade to people that have watched it as children, since as I have said, that experience was made for you when you were a kid. It is a show of its time, and you might be surprised at how much lamer it was compared to how you might remember it. Don\'t get me wrong, I am still fond of the series, I still found it entertaining because it is one of the first shows of its type that I have ever watched to completion. And even if I find it lame now, it\'s entertaining to see what was thought ot be cool at the ime and aimed to get me to be like ""WHOA THAT IS AWESOME DAD BUY ME ONE!"" In any other context, this is just a lame show about the power of friendship and defeating evil that tries to sell a product to kids.

Absolute genius marketing. However, a fair amount of effort seems to be put into this. While the overarching plot is about as generic as you can get from a sports anime with supernatural powers in the mix, what makes the story shine is the interactions and development that the 4 main characters of Tyson, Kai, Ray and Max have on each other.The sport of Beyblading isn\'t exaggerated, and is portrayed similar to sports in the real world. There are regional and international tournaments where...the athletes (beybladers) compete for trophies. Some of these bladers have mystical beasts inside their spinning tops that help them in battle.The story follows the previously named main characters, all of which I imagine to be 12-14 years old, on their quest to win trophies. Along their way, they deal with many very realistic themes which make you more emotionally invested in these characters and thus makes you care about this show about spinning tops. There\'s an arc where Max has to deal with the divorce of his parents and earning the respect of his mother; Ray has an arc where he has to deal with his old friends thinking that he betrayed them, and Kai has to deal with some very traumatic events regarding his upbringing which leads him to some very conflicting decisions.Art 4/10The artwork is not great, and average at best. Comparing it to other anime at the time (2000), such as Pokemon, it does not stack up well. While the bitbeasts have great designs, they are held back by their extremely clunky animation - if you can even call it that. The human characters look fine - nothing particularly great and as if you\'d find them from a ""how to draw manga"" book. The beyblades themselves look like coloured anime triangles.Sound 7/10I only watched the English version, so I can only give an opinion for that, but the soundtrack was great. Soundtracks covering battles had lyrics and a pop punk sound that sounded as if Sum 41 made them. This certainly hit the mark of its time, and fills the viewer with nostalgia of the 90s and early 2000s when the songs start. They also work very well to give the show a flavour of attitude.The non-vocal soundtrack seems pretty generic and average when compared to other anime, but it does its job decently nonetheless by painting the mood well for the scenes that they play in.The voice acting can be off at times, especially near the beginning of the series, but there are some funny lines which can make you feel like a kid again. While clunky at first, the voice actors consistently do a good job of portraying the characters how they should be.Characters 8/10As said before, the show derives most of its value from how likeable the characters are thanks to their realistic personalities, ordeals and interactions with one another. At surface value, they seem like cliche shounen anime archetypes: Tyson is supposed to be the generic protagonist; Max is the super friendly weaker minded one; Kai is the archetypal rival to Tyson, and Ray is the cool, strong and silent type.However, it gets a lot deeper than that. Ray has a facade of confidence which he uses as a coping mechanism formed by coming from a purely meritocratic society. He initially equates his self-worth with his skills and has a strict moral code. Kai is a dick for most of the series, but his personality is explained by his upbringing. He hides his emotions and finds it difficult to trust people and form bonds. He is also the most knowledgable and reliable in terms of skill and offers harsh realism. Max brings a well needed carefree friendly attitude which contrasts Kai. He has to deal with his parents\' divorce during one arc, and through this gains his much needed confidence boost. Tyson somewhat is your typical shounen protagonist, and his development comes in later seasons. However, he does seem far more believable and realistic than many others of his archetype from the way he speaks to his interactions with his friends. He cares a lot for his friends and helps them get over their internal struggles.Overall, the characters are fun to watch grow and help each other become more well-rounded human beings. It\'s more about this than the actual sport of Beyblading.Enjoyment 9/10I watched this as a kid, and then again as a teenager and enjoyed it even more the second time round. Full of nostalgia, a fun soundtrack and very relatable and likeable characters. It is a fun watch that can get you surprisingly emotionally invested.Overall 7/10 the athletes (beybladers) compete for trophies.

However being this far in I do still think I can make a fair judgement. I will update this if I feel any major changes happen in these last 6 episodes that change my opinionBeyblade is just one of those franchises I love. The toys are great and the franchise is still ongoing with new content today with the Burst series and the Beyblade Rising manga. I got into this franchise in the days of Metal Fight watching everything up to Zero G. However as a kid I had no...access to the original series as it was never rerun on Cartoon Network circa 2010 so I didn’t even know it existed until my mother got me this pack of cards based on Beyblade V-Force which got me interested in the original generation. Now as an adult after getting back into the toy line, after finding an official release of the first 2 seasons on YouTube with G-Rev currently in the process of being uploaded I decided to give this original generation a try.Story 7/10Beyblade Season 1’s storyline is rather simple with Tyson, Kai, Ray, Max and Kenny traveling around the world to compete in Beyblade tournaments to get better at the game and reach the top. It’s a rather simple storyline but it’s really effective. This anime unlike Yu-Gi-Oh was made after the toy line came out in Japan with the release of Ultimate Dragon and Ultimate Frostic Dranzer and the Beyblade Game Boy Color game being released in 1999 and the anime being released in 2001. Even though this is a promotional anime it doesn’t affect the story too much. Characters upgrading their Beyblades to the newer models is done naturally in the story and even though yes this is a cheap marketing tactic, it’s really cool to see how these changes affect how the characters play the game and how it enhances the power of the bit beasts that represent the fighting spirit of the Blader. It’s a very generic storyline I’ll give you that but it’s still a damn good one especially if you are a fan of the toys and love the cast of characters.Art 7/10Animated by MADHouse the art is at a consistently good quality and the animation on the Beyblades themselves is done in the same style as the characters. In later series the Beyblades are CGI so it was rather refreshing to see the Beyblades drawn in the style of everything else in the show. Outside of the Beyblades themselves the characters are drawn in a smooth and rounded style. Very few characters have super sharp edges outside of the eyes and hair on certain characters. Characters have rather large irises in their eyes with defined pupils and highlights. There are lots of very thin line details as well, however on the official streams being in 480p some of these line details can be crushed and or become very pixelated. Overall the art is pretty good but due to the resolution of the official stream, I feel that the artwork itself suffers as it isn’t as well defined as it’s supposed to be on the line edges. Besides how generic the story is there is one other problem with the show that pops up in the writing. In the English dub besides some out of date lingo being used to be cool with kids in 2001, the dub also decided to change a lot of character names while keeping the original nationality so you end up with Chinese characters who were isolated from the rest of society being named such western names as Gary and Mariah. Also the dub decided to replace Kenny checking on his computer and relaying information to the Bladebreakers with a bit beast named Dizzi stuck in his computer which does everything for him probably to replace the text on the computer. That was dumbSound 4/10This is a bit of an awkward one. There is no legal way to watch this show in Japanese so I ended up watching the show in English. The dub has to be one of the worst dubs I’ve heard from a native English speaking region of the world. Nelvana made some really bad decisions with the casting and directing. While most anime and cartoons will use adult female actors or men with higher pitched voices to play child characters, Nelvana made the decision to cast all the characters with age appropriate actors. However this led to some problems. The character voices around very still especially for these younger characters and when your main characters are 5 11 year old boys it becomes extremely noticable when they can’t hit emotional moments and screams very well. Some of the adult voices also sound rather stiff but it is much worse with the kids. I looked at the Japanese cast a little bit and it seems much better but I cannot judge as I am unable to view this version. One of the biggest strengths of the dub though is the music. The opening theme song “Lets Beyblade” is an absolute banger with those sick guitar riffs and those cheesy lyrics. The battle music is also really intense for the generic themes, but when the dub hits an insert song it also has that same cheese as the intro that is just amazing to jam out to. I’d reccomend looking for the Let it Rip CD if you like these songs as it has some of the songs from all the seasons as well as some extra songs from popular American bands from around the time the show came out. However the dub quality itself being so bad outweighs the great music leading to this poor score.Characters 7/10The characters in Beyblade is one of the strongest parts of the show. Tyson is really excitable and aggressive in his battling which can be to his detriment at times but his spirit shows through in how much he is willing to do for his friends. Kenny is the smart one who analyzes all of the opponents of the BladeBreakers and is the brains of the team. He doesn’t play very much but he is always willing to help the team from the sidelines by analyzing opponents and upgrading everyone’s beyblades with new parts. Max is a half Japanese-half American Beyblader who is always enthusiastic and optimistic and plays with a defensive approach. Ray is a calm and levelheaded member of the team but can get really fierce in battle. He’s probably the most mature out of the team. Kai is a bit of a jerk. He’s arrogant and self centered and doesn’t really care about his team. This leads to tension throughout the show as he especially doesn’t get along with Tyson. Later episodes will test the strength of the bond of the team as you see the team grow closer together as they take on challenges big and small and in the Russian Championship arc you will get to see the main characters have something thrown in their dynamic that messes things up for a few episodes. Throughout the show the Bladebreakers will meet all sorts of opponents from all over the world with all sorts of crazy bit beats and a few of the teams have direct links to the Bladebreakers and their members that shed light on their pasts. Even if these characters aren’t the most fleshed out they are fun characters that are lovable for their simple traits and their unique play styles. Ray and Kai ended up being my favorite characters for their personalities but I’m also slightly biased and Dranzer is my favorite Gen 1 Beyblade Evolution line and Kai is just a badass with how rarely he plays but how devastating a punch he deals with Dranzer.Overall I honestly really enjoyed Beyblade Season 1. I had a lot of fun watching it even through all the issues it had especially in the dub I watched. If I were to rate my enjoyment in a scale of 10 I would give it a solid 8. My critical score for the show is a 7 as it is a very very flawed show and those dub related issues really hold the series back, but I feel it isn’t as bad as the score on the site would make the average MAL user think. You gotta keep in mind this anime is a promotional anime made to sell toys first and foremost and is aimed at kids around ages 7-11 so it isn’t like the deepest anime. I generally feel it is necessary to give a little leeway for kids shows regarding this as first and foremost these anime are meant to be fun and enjoyable for audiences of all ages. Definitely give Beyblade season 1 a watch if you love the toys, you just might want to search out some Japanese subs as those will probably be the better product overall. I’m not sure about the Español Latino and the Brazilian Portuguese Dubs and their quality but they are based on the Nelvana English dub so I would expect a few of these same issues to carry over but don’t let that hold you back from enjoying the show. Enjoy it in whatever form you see best just maybe prioritize the original language track access to the original series as it was never rerun on Cartoon Network circa 2010 so I didn’t even know it existed until my mother got me this pack of cards based on Beyblade V-Force which got me interested in the original generation. Now as an adult after getting back into the toy line, after finding an official release of the first 2 seasons on YouTube with G-Rev currently in the process of being uploaded I decided to give this original generation a try.Story 7/10Beyblade Season 1’s storyline is rather simple with Tyson, Kai, Ray, Max and Kenny traveling around the world to compete in Beyblade tournaments to get better at the game and reach the top. It’s a rather simple storyline but it’s really effective. This anime unlike Yu-Gi-Oh was made after the toy line came out in Japan with the release of Ultimate Dragon and Ultimate Frostic Dranzer and the Beyblade Game Boy Color game being released in 1999 and the anime being released in 2001. Even though this is a promotional anime it doesn’t affect the story too much. Characters upgrading their Beyblades to the newer models is done naturally in the story and even though yes this is a cheap marketing tactic, it’s really cool to see how these changes affect how the characters play the game and how it enhances the power of the bit beasts that represent the fighting spirit of the Blader. It’s a very generic storyline I’ll give you that but it’s still a damn good one especially if you are a fan of the toys and love the cast of characters.Art 7/10Animated by MADHouse the art is at a consistently good quality and the animation on the Beyblades themselves is done in the same style as the characters. In later series the Beyblades are CGI so it was rather refreshing to see the Beyblades drawn in the style of everything else in the show. Outside of the Beyblades themselves the characters are drawn in a smooth and rounded style. Very few characters have super sharp edges outside of the eyes and hair on certain characters. Characters have rather large irises in their eyes with defined pupils and highlights. There are lots of very thin line details as well, however on the official streams being in 480p some of these line details can be crushed and or become very pixelated. Overall the art is pretty good but due to the resolution of the official stream, I feel that the artwork itself suffers as it isn’t as well defined as it’s supposed to be on the line edges. Besides how generic the story is there is one other problem with the show that pops up in the writing. In the English dub besides some out of date lingo being used to be cool with kids in 2001, the dub also decided to change a lot of character names while keeping the original nationality so you end up with Chinese characters who were isolated from the rest of society being named such western names as Gary and Mariah. Also the dub decided to replace Kenny checking on his computer and relaying information to the Bladebreakers with a bit beast named Dizzi stuck in his computer which does everything for him probably to replace the text on the computer. That was dumbSound 4/10This is a bit of an awkward one. There is no legal way to watch this show in Japanese so I ended up watching the show in English. The dub has to be one of the worst dubs I’ve heard from a native English speaking region of the world. Nelvana made some really bad decisions with the casting and directing. While most anime and cartoons will use adult female actors or men with higher pitched voices to play child characters, Nelvana made the decision to cast all the characters with age appropriate actors. However this led to some problems. The character voices around very still especially for these younger characters and when your main characters are 5 11 year old boys it becomes extremely noticable when they can’t hit emotional moments and screams very well. Some of the adult voices also sound rather stiff but it is much worse with the kids. I looked at the Japanese cast a little bit and it seems much better but I cannot judge as I am unable to view this version. One of the biggest strengths of the dub though is the music. The opening theme song “Lets Beyblade” is an absolute banger with those sick guitar riffs and those cheesy lyrics. The battle music is also really intense for the generic themes, but when the dub hits an insert song it also has that same cheese as the intro that is just amazing to jam out to. I’d reccomend looking for the Let it Rip CD if you like these songs as it has some of the songs from all the seasons as well as some extra songs from popular American bands from around the time the show came out. However the dub quality itself being so bad outweighs the great music leading to this poor score.Characters 7/10The characters in Beyblade is one of the strongest parts of the show. Tyson is really excitable and aggressive in his battling which can be to his detriment at times but his spirit shows through in how much he is willing to do for his friends. Kenny is the smart one who analyzes all of the opponents of the BladeBreakers and is the brains of the team. He doesn’t play very much but he is always willing to help the team from the sidelines by analyzing opponents and upgrading everyone’s beyblades with new parts. Max is a half Japanese-half American Beyblader who is always enthusiastic and optimistic and plays with a defensive approach. Ray is a calm and levelheaded member of the team but can get really fierce in battle. He’s probably the most mature out of the team. Kai is a bit of a jerk. He’s arrogant and self centered and doesn’t really care about his team. This leads to tension throughout the show as he especially doesn’t get along with Tyson. Later episodes will test the strength of the bond of the team as you see the team grow closer together as they take on challenges big and small and in the Russian Championship arc you will get to see the main characters have something thrown in their dynamic that messes things up for a few episodes. Throughout the show the Bladebreakers will meet all sorts of opponents from all over the world with all sorts of crazy bit beats and a few of the teams have direct links to the Bladebreakers and their members that shed light on their pasts. Even if these characters aren’t the most fleshed out they are fun characters that are lovable for their simple traits and their unique play styles. Ray and Kai ended up being my favorite characters for their personalities but I’m also slightly biased and Dranzer is my favorite Gen 1 Beyblade Evolution line and Kai is just a badass with how rarely he plays but how devastating a punch he deals with Dranzer.Overall I honestly really enjoyed Beyblade Season 1. I had a lot of fun watching it even through all the issues it had especially in the dub I watched. If I were to rate my enjoyment in a scale of 10 I would give it a solid 8. My critical score for the show is a 7 as it is a very very flawed show and those dub related issues really hold the series back, but I feel it isn’t as bad as the score on the site would make the average MAL user think. You gotta keep in mind this anime is a promotional anime made to sell toys first and foremost and is aimed at kids around ages 7-11 so it isn’t like the deepest anime. I generally feel it is necessary to give a little leeway for kids shows regarding this as first and foremost these anime are meant to be fun and enjoyable for audiences of all ages. Definitely give Beyblade season 1 a watch if you love the toys, you just might want to search out some Japanese subs as those will probably be the better product overall. I’m not sure about the Español Latino and the Brazilian Portuguese Dubs and their quality but they are based on the Nelvana English dub so I would expect a few of these same issues to carry over but don’t let that hold you back from enjoying the show. Enjoy it in whatever form you see best just maybe prioritize the original language track']"
Bakuretsu Tenshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/109/Bakuretsu_Tenshi,"[""Burst Angel is another clear example of a good anime being ruined by wanton fanservice and by being too long for its own good.The story could have been summed up in 13 episodes, but it dragged on with so many pointless side stories and filler episodes that it took away drastically from its momentum.The story is kinda weak, but interesting. They definitely took time out to create this intriguing future Japan. The art was great, but there was too much fanservice, but not as much as compared to other anime. Could you believe it when I say it was actually 'tasteful'? Like, sure, their...boobs were huge and stuck out and they were half-naked all the time. But I didn't feel icky and disgusted by it.The characters were good, Jo and Meg have an interesting relationship. The misfortune of Burst Angel is that they concentrated more on the &quot;damsel in distress, use mecha to save her, shoot-'em-up&quot; aspects that the characters couldn't have been as fleshed out as they should have been.I liked the first eight episodes of this a lot. Then it got all unfabulous right after. Is it worth your time? Well, I watched it, and my time is fabulous. boobs were huge and stuck out and they were half-naked all the time.

It had a lot of high points, but there were also a lot of low points. Glad to say that there were more highs than lows.Here's an example of the roller coaster I'm talking about. Every 2-3 episodes, there's a different storyline. Some were good, like the one when Meg and Jo went to this all girls school. Some I couldn't understand, like that time warp episode. In fact, most of the time I couldn't understand because of the many independent storylines.I like most of the characters - Jo was cool. She was tough and...kinda cold, but she is likeable. I liked the way she holds the guns (although her voice is a bit too deep). Amy was really adorable, and I like the idea of a kid whose really a well known cyber genius. Sei has a really great background, and she also has a cool personality. The only one I didn't like was Meg, who apparently is only there to serve as hostage/bait. She is completely useless and very irritating. I also don't like her clothes. I never liked clothes with a western feel to it, which is exactly what Meg is wearing. Everyone else had pretty nice clothes that are well designed.At first I thought Kyohei was the main character, which would have made the anime a harem anime, but turns out he was only a supporting character who totally disappeared in the last episode. He too was a bit irritating, because he was a coward and all, but his cooking ability is a plus (damn, a man who can cook).Usually, I am not a fan of mecha. I don't like heavy fight scenes concerning chunks of steel, and those kinds of scenes are a chance for me to grab snacks but I thought Jango was cool. He didn't look unique or anything, but for some reason, I think I like Jango.It was a pretty well drawn anime. Like I said the clothes were well designed, the same goes for the mech, the environment - everything. I didn't like the fact that the characters had no genitals, and it's not because I'm a perv or something like that, but if they're not going to put in dirty stuff like that then don't show naked bodies at all. I thought the excessive skin was useless anyway. I also find that Sei and Meg's bodies were too exaggerated. I also noticed that their bodies tend to morph, especially the chest area. In fact, I think Jo had the most proportionate body, even though she was a bit muscular.Is it just me or is this anime similar to Elfen Lied? The diclonius are kind of like Jo's race. It was also a bit violent (although not as violent as Elfen Lied) and it had naked scenes and exaggerated body types as well. One thing's for sure - I liked Elfen Lied better.The music was great. I liked the high energy opening and the toned down ending themes. The background music was great too, there were even western themed ones that even I can stomach. There was this one that they played in that episode with the crow cybot/cyberoid. Speaking of cybots and cyberoids, what's with those terms? I thought they were just too dorky.Bottom line is it wasn't so bad. I don't think I wasted my time, and for most of the series, it wasn't so bad.

It had artistic merit (meaning caught a warm blooded post American males attention), technology and some violence to boot. ‘What could go wrong’ I thought to myself as I was scrounging about the HMV’s in the midst of its close out sale. Oh how wrong I was.Synopsis: A bunch of teenage female bounty hunters and their one male cook live in a world where everyone is allowed to own a gun. As such there is a huge spike in crime. There are a group of robots...called cybots which are just robots with human brains and the all-female bounty hunters fight them too. At the centre of this group is Jo, a cold hearted and emotionless super-solder/gun wielder. She is to an extent romantically involved with a ditzy redhead named Meg. The genres (according to Wikipedia) are cyperpunk, mecha and yuri. Although considering Wikipedia never lies, I will not dispute the cyberpunk attribute.1: Let’s just check all the boxes for this one shall we?Plugging the DVD into my gaming desktop, I started my binge. Right from the start, I noticed that the box cover did not lie about its promises. It had giant robots, a large group of female characters, and lots and lots of guns of all varieties. There were a few males protagonists but they were just there to show that it was not entirely one sided. In my mind I could see the creators, dressed in business suits trying to create a masterpiece:Business man 1: “We need to make a classic that will appeal to the teenage male demographic! What have you!?Business man 2: Younger males tend to like scantily clad women and lots of violence, mostly women though. Giant mecha seem to be highly praised as well.Business man 1: GREAT! Make a list and send them to our artist at once!Business man 3: Don’t we need a story to put them in…?Business man 1: Please, the teenage demographic are hardly people, they wouldn’t be able to tell a story if a pan pan girl sat on their face and read it to them.Business man 2: Check list is done.Business man 1: GREAT! Ship it to our artist slaves and let’s go do some blow.This unfortunately, kept repeating in my mind throughout the anime. The story was weak and the characters were just there. Normally when I watch an anime like this, I try and find an alternative viewpoint to fixate on, normally the artistic style. Which was unfortunate because…2: The art was akin to watching a high school art student learn anatomy.The art was sup par. The human body was poorly represented in this anime which is quite sad because this anime came out right around the time of some decent classics. However, this one was not one of them. Not only were the characters poorly drawn but at times the animations were clunky and even out of time and place. This actually became more apparent near the end. Not only was the art poor but it was not constant. Characters hair colour changed from one episode to another. The first time I noticed this was a filler episode (FILLER!) where it showed some of the back story between the budding relationship between two of the female protagonists the ditzy redhead had silver hair. When it went to the next episode, she was back to red hair. But then the next episode her hair goes blue for no reason. However, art takes many forms and this is where the good promising bits of my review come in because…3: The nothing was absolute in this anime.I am a candid person by nature, and, one of the things that makes me want to duct tape story writers mouths to tail pipes more than anything else is when a ending occurs when it is not warranted. A cliché example is all the 1980’s films where everything is going against the protagonist luck and somehow, he survives AND defeats the enemy. The world does not function on Disney logic and neither should stories (in my candid opinion).

Now I know that the characters would not die in this battle (or so I thought considering number 3 caught me off guard). Unfortunately, this was not a constant. Some of the battles were cliché (good robot blows up bad robot and looks at the screen during explosion) but some of them were very fluid and quite fun to watch. The saddest bit however is the fact that….5: They left out the 4th check box, story.This anime meanders. I mean, it really meanders. At times, it tries to be a comedy but the jokes are so bad that you wonder if it was just an attempt to add character depth. Then at times the characters will be all serious which actually suits this anime better. But then some episodes will be fan service which kills it because the animations were so poorly drawn a man would be better at sitting a Barbie doll on a table and just staring at it (would be less creepy as well because one of the female characters has the body of a 10 year old boy which made me sick to watch her, and she is the main character). The worst bit is that half of the anime, there actually is no defined goal. The viewer watches a bunch of skimpily clad bounty hunters killing their targets. It’s not till the end that they package some of the marks as plot devices in such as a way that showed some planning. Unfortunately, it’s so played down even in the end that it makes little difference to the whole anime.Overall: It’s a yuri, story took a back seat to making sure there were plenty of women to kiss and make out. Unfortunately, there was a lot more they could get of done to make this a decent anime. Skip the humour, stay gritty, and keep the plot going so it would be important. Now, this review sounds harsh but over all, it was watchable. And since the ending was actually unexpected, I give it 4 out of 10 with 1 being akin to Devil lady and 10 being Akira esque.

The opening and ending themes are great, and the concept is pretty cool (though a bit unoriginal).  Even the concept art and cover art for this series is fantastic.  However, the series itself is somewhat deceiving of its shiny outer shell.Bakuretsu Tenshi starts out well, introducing (who we think is) the main character, Kyohei, a culinary student hired to cook for a team of mercenaries, including Joe and Meg (the real main characters of our story).  We think that\'s going to go somewhere but it doesn\'t.  Neither does the pretty...animation and artwork that we get in the first few episodes.  Around episode 3 things start to decline rapidly in the quality of the show.The anime is full of inconsistencies- not only in the animation and artwork, but in the story and the characters as well (I\'d say the plot is inconsistent, but there is no real overarching plot to begin with, so we\'ll just leave that matter out of it).  At some points the characters\' hair changes color, or their clothing randomly alters to provide for unnecessarily sexy bondage scenes (mostly involving Meg).  By the end of the series you\'re only left with a handful of useful episodes that connect well to each other, and you wish you hadn\'t watched all the others in between.  It took every fiber of my being to just keep going with the series.For the most part, however, I\'ll admit it isn\'t absolutely horrible.  The fight scenes are pretty decent, though short-lived in some areas.  Most of the episodes consist of about 20 minutes of running around (or just walking) and heavy dialogue, leading up to a one-minute fight sequence.The characters are, for the most part, bland, with no depth to them, and you often wonder what their motivations are (you never really get a straight answer to that question).  Joe, the ""main"" main character, is intriguing at first.  You want to love her for her sheer awesome conceptual design, but after a while you just end up wanting to punch her in the face.Each episode\'s story (most of the episodes are self-contained) can be confusing and jumpy, but sometimes they\'ll hit on a good one.  And don\'t even get me started on the cinematography.  They break the 180 Rule (if you don\'t know what this means, just look it up) so many times it made my head reel.  Often they focus on a character or an object that you think will have meaning later on, but never comes back into the mix, and you\'re left wondering what the heck happened to that one guy.Another bad point is that they introduce a somewhat major character about halfway through the series, whom we are led to believe we don\'t have to care about, but she shows up in several of the other episodes after that.  We still don\'t care about her, though, and she leaves quickly.I will say this, though: the character designs, costume designs, and vehicle designs make up for the horrible and often cheesy writing, and the fight scenes, as I mentioned before, sometimes are good enough to make you want to watch the whole episode.The series seems to want to be hentai, but just stops short enough to be rated PG-13 (it is definitely ecchi, however).  There are moments of cheesy gore, though, but they are few and far between.  There is also an unnecessary amount of flashbacks and recaps, and even a few episodes could be cut down to a 5-minute short.  As a result, many episodes are tiring and forgettable.  In the same way, some episodes drag on with too much information, while at other times you wonder if you missed something.As with any anime, there\'s a lot of yelling and warped anatomy, and gravity-defying instances, but this isn\'t that much of a problem.  For now, we\'ll just throw all physical laws are out the window (however, suspension of belief only goes so far for some people).The whole series tries to build up to a \'big bang\' ending, but fails on a few levels.  It was a bit satisfying, though it did leave a few loose ends.  By the end of the series, the main character switches over to Meg (this makes three main character switches now), whose new look and attitude makes you question why they didn\'t just cut the series in half and have a second season starting from the end of the first.  I would much rather see an anime based on the new Meg than go through all that again.All I can say is, if you\'re going to watch this, don\'t expect much out of it or try looking for a plot, meaning, or analysis, otherwise you won\'t enjoy it at all.  If you have an education in art, animation, or any sort of entertainment, don\'t watch this series, because it will just disappoint you.  If you do like watching ridiculously proportioned girls skipping around in precarious situations, then go right ahead, but again, don\'t look for it to make any sense whatsoever.Oh, and one more thing.  I simply can\'t take any series seriously when all the guns \'squeak\' when you hold them. animation and artwork that we get in the first few episodes.  Around episode 3 things start to decline rapidly in the quality of the show.The anime is full of inconsistencies- not only in the animation and artwork, but in the story and the characters as well (I\'d say the plot is inconsistent, but there is no real overarching plot to begin with, so we\'ll just leave that matter out of it).  At some points the characters\' hair changes color, or their clothing randomly alters to provide for unnecessarily sexy bondage scenes (mostly involving Meg).  By the end of the series you\'re only left with a handful of useful episodes that connect well to each other, and you wish you hadn\'t watched all the others in between.  It took every fiber of my being to just keep going with the series.For the most part, however, I\'ll admit it isn\'t absolutely horrible.  The fight scenes are pretty decent, though short-lived in some areas.

Unfortunately Burst Angel turned out to be another one of those animes that took me several months to finally find the interest to finish.One good thing about this was that the mecha battles were kinda cool, and i dont usually like mecha at all. The story, however, was a snoozefest. And I mean I actually fell asleep several times through this series, and didnt even bother rewatching the episodes I missed.This starts off by focusing on a young man who is hired as a cook for...a group of girls. It seems as if this boy is the main character but he kinda just fades out and plays no part in the story. Burst Angel is mostly just a series of fillers, there is a very thin story line lightly painted in the background. Green glowing brains are placed into mechs and some 'organization' is taking over the city. But ever episode is the same. Meg is in trouble, Jo has to save her.The character designs actually look pretty good. Their costumes, though unpractical, are very flashy. But on the bad side, there is very weak character development. The voices in the english dub, are terrible. Its total script reading with no effort whatsoever and the music is repetitive. And one japanese city has all its citizens speaking with an american country accent.If someone gives this too you, then its pretty enough to watch an episode or two, but no way would I recommend spending money on purchasing this or time on renting it. a group of girls.

But afterall it was a bad choice...The story goes well - every episode has his own plotline, but the major plot is hard to define. That\\'s a point down... Once in a while the mini-plotlines where good enough, but overall they were decent.The Art is almost great - the 3d mechas are well designed and its enjoyable to watch them next to the \\'anime\\'.

Well that was easy.The end...In all seriousness, it is a good anime but it has some problems. The fan service level is insanely high. I\'ve already talked about why that\'s a pet peeve of mine so it seems silly to go into it again, but I\'m going to anyway. The problem with it isn\'t so much that it happens, it\'s that it happens all the time and there\'s almost never a good story or character reason for it. Seriously, why do women fighters tend to wear skimpy impractical outfits in media while men generally wear things that make sense?The...only other major problem with this anime is the pacing. The plot moves along very slowly until the last four episodes. Up until that point most of the episodes contain little pieces of plot but are mostly stand alone episodes that serve mainly to develop the characters. As a result the main story comes at you very slowly and then very quickly and before you can really get a handle on it, it\'s over.Those of you who know me are probably thinking, ""but you consider the story the most important part of everything except comedies, why do you consider this good if it has a bad story?"" In answer to that, I didn\'t say that the story was bad. It\'s poorly paced to be sure, but it\'s actually a very good and intriguing story. It\'s just not a traditional story. It\'s more character driven than plot driven. And the characters are very well done and interesting. Even though they\'re designed so that it looks like they arbitrarily cut large pieces of fabric from their outfits. Even the plot, horrible pacing aside, is very nicely put together. It isn\'t original, but it\'s told in an original way.The visuals are simply excellent, if you can excuse the fan service factor. They really establish the setting perfectly. The action scenes are stellar and they have some nice variety. Some of them involve mecha, others are hand to hand, and others are gun fights. And every single one is unique. Overall, I was very impressed with the series.Now on to the all important yuri factor. I\'m going to give it an 8/10. It\'s obvious that Jo an Meg are a couple and they get some really adorable scenes. Jo even says at one point that Meg is the reason that she\'s able to fight. Where it loses points is that there really aren\'t that many episodes where they actually get to share cute moments. They happen in maybe 1/4 of the episodes. While it is nice to see a canonical yuri couple, I really wish that they had done more with it.My final rating for Bakuretsu Tenshi is 8/10. It\'s a great anime.

Despite not doing anything that\'s obviously wrong, in the end ""Bakuretsu Tenshi"" couldn\'t even get as far as a 7/10 in my book.From the offset, I thought this was going to be a harem anime. The tellings signs are all there: we have a classic harem hero: a nice guy who\'s a total loser (any guy coming from the ""Love and Happy Cook School"" surely deserves to be labelled an Uber Loser), and it looked like he was gonna end up living in a big house (or in this case, a big... uh... armoured truck) full of girls. But, for some...reason, I was slightly intrigued. Maybe it was the lush, colourful animation and the kick ass action sequences that really wowed me. Maybe it was because I found the character designs to be appealing. Or maybe it was the lack of slapstick comedy that are normally omnipresent in harems giving me hope that this might offer something different.But, having caught my attention, episode after episode of unspectacular short stories (that were only loosely connected at best) ensued, and totally wore down my initial interest in the show. It\'s not that the short stories were particularly bad, but there just wasn\'t anything GREAT about them. Nothing to tempt me to watch the next episode with great urgency.Not only are the episodes quite independent of one another in terms of plot, but there isn\'t much continuous character development either. It turns out I was very wrong about this anime being harem - turns out the total-loser-but-nice guy wasn\'t even the main character, and only appears in the occasional episode. He plays such a minor role I don\'t know why they bothered devoting the opening episode to his introduction in the first place. The relationships between the characters were mostly static throughout in a really uninteresting fashion, to the extent that I almost wished this anime is a harem... at least there\'ll be SOME non-static interaction between characters then. As it stands, the characters really lack any kind of spark to them beyond their initial appeal.Perhaps ""Bakuretsu Tenshi"" is trying to find middle ground between having a consistent underlying plot like in most other series and just having mini adventures like in Cowboy Bebop, but failed to impress in its attempt to do either. ""Cowboy Bebop"" had mini adventures that were a lot more enjoyable, and had far more diversity than ""Bakuretsu Tenshi""; it also had genuinely interesting characters that made the show more addictive to watch. ""Bakuretsu Tenshi""\'s attempt at having an underlying plot is even worse. It has what I now see as Gonzo\'s trade mark flaw, where they present to you an anime that\'s like a puzzle with half the pieces missing. This anime has a futuristic setting that\'s so different from what we know, that it really isn\'t the kind of stuff you can just pick up as you go along. The strange social structure; the weird cyber technology; the relationships between all these companies and mafias etc are just so confusing, and the anime doesn\'t really explain any of it. I watched through the entire series without gaining much of an understanding of it. There are a heck of a lot of ideas, a lot of them interesting ones... but that\'s all they are - just ideas. Their under development is probably the thing that hurt this anime more than anything else.""Bakuretsu Tenshi"" is a textbook example of all style and no substance. Looking at it episode by episode, I can\'t really say it\'s boring, but overall I found it took me quite a lot of effort to watch. The outstanding animation is what carries this anime along... perhaps it\'s worth watching a couple of episodes just for that.

In the end Burst Angel turned out to be a totally different show then I had first though it would be, yet in quite a good way…The series is normally split in to story arcs made of two or more episodes (There is the odd one of episode) and they normally have a common theme or item that connects the story in the final few episodes. The main story itself and the arcs are...fun and interesting enough, they range impressible from blood hungry monster plots to the quite bizarre samurai and cyberspace roaming that you would not expect to find in this type of anime and while it normally works well the plot sometimes try’s to be a bit deeper and darker then it can actually manage (And the main idea of a Tokyo with guns gives it the right to at least try) In the end it works much better as a fun, over the top series.Burst Angel is mostly a Sci-fi/Action series and as you would expect each story includes some fun mech or gunslinger battles which while mostly impressive, sometimes do end up feeling a little bit tedious after a while (Must point out however that this is the first mech series I have really watched all the way through)The characters are a big highlight of the series and while they may be a little stereotyped in there ways (Loud kid, well endowed leader, quite gunslinger, the one who always gets kidnapped) but each are given there own quirks that help define them more as the series goes on and end up giving the story a good dose of needed emotion as the series concludesThe most fascinating character was Jo, whose striking crimson appearance just screams how cool she is. She’s a bit of a typical ‘gunslinger with a mysterious past’ at first, and it takes a bit of time for her to develop, but when we do learn more of her past and her relationship with Meg it’s worth the wait.Meg is basically there to get caught or kidnapped in each episode, which at first gives her character a light weight, stereotypical feel. But as the series develops we get to see more of her relationship with Jo and find that there is a little more to her character then you at first think.Kyohei is one of the few male characters and when he appeared in the first episode, I started fearing that this anime would become a typical Harem, yet by the end of the series I was surprised at how underused he actually was! In the end his job is to basically introduce us the viewers to the plot and characters of the show and do little else. After the first few stories his appearances become more and more sparse and by the time we know the main characters and there back stories he is more or less ignored at the end.The supporting cast is great too, though I think Sei had more potential then she was given and the addition of Leo felt a bit too random, he adds little in the end other then being another guy.Watching this in Sub I found the cast to be great if nothing to special and the music really matches the energetic and fun feel of the show. I have yet to hear the Dub but the cast sounds good enough for me.The animation is very impressive, the characters are well designed and have there own cool looks and colors. The Mechs could have been better designed I think, with a little but more originality and flare but animation wise they usually deliver the goods and the CGI doesn’t feel out of place with the rest of the animation ether.Overall this turned out to be a brilliant and fun anime, just don’t expect anything as deep or as dark as Black Lagoon despite the gunslinger similarities. fun and interesting enough, they range impressible from blood hungry monster plots to the quite bizarre samurai and cyberspace roaming that you would not expect to find in this type of anime and while it normally works well the plot sometimes try’s to be a bit deeper and darker then it can actually manage (And the main idea of a Tokyo with guns gives it the right to at least try) In the end it works much better as a fun, over the top series.Burst Angel is mostly a Sci-fi/Action series and as you would expect each story includes some fun mech or gunslinger battles which while mostly impressive, sometimes do end up feeling a little bit tedious after a while (Must point out however that this is the first mech series I have really watched all the way through)The characters are a big highlight of the series and while they may be a little stereotyped in there ways (Loud kid, well endowed leader, quite gunslinger, the one who always gets kidnapped) but each are given there own quirks that help define them more as the series goes on and end up giving the story a good dose of needed emotion as the series concludesThe most fascinating character was Jo, whose striking crimson appearance just screams how cool she is.

Oh who am I kidding, I ain't grown up enough.A serious contender for guilty pleasure, Burst Angel is far from the best series out there, not even the best Gonzo ever made.  A quick glance at the cast tells you NOBODY WATCHED THIS FOR THE STORY.  It's the DOA Beach Volleyball of scifi anime.I've heard it's a thing with the studio that their projects start out okay and kinda fall off the rails about halfway through.  Burst certainly does (where the heck the samurai episodes come from I have no...idea) but it all boils down to armed cuties kick some ass.  It's Borderlands with just the female characters and they have a Gundam in the truck.The mecha fights are pretty cool, I love JANGO's design.  The rest of the action is alright, and on occasion there's even some well drawn food...oh yeah, the guy character is attending a culinary school.  And I like that Funimation just played the Texan accents card so well in the dub.So it isn't a life changing experience, and you could watch something better any day of the week.

To me, it’s like junk food in anime form:  if it’s your thing, you may enjoy it as a ‘guilty pleasure’.  As other people have noted, the story is paper-thin, the characters are two dimensional, and there are too many filler episodes for a show this short.  I don’t care for fan service in anime, and there was too much of it here in my opinion.  I’d really only recommend the show to someone who likes the visuals of girls, guns, and giant robots.  Anyone looking for any depth to a show...should steer clear.Sei was about the only interesting character, but her backstory never really went anywhere.  Jo – tough girl with guns; seen it before, nothing new here.  Meg – whiny, useless eye-candy.  Other than serving as a focal point for hostage situations, she does nothing in the show other than cling to Jo.

The songs worked well for the show, but I personally can’t stand the translated lyrics or the vocal style on the opening track.Bottom line, Bakuretsu Tenshi doesn’t add anything new or original to the genre, and what it does, it does with average competency.  I wouldn’t quite call the entire show filler, but it comes close.  If the visuals / combat scenes had been less interesting, I probably would have rated this lower than a 5/10.

Jo – tough girl with guns; seen it before, nothing new here.  Meg – whiny, useless eye-candy.  Other than serving as a focal point for hostage situations, she does nothing in the show other than cling to Jo.

Think I enjoyed it more this time. In any case, to the review:STORYStory is kinda over-the-top I think, but at the same time, something you might expect from an anime of this genre. Seems more than slightly random at points. I´d say that this anime is pretty episodic, not necessary a bad thing though. The ending was kinda meh, but when it hasn´t been? The story manages to get on the good side in my eyes, definitely.ARTLooks good enough to me. Real looking guns gather some extra points from me. ;D Need to say...though that some parts could look smoother, especially some scenes with lots of movement. For example cars could use some work at parts. (Aside from the show itself, the art of the characters is amazing.)SOUNDHard to say anything bad, sound acting is good, I like Jo´s voice especially. Great intro and outro also. Really liked it after hearing a lot of japanese music in my everyday music-listening. At first all anime-music sounded somehow special you know.CHARACTERSWell yeah, like others have said, no real suprises. Also some character are just too much of a fanservice... Sei, I have two things to say about her, and you all know what they are. A tip, they´re big. Amy, kinda annoying at times, then also funny and cute. Meg... I just say he´s a useless baka. Leo, a basic guy, nothing annoying though, liked him very much. Had some amusing acts going on... xD Kyohei, thought that he´d had a larger role in this, but guess not. Didn´t really raise any feelings. Then, Jo. Really love her, she made a huge part of this anime to me. Amazing design I think. Revealing outfit, but her body isn´t the usual fanservice really. Liking both though. Also, as a liker of tattoos, points granted. Her weapons, .50 AE Desert Eagle, two-tone and dual-wielded! Been kinda a gun maniac for a long time, so... And her attitude, somehow I can relate to her at times. Easily the best character in the show, and has a place in my favorites forever.ENJOYMENTWhen the going really got rough, it was awesome. Had much of weaker moments also, but never got me thinking of dropping this. Maintained somehow solid all the time and kept me interested. The better characters had a big role in that too.OVERALLAction packed show, with girls whooping ass and some mecha. Could be more solid and have some characters improved, but a recommended one none the less. First gave this an 8, but changed to 9 after all. If I could, I would give 8,5, but I can´t. I feel this has to rised over some other series I´ve seen, so here we go. though that some parts could look smoother, especially some scenes with lots of movement.

You have action, horror, drama, a little ecchi, as well as a sorta lesbian love thing going on. While this may not be a perfect anime I did enjoy it thoroughly.The pacing of the episodes was a little wonky, some arcs ended way to fast and others dragged on way to long. Though I still think 24 episodes was a good decision, they could have tightened the plot up a bit more. I am after all a sucker for anime with strong female leads and while Meg...may not be that Jo and Sei are enough to satisfy me.Its a shame that this never got a sequel as for me the end of the last episode showed how they could have turned Meg into a strong female lead. Though what we had been left with was a lacklustre ova.This is still one of my favourite shows, it may not be great but it has its moments. may not be that Jo and Sei are enough to satisfy me.Its a shame that this never got a sequel as for me the end of the last episode showed how they could have turned Meg into a strong female lead. Though what we had been left with was a lacklustre ova.This is still one of my favourite shows, it may not be great but it has its moments.', ""A spaghetti western set in not quite post-apocalyptic Tokyo might be the easiest way to describe Burst Angel. The ideas of an outlaw gunslinger and the authorities' reliance on firearms to deal with criminals fit the genre well, and the series contains numerous homages, such as the design and name of the mech Jango, the episode titles, and the music used in the series.A person's enjoyment of Burst Angel depends on what one thinks of girls in revealing clothing fighting freakish monsters with glowing brains and rampaging giant robots. If such things are to your liking, the series will surely please. However, if you...don't appreciate the presence of such elements in your anime, there is little reason to watch.The characters of Burst Angel don't bring any creative or new traits with them, but they fill their roles well. Jo, the main character, is the tough-as-nails gunfighter who is loyal to those who earn her respect and has a special soft spot for Meg. Meg is Jo's longtime partner who, while not completely useless, spends much of the series kidnapped and used as bait. Amy is the whiz kid hacker. Sei (whose middle name is Elizabeth, thus making the reference to Little Women complete) is the leader of the group, and sometimes clashes with Jo by prioritizing the mission over rescuing Meg. Finally, Kyohei is the fish-out-of-water whom the girls hire as a cook, but is often dragged along on missions because of unfortunate coincidences.The characters don't have much depth and are fairly static, although there are a couple of episodes that provide a slightly broader glimpse of their personalities. Individually, some of the characters can be a little irritating, but their interactions generally make up for these shortcomings. Also, they are assisted by the typically fun and quirky supporting cast that appear frequently.The plot is not Burst Angel's strong point. The overarching story regarding RAPT and the conspiracy involving the monsters with glowing brains hold the shorter plot arcs together only loosely for much of the story. Events tie together a little more tightly in the second half as the series comes to a close. The story is somewhat typical, although entertaining enough if one likes the characters. The individual arcs, usually one to three episodes long, and break from a standard format before events get too repetitive. The series tries to not take itself too seriously (especially notable in the dub), but some of the later episodes are played pretty straight. They don't do a bad job of it, but you've probably seen most of it before done better.Visually, the series is quite good. Character designs are appropriately pleasing or unsettling, depending on the subject. The female characters' breast size does fluctuate, most notably in the beach resort episode, but that (and the rather unrealistic proportions of Meg and Sei) is probably the art's greatest flaw. The 3D and 2D images blend together very well, which can be a difficult task for some shows. Action scenes are well done, but not stunning, and the rest of the animation is of good quality as well.Both English and Japanese language tracks are competently acted. Kyohei's voice can be a little whiny in both languages, but this fits the character. Fortunately, Amy's voice was not done in the high pitched screech typically found among young girls in anime. The deeper tone used for Jo's voice is a little different from what one usually hears for female characters, but works well.While the ED is utterly forgettable, the OP is quite lively and somewhat unique. The background music works well and matches the mood of the western genre.In all, Burst Angel is a fun action romp that delivers shoot outs, explosions, and pretty girls, but looking for much more than that may leave you disappointed. don't appreciate the presence of such elements in your anime, there is little reason to watch.The characters of Burst Angel don't bring any creative or new traits with them, but they fill their roles well.

The English dub is one of the better ones I have seen in recent times and it is available in subbed form depending on your preference for such things.The story is a nice blend of intrigue and conspiracy set within a decently fleshed out world though it is let down by sometimes meandering to what only feels like filler content as well as the needless attempts to get even more fan-service in. The characters are a quite clichéd and they would have no harm done with a bit more fleshing out as the story progresses, no pun intended.While the fan-service may put some off or of course draw people to it this is a series you definitely should give a try if you’ve never seen it especially if you enjoy cyberpunk in anyway.

It really depends on what sort of mood you are in. If you are willing to suspend your disbelief and just go along with things, you will probably appreciate the action and humorous highlights provided by the colorful cast.STORY:Every few episodes you start settling in to what you think are the themes that have been set for the show, and then something COMPLETELY RANDOM comes along and blows away your expectations. Occasionally there are giant robot...battles and super soldiers (like a gundam plot), occasionally there are alien-like super creatures reminiscent of an 80s capcom game, and occasionally there is police drama like style. I am just hitting on a few themes that come up. There is plenty more strangeness.ART:Well there are a lot of scantily clad ladies with guns....SOUND:Kind of tacky jpop openings and closings. The theme song is pretty catchy.CHARACTERS:All of the characters are, well, characters. There's the super-human combat beast, Joe, the adorably helpless Meg, the brainy loli character Amy, the brainy plotting Sei, and the random slice-of-life bakery guy. The combinations of their personalities in the outrageous and overall dramatic situations the story puts them in make for a flavorful experience.ENJOYMENT:Depending on what state of mind you go into Bakuretsu Tenshi with, you will either love it or hate it. It comes off like it is attempting to have a serious plot, but the plot is just so unintentionally ridiculous that you will be disappointed if you try to take it seriously. battles and super soldiers (like a gundam plot), occasionally there are alien-like super creatures reminiscent of an 80s capcom game, and occasionally there is police drama like style.

This anime is a really rough gem which is polished almost to perfection by the skilled designers.With a action packed story, amazing artwork, this anime steps up to my expectations. The story takes place in a crime-ridden future japan, at first the story is focused on a Pastry chef, Kyohei Tachibana, who is a 18 year old boy looking for work, Upon getting a flier for personal chef job, he rides his bike to a parking lot where a large truck was sitting....When he goes up to the truck he meets four girls, Sei, Meg, Jo and Amy.Sei is the leader of the girls and takes command when times are needed.Meg is the cults of the group, She is always getting kidnapped making Jo come to save her.Jo is the bad ass of the group, She is the one who fights out of the girls and pilots a robot named Jango. Jo is my personal favorite character in this anime.Meg is the computer wiz and always has more fun hacking into something rather than going out and having a good time.All the characters are tightly warped in the story and makes none of the characters useless. The characters are the strong point in this anime.The show is more serious than funny but you can still have a good time watching it.There are a total of 24 episodes in the anime and every one has something to do with the final outcome of the anime.I give Bakuretsu Tenshi, a 7/10 When he goes up to the truck he meets four girls, Sei, Meg, Jo and Amy.Sei is the leader of the girls and takes command when times are needed.Meg is the cults of the group, She is always getting kidnapped making Jo come to save her.Jo is the bad ass of the group, She is the one who fights out of the girls and pilots a robot named Jango.

I have to say I really enjoyed it, but it won't win any prizes for story telling. But it's an interesting show.StoryThe story consisted of several side stories linked to the finale. I think they were all important to learn more about the story but I found I was a bit confused on how it all linked up at some points.Their are some minor filler episodes but I think they did link up to the story enough not to take away...from it. I found it was very much like western animation in this regard for younger audiences.I do think it relied on the characters being good to much.But I found it really interesting and the world they built was quite good to. I liked the whole futuristic Tokyo wasteland setting. It was well done.Like Martian Successor Nadesico this anime lucked out because it needed a second season, but it is never to be.TechThe visual were quite good for for the time and the sound effects to being 2003. No real complaints there. Some of the special effects where bad near the finale which was disappointing.The voice acting wasn't that good either. But these few negative things didn't take my enjoyment of the show away. I think it's more of a reflection of the time it was created rather than carelessness on the makers of the show.CharactersI liked them all, the main characters were well thought out and had interesting stories and developed fairly well. I think the biggest thing I liked about this show was Jo. The main character. She was a cool headed badass who knew how to like others.Meg was pretty good to although pretty much useless. She was an important supporting character though and she really didn't get to shine in the series. I think the plan was to have her be the lead of season 2, but since it got canned it could never be.Sei and Amy where great characters to. Sei was well developed and had a more important part than Amy did. Her backstory was pretty solid and her design was good. Amy's was good to but she didn't feel like a main character but a supporting character like Kyohei, who was the chef.ConclusionWhen it comes down to it, the show is about Jo being badass. I enjoyed it allot and the action was good. The Mecha component of the series I also enjoyed and they were an important part of the story.To me it felt like the story was more about gun fights and less about Mechas. Which I liked. It's good seeing Mecha's just being a part of the story rather than one of the main focuses.It's a good show and I'd recommend it highly. I can't give it a better score than I did though, It's simply good and not much else more.Score: 7.6/10 MAL Score: 8/10 [Rounded up] from it.

Sometimes the anime will go off the rails, however I found this more entertaining as it helped to develop more of the characters and show you what they did as a job.I found overall that the story was great and it gave you what you wanted to see although fan-service did take over it. If you love girls-with-guns then this is a great anime to get into and you can get into the mood...and mind of the characters. The characters are well developed and to me it felt like there was a lot to the characters, especially with the way that it would portray each one during the anime.The plot of this anime was really up and down, it made you watch fillers that were unrelated to the real story, however this helped you to see more of the characters and more of the enjoyment. Some of the fillers would be weak but some would be strong, I really enjoyed the all-girls school filler, this really made me love the anime as much as I do.I actually enjoyed this anime a lot and managed to finish it quite quickly as i was engrossed in it, it gave me the suspense to want to get to the end. Sound and art was really nice for the time it was developed.

You are not missing out on anything important in case you haven't heard of it, but if you end up as a fan of the series, give it a read.First of all, I enjoyed Bakuretsu Tenshi greatly, and without a doubt many others will as well. However, if we look at the series with a critical eye, it's very hard to give it a thumbs up. The character development is almost nonexistent, the plot is fragmented...and repeats itself.

CB Chara Go Nagai World,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2692/CB_Chara_Go_Nagai_World,"[""This OVA series has to be one of the most underrated anime ever.  Although at first glance this may seem very stupid, but actually its very funny.  It takes &quot;Devilman&quot; a very serious show along with &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; another series show although it did have some comedic moments and basicly parody them along with their creator Go Nagai himself.  Plus although I doubt anyone will count this as cannon, but it also bridges the gap between &quot;Devilman&quot; and &quot;Violence Jack&quot; another work of Go Nagai.  The only minus I can see is that if the person watching isn't aware of anything...Devilman, Mazinger Z, Violence Jack, or even Cutey Honey related then they wouldn't get pretty much all of the jokes, so only GO Nagai fans will be able to enjoy this.

In the same sort of style as the original SD Gundam OVAs, CB chara Go Nagai World merges the worlds of Devilman and Mazinger Z and trap them in a sort of chibi world. While it almost always keeps a light hearted tone, you never feel like your watching something for kids. The story is a bit weird but since its just a Chibi parity, it actually works pretty well.

Dear Boys,https://myanimelist.net/anime/292/Dear_Boys,"['Animation:The animation was acceptable, but got worse towards the end. Eyes that didn&amp;rsquo;t match, weird or wrong faces (and why did the girls look so much like boys with long hair?). The background was plain. The basketball actions weren&amp;rsquo;t drawn very well, sometimes making you wonder what they were doing and half of the time you didn&amp;rsquo;t really get how they got past their defenders. As for the OP and ED, they were pretty bad.Sound:This was very well done. Most (not all) of the voices were really good and were nicely complementing their personalities. The sounds were what you would expect, not extraordinary...but not horrible either, just average. The music during episodes was also very good, the music you needed during the scene was used, and I was enjoying it. But again, the OP and ED were bad (that&amp;rsquo;s a matter of taste though).Story:The typical high-school sports story: Trying to win the nationals. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really astonishing, but there was a little originality in the story. There was no basketball team to begin with (it was suspended from the tournament for one year). Because of that all the senpais quit the team and only 4 players remained. Then one extra player (Aikawa), a transfer student, came and the team was reborn.Character:The five main characters were nice, but nothing special. You&amp;rsquo;ll see a little about their background, about what happened to the former basketball team or why Aikawa transferred to their school, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything impressive. Only three of them made real development, trying to get a little closer to Aikawa, while the other two (Aikawa and Taku) made almost no progress.The other, less important (or not important at all) characters weren&amp;rsquo;t very good. The girls, from the girls basketball team, were more of a support for the five (main) boys than that they  hade a real personality. The opponents weren&amp;rsquo;t good either. They were almost the same as the five main boys, except for the team aces and captains. The only difference was their look.A couple of the characters started, or made progress with, their relationship with each other. The friendly relationships between the team players (from both the main team as well as their opponents) were pretty nice to see and made the basketball games more enjoyable, while the romantic relationships hade nothing to do with the story and weren&amp;rsquo;t really good.Enjoyment:I watched this series for the basketball, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it. Mostly because of how the action was animated. During some games you finally got to see some real basketball, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t much. Most of the time it was just seeing point after point (not much action) and when Mizuho (the main basketball team) was losing, Aikawa would speak to the rest of the team and Mizuho would get fired up, finally starting to play real basketball.Overall:Despite it&amp;rsquo;s flaws (bad animation &amp; a little below-average characters), it had some strong points (very good sound &amp; some nice relationships), which made it a decent (sports) anime. But I would rather (re)watch Slam Dunk which has a better (but older) animation, superb characters, little better story and gives you a better (basketball) enjoyment.

It doesn't have a particularly outstanding score here on MyAnimeList, it's not exactly a new anime and while it may have been my first proper sports anime, I had people left, right and centre telling me that sports anime in general aren't very good. On top of that, the voice actors in the English version were those who work for Blue Water Studios, Ocean Group's cheaper sister studio which isn't exactly known for quality dubbing outside of a couple of notable exceptions (i.e. G Gundam and Cardfight Vanguard.)With that said, I was pleasantly...surprised from the very first episode with how much I really enjoyed Hoop Days.The story of Hoop Days is nothing too complex. It's the story of a High School student named Kazuhiko Aikawa and the basketball club of Mizuho high school. To start with, Mizuho only has 4 players, with their captain, Takumi Fujiwara being banned from playing for a year due to punching out the team's coach a year prior. Slowly but surely, however, Aikawa's positive attitude begins to rub off on the rest of the players in the basketball club, and slowly but surely the boys' basketball team gets back together, regains their passion and begins to win games in their quest to be the best basketball team in Japan. Again, nothing too complex, but it works. The characters are so well-written and likable that you genuinely want to root for them to achieve their goals and succeed. Aikawa in particular is such a nice guy that you can't help but feel his positive attitude rub off on you as a viewer.As far as voice acting goes, I was pleasantly surprised and a little annoyed. Surprised because while I had fears coming in due to my own past negative experiences with Blue Water Studio dubs, they did a really good job dubbing the characters in Hoop Days. Each voice actor was cast appropriately for their character. Mark Gatha in particular turned in another strong performance as Aikawa. The voice acting suited the characters perfectly. On the other hand I was annoyed because as a fan of the Gundam franchise, I wondered where the quality voice acting was in such Blue Water dubs as Zeta Gundam where the voice actors seemed to really phone it in. If they'd been this good in Zeta Gundam, it more than likely wouldn't have left such a sour taste in my mouth. But this isn't a Zeta Gundam review, and I really can't complain about the voice acting in Hoop Days.Animation-wise? Nothing too spectacular. A lot of gratuitous CG on the basketball during games and the hoop in games, but as the same studio that created Hoop Days created Initial D's anime, it's to be expected. There are a lot of Initial D elements present to be honest. The same goes for the soundtrack. Very urbany, very hip-hoppy and europoppy, nothing that wouldn't sound out of place in Initial D.  Failing that, the animation is nothing overly spectacular. If you're expecting high-quality HD-quality animation, you won't find it here. Hoop Days is *definitely* a product of the mid-00's.All-in-all, Hoop Days is a fun anime. While it may take itself a bit seriously at times, the characters are enjoyable, the story (while simplistic) is enjoyable and the soundtrack and voice acting are very good. If you're looking for an anime full of complex, mind-blowing twists, you won't find it here. But if you're looking for a light-hearted, fun and entertaining sports anime, Hoop Days is a good place to start. At only 24 episodes, it's not overly long either.

The story is decent, the art and animation are low quality and the characters are simple. This anime tries so hard to be cool by including rap in the ending theme, and the opening tries to glorify basketball by sounding more extravagant. Other sports anime in the same genre are capable of being cool without even trying (Slam Dunk, KNB). This anime was aggravating to watch and very much unrealistic, knowing as much as I do about basketball I couldn't help but...point out the flaws with this anime in terms of the game. By the time I made it through halfway through the series, I saw the most egregious play in basketball, two missed flagrant fouls calls by the ref, and an unfounded technical towards the MC's team when it was undeserved. I was so upset, that I rage quitted an anime for the first time in my anime watching lifetime (over 10 years). If this was the first basketball anime you've ever watched, I understand why people would like this, but if you've seen other basketball anime, you'll realize how bad this anime really is. If you wanna watch a good basketball anime, watch Slam Dunk, Kuroko no Basket, Ahiru no Sora, or even Buzzer Beater, but don't watch this. point out the flaws with this anime in terms of the game.

Despite its many flaws, it was an enjoyable ride for me.Art & Animation (5):It was pretty obvious that the animation was bad. I do understand that this was made in 2003; but slam dunk was made in 1993, and i still think it had better animation than this. The faces get really weird at some scenes, and it didnt have a smooth flow; any basketball anime needs to have a...nice flow to be able to accurately and entertainingly portray the action of any match. It was hard to know how they got past the opposing members sometimes, and sometimes the defenders on the other team were not defending at all! The character design wasn't really bad, even though i personally think Aikawa's hair was really weird. Overall, the execution was not well done.Sound (8):I really hated the opening at first, but it was somehow catchy, and I got used to it in the end. The ending song, however, was awful; but that might just be personal preference. The sound effects were done well, and the music that played at certain scenes fit them. As for the voice acting, I thought it was very good, and the voices compliment the characters.Story (7):The story was'nt really extraordinary, but that was to be expected. Most basketball animes tend to have similar story lines, which are pretty normal. There were some original ideas, however. The whole idea of the club being dis-functional before Aikawa came; also, the addition of a female basketball team. I thought the female team was a great idea and a first in the anime industry, however, it was not well executed. The team served only as practice partners for the boys' team and as support. It should have had its own hurdles to overcome, which were almost none. The individuals of the team faced personal problems, but the team as a whole never did.Character (7):The characters were not really that special, but some of them still grow on you. For me, most of the girls, save for Satomi and Mai, were really annoying. The boys were kind of interesting, and we got to explore the pasts of some of them. The opponents were also good, nothing special though. East Honmoku was the rival team that grew on me most, and i thought they were the source of most of the comedy in the whole show.Enjoyment (8):Despite the bad animation and the unnecessary scenes, I quite enjoyed this series.

However, Ask Dr. Rin! was quite enjoyable. Although Ask Dr. Rin! is meant for children to a certain extent, this anime\'s story is too complex for a child.

The story was very slow at first...and the art isn\'t the greatest. In fact, it screams ""I was made in the early 2000\'s."" The soundtrack sounds forgetful but after watching an episode, I often times find myself humming a tune or two from the show. The character design is very generic, however I found myself wanting to cosplay as certain characters after I saw the outfits of the Four Gods, Meirin and even Rin Rin. Despite my critiques, I enjoyed the show the entire time while watching. My final verdict is that this show is not for everyone. If you love Sailor Moon and Fushigi Yuugi, then you\'ll love this illegitimate child known as Ask Dr. Rin! If you hate love triangles and waiting for just ONE kiss, don\'t look at this show.

Futari wa Precure: Max Heart Movie 1,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1930/Futari_wa_Precure__Max_Heart_Movie_1,"[""I've talked about PreCure thrice before. I started by talking about DokiDoki and then I moved back to Futari Wa and Max Heart. With the films, I'm going to start at the beginning. Unfortunately, there were no Futari wa films. Which means skipping ahead to the entirely mediocre sequel, Max Heart. Well, maybe the film will be more about Honoka & Nagisa and less about... what was the boring one's name? Inori? Yeah, that sounds right.Story:We open with Nagisa and Honoka sitting at Akane's takoyaki stand. They converse with Akane and one another. The other girl... Setsuna is given her break and the three...run off. They're approached by a mysterious cloaked figure who sounds just like Goku and knows they're PreCure. After a brief battle, it's revealed that the cloaked figure was actually a bunch of little frog warriors from the Garden of Hope. They request assistance from our heroines as they're being threatened by a powerful witch. Not wanting to abandon those in need, Honka, Nagisa and the other one agree and they're teleported to the Garden of Hope.The only story issue that really merits mention is with the ending. Things wrap up really easily in the end. On one hand, you can forgive it somewhat since this is a franchise for the youth. But, on the other hand, it isn't as satisfying a conclusion as it could have been.There are a lot of things to like about the film. It's paced very well, flowing from one thing to the next very naturally. The conflict has weight to it. The arc of them gaining the friendship of the warriors is nice. There's also very little of either Pollun or Tsubomi. He might have four or five lines, and she mostly stays relegated to the background or is just out of the fighting due to being Yamcha'd. Honestly, the series proper could have benefited if they'd gone the route of the film and had significantly less of those two.Characters:The characters are pretty much the same as they are in the series. Nagisa and Honoka are fantastic and have a strong dynamic. Erika is really flat and boring. Pollun is a bit less annoying here. Mainly because he's used a lot less and he doesn't throw any tantrums. In terms of new characters we get for the film, they vary. Most of them are just kind of flat. The big exceptions are Square and Round, who are a bit more fleshed out and Marquis, who's a little annoying. Our antagonist is one of those villains who only trusts in her own power and mocks the heroes for relying on others. Pretty standard, but there's nothing really wrong with her.Art:I have to give the film credit on this count. While the designs are the same as the series (including Itsuki's perpetual look of dull surprise), or on par with it in the cases of the film characters, the backgrounds in this are superb. At least, they are when we get to the Garden of Hope. It is a very pretty world. I also do like the antagonist's design and her bat-like minions. What they do with her ship is really cool. The action sequences are really good as well. Nagisa  & Honoka really get physical with the punches and kicks. We also get to see their frog-like compatriots punch some bat monsters. Which is pretty awesome.Sound:Honna Youko and Yukana deliver the superlative performances we've  gotten used to in this franchise. I'll also give credit to Nozawa Masako & Matsuoka Youko. They're both good in this. Ikezawa Haruna's performance is much less annoying, probably because of her character being downplayed. Tanaka Rie still sounds like she's just not putting in any effort. I'm still certain it's because Yuri has all the emotional depth of a paper clip. I mean, she displayed emotions as Aizawa Chizuru, Nishizumi Maho, Sei and Neptune. The music is pretty much like the music from the series proper. Right down to using the lazy remix theme tune. Which shouldn't be a surprise considering that Sato Naoki did composition for this, the series proper and Futari wa. Most of the music is good. We even get some new songs that are quite good.Ho-yay:Unlike the main Max Heart series, in this film Honoka and Nagisa are allowed to have moments without them being interrupted by Hibiki. And they manage quite a few. Including one early on where Nagisa says she'll find someone who likes her for who she is and it's promptly followed by Honoka saying she's cute.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Max Heart The Film. Surprisingly, given my general thoughts on Max Heart, I quite liked it. It's got a lot of charm. Keeping the boring and annoying characters largely to the side was smart. The action is pretty amazing. The artwork in general is pretty, actually. All in all, I give it a 7/10. If you're a fan of Futari wa PreCure, give it a try. Even if you're like me and don't have any affection for its sequel. Tomorrow we'll keep film festival week going with Kaze Tachinu. run off.

There's also very little of either Pollun or Tsubomi. He might have four or five lines, and she mostly stays relegated to the background or is just out of the fighting due to being Yamcha'd. Honestly, the series proper could have benefited if they'd gone the route of the film and had significantly less of those two.Characters:The characters are pretty much the same as they are in the series. Nagisa and Honoka are fantastic and have a strong dynamic. Erika is really flat and boring. Pollun is a bit less annoying here. Mainly because he's used a lot less and he doesn't throw any tantrums. In terms of new characters we get for the film, they vary. Most of them are just kind of flat. The big exceptions are Square and Round, who are a bit more fleshed out and Marquis, who's a little annoying. Our antagonist is one of those villains who only trusts in her own power and mocks the heroes for relying on others. Pretty standard, but there's nothing really wrong with her.Art:I have to give the film credit on this count. While the designs are the same as the series (including Itsuki's perpetual look of dull surprise), or on par with it in the cases of the film characters, the backgrounds in this are superb. At least, they are when we get to the Garden of Hope. It is a very pretty world. I also do like the antagonist's design and her bat-like minions. What they do with her ship is really cool. The action sequences are really good as well. Nagisa  & Honoka really get physical with the punches and kicks. We also get to see their frog-like compatriots punch some bat monsters. Which is pretty awesome.Sound:Honna Youko and Yukana deliver the superlative performances we've  gotten used to in this franchise. I'll also give credit to Nozawa Masako & Matsuoka Youko. They're both good in this. Ikezawa Haruna's performance is much less annoying, probably because of her character being downplayed. Tanaka Rie still sounds like she's just not putting in any effort. I'm still certain it's because Yuri has all the emotional depth of a paper clip. I mean, she displayed emotions as Aizawa Chizuru, Nishizumi Maho, Sei and Neptune. The music is pretty much like the music from the series proper. Right down to using the lazy remix theme tune. Which shouldn't be a surprise considering that Sato Naoki did composition for this, the series proper and Futari wa. Most of the music is good. We even get some new songs that are quite good.Ho-yay:Unlike the main Max Heart series, in this film Honoka and Nagisa are allowed to have moments without them being interrupted by Hibiki. And they manage quite a few. Including one early on where Nagisa says she'll find someone who likes her for who she is and it's promptly followed by Honoka saying she's cute.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Max Heart The Film. Surprisingly, given my general thoughts on Max Heart, I quite liked it. It's got a lot of charm. Keeping the boring and annoying characters largely to the side was smart. The action is pretty amazing. The artwork in general is pretty, actually. All in all, I give it a 7/10. If you're a fan of Futari wa PreCure, give it a try. Even if you're like me and don't have any affection for its sequel. Tomorrow we'll keep film festival week going with Kaze Tachinu."", ""The time to watch the first movie of this fantastic franchise finally arrived... and it was decent.The story is pretty standard for those type of movies (or well, in the case of Precure it's more or less what it's about, just in shorter duration): some magical frogs come to ask the Precure and Hikari for help to face a baddie who wants to steal a treasure that they have which would cause chaos in the wrong hands, and it's up to them to save the day.The characters from this movie were fairly forgettable excluding Square, one of the frogs who is way less open to...the Precure than the rest and creates some drama for Nagisa due to his opinions, he developed pretty well over the duration of the movie to be satisfied with him.In terms of art and music it was more or less like the TV series, which is a good thing because the action scenes were very enjoyable to watch as usual thanks to the nice animation, there is also a solid insert song in the movie that I liked, no complaints from this part.Overall this movie was pretty unremarkable but not boring to watch, I would recommend it if you liked the TV series, but if not it's definitely skippable. the Precure than the rest and creates some drama for Nagisa due to his opinions, he developed pretty well over the duration of the movie to be satisfied with him.In terms of art and music it was more or less like the TV series, which is a good thing because the action scenes were very enjoyable to watch as usual thanks to the nice animation, there is also a solid insert song in the movie that I liked, no complaints from this part.Overall this movie was pretty unremarkable but not boring to watch, I would recommend it if you liked the TV series, but if not it's definitely skippable.""]"
Golgo 13,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1760/Golgo_13,"['I\'m amazed that there\'s no review for this movie, especially as Golgo 13 is pretty well known in anime circles. But then again, anime that are over 25 years old don\'t seem to get much love these days, no matter how good or bad they are.Golgo 13: The Professional was released in 1983, a full 7 years after the manga by Saito Takao ended serialisation. During it\'s run the manga saw phenomenal success in both Japan and the rest of the world, with over 200 million sales in various formats. The series was adapted into two live action movies in 1973 and 1977, both of...which were reasonably well received, but were not the successes that had been hoped for.Fast forward to 1983, and the release of the first anime incarnation of the legendary assassin Duke Tougou. At that time anime was still in it\'s infancy in the Western market, with much of what was being released were either Ghibli affairs, or shows that were deemed suitable for Western audiences. Then, Golgo 13: The Professional arrived on the stage, and nothing was ever the same again.It\'s often commented about how Akira opened the Western markets for anime, however what is often overlooked are the shows that came before it that gradually forced their way into how we in the West viewed ""cartoons"". Golgo 13 was not only responsible for giving that door a good kick, it also had the added bonus of being made specifically for an adult audience, something which was almost unheard of at the time.The story follows the exploits of Duke Tougou, the legendary assassin known only as Golgo 13. He has been comissioned to kill one Robert Dawson, the son of oil baron and owner of Dawson Enterprises, Leonard Dawson. Although Golgo 13 is successful in his task, Leonard Dawson has sworn bloody revenge for the murder of his son and heir. Throw in the army, FBI, CIA, other assasins, mass murderers and a distinct lack of morals, and you have a recipe for something..... unique.The pacing and style in which the plot unfolds is actually very good, and is very reminiscent of the better class of action movie. Indeed, the writers took their cues from several action movies from both the East and the West, which is ironic as this movie has in turn inspired others, from Luc Besson\'s ""Leon"", to Tarantino\'s ""Kill Bill"" (even the videogame ""Hitman"" pays homage to the whole Golgo 13 series in several instances). The whole story starts with an innocuously languid feel, which belies the breakneck speed at which it progresses later on.One thing I did like about the plot for this movie was that it wasn\'t simply about Duke Tougou, but was seen from the perspective of Leonard Dawson as well. His blinding rage at Golgo 13 is the main driver for the story as a whole, and is also what adds some drama and tension to what would otherwise have been a fairly one dimensional action movie. Another thing that separates this from the herd is the huge twist at the end of the movie as it adds a new dimension to the events that occur, and also explains a lot about Leonard Dawson as a character.Given the age of the movie it would be fair to expect animation to be subpar compared to most titles on offer today. That said, Golgo 13 was one of the first anime to make regular use of CGI, something which did not become prominent in the medium until the mid 90s. This is only used in certain sequences, however it is used to good effect on the whole. Some of the buildings and backdrops are clearly CGI, but rather spartan with the detail. Those that are not are nicely drawn and detailed, making them a decent canvas upon which the action can take place.The design for Duke Tougou follows very close with that of the manga and, using the manga as inspiration, the other characters were also created using Saito\'s foundations. The nice thing about this is that each of the characters have a certain ""believable-unbelievability"" about them, in other words, they\'re visually larger than life characters in the style of any good action story.Animation-wise, the movie isn\'t too bad on the whole. It is, however, reflective of the time, which means that there is often an over-emphasis on speed and movement (the use of speed lines for example), which can detract from a given scene. These techniques were used often during the 70s, 80s, and early 90s though, so their usage can be forgiven if one remembers that fact.Unfortunately I\'ve only seen the English dub for this movie (one of the few anime I haven\'t watched in both languages - yet), but don\'t be fooled into thinking that this is a bad thing. The dub is actually pretty well acted, if a little wooden on the whole. Gregory Snegoff, who plays the role of Duke Tougou, has also played several other anime based roles, however this role was a challenge for him and the rest of the cast as they were effectively being asked to speak and act like no other anime characters before.Ultimately the dub is pioneering stuff though as it effectively paved the way for more adult oriented anime like Akira, Crying Freeman, Wicked City, Genocyber, AD Police, etc, etc, to be released on the Western market.The music an eclectic blend of pop, rock and jazz, with some strange quasi-classical pieces thrown into the mix. This seemingly odd mixture of style and content has meant that some people have found the movie to be less than satisfying, primarily because the music and the atmosphere sometimes don\'t mix. Although this may be the case in certain circumstances, it\'s my belief that, at least musically, the movie is well served by the majority of the tracks it uses.As far as characters go, one would expect Duke Tougou to be the one who gets the most development. Ironically, and fittingly, it isn\'t actually him who is the driver for the movie. That role belongs to Leonard Dawson who, in my opinion, is one of the better anime antagonists to appear fro the 80s. Dawson\'s blind rage over the death of his son pushes him to act in ways that are both morally and legally wrong, however his thirst for revenge overrides everything else. What is interesting to see in the movie is how Golgo 13 remains unchanged and unchangeable - forever the quiet assasin, whilst all the hatred, evil and invective happen because of Leonard Dawson, which poses an intruiging moral argument as to who is actually the monster in this case.That said, the other characters aren\'t really developed all that well, and some of the supporting characters are extremely stereotypical. Laura Dawson (the widow of Robert), is a case in point, as she seems to be a character with almost no backbone whatsoever, no matter gets thrown at her. The other characters are equally as poor unfortunately, with almost no depth to them.This is a movie with numerous flaws, however it works as a straight up action flick simply because of the conflict between Duke and Leonard. The acting may be wooden at times, but this can easily be forgiven as the action does make up for it.So, will you enjoy this? If, like me, this was one of the first anime you owned back in the 80s, then the movie will have a certain nostalgic feel, especially when we recall how cool the CGI helicopter looked back then. Likewise, if you\'re a fan of the manga, or the recent TV series, then this is a movie you shouldn\'t miss as it does do justice to the franchise.Action junkies and people looking for something with a bit more bite may also want to give this a try as, even with the flaws, it\'s still makes for pretty entertaining viewing.But if you want romance, friendship, comedy, or twinkly stars and rainbows, then steer clear. which were reasonably well received, but were not the successes that had been hoped for.Fast forward to 1983, and the release of the first anime incarnation of the legendary assassin Duke Tougou.

That manga is Golgo 13, and it is basically unknown outside of Japan. Golgo is one of those series along with Lupin 3rd that is not just HUGE in Japan, but at the level of cultural icon, yet they are utterly irrelevant everywhere else outside of Japan. In Japan, Golgo has sold well over 200 million copies, which is more than Rurouni Kenshin, Yu Yu...Hakusho, Attack on Titan, and Inuyasha...combined! Is the anime movie of this highly successful manga any good? Not really.Golgo is a badass assassin who kills without mercy and sleeps with all the ladies. He is a smooth, sociopathic killing machine. However, Golgo never evolved outside a crude ripoff of James Bond in 50 freaking years. He is never given a background even in the manga, so it goes without saying that you learn NOTHING about the guy in the movie. It would be OK if only certain details were kept ambiguous like where he was born, how he became an assassin, why he became an assassin, but we don't even know his basic likes and dislikes, let alone his character motivation. Golgo may be GAR, but he is possibly the most flat, one dimensional character in anime history. For many viewers, this kind of makes Golgo a tad boring. We know he's going to win. We know he's going to kill his target without getting a scratch on him and he isn't going to feel bad for killing him. Eventually even something as awesome as sniping people in the head gets stale and redundant.The plot is that Golgo kills the son of a very wealthy man, who had a mysterious hit order placed on him. The wealthy father than sends legions of guys after Golgo only for Golgo to easily kill them all. The plot in this movie is honestly pretty simplistic, apart from having one of the absolute STUPIDEST twist endings in anime history. I won't spoil it, but even M. Night would say that was head bashingly retarded!To be honest, Golgo 13 doesn't even have the cheesy 1980s charm to it that Violence Jack has. It is honestly quite boring. Seriously. A movie about a hitman popping people in the fucking head is boring! If you want to see a Golgo movie, I would check out the live action version with Sonny Chiba! Why? Because Sonny Chiba makes everything better! He rips people's balls off, has a black belt in Ninjutsu, and has eyebrows even bushier than Leonid Brezhnev's! Golgo 13 the anime movie is a mediocre waste of time, but it is never a waste of time to see what kind of over the top performance good ol Shinichi Chiba will turn in!

It ranked in the top 5, along with Ninja Scroll, and later, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Vampyre Hunter D, and other classics.Over time, the graphics have come to appear a bit dated, so i would only give it 8/10 for graphics (unlike Ghost In The Shell, there doesn\'t seem to be a remake coming), but this is mostly in the CG sequences and, considering limits of the time, overall, it is still well presented.However, the reason why I came to like this movie is because of...the protagonist, Golgo 13. Without spoiling the plot, he is one of the most consistent ""heroes"" in a series ever (after this movie, there was a sequel, a manga series, a series of games, and even an anime TV series).To use one word to describe him: stoic.Golgo 13 does not hesitate, respond emotionally, or ever seem out of control, even when things clearly go wrong and he is in danger. This may make him sound dry (like, say, K. Reeves / Neo in The Matrix Trilogy), but he isn\'t. He is quite an engaging character.The story of this movie is somewhat simple, but the details make it interesting. In fact, that is one of the things that makes it worth re-watching... a lot happens in a short space of time, which doesn\'t feel rushed, but afterwards, makes plot development in other movies feel pale and unprofessional.The presentation style, from opening credits to ending, sets the tone for this dramatic action, which takes itself seriously without being boring. Furthermore, it deals with mature themes such as betrayal and murder (in fact, the lead character is an assassin).Okay, if you haven\'t ever watched this yet, then go out an do so now... although, actually, I prefer the sequel to this (Golgo 13: Queen Bee) for pure entertainment value, even though this is overall a better movie. the protagonist, Golgo 13.

Relentlessly visually innovative! Fun to laugh at!Golgo 13 is the longest running manga ever, super well known in Japan. He's an assassin who tends to kill people in impossibly skillful and unpredictable ways, usually with just one shot, he's the ultimate sex machine even though he barely moves during the deed and keeps the same stern expression he always has... which is hilarious. Especially because of those trademark colossal stern eyebrows. He's cool. Too cool. Emotionless, meticulous, unchanging and amoral. He's the hyper masculine ideal. His codename is Golgo 13 but the name he goes by from day to day is Duke...Togo, which seemingly everyone knows, kinda defeating the point of a fake name. Heh.Anyway, the point of Golgo 13 is that he is unchanging. He is a fact. Whilst it's great to see how he completes his jobs, the main point of Golgo 13 is the effect he has on other people. Take the main antagonist in this film - Golgo is unchanging and emotionless whilst this character is driven by sheer emotion provoked by Golgo's actions. This film will seem pretty disjointed if you don't know the basic premise - that the antagonist's son is killed by Golgo at the start of the film and as Golgo goes from job to job he is pursued by agents of the antagonist.Know this. Golgo 13: The Professional has the most relentlessly innovative interesting visuals I've ever seen in an anime... Now, this is disputable, but I'd say more than even Mind Game. The sheer number of things they do with light is astonishing. ASTONISHING. The anime industry has adopted cgi which this was the first anime to use, and the postcard technique where animation turns into drawn stills was pioneered here. *CORRECTION - IT WASN'T, THE DIRECTOR USED THE POSTCARD TECHNIQUE A BUNCH IN HIS OTHER WORK APPARENTLY...

I know it isn't awesome from our perspective, but just pretend that it's awesome and you'll have a blast.This film is obsessed with reflections, presumably because the antagonist is the mirror image of Golgo, at least in the emotional department. It's a game in and of itself just to look out for the countless mirror-esque reflections shown onscreen. Whatever you do, DON'T MAKE IT A DRINKING GAME. YOU WILL NOT WIN.This is a great film to laugh at. The villainous Gold and Silver alone are worth the ticket price. All the villains are great fun.The music is fantastic as well. Lots of smooth jazz and otherwise just perfect music to make everything seem oh so cool.This is a truly special and unique anime. That being said, the other anime film and tv series are definitely worth a watch too if you like this, but don't expect the same level of visual innovation.BE WARNED THERE IS A GRATUITOUS RAPE SCENE.

I was familiar with the premise of Golgo 13 by reputation among older anime fans, so I decided to sample this movie via rental from Netflix and I feel like I wasted 90 minutes of my life on this. The movie features titular assassin Duke Togo getting entangled in a corrupt business tycoon's plot of revenge when Togo gunned down his son when hired for the job. The whole feel for this movie is quite over-the-top with its very violent gun fights; confusing direction of plot; ridiculous action sequences where Duke survives ridiculously...impossible dire situations and making very impossible gunshots that will make you flush your disbelief down the toilet; the tycoon baddie being fanatically obsessed with killing Duke and a completely irredeemable scumbag; and Duke screwing every attractive gal he comes across in several sex scenes (also be warned that there's a rape scene as well in this movie). Don't expect to connect with any of the characters either as they are either too shallow in personality for you to care about and/or just serve as meatbags for Duke to kill off when they try to kill him. Some folks could even find this movie to be quite sexist with the treatment and depiction of women within the movie and the said mentioned rape scene.The visuals to this movie are quite outdated compared to modern standards with its rough details and sparse colors, though this is forgivable considering the movie's age. And despite how ridiculous I found the believability of many of this movie's action scenes were, the movie does have some interesting animated scenes it delivers such as the first-person perspective of a bullet fired from Duke's sniper rifle as it is about to pump a hole into it's unlucky victim's head; a split screen shot of Duke and his unlucky foe getting shot; and what appears to be the earliest CG animation sequence rendered in an anime as several enemy helicopters try to gun down Duke during a later action scene. The third example is quite rough compared to what you can expect of CG animation from modern anime titles, but I was surprised that something like this was done in an early 80s anime title.Beyond my praise for some of The Professional's animation methods though, the movie is otherwise a huge laughable mess of offensive content and over-the-top elements involving its characters and action scenes. Considering this is my first look into the Golgo 13 franchise, I think this will be my last look into it unless I get some very convincing arguments to consider venturing into other titles of the anime franchise otherwise. impossible dire situations and making very impossible gunshots that will make you flush your disbelief down the toilet; the tycoon baddie being fanatically obsessed with killing Duke and a completely irredeemable scumbag; and Duke screwing every attractive gal he comes across in several sex scenes (also be warned that there's a rape scene as well in this movie).

Golgo 13 excels in not just one way, but in three. First of all, this movie is a masterwork of nihilistic neo-noir pulp. Secondly it is an auteur art-house film by a truly visionary director. Finally, it is a poignant meditation on the nature of evil. The three elements are all delivered masterfully and tie into one another with incredible coherency.Golgo is a stoic assassin with little to no personality. He exists to kill and get paid for it, and is always inexpressive and cold....He has allies and business partners, who he is reliable to, but there is no warmth in any of his interactions, even with the women he beds. He is entirely amoral – killing is merely his business, he is empty. People often criticize the movie and this character for just that – Golgo is not really a human being; he is an amoral power fantasy, unspoiled by any sort of accessible charm or sentimentalism. Dezaki was willing to play this character straight, despite him being entirely unsuitable as a protagonist for standard movie goers, who look to empathize with their ‘heroes’, or at least enjoy the appealing side of an anti-hero.There are no heroes in the world of Golgo, at most there are victims and victimizers. Every sequence exemplifies a grimy, desperate and corrupt late 70s dystopic atmosphere. Even bright scenes seem uncomfortably abrasive, as the light is always blinding and hard, and every landscape and person we see seems worn out. The music simultaneously has a kind of suave groove to it while sounding tragic, rough, and pained. At the moment I write this review I am listening to the song featured in the ending credits “Golgo 13 & I”, featuring a sexy bemoaned chorus of “kill me, kill me once again” set to dirty jazzy J-Rock. It is incredibly evocative and fitting, as is the whole score.The story is paced and written bluntly, without any subtlety, and the plot itself is a simplistic sequence of violent and cruel events. The film achieves its powerful atmosphere with its absolute minimalism and willingness to abandon regular story telling conventions to maintain the purity of its vision of nihilistic cruelty. This is the ultimate exemplification of unmediated, brutal pulp, filled to brim with sex, violence (sexual violence as well) and hyper stoic masculinity. The world this film presents feels real enough that you can practically smell the cigarette smoke and gaudy cologne, and hear the tired desperate moans of its people as you watch it. I would liken it to an earlier take on Umetsu’s highly controversial and powerful “A Kite” in terms of its tone.At times character animation is used wonderfully to tell us what we need to know about characters without excessive dialogue, and the depictions of the characters are always highly detailed, often utilizing four or five tone shading for maximum dynamic effect that always matches with the inventive color palettes used to highlight the scenes\' mood. Golgo also utilizes a heavy use of hatching on the characters, which adds on an extra layer of grime to their presentation. The character designs themselves are hyper realistic, and Dezaki makes his women voluptuous and far more sexy and cunning than cute, something that makes me think of the female characters in Kawajiri works like Wicked City and Midnight Eye: Gokuu ,who have a similar aesthetic to them.What is most important about this film is that here Dezaki had come to perfect the style of limited animation that made him such a revolutionary figure in the industry back in the 70s (perhaps I will take this back upon seeing more of Dezaki’s later works, but this is clearly his style in its maturity). His sense of conveying atmosphere through color design and shot composition is unmatched here – as nearly every shot (not just scene, but shot) in this film is perfectly crafted to convey what it needs to. Dezaki uses visual motifs of reflective surfaces, blinding light work, and surrealistic, psychedelic, and nightmarish moments of emotional and physical impact to leave you breathless at every turn. This is of course also full of Dezaki’s signature postcard memories (sometimes in rapid fire), split screen sequences, and his use of complex background layering and motion to create immersive locations through the illusion of the parallax effect. Visually this is an auteur’s playground, and for this alone it could be considered a masterpiece, since Dezaki’s visionary approach has in many ways never been matched.However, there is 30 seconds of atrocious 1980s CGI that this movie has become famous for. At the very least the CGI sequence has an appropriate color design for the film, but the models used in the sequence are laughable. Still, 30 seconds out of a 90 minute movie is easy enough to excuse. The intro also utilized CGI, but surprisingly it worked well. It also really goes to show the degree to which Dezaki was willing to use this film as a playground for experimentation in animation. It is also worth mentioning that while structurally it is mostly successful there is an argument to be made for it overloading the story while new elements in the final third, which does make it seem like certain elements from the manga were thrown in just for the sake of appeasing fans, although it made the film less effective than it could have been.Finally, there is the thematic core of the film. In aphorism 146 of ‘Beyond Good and Evil’ Friedrich Nietzsche stated that “He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.” And nothing could more accurately convey the philosophical underpinnings of this meditation on human evil and resentiment.The main antagonist Dawson lost his son to Golgo, and the plot is based around Dawson’s attempt at revenge against Golgo. Golgo may be a monster, but he is an empty one, he is less than human. In contrast Dawson is the one who shows immensely human emotional outbursts and is constantly in a frenzy of pain and hatred throughout the film. Dawson becomes a far more horrifying monster than Golgo because of how human and relateable he is in his emotional agony, resentiment, and his need for revenge, and through his actions he winds up as even more empty and despicable than the man who he initially felt righteous indignation towards. Anyone who has comprehended the monstrous actions and attitudes of ""righteous victims"" throughout history and in our current historical moment will understand how much truth this message conveys.Golgo 13 is to my understanding the highest selling manga of all time, with its main demographic being an older male audience. It is something of a cult classic that has never really broken into the North American market. I cannot speak for the rest of the franchise, but Dezaki has caught my interest in the franchise through this flim.

The directing, the shot composition, and the art itself all being excellent. The first 20 minutes of this movie is a solid 8 or 9, and then the integrity of the script starts to crumble almost immidiately.I'm always put off when a stoic character like Golgo or Max Payne shacks up with someone they've just met, it always seemed to me as if they were betraying their character. So, as you could imagine, it always perplexed me whenever one of the 'once every five second' sex scenes...popped up completely out of nowhere and ran over the pacing of the movie like a puppy being hit by a lawnmower. But I was able to ignore that, seeing as it was a personal peeve and I was able to find the rest of the scenes rather enjoyable.Now, I would like to think I have a lot of patience for silliness and wacky scenes in media. I can get over strange things happening IF the series is based in a fictitious world that allows for fantasy elements such as a stupid snake man that chews the scenery like a baseball player would chew tobacco... However, the world that was set up for us in this movie seems to be one steeped in realism, judging by the first half hour; in which Golgo executes targets in beautifully directed scenes where bullets rip through their targets leaving them dead and gone from this world, and everyone around them in a state of shock and horror.Judging from the last scentance I've just wrote, you can see why I'd be a little fucking surprised when a scene happens in which a man is crucified to a wall by knives and Golgo is attacked by his killers, who just so happen to be the three stooges of the cia, they all have their very own wacky gimick and near-comedic facial expression. This is then followed up by the church being absolutely obliterated by machine gun fire and collapsing, presumedly killing everyone inside... Though, five seconds later we see Golgo going for a dip and he appears to be safe and sound.The next scene is when I flat out began to laugh at this movie. Golgo's informant is killed by a strange looking man in a way I can't even describe, blood just seems to fly from around his neck for no reason I can fathom. This strange man is then introduced as 'big snake', a big tall bastard who slithers everywhere and is super fast or whatever. This scene is followed up by the three amigos from earlier rocking up and getting bodied by this guy in a way that doesn't fit the tone of everything I've seen up to this point, and it was at that point that I turned the movie off. Big snake molesting the widow was the last straw and I just kind of gave up. I wouldn't care about a lot of this stuff if the first 20 minutes weren't so engaging. popped up completely out of nowhere and ran over the pacing of the movie like a puppy being hit by a lawnmower.

Now that I’ve finished this movie I can say that was probably only meant chronologically and should be changed since I doubt there’s any continuity, but I don’t regret my less common starting place. In this 1983 film, the professional assassin Duke Togo AKA “Golgo 13” is hired to kill the son of a wealthy oil baron. However, Golgo 13 has gone in over his head this time...as the father is mad with revenge over his son’s death, and the sniper soon finds himself under pursuit from one of the country’s wealthiest men who has even bought out the CIA and the Pentagon.Golgo 13 is a very simple concept. It’s an episodic format that takes the audience through the multiple hits of a legendary hitman who can do the impossible without fail. Despite Golgo 13’s impeccable skill, he does take damage and pain from his jobs to remind us that he’s human, and so there’s always some curiosity and admiration regarding how he’s going to get himself out of such dangerous scenarios even though we know he’s going to succeed in the end. Golgo 13 isn’t a complex character himself, a near mute man who is almost always wearing a poker face even when having sex with the countless women who instantly throw their clothes off for him (which makes the sex scenes just as hilarious as it sounds). But this basic premise belies what’s so appealing about this movie.Simply put, Golgo 13: The Professional has marvelous style. It’s a product of its time in the best possible way. Not because of common techniques of its decade, but rather an idiosyncratic style of direction that comes from a different pop culture head space than anything that someone would create now. It’s a movie that’s quintessentially 80s but twists that notion further to become something just weird enough to stand out among its time and also still possess a lot of character today. The movie’s opening consists of a bunch of images of computer-generated skeletons spinning around revolvers in strange poses that include holding their own head among other Halloween favorites. On a surface level it’s technically primitive CG being used for the sake of appearing modern that you can find in a lot of old animated movies, but this archaic charm only magnifies the weirdness of what it's actually constructing. The creepy macabre skeleton imagery that doesn’t fit in at all with the rest of the movie’s images, all juxtaposed with female-sung Japanese pop song that repeatedly says “pray for me” in English.Golgo 13 is a basic immortal assassin badass surrounded by a strange cinematic world that’s a perfect fit for the actual hyper-intense writing. The movie loves to use constantly shifting diagonal shots and inconsistently used editing techniques that add to the off-kilter narrative of insane violence and insane people. Golgo 13 is portrayed in a super serious hyper-realistic manner and yet he sometimes finds himself up against unexplained super mutant humans with randomly hideous appearances and abilities. One of which rapes a woman into losing her mind after he follows her around a locked room with corded desk lamp with a multi-colored glass shade that creates the only light in the pitch black room. There’s so much eccentricity to this movie that gives it a surreal nature, and in general it likes to play with a lot of contrasting 80s bright flashes of colored light added during editing that contrast with the heavily shaded comic book look that really accentuate certain details of scenes.There’s another scene where Golgo 13 has to fight off several men, but while this is happening footage is intercut of a woman peacefully swimming nude by herself in a lake while soft synthetic music plays uninterrupted during both the serene and violent parts. Golgo 13’s first hit in the movie has him targeting a cruise ship, and on the deck there’s a pool that’s in the shape of a casket where the oil baron’s son falls into after being shot. What seems like subtle symbolism takes on an even more clever meaning with the rest of the movie’s plot. There’s a part where a man falls from the top of a skyscraper, and this fall is portrayed in slow motion while gentle nostalgic ambiance plays and the camera rotates around him from several angles to give the real impact of just how far he’s falling, both literally and figuratively. Golgo 13 is extremely well-directed with many memorable frames and quirky techniques and lighting effects to make it all stand out. The movie also frequently uses still manga-like images that are drawn in a darker and more heavily shaded style than the rest of the movie to punctuate the hits of certain action scenes or transition scenes.Over all the action in Golgo 13: The Professional is a downright surreal experience that transcends a typical action movie plot. It’s unpredictably strange and loose with its construction and style while moving slow enough to not draw too much attention to itself. It’s a cool, acidic burn whose style drips off of it rather than burst outwards. It’s a lot of fun when it comes to its story and action, and charmingly unorthodox when it comes to its style that’s a mix of intelligent craftsmanship and strange 80s kitsch. While not a universal classic, it’s a movie that deserves more than historical respect and stands out today if you look at it with a curious lens. as the father is mad with revenge over his son’s death, and the sniper soon finds himself under pursuit from one of the country’s wealthiest men who has even bought out the CIA and the Pentagon.Golgo 13 is a very simple concept.

The art is beautiful, a refelction of why we watch anime to this day. The simplistic beauty is enhanced by vibrant colors. But I want to take a moment to mention the soundtrack. I love the soundtrack to this film. It is the reason I started paying attention to who does the music in anime. It's 70's tyle stoic badassness and that's what makes it great. Only... having seen it dozens of times I can say watching it now; it's not really enthralling me....Also it's NC-17 by today's standards. So it's not for those whose triggers require warnings.  Other than that, it's nostagia of the era that earne anime it's reputation for sex and violence. Bonus, today's the first time I've seen the James Bond esque opening sequence for this film.

Great characters in this. if your a woman,or womanly man, stick to your new jap animation for little kids, but if your a man, watch this on youtube, right about now... peace ', ""Golgo 13: The Professional.To me, its was The Eighties: The Anime.Golgo 13, an assassin who lives by a samurai code and never breaks his word, shoots his way through a Sicilian mafia and uncovers that a mysterious organisation is trying to put him 6 feet into the ground. He's a mix of James Bond and Agent 47, which makes him even more badass.This movie has all the action you could wish for, and more. He pulls off seemingly impossible shots with his rifle, gets into fistfights with special forces and extremely sinister villains, engages in high speed car chases where he drifts round the...streets of San Francisco, and makes love to several women whilst saxophones perform a romantic rendition in the background.All this whilst the art is gorgeously drawn, no shots are the same as Golgo 13 stoicly fights through the movie from beginning to end. However, there are some flaws to this movie.There's the worst CGI scene I've ever witnessed near the end of the spectacle which ruined my immersion completely. I couldn't help but laugh at how out of place the CGI was. Did they run out of money for that scene or something?Another flaw was that they had spent the entire movie building up the 3 counter assassins who seemed impossible to kill and has Golgo 13 dispatch of them within minutes. On one hand, it does show how invulnerable Golgo is, but on the other hand it does leave me and possibly a lot of other people underwhelmed by how easily they were killed.All in all, this is a great movie to watch despite the flaws if you're big on action, mystery and maybe even romance and love the eighties as a decade. streets of San Francisco, and makes love to several women whilst saxophones perform a romantic rendition in the background.All this whilst the art is gorgeously drawn, no shots are the same as Golgo 13 stoicly fights through the movie from beginning to end.

On one hand, it does show how invulnerable Golgo is, but on the other hand it does leave me and possibly a lot of other people underwhelmed by how easily they were killed.All in all, this is a great movie to watch despite the flaws if you're big on action, mystery and maybe even romance and love the eighties as a decade."", 'Golgo 13 is a man among men. He is slick, hard faced and brutal, and only goes by his rules. He is an assassin for hire, and he\'s very good at his job. His latest venture has him going after a mafia boss lord named Dr. Z, after killing a mans entire family Golgo is hired by him to take out the entire organization. But once he gets involved with Dr. Z\'s daughter Cindy, a lushes goddess of a women who, like many other women, fall into his spell. But it seems Golgo\'s past is catching up to him, as he is being tracked down...by one assassin after another. From the mysterious and evil Gold and Silver, to the ruthless and bizarre Snake.

Golgo 13 is a bad ass, someone James Bond should inspire to be, in fact, he kind of reminds me of how James Bond should be. A cold killer with an unknown background. The film itself looks and feels like an 80\'s anime, with classic music and beautifully hand drawn animation. Everything from the city skyscrapers to the facial expressions of the very realistic characters. These aren\'t your big eyed, goofy looking ""cartoon"" anime characters. These look like real, chiseled people it\'s really quite extraordinary.A fun action film that doesn\'t hold back, another prime example of how anime isn\'t your child\'s cartoons. This film is full of bullet frenzy, head exploding violence with fully naked women and all. But I dug it a lot, its like one of those VHS tapes at Blockbuster way back when, with their anime section that actually had, mature adult anime.

Duke Togo is still among my top 10 in terms of very dark anti-hero's and he is a big reason why Golgo 13 left such a big impression on me.The story is pretty simple Golgo 13, an assassin for hire, is contracted to kill the son of a big oil tycoon. As a result, the tables turn on the assassin and it all goes downhill from there.It's important to note the the art style...is dated and while other animations at those times stand up well, Golgo 13's unfortunately does not. The animation does have its moments but there were to many unforgivable still shots and often time shoddy animations that could have been done SO much better to relay what was happening at the moment.That being said, its a small complaint for much of what I felt was such a dark anime and what keeps me compelled is mainly the comparisons of both the antagonist and protagonist.The main character Duke is the assassin that you expect an assassin to be, an emotionless individual who understands entirely that death comes with the job, even with that being said, some of his actions gave me pause and in some ways were very unexpected. After all, I had no clue what kind of man Duke really was but you definitely find out by the end of the film.Giving the act of Duke's assassination, you may start the anime off championing the cause of the antagonist oil tycoon but as the story progresses the character may sway you in ways that your not going to believe. By the end of the film you are left to question who was truly the more righteous of the two and it is one of the main reasons why I enjoy the film the most.As far as the sound track goes, it's your generic 90's anime fare ,something that I've always adored and never had a complaint for.Overall I enjoyed this movie and have re-watched it several times hoping to pick something else up I might have missed out on. This to me is still the best Golgo anime out of anything that has been made which is a shame because Duke is such an intriguing character to me and I would have jumped at the chance to see him at his most vulnerable moment if the manga did in fact have an arc that captured that.This film seems like it was close to vulnerable as it was going to get from the main character...and that is not really saying much as you will find out when you watch. is dated and while other animations at those times stand up well, Golgo 13's unfortunately does not.

However remember not to judge this one as harshly as the anime you may see in the 2000s, as the animation is a bit dated and janky.The music is fantastic and very 80s though.

Duke Togo is an absolute bad-ass, the story is excellent, and the villains are memorable and bizarre (the snake guy seemed like he\'d be more at home in a horror flick, yet it worked). There\'s also kick-ass dialogue like a woman telling Duke ""why don\'t you pull my trigger sometime?"" You can\'t beat that!

Duke Togou is a legendary assassin who kills Robert Dawson, the son of a very wealthy man named Leonard Dawson. Leonard now seeks revenge and is filled with a burning desire to have Duke dead at all costs. Simple, but it has details that make it interesting and make it work very well. The pacing is also really fast, a lot happens within a short time span, yet the film never feels rushed.Characters - 7 I'm going to be frank here. Duke Togou is a...tad bit boring as a character, and we know nothing about him. No background, no motivation, hell, we don't even know basic things like what his likes and dislikes are. And according to some people, the manga doesn't give us this information either. However, there's something about him that gives him this certain edge. Despite the lack of information, he's still badass. Maybe it's his cool, stoic nature?I think that the driving factor in terms of characters in this film actually resides in the main antagonist, Leonard Dawson. His blind rage over the death of his son overrides everything that is important to him and his wrath pushes him to traverse into heinousness and make desperate attempts to kill Duke that are both morally and legally wrong. Even he comes to realize this. I personally think of him as one of the better antagonists in anime.Visuals - 9 The film truly shines in this regard. Apart from looking fantastic, the visuals are some of the most innovative you'll ever come across in the medium. There are a ton of techniques and ideas used here, such as the first implementation of CGI ever used in anime (I think), the postcard technique where animation transitions into stills, and the staggering number of things they do with the lighting. The film came off as rather experimental.Audio: 7.5 The music in this film is really damn good and does a great job at setting the mood and atmosphere while standing out (although there are a few scenes that don't mix very well); with its soundtrack comprising of rock, pop, and jazz, it stands out as unique.Overall: This is a very fun and entertaining action film with some of the coolest and cutting-edge visuals you'll ever find. Simple plot, but filled with tons of awesome stuff and excellent execution!O Score: 7.25/10S Score: 9/10Final Score: 8.125/10 rounded to 8/10 for MAL score. tad bit boring as a character, and we know nothing about him.

Then, you got Golgo 13.The first aspect that calls your look, is the animation, the fucking animation, man. Honestly, it looks awesome, they got this camera plans that make the action more bombastic, the movements of the cars, the destruction, all looks incredible, and in general, it has a very good direction. That was the strongest point of the movie: it's direction, now, in terms of characters, they are simple, and you can perfectly forget them, but luckily, the movie is more centered in the protagonist, which is more memorable than the secondaryes, but not the best that the movie could had, come on, it could be better, he is more a plot device than a character.And I left the story for the end: It's simple, really, it's very simple, but it's well done. The final plot twist hits hard, and plus, the direction makes it even more epic, but thats all the good stuff, the rest of the movie is Golgo killing random people, while other characters hire asssasins and soldiers to kill him, in certain parts of the movie, this feels like filling content, so it's not so good. But yeah, if you are wanting to see a simple movie, with and story thats easy to catch, a magnificent direction and a well done plot twist, then this is your movie.

It does well to establish that he\'s all of those things without dwelling on it for too long or trying too hard to drive that point home.

The animation what there is of it in not much better than a Hanna-Barbera cartoon, most of the time this looks like a 'kinetic novel' rather than an animated movie. There is one scene in the movie that is straight out of a video game, at least it looks like it, and takes you out of the movie entirely, WTF? There are a bunch of sex scenes at the beginning of the movie, that have nothing to do with the plot. And how are these women getting so excited by a...man who just lays there unemotional?

Then there is the simplistic, confusing, overly complicated plot, it's ridiculous, especially since we don't know the reasons until the end of the movie, and they are really stupid.

Golgo 13: The Professional is still a great action movie in my opinion. Duke Togo aka Golgo 13 is one of my favorite anime and manga characters ever because he is a total badass. Golgo 13 is like combining James Bond and Django Reinhardt into one awesome macho character. I have seen people criticize Duke Togo for having no personality and I disagree with that. I love that Duke Togo is silent but deadly. It makes him even more awesome with the fascinating aura...of mystery around the character. Duke Togo is a human grim reaper when he is on screen. When you make contact with him, you know that you're already dead. He never misses his target by killing them in a single shot. You know you're already dead when you make contact with him. He never misses a target since he kills them with one shot. Golgo 13 was killing people in one strike before Saitama made it cool.Duke Togo is overflowing with testosterone. When you watch this movie, you will grow body hair and an extra set of testicles (an extra pair for men). Duke Togo is a lady's man who can chew bubblegum and kick-ass at the same time.I miss the days when we had action heroes like these (not just anime & manga). Except for John Wick and a few others, I believe that today's action heroes lack the fun and badass nature that older action heroes possessed. Every scene in Golgo 13: The Professional is brilliantly animated, and the animation is outstanding. When animating his films, Osamu Dezaki was known for his meticulous attention to detail.When watching Golgo 13: The Professional, you can see every tiny bit of detail on the guns, clothes, backgrounds, etc. The animation is very stylistic with the characters looking more realistic than most anime do. The character designs don't look like most typical anime and manga characters in my opinion. Golgo 13: The Professional is known to be one of the first anime films to use CGI. You have a small scene of CGI that looks laughable by today's standers. Back in 1983, it was state of the art. You get plenty of testosterone-fueled action scenes and gory violence that are satisfying to watch. The jazzy soundtrack and the sleazy atmosphere adds more icing to the cake. Duke Togo is voiced by the legendary Tetsurô Sagawa (RIP) and his voice is perfect in my opinion. Even the dub from Streamline Pictures is solid, and it is probably one of their best dubs next to their dub for Wicked City (1987) in my opinion.Golgo 13: The Professional has a dark, and mature story that deals with the obsession with revenge. You get to see how human misery affects everyone, not just the individual person. The primary villain, Leonard Dawson, begins to push his thirst for vengeance to the point where it backfires on him. You have a fun cast of supporting characters that, in my opinion, are memorable. Snake, Gold, and Silver have always impressed me as interesting villains. Duke Togo is pushed to the ground by the battle between those guys because it demonstrates that he is not invincible. Duke Togo is a very tough man, yet he is still a human being. He can still be killed in the same way that any other human would. It allows the film to place Duke Togo in a dangerous situation, leaving the audience to wonder how he will survive.Overall, Golgo 13: The Professional is a great movie that I highly recommend checking it out. Even those who aren't fans of anime will likely enjoy it. Rating: 9/10 of mystery around the character. Duke Togo is a human grim reaper when he is on screen.

The character designs don't look like most typical anime and manga characters in my opinion. Golgo 13: The Professional is known to be one of the first anime films to use CGI. You have a small scene of CGI that looks laughable by today's standers. Back in 1983, it was state of the art. You get plenty of testosterone-fueled action scenes and gory violence that are satisfying to watch. The jazzy soundtrack and the sleazy atmosphere adds more icing to the cake. Duke Togo is voiced by the legendary Tetsurô Sagawa (RIP) and his voice is perfect in my opinion. Even the dub from Streamline Pictures is solid, and it is probably one of their best dubs next to their dub for Wicked City (1987) in my opinion.Golgo 13: The Professional has a dark, and mature story that deals with the obsession with revenge. You get to see how human misery affects everyone, not just the individual person. The primary villain, Leonard Dawson, begins to push his thirst for vengeance to the point where it backfires on him. You have a fun cast of supporting characters that, in my opinion, are memorable. Snake, Gold, and Silver have always impressed me as interesting villains. Duke Togo is pushed to the ground by the battle between those guys because it demonstrates that he is not invincible. Duke Togo is a very tough man, yet he is still a human being. He can still be killed in the same way that any other human would. It allows the film to place Duke Togo in a dangerous situation, leaving the audience to wonder how he will survive.Overall, Golgo 13: The Professional is a great movie that I highly recommend checking it out. Even those who aren't fans of anime will likely enjoy it. Rating: 9/10"", ""I am a kid of the 80's and I truly take a lot of pride in that. One of the biggest and most positive things I take out of my childhood as an 80's kid is having the opportunity to watch a lot of ultra-violent r rated action movies and experiencing these movies at such a young age really helped me define what I love about action films even to this very day and I have an incredibly strong opinion that action movies tend to exceed their expectations when they're allowed hit the r rating as a bare minimum because they have the creative freedom...that when you want a enjoyable action story you can't shy away from the graphic nature that comes with showcasing violence. However, when you find the perfect balance of showcasing violence and the many things that gives an r rated film it's reputation (nudity, profanity, and drugs/alcohol) with a very engaging story then it is the very pinnacle of action storytelling because you give the viewer what they want with regards to the shallow aspects of what r rated action cinema provides but you also keep them engaged with a very compelling story that can leave nothing but a positive viewing experience which is what happened to me. This is why The Professional - Golgo 13 is such an important anime film to me and why even to this day it's one of my favourite anime films of all time.Despite the fact that Golgo 13 is the longest manga currently in production and there have been quite a few films (live action/anime) and a few anime series that have been made of this character, this film is my only experience with Golgo 13 thus far.The character of Golgo 13 is a professional hit-man that is hired to perform assassinations all around the world and has earned the reputation of being the most dangerous assassin in the world and there is no assignment too dangerous that he will take on as long as the price is right.The story of The Professional - Golgo 13 focuses on how the assassination of a oil billionaire's son brings the wrath of a power hungry father and how he is willing to use the American government (CIA, Pentagon, and the FBI) and all of the weapons at its disposal towards Golgo 13 in order to avenge the death of his son while slowly losing his sanity in the process.One thing you do have to take into consideration with regards to this film is that while it may be easy to determine who the heroes and the villains are in this movie. Golgo 13 himself is not portrayed as a hero in this film and rightly so - he is more portrayed as an anti-hero in this film. He is not a character to be respected or admired, but yet he is a victim of pure circumstance for just doing his job. He is an incredibly cold, calculated, and unfeeling person and has no interest in pursuing close personal relationships with people despite the fact that he has many sexual relationships with many women throughout this film. Even though he is the main character in this film he actually speaks very little dialog throughout the film. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the film does a really fine job of in the very beginning of making you feel sad about the Oil Tycoon (Leonard Dawson) mourning the loss of his son (Richard Dawson) with some incredibly beautiful emotionally driven dialog but as you get to know the character more and more and see the disgusting length's he is willing to go to kill the assassin (such as using members of his own family to help fulfill his mission), you start to lose respect for the oil tycoon through his disgusting behavior. However, the film does something incredibly powerful that by the time film reaches its proper conclusion and the chaos ends in Golgo 13's life you almost feel a sense of understandable pity towards Leonard Dawson once you find out why the assassination against his son occurred and it's one of the most surprising and effective moments in the entire film.There are several things why this film is so incredibly powerful and so incredibly timeless. First of all, the animation in this film is absolutely beautiful because every detail of animation is painstakingly drawn with an incredibly amount of detail but yet retains this very rustic and old fashioned feel to it. All the weapons, cars, and the characters are drawn with such professionalism and so much emotion is put into many of character's eyes and faces. There are many scenes throughout this anime film where the animation stops for a moment and transitions into a palette of really detailed hand-drawn art that adds an incredible amount of depth into this film especially when it hits a specific musical cue. The music in this film is incredibly beautiful because it uses a lot of beautiful jazzy tracks through the majority of the film, but it ramps up the music when some of the beautiful tense action set pieces are present but every piece of music throughout this film is expertly placed and fits each scene perfectly. This is film is also revolutionary for it's time because as far as I know it's the first animated Japanese film to use CGI. It was used when attack helicopters were used to attack Golgo 13 during the conclusion of the film in Leonard Dawson's tower. The CGI is incredibly crude if you try to watch the film now, but back then it was quite revolutionary. Some people may fault the film for this because it does take away for a few moments the beautiful hand drawn animation this film exemplifies but for me personally it was an excellent piece of nostalgia and it never really hampered my love for the film overall, but I will agree that it's definitely not needed and it can be off-putting to some people.You can't really talk about this film without really addressing one of the things that this film is known for which is the amount of violence and nudity that this film has because it literally has a metric ton of it but it's one of those films that I personally feel that it's absolutely needed to keep things visceral and entertaining. This film has a very sleazy feel to it, but it is a product of it's time - it's a true testament of how brutal and unapologetic things are in the life of an assassin and you can't really sugarcoat it. If you want your film to be memorable, if you want your film to be visceral you can't be afraid to show the sleaziness of the criminal underbelly and how incredibly violent the life of a hired gun can be. Just about every death in the film is graphically violent regardless if it comes from Golgo 13 himself or the many villains that are dispatched in order to kill Golgo 13. You get to see bullets pierce through human skulls in very detailed fashion and even when it comes to some of the more hand to hand kills you get to see sharp bladed weapons cut through human flesh with an incredible amount of precision and detail and these deaths tend to be some of the most incredibly detailed throughout the entire film. You can almost feel it through your very bones on how many painful some of these deaths are. The film is certainly not afraid to show blood and in some cases it really goes out of it's way to show you way too much blood but it's almost needed for a film of this nature. Despite no matter how many enemies Golgo 13 dispatches, Golgo 13 suffers his share of losses as well with some of his friends and informants suffering very gruesome deaths from the many assassins that Leonard Dawson sends to dispatch Golgo 13. One thing I do appreciate with regards to the anti-hero of this film is that despite his skill level - he is never truly invincible and he suffers a lot of wounds and damage throughout this entire endeavor. He needs time to recover which it does show him recovering in the film and you often wonder how he is still able to fight after having all this damage done to him.The film does take a long time to establish it's overarching plot point. It doesn't really start to develop the overall plot until roughly halfway through the film with little hints dropped through the first half that something more sinister is happening behind the scenes. The first half of the film focuses on Golgo 13 performing assassination jobs that have no relation towards the overall plot of the anime such as taking on a high ranking leader to a mafia crime family to performing a seemingly impossible shot in order to assassinate a high ranking nazi officer. Even though these assassinations have nothing to do with the overall plot of this film's story they offer some of the most entertaining action set pieces of the entire film and they're incredibly fun to watch especially when your trying to figure out how Golgo 13 is going to perform these assassinations through insurmountable odds.I really have to praise the film for putting a lot of detail into the many villains that this film has because for the most part many of the villains have excellent individualistic characteristics that make for excellent adversaries against Golgo 13 and some of these villains don't even speak one sentence of dialogue and it is because of that; their allure and presence are enough to make them incredibly memorable. You have villains such as the American Special Forces, Bragan, Dr. Z, Snake, Gold & Silver, and of course Leonard Dawson. The funny thing is each of this villains have a way of doing damage of Golgo 13 - whether by emotionally manipulating him or hurting him physically in some way. When it comes with comic book films I often have a problem when a movie tries to interject as many villains as humanly possibly - but one thing this film does right is many of the villains have the right amount of screen time and they never overstay their welcome throughout the entire film. They establish their presence and they have their moments to show how truly dangerous they are and in a film such as this, that is all that is needed in order for their presence to be felt throughout this entire film.As a lifelong fan of English dubbing, this film has one of my top 5 favorite English dubs of all time. There are a lot of English voice acting pioneers in this film with a lot of them putting an insane amount of effort into the roles they were put in. I really have to give credit to Michael McConnohie as being the voice of Leonard Dawson for giving an incredibly layered acting performance by making the audience feel both pity and disgust for him throughout the entire film. There is not one weak English performance throughout the entire film and you can tell a lot of effort was put into each and every role. Leonard Dawson by far has some of the most powerful dialogue in the entire film - I especially have a lot of fondness for his monologue when he talks about asking for the release of Gold & Silver in order for him to do his bidding with regards to killing Golgo 13.In conclusion I love this film because it ticks all the boxes on what I want out of a gory unapologetic action film, but this film is not for everybody and I can say that with extreme confidence because it does have a lot of uncomfortable scenes such as rape and extreme acts of violence. If your willing to look past the gratuitous amounts of violence you will actually see a very compelling, very beautifully animated and well acted piece of action cinema that has an important place in my violent action packed film heart. that when you want a enjoyable action story you can't shy away from the graphic nature that comes with showcasing violence.

Do you want something at the end of the week to look forward to?Hinako Note was just that thing. Spring season is at the end of the school year and a busy time for people who work. At the end of every week I sit down to enjoy this lovely show that whispers to my soul ""everything is all right"" and pumps me with energy for the coming week.Why would anyone expect something other than light hearted comedy with very cute girls after reading the synopsis and looking at the...poster of the anime. It is very clear as to what expect from this anime and it delivers more than what\'s expected.Story 9/10Watch, enjoy and cheer for our adorable Hinako who struggles to get over her shyness and try to become a theatre actress.

The potential for a good cute girl show was there, but it really needed a redraft or more editorial oversight to achieve it.It's not easy starting again in a new city. It's even harder for Hinako, a girl whose social anxiety makes her freeze like a scarecrow when approached by strangers. It wasn't as bad in the countryside, where having a human scarecrow to attract animals away from fields was useful. But...it won't do her much good in Tokyo.Yet that's partly what drew her there, because she has come up with a solution to overcoming her shyness: acting. After meeting her new house mates – the book-eating Kuina, maid dressing Mayuki & landlady Chiaki – they resolve to form an acting troupe to bring more customers to Chiaki's cafe & maybe even perform on a famous stage. That is if they can find time between all the other cute girl shenanigans they get up to.At the start, Hinako Note seems like it will be a spin on the cute girls running a shop set-up that proved popular in Is This Order a Rabbit? There's both a bookshop & a café to split time between, as well as a high school & threatre club – where they meet the final main member of the group; the bratty Yua. However, it flits between settings with abandon, leaving things feeling unfocused & unconnected, particularly as it becomes increasingly episodic. It's almost as though the original author couldn't pick one cute girl location, so tried to have all of them.It also has the effect of making Hinako's progression towards overcoming her shyness feel disjointed. The idea is that the acting will cause her to gradually gain in self-confidence so that she no longer freezes when talking to people, which is what happens – twice. While the show generally does a fine job showing her friendships develop over time, her own shyness increasingly seems to come & go when it's convenient.One might expect it to have been structured such that, for example, she starts off barely able to talk & ends giving the leading performance on the big stage, symbolising her finally overcoming her anxiety. Alternatively, it could have gradually dropped the idea altogether, perhaps shifting the theme from overcoming your weaknesses to accepting them & finding people who accept you for who you are. Instead it peaks & troughs throughout the series, with apparent breakthroughs being followed by a return to the scarecrow pose the next time it's funny.But in some ways that's to be expected, given how the show evolves over its runtime. While it starts out looking like an ensemble anime, all about the importance of friendship & the various relationships between the characters; by about episode six it increasingly seems more about waifu worship & how great Hinako is. Ditsy, vulnerable & air-headed yet also amazing & perfectly proportioned, Hinako quickly becomes the centre of almost everything happening around her. She may not be every viewers favourite character, but she clearly is the director's, it becoming rather eye-rolling by the time a clamshell pillow has been added to her bath scenes like she's some sort of discount Venus.There is some indication that this is all meant to be presented from Hinako's point of view. A notebook, presumably Hinako's, is often used as the image to break up segments of the show, perhaps suggesting this is all being taken from her diary (clue is in the name, I suppose). But while that may somewhat explain why the show focuses on her, it doesn't explain the things about her it focuses on.To be fair, all of them get a degree of back story & time to further distinguish themselves as characters, though it all feels a bit predictable.

She eats paper & dresses in animal onesies, quirks compensating for lack of character.As if wanting to visually parallel this shift, there is progressively more fan-service as the series goes on, particularly once it's revealed what a great body Hinako has. There are two or three of what might be charitably called dress-up episodes, with each one seeing characters striking progressively more risqué poses. The incidental pervy cuts become increasingly so, with body pans escalating to close-ups of T&A while the images used for the next episode previews become increasingly fetishistic - one being of Kuina licking Hinako's foot. A degree of this is to be expected in cute girl shows, but at times Hinako's Note ramps it up to sex comedy levels despite never being one; the lewd parts never feeling in character or particularly connected with what else is going on.Oh & since important industry types undoubtedly read every MAL review, I have a request: Please stop using moo sounds to indicate big breasts are on screen. Please, just stop.Of course, if this sounds like your kind of thing, then Hinako Note's production does a fine job presenting it. It looks & sounds pretty much as you'd expect, with suitably bright & colourful images, standard but appealing character designs & an upbeat, whimsical soundtrack. There were no notable dips in quality, though a minor but noticeable thing is the increasingly static background characters. By the same token, though, it never really excels, with no memorable animation sequences or the like. The OP & ED are somewhat notable for being the type of music that goes through multiple key & time signature changes, creating a sort of bubbly, schizophrenic mashup of cute girl sounds, unfortunately accompanied by some rather lacklustre dance routines.There are some good things in Hinako Note. The characters are likeable, if not utilised to their full potential & some episodes deliver good enough cute girl antics. But it never manages to hold its focus on any one of its ideas for long, even as the camera increasingly focused on the characters vital assets. An okayish show that needed more editorial oversight to become a good one.& I didn't even mention the busty 9 year old club advisor. it won't do her much good in Tokyo.Yet that's partly what drew her there, because she has come up with a solution to overcoming her shyness: acting. After meeting her new house mates – the book-eating Kuina, maid dressing Mayuki & landlady Chiaki – they resolve to form an acting troupe to bring more customers to Chiaki's cafe & maybe even perform on a famous stage. That is if they can find time between all the other cute girl shenanigans they get up to.At the start, Hinako Note seems like it will be a spin on the cute girls running a shop set-up that proved popular in Is This Order a Rabbit? There's both a bookshop & a café to split time between, as well as a high school & threatre club – where they meet the final main member of the group; the bratty Yua. However, it flits between settings with abandon, leaving things feeling unfocused & unconnected, particularly as it becomes increasingly episodic. It's almost as though the original author couldn't pick one cute girl location, so tried to have all of them.It also has the effect of making Hinako's progression towards overcoming her shyness feel disjointed. The idea is that the acting will cause her to gradually gain in self-confidence so that she no longer freezes when talking to people, which is what happens – twice. While the show generally does a fine job showing her friendships develop over time, her own shyness increasingly seems to come & go when it's convenient.One might expect it to have been structured such that, for example, she starts off barely able to talk & ends giving the leading performance on the big stage, symbolising her finally overcoming her anxiety. Alternatively, it could have gradually dropped the idea altogether, perhaps shifting the theme from overcoming your weaknesses to accepting them & finding people who accept you for who you are. Instead it peaks & troughs throughout the series, with apparent breakthroughs being followed by a return to the scarecrow pose the next time it's funny.But in some ways that's to be expected, given how the show evolves over its runtime.

This site\'s rating system seems to suggest ""mediocre"" is actually awful, since only truly awful shows have an average rating around 5.  If you\'re confused as to what the word, ""mediocre,"" actually means, I invite you to watch this show.  You will come to understand.The mediocrity starts with the characters.  If you\'ve watched a show of the ""cute girls doing cute things"" or ""moeblob slice of life"" genre before, you\'ll know these are exactly the...sort of characters these shows are expected to have.  There\'s a painfully shy one, a younger-looking girl in a maid uniform who\'s actually their senior, a pastiche of every tsundere ever, a big eater who makes catlike expressions, and on and on.  Some of them seem to be direct knockoffs of characters in other shows.  Despite the derivative nature, their designs are appealing.  The characters themselves are endearing in their own way.  Unfortunately, some of them stretch suspension of disbelief needlessly.  Let\'s put aside the question of the club advisor for now, as I\'m assuming her age is a lie until proven otherwise, but why is the landlady a first-year high school girl?  Well, obviously, it\'s so they can all go to high school together.The setting is probably the worst thing about this show.  We don\'t see enough of the school for it to feel like a real place.  It feels tacked on and unnecessary.  GochiUsa just had the characters living and/or working together, and that was enough.  We have that same setup here, with the main characters living together in a used bookstore which is also a dormitory which is also a coffee shop.  Why a coffee shop?  Because GochiUsa did it, and because it creates an excuse for a maid-like outfit.  The home/work setting feels like an actual place, but it still feels a bit artificial.  Where\'s the kitchen?  There are rarely any customers.  When there are scenes on the nearby streets, there are never any cars and barely any pedestrians.  It\'s sort of odd, because the background work is pretty decent.The show\'s artwork and animation is acceptable at the least.  We don\'t have obvious mistakes like inconsistent border thicknesses, unerased lines, or jarring CGI, just to name a few I\'ve seen in the last couple of seasons.  Actually, for the genre, this seems to have above average production values.  The OP/ED are fully animated, and even include a dance which presumably took a significant amount of animator effort.  There\'s a fair amount of superdeformed art, but it seems like a deliberate decision because they thought it would be cuter, or more expressive, rather than a cost-cutting measure.  There is one weird inconsistency, though.  Since Hinako seems to be the primary fanservice vehicle, she has a wide variance in bust size in particular.  This can happen mid-scene, and it\'s oddly jarring when it does.The sound is the thing I\'m least qualified to comment on.  The music didn\'t make a big impression on me.  I don\'t particularly like the opening theme, since there\'s too much spoken-word dialogue.  It\'s especially annoying because it wasn\'t translated on the site where I watched it.  I thought the voice actors were trying too hard for that high-pitched cutesy sound, but it does match the diabetes-inducing nature of the show, so it isn\'t really out of place.All in all, this show is nothing special.

Since it's my first, I'll get better at doing this in time.As someone who has quite a liking towards moe anime, I found this show fairly alright to watch. Hinako Note was a fairly decent moe slice of life anime. It wasn't really anything standout, but it was overall an alright anime to watch.When I first started this show, I didn't really think I'd like it a lot because it couldn't have felt more generic to me. It felt like the show was trying to be too cute with things like the character having...very high pitched voices and how they would have to turn into chibis to act out small scenes at some point in every single episode, but I thought the show got just a BIT better I kept watching to the end.StoryThe story isn't anything unique or anything it's pretty simple. The main character  Hinako is a shy girl who came from the countryside to move to a cafe/ bookstore called Hitotse so she could attend Fujiyama High School in the city that has a club where she could practice becoming an actress in plays to help boost her confidence with being around and talking to people. When ever she speaks to people at first, she'll freeze up and turn into a scarecrow. To help her topple her fear, her friends at Hitotse decide to help Hinako run a theater trope in the cafe on the side at times.As Hinako moves into the cafe she meets...some generic anime personalities.Kuina: The blue haired girl who has a hefty appetite, eats quite a lot which happens to include books (yes, BOOKS), & will make you think of Konata from Lucky Star.Mayuki, the girl with blonde hair who is supposedly Hinako's senpai being a grade above her, but has trouble with her height as she looks like a loli. She looks and acts like a cute little kid at times, but is reliable as the age she claims to be.Chiaki who'll play the role of the landlady and the popular girl who supposedly looks hot & just so happens to be in the same age range as Hinako and the others so she can go to school with them just because.After Hinako has time in school, she'll meet the girl who eventually tries to become her rival for a very short period of time, but ends up becoming friends with, Yua, a very generic tsundere girl who pretty much likes Chiaki and gets very shy around Chiaki.There's also a girl who happens to run the club Hinako was trying hard to get into named Ruriko: a loli with giant oppai.The art was good, nothing special. You'll notice how low budgeted this show really is after the first few episodes. The flashiest scene in this comes from the opening with 2 short dance like scenes, which looked like the most expensive animation used in the show. As mentioned earlier, assuming it was used to substitute for the low budget, the characters will turn into chibis for short segments of every episode. It seemed like the character templates felt a little wonky to me because they all look like they could be adults (Excluding the short girl Mayuki). The background art for each scene was pretty good though. The scenery was beautiful & one of the best things about the art in this.The sound factor for this was ok. Their voices are high pitched as hell so the point where I couldn't feel even a bit serious while listening to them at first, but I got used to that. The opening wasn't really anything special nor memorable. It's kinda decent, but it couldn't be a more generic opening for a moe slice of life. It actually mimics the OPs from a few shows sneakily like Lucky Stay & Nichijou with the dancing bits. The ED was just a little bit better though, but still pretty bland.With girls working in a cafe & some of their characteristics, the first thing this reminded me of was an alternative cheaper take on GochiUsa. That thought lingered with me for the rest of the show, but it slowly split itself from that route as it seperates itself from the usual moe anime by trying to act TOO kawaii, and even trying to display some sex appeal which isn't something that doesn't feel right with moe sometimes. Throughout the show, they sprinkle some ecchi on it by showing a few shots of the characters (mainly Hinako & Chiaki) with some sketchy outfits and poses & Hinako in the bath a little. When those two get in bathing suits, their oppai suddenly got much larger than they look from the outside layer of their normal clothing. Even a few of the end cards would have some unusual shot for moe anime.It was a pretty generic show overall and I might've given it a five if not for the little extra feeling it soon gave me, as I can't say I didn't enjoy it just a little. Nearing about episode 6, it got more enjoyable to me. It MIGHT give you a reminder of shows mostly like GochiUsa, Yuru Yuri, & Hanayamata while a bit like Anne Happy & Non Non Biyori as well. If you like those shows, then there's a chance you MIGHT enjoy this show. If you're not one for slice of life or moe anime, then I can't say I'd even recommend it for you. very high pitched voices and how they would have to turn into chibis to act out small scenes at some point in every single episode, but I thought the show got just a BIT better I kept watching to the end.StoryThe story isn't anything unique or anything it's pretty simple.

I\'m now on the hunt for more shows of a similar genre.', 'Without even seeing the show, it is undoubtedly a show intended to be adorable and funny. Hinako Note, no doubt, achieves this with its constant shifting between ""normal"" and ""chibi"" artstyle, as well as fitting sound effects and colourful backgrounds. The visual excellence don\'t end there as even their background characters are well designed and are fairly colourful. Overall, Hinako Note\'s visual presentation is peerless. The setting is fairly simple and fitting for the theme. Character interaction is also well-done by having the characters have fair amount of screentime and they also have decent synergy in creating interesting situations.However, despite its wonderful visual presentation,...Hinako Note falls short on several other aspects. For one, the genre of slice of life is already relatively slow. Comparing it to action, mystery or drama, slice of life in itself generally is more dialogue heavy and it needs to be extra creative to spark interest. Hinako Note does have its interesting moments, but it is pretty dialogue heavy in addition to the slow-paced nature of the genre. This leads to a lack of action and movement and where action is needed, scenes are usually rushed. Rather than showing where A gets X item, it often jumps to a scene wherein A already has X. While not really wrong, A could have trouble getting X that would produce interesting scenes. Moreover, sometimes the topics get boring and the punchline tends to get repeated with slightly modified set-up and premise. Patient viewers might pass this off and disregard it, but eventually it does get boring. Even the sharpest blades get dull over time. The quirks of some characters aren\'t really used enough. The starkest ones would be Hinako\'s nervousness, Chia\'s bust size, and Mayu\'s childish body frame. Due to that, Yua and Kuina tend to be overshadowed by the others, despite Yua being a fairly determined theater student and Kuina\'s affinity, or appetite rather, for books.As a whole, Hinako Note is not a bad show. Its visual excellence is enough to keep me entertained a bit, but I do find myself getting bored or spacing out. The lack of movement and creativity certainly hurts the show which is disappointing, since the characters have pretty unique quirks. It just goes to show you can\'t always judge a book by its cover.Disclaimer: This is based on my perception of the show, which is most likely not applicable to everyone.

This leads to a lack of action and movement and where action is needed, scenes are usually rushed. Rather than showing where A gets X item, it often jumps to a scene wherein A already has X. While not really wrong, A could have trouble getting X that would produce interesting scenes. Moreover, sometimes the topics get boring and the punchline tends to get repeated with slightly modified set-up and premise. Patient viewers might pass this off and disregard it, but eventually it does get boring. Even the sharpest blades get dull over time. The quirks of some characters aren\'t really used enough. The starkest ones would be Hinako\'s nervousness, Chia\'s bust size, and Mayu\'s childish body frame. Due to that, Yua and Kuina tend to be overshadowed by the others, despite Yua being a fairly determined theater student and Kuina\'s affinity, or appetite rather, for books.As a whole, Hinako Note is not a bad show. Its visual excellence is enough to keep me entertained a bit, but I do find myself getting bored or spacing out. The lack of movement and creativity certainly hurts the show which is disappointing, since the characters have pretty unique quirks. It just goes to show you can\'t always judge a book by its cover.Disclaimer: This is based on my perception of the show, which is most likely not applicable to everyone.', ""So nowadays, every new season, you will see that moe slice of life about cute girls doing cute things. And in winter 2017, Hinako Note is that anime. But is that really a bad thing? For me it's not and if you agree with me, feel free to continue to read my review.So the story is pretty standard, Hinako is a shy girl from the countryside, it seems like the only thing she can do is to be a scarerow in the field since she can be friends with a lot of animals. In an attempt to cure the shyness, Hinako left her peaceful town...to go to school in Tokyo. There she stays in an old book store and meet her new friends and join the drama club to break free from her shell.The anime itself is pretty relaxing, it follows the everyday life of our main cute girls. The episodeds are clique and mostly follow tropes that existed in the medium ages ago.You can find beach episode, valentine episode, school festival episode,... There's really nothing new so you should only watch this anime if you want something relaxing or you particularly enjoy moe animes like me.So clearly, this anime is character-driven, the characters will decide if you like this anime or not. There we have Hinako, a shy and naive girl, she's very unreliable and most of the time, an airhead. Kuina, the same age as Hinako, a genius who can write play, have great memories and and extreme love for food. Chiaki, a beautiful and quiet girl who is the love interest for a lot of other girls.  Mayuki, a cute girl who looks lot younger for her age. Yua, a stundere who like Chiaki and helps Hinako a lot. So as you can see, the characters are nothing new, the interesting thing about them is the chemistry of their interaction. And Hinako got quite development through out the anime. The way she gradually becomes more sociable is fun to watch.The artstyle is pretty standard for moe anime with bright color and cute characters design. I would give it 7/10 cause it actually looks quite beautiful. Along with catchy songs in the op and ed. But there is nothing standout in the soundtracks, it's so-so and forgettable.So overall i give this 6.5/10. I enjoy a relaxing anime even though it dont really have a story. But it's the moe anime of the season and it's actually not very boring to watch i must say. to go to school in Tokyo.

Like how the land lord is going to their highschool and how could a shy girl wear such revealing clothing but can't say thank you to customers? Story moves too fast and seems a little forced at times.But overall the Story is simple and effective. Every episode makes the next episode more desirable. Every time I watch 24 minutes, I'm always hyped up for the next 24 minutes. Especially around episode 4 when it really starts picking up steam.60% of the anime is shown in moe. Every...eventful moment is in moe and is only not moe at the most 'boring' parts or erotic parts.Art is super cute. Hinako Note is painted with cute characters doing cute things. There are moments where you can't help but say 'awwww' and If your in to erotic stuff then Hinako Note got that too.I like the music. Especially the Opening song. Music is appropriate for such settings for the most part. Nothing much to say honestly.Characters are easily the most paramount detail about this series.Hinako is a joy to watch her eagerness to overcome her shyness. Seeing her fumble her words is super cute.Mayuki is way too similar to Hinako. She is like shy girl #2 or cute girl #2. She is a much shorter, slightly more confident, loli version of Hinako.Kuina is the most predictable of the bunch which isn't bad at all. Besides eating she isn't much different from the other girls.Chiaki is probably the most well executed character in the series. I find it hard to find criticism of her. I'm not going to say she is a bad character because I hate characters like her. She is quite good.The supporting characters are bad. Ruriko is just a copy and paste character and Yua is just ok.If you are able to overlook the flaws and focus on the positives then this should be an enjoyable series for you.

There is no problem that Hinako Note has more of then letting the Gimmicks take too much space in the show. The gimmicks themselves aren't the worst but they get repeated so often that it clearly becomes a crutch of the show. Maya is small and childlike, Hinako is a scarecrow, Kuina eats EVERYTHING (especially books), the gimmicks can be somewhat creative, the scarecrow, but there's so forced that it's hard to see anything good in them. Especially when one's like Kuina's have been done so much before. It's telling when standard tsundere is one of the better characters...of the story, although that may be due to my own like for tsundere.Sadly the gimmicks get in the way of character development. Rather than give them depth and shine, time is spent using this gimmicks and setting up weak comedy skits. The characters are mostly the same throughout the show, they don't change nor do they get any depth. They're shallow and the roles they're introduced as are pretty much what they are. The only exception is Mayu who does get a nice episode that focuses on her, but even then it doesn't add much to her character.Adding to the weak gimmicks is an OST that makes me cringe. The songs are fine, but the sound effects are the most cliche and corny things they could possibly find, complete with BOING BOING and Moos when they focus on Hinako and Chiaki's large breasts. There is something about the sound choice which makes it feel that much more offputting to watch. The fanservice wasn't even the worst but the sound effects that they chose did a good job of making it seem as sleazy as they could. It was a terrible choice.The show tends to switch off between well-designed episode ideas and bad jokes, the plot itself is decent enough to provide a sort of idea of where it's going but not good enough to be immersive itself. The acting itself was covered well enough as well as their reasons for why but the actual development of that plot feels lackluster. That may be a side effect of the adaptation blues though.The interactions between the characters are pretty cute though, and if anything it does succeed at being a cute show. If one wants to watch something just for the cuteness this wouldn't be a bad choice, but for any other reason, it doesn't have much merit. That said I'd personally suggest skipping it, there are much better CGDCT shows that don't force their gimmicks every couple of minutes.P.S.

And what better place to start than the first anime I ever watched? Yep, I didn't start out with any of the big shounens or gateway anime, I started with a fucking less than popular slice of life. Crazy, huh? Anyways, the reviewStory: 7Now, as it is a slice of life, of course the story isn't going to be anything riveting, nobody expects that. But seeing a girl with massive social anxiety was something I could very much relate to, and I could...appreciate that. Seeing her slowly work on overcoming her anxiety by taking on various challenges that tested her in presenting herself to the public was enjoyable for me to watch.Art: 7Basically all the art that is necessary for a slice of life show is enough to make some cute girls that everybody can have fun watching for whatever the runtime of the show is. Hinako Note wasn't spectacular or anything, but I think the character designs were plenty enough to get the job done that they needed to.Sound: 8I don't remember too much of the songs played during the show, but if memory serves correctly, they absolutely did what they needed to do, but the reason I gave sound an 8 is because I enjoyed the OP and ED a bunch. So much in fact, that they were the reason I watched the show in the first place. Heard the ED in osu! and somehow that is what ended up getting me into anime, so I think I can solidly say that the songs this show has to offer were pretty good.Character: 9Similar to art, if a slice of life show can have cute girls with distinct personalities, there really isn't much more that they need to do to pass in my book. Maybe I'm just easy to please, but Hinako Note's cast is more than enough to keep me entertained for 12 episodes. Also, Kuina is best girl and you can not fight me on that.Enjoyment: 9Obviously there's not gonna be any epic story, deeper meaning or anything of the sort, but if you can just sit down, turn the ol' brain off, and enjoy some cute girls doing cute shit, then I can absolutely recommend this show for you. It definittely isn't the best slice of life out there, but I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.Overall: 9If you're a slice of life fan, I absolutely recommend this show.

Kuina she is a well the hungry person of the anime she thinks about food a lot and even eats the books at the store otherwise pretty up and going. Mayuki is a person who likes wearing maid outfits and costumes as well also has really good feelings for Chiaki otherwise pretty much a nice and sweet girl. Chiaki is the landlord of Hitotose and is also the last main of the anime she is really well liked otherwise a quiet talker also nice as the rest of the characters. Yua (also yes im gonna add a supporting character even though i dont really talk about them) so she basically has feeling for Chiaki and also kinda becomes Hinako's rival becuase of her getting the lead in a play when she felt like she should of had it but she opens up later to hinako otherwise a tsundere easily.Enjoyment: i personally really enjoyed this anime like a lot more than i though i would this anime is really and i mean REALLY funny like episodes 4 through 6 were kinda meh but the rest were easily very good and a good sitting to watch as well.Overall: Easily a 8 for me yes it was that good i could understand that yes this anime does have gimmicks going for it like you'll easily notice them right away when you watch it but honestly that didn't bother me like at all unlike other people or the more popular reviewers because i could understand but this anime was hella funny for me and easily worth the watch in the world but decent at best also the characters all sounded good as well.Character: Hinako is the really shy one of the bunch and again like i said she cant really talk if anyone even approaches her or even talk to her she does mature as the anime goes on and she is really nice and sweet. Kuina she is a well the hungry person of the anime she thinks about food a lot and even eats the books at the store otherwise pretty up and going.

Sadly, the only moment seems to be the little chick that somehow follows her around all the time and it\'s sadly not used much more than that, every once in a while.As for the acting/theater part, it was kind of boring. Honestly, it felt like they overdid...the cuteness a bit too much and focused unnecessarily much on erotic shots. Libido would be the only thing getting fired up with stuff like that and I doubt that\'s what people watch this for. Sadly, it was fairly disappointing overall, or perhaps it\'s more correct to say that it was average and didn\'t bring any surprises, although it was honestly a bit subpar even then.It was pretty monotone and although the cuteness was appealing, I feel like it lacked too much in other departments. It\'s just that, cute girls doing cute things and nothing creative or exceptional going on. I found myself struggling to continue after a few episodes and no good anime should ever make people feel like it\'s a chore to watch instead of interesting. The good ones should make you feel that you\'re not bored at all and want to see what comes next and the truly great ones should capture your attention so that you can\'t wait to watch more. This was sadly somewhere around where you can watch it, it\'s not horrible, but you kind of feel bored and fall asleep after a few episodes.So, did this show have clever and good jokes that makes you laugh? Nah, I didn\'t really find anything like that here, it\'s too focused on being cutesy to actually try to make any good jokes that is so sorely needed. Don\'t misunderstand, there IS comedy present, but it\'s always on the level of perhaps provoking a slight smile as even the jokes are just there to show how cute the characters are. Eating book pages, gluttonous characters or clumsy characters are about the peak of humor in this anime. Essentially, this anime focuses on one or two particular character traits and abuses them to the point we might as well call it ""beating a dead horse"". One character only has the role to be clumsy and cute, another one just has the role to be gluttonous and cute, another one just has the role to be childish and cute and all their actions revolve around these things. It gets very boring after a few episodes. It feels artificial and lacking.As for characters, they feel pretty flat, cliché is such an overused word, but I guess that\'s how I\'d categorize them. We have the clumsy, shy character, the kinda silent ""cool"" senpai, the cute doll-like and tiny girl that has a complex about her size and everyone teases about it, we have the :-3 smiling cat-like persona who is gluttonous and sleepy, the super tsun tsundere that just can\'t be honest with herself and the child(loli, in this case a somehow extremely busty nine year old) ""teacher/advisor"" that also fills the manipulative role.While we have all these clichés, I don\'t feel like they interact well with eachother and it\'s missing quite a lot to be truly good. In the end, all the focus went to make them as cute as possible, so they don\'t even feel real anymore, instead feeling like empty husks that only exists to act within a pre-defined role like a robot and play the cute-game with every other robot. As mentioned before, they\'re hopelessly simple and only has one or two traits each, all the focus is going to those two traits.I can see why this anime got this fairly low score, because even as a show where it\'s all about cute girls doing cute things, the proportions are unbalanced and the setting is quite lacking in zest. I do love cute girls doing cute things shows, but even then it\'s just bad writing if you ignore pretty much all other aspects in order to make it as cute as possible. Also, a 9-year old child actress with humongous boobs? Come on. Is she only there to be fanservice to people who likes both lolis and boobs? I see no reason whatsoever as to why she would be a good addition to the character cast. I could somehow buy that she\'d be a child actress that is training there, but drop the unrealistic and moronic addition of the huge knockers. the cuteness a bit too much and focused unnecessarily much on erotic shots.

If your answer is yes, then this show is not for you. Why? Because you probably already watched much better, much more original shows than this one.The main character of this show is Hinako, a girl who gets embarassed every time someone talks to her. She moves from the countryside to Tokyo in hope of overcoming this habit by joing the drama club in her new high school.However, like most SoL/CGDCT shows, Hinako Note quickly abandons its plot, and instead of giving us cute girls doing cute things, gives...us cute girls doing nothing, or rather, cute girls doing the same thing cute girls have been doing in every SoL for the past five (ten?) years, only with new characters.The beach episode? Check. Characters trying bikinis/new outfits every five seconds? Check. Characters drinking tea or eating every five seconds? Check. And so on and so on.This kind of stuff was alright ten years ago with animes like K-On, because it was done intelligently and it was new. This is not the case here.Talking about K-On, people over at Passione were very obviously ""inspired"" by K-On and Gochiusa when making Hinako Note, as many, MANY parralels can be made between the two.In the first episodes, the characters of Hinako Note make it their goal to play at Suzuran, similar to how the characters of K-On make it their goal to play at Budokan.In the first episode, Hinako is in Tokyo and she\'s looking for the bookstore where she\'ll stay, similar to how Cocoa, in the first episode of Gochiusa, looks for the Café where she\'ll stay.There is an episode where Hinako\'s mom visits her, similar to the episode in Gochiusa where Cocoa\'s sister visits her. Again, and so on and so on.So, as you might have guessed by now, the story is a 100% not original. There is nothing new.What about the characters? Frankly, they\'re not THAT bad. Hinako herself is very similar to Cocoa from Gochiusa, but putting that fact aside, she is rather likeable, although the ""joke"" of her being embarassed easily gets old and annoying really fast, which might lead you to not like her.Chiaki is rather original, especially in a CGDCT show. She is likeable. Kuina is likeable as well, although if you don\'t like the ""Eats everything and is always hungry"" type of character, you\'re not gonna like her, because that\'s 90% of what she\'ll do.Mayuki is a dress freak (obviously, otherwise the characters wouldn\'t be able to try new clothes every five seconds) and she\'s complexed about her height. She\'s always there but you don\'t see her that much. Because of this, I don\'t hate her, but I don\'t feel attached to her either.And Yua. Oh, Yua. I\'m not gonna bother talking about her too much, all I\'ll say is that she is one of the lest original tsunderes I\'ve ever seen (and they\'re not very original to begin with) and she\'s worst girl. There. Unless you\'re 10, new to anime and don\'t mind bitchy characters, you\'re not gonna like her.The music is nice. The sound effects do the job.The animation is good. With that being said, IT HAS TOO MANY CHIBI MOMENTS. This is becoming more and more of a problem in anime in general. The animators are lazy, so instead of drawing all the details like they\'d normally do, and like they\'re supposed to do, every time there\'s a slightly silly moment, they draw chibi. This is dishonest animation and I personally dislike this very much.Overall, it wasn\'t hard for me to watch Hinako Note. However, there were too many flaws for me to enjoy it.

Hinako Note is not bad, it\'s just not good, and little effort has been put in it.', 'TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.Hinako Note was Passione\'s attempt at CGDCT (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) which ended fairly well, though at times the direction of the show felt lost.Hinako has now just moved out to Tokyo in an attempt to become an aspiring actress. There\'s just one major setback: she freezes up like a scarecrow whenever she talks to any human being. How will her acting career fare as she receives help from her new roommates at Hitotose Manor?The main cast of characters consisting of five (cute) girls all compliment...each other in the way they interact with one another. Hinako, the scarecrow, Kuina, the ever-so-lovable glutton, Mayu, the super short doll like girl who\'s actually older than the prior two, Chiaki, the landlord and a dedicated actress (and best girl), and last but not least, Yua, who\'s super into Chiaki. All the girls are cute in their own right and spend their time in each episode doing cute things as formerly mentioned. However, sometimes, things go from cute to... uncomfortably erotic. Too many shots of pinup dresses and more revealing outfits that defined the outline of the body contrasted with the chibi animation that they would receive time to time and the core of the show itself. While they were good shots, it just broke the theme of the show (Hinako goes from ""Flat is justice"" to ""Flat is injustice"" in 0.2 seconds).Moving along, the art and sound were rather good for me. The art and animation was of course cute and endearing (especially the chibi scenes), and the soundtrack was insanely good. Both the OP (while this one will make this listener end up with the biggest migraine of their life) and the ED are visually and vocally fun to view. Especially the ED, which in my opinion, is the best of the season just from the great choreography that went into it.TL;DR: Hinako Note is another CGDCT show that at times, was really cute, but at other times was really bizarre and on the off-beaten path to weirdness. With an astounding sound track, the chibi scenes and other cute parts are sure to make you fall in love with the cast and the show as a whole. each other in the way they interact with one another.

This isn't an anime for that, it's something that you should watch just to relax, snuggle under a blanket with snacks and enjoy.My opinion, if you don't like it well... sorry "", ""Story is awesome. I really love character development in this anime. It's seems ain't much but at least it is honest work. The story is also warming and upliftingAbout art. The anime version is actually pretty well even though seems different with actual author's arstyle.

The soundtrack also fun to hear and vibe on.Character, actually overall awesome but... the character proportion is making this anime kinda...ero as it is full of fetish basically. (yea i...am horny guy but this is review so i have to be rational)Enjoyment, I really enjoy this anime. what make this kinda off is... no s2. The ending of the story still not reached and what make it worse is basically this anime has no fandomOverall, this is awesome and must watch anime am horny guy but this is review so i have to be rational)Enjoyment, I really enjoy this anime. what make this kinda off is... no s2.

This show is peak fluff, everything from the VAs to the coziness of the artwork is designed to relax you, its like lighting up a fat one at the end of a stressful day, the more you dive into it the more it loosens you up. Then there's the fan service, why God himself channeled his glory into the hands of the animators of this show! The fan service while small, and only occasionally popping...up is so pulchritudinous, so resplendent, that like a child seeing the moon for the first time I was unable to take my eyes of it as I just saw in awe genuinely thanking whatever higher power there is in this world for letting me live right now and enjoy this. The story is pleasantly enjoyable and the op is catchier than a super charged version of the common cold. People tend to overlook shows like this, they say there's not enough action, or character development/plot, well I can tell you that when you reach a point where you think your time is limited and you won't see tomorrow, the big adventures and great stories never matter, what does was the love, and this show goes straight to the heart. up is so pulchritudinous, so resplendent, that like a child seeing the moon for the first time I was unable to take my eyes of it as I just saw in awe genuinely thanking whatever higher power there is in this world for letting me live right now and enjoy this.

Now LA isn\'t bashing on Hinako Note, no no no, LA is merely saying the similarities are there and heck LA actually really likes the frequent changes into moe chibified form that only increases that yes, this is typical moe fluff...but ""ok to decent"" moe fluff.But if LA REALLY needs to talk about faults, then it\'s that Hinako Note has ALOT going for it trying to be soo many things as well as riding into the anime trend of moe fluff and their daily lives and sure some defence is that both the cafe and the bookstore helps Hinako get over her shyness as she works at both and hijinks ensues. The other problem is the most obvious one and that is that most of the characters have a preset running gag that never changes or evolves to the main cast (from again the aforementioned Hinako\'s scarecrow shyness) such as Kuina Natsukawa voiced by Miyu Tomita eating habits (which includes books), Chiaki Ogino voiced by Hisako Tojo being the affection of all the girls in Hinako\'s school as well as Yua Nakajima, Hinako frienemy because of her Chiaki and in the early theatre moments. Finally we have Mayuki Hiiragi voiced by Yui Ogura, the maid of the group and gets shy when she\'s called a doll and she was LA\'s favourite character...why?...the majority of her comedic moments landed quite well even if they are running gags.In terms of animation by Studio Passione, the animation has a really tendency to switch from normal character designs to chibified form ALOT and yes the chibified form are moe as hell and LA really does it like from all this, though it makes LA question if their chibified form is in a metaphorical sense or they can actually change into chibified and it\'s ONLY the main cast...and LA is looking too deep into this. One little flaw LA will say about the animation is that the fanservice is there and eye-rollingly annoying at times when it does show up. The fanservice is mainly n the more risque costume the cast (sans Mayuki) gets into, like sexy nurse or maids and they plain old chest shots because big boobs are great in conjunction with a moe fluff anime...... -sigh- again Hinako Note trying to have it\'s bloated cake and eat it too and no LA has no defence for this one.Annnd in comes voice acting and there\'s ALOT of squeakers in this anime, from M.A.O to Marika Kouno as Yua to the typically obvious Yui Ogura, but thankfully Yui Ogura\'s vocals fits into her role thus her being a caricature of her roles doesn\'t exactly apply to this role if this character is SUPPOSE to be like this and the fact that YUi Ogura doesn\'t go crazy with her moe squeaker vocals as Mayuki. LA was slightly annoyed by Hisako Tojo due to her ever constant low monotoned moe vocals. For  LA\'s most annoying voice actor it went to M.A.O for obvious reasons and on the flipside, LA\'s favourite voice actor goes to Yui Ogura.Hinako Note isn\'t a bad moe anime, if anything LA just wished it could do something more with it\'s material outside as well as trying to ride into the anime trend of Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?. Hinako Note is a hit or miss in terms of comedy and will vastly depend on whether you like the main cast of this anime (or the voice cast). LA will say this again for Hinako Note...it\'s a bloated cake filled with sugar and cream...whether you can handle and eat all that can either frustrate you into leaving or just go into a sugar rush, run out of energy then find finer cakes with a better focus.Rabbit House Coffee anyone?.... and eat it too by bringing in something refreshingly new from this anime trend (easily because of Hinako\'s dilemma of being a scarecrow).

The plot is quite simple but not that bad. It has some references but it doesn't make any better instead it made it cuter and that is where Hinako focuses the anime pretty much focuses on how cute this girls are and how they will look cute on certain situations. It can be quite funny but just situational. And Sounds and Art is very good as well and i can see it is well-funded and they hired good Seiyuu's for it which is great. Characters...  though i haven't seen the 5th girl but then...i don't think i need to anyway since 4 of them is already introduced in the first episode so far the noteworthy character would be Kuina cause she looks like matured version of Konata.  The rest is just fine as they are. Overall Hinako Note is indeed an Moe anime cause it's all sugary-and-rainbows and they did a good work on it. and at least i like it for it's cuteness and calming atmosphere which all of the Moe anime gives me. i don't think i need to anyway since 4 of them is already introduced in the first episode so far the noteworthy character would be Kuina cause she looks like matured version of Konata.

It's fun if you like that genre, but not worth going out of your way to see if you don't normally like shows like this.Story: Hinako, a nervous girl from the country, moves to Tokyo and tries to become a theater actress to gain confidence in herself.  As is typical with shows like this, the plot really doesn't matter.  The show itself often ignores the theater premise and just goes with your traditional setups for these kinds of shows.  The beach episode, training camp at school, etc.  Surprisingly no hot...springs episode now that I think back on it though.  The entire theater portion of it really doesn't matter to be honest, it's just a setting and a thinly-veiled excuse to dress the girls up in various cute costumes, which the show spends the vast majority of its runtime doing.The one thing I would criticize here is that the show has a tendency to periodically slam the brakes on to do about a minute's worth of extremely out of place fanservice before resuming the episode like it never even happened.  I'm not inherently opposed to fanservice and I understand the reality of why it exists, but it feels very jarring for a series that's very sweet and innocent most of the time to suddenly throw in a bunch of closeups of the girls in their underwear and aggressively zoom in on their crotches.Audio/Visual: The voice acting is strong for the most part, several of the VAs are immediately identifiable.  The voices do tend towards the overly cutesy, but that's the kind of show it is so the highly saccharine nature of the show will probably get to you before the voices do if that's going to be an issue for you at all.  Visually, the character designs are very nice and look good, but often turn into blobs for parts of scenes as a stylistic choice.  I didn't mind this, but your mileage may vary.  They don't ask a lot of the animation here, but what is there is well-made.  The designers also did an excellent job of creating and animating a wide variety of different costumes and dresses as well.  The girls essentially playing dress up is a major element of the show and the design of the clothing is consistently strong throughout.Characters: I really enjoyed the characters in this series.  They're all very cute, maybe drifting into cloying territory occasionally, but have unique personalities and gimmicks that are fun without adding unnecessary complications.  Hinako turns into a scarecrow when she gets nervous, Kuina is food-obsessed to the point of eating books, Mayu is easily embarrassed yet insists on wearing a maid outfit at all times, Yua is the friendly rival (think Ayano if you've seen Yuru Yuri), and Chiaki is the mature and understated one.  It's pretty easy to sum up the archetypes but they do a good job of making you care about the characters beyond just those archetypes.  Their interactions are very charming and the comedy is gentle but pleasant.Overall, this is just a fun and sweet CGDCT series.  There's little to it beyond what you're probably expecting, but it's a pleasant and relaxing watch.  A great healing anime if you're ever in a bad mood. springs episode now that I think back on it though.

SoL shows generally don\'t have a proper story, most of the time it\'s there just for the sake of being there. SoL shows generally don\'t have proper characters either, or any character development. This doesn\'t mean that a SoL show can\'t have story or good characters, it just means that most shows out there choose not to include them. They use the SoL genre as an excuse for the lack of story or proper characters, these type of shows are all over the place, they don\'t have a proper goal that they are trying to achieve...with the show and just put out random acts every episode. A show must know what its trying to achieve if it wants to succeed, I don\'t mean plot wise, what I mean is in a more broader sense, what is the director trying to convey with the show, what did he want to create here and so on.When they fail this what we get is Hinako Note. A show that doesn\'t know what it is trying to be, a show that lacks good characters and character interactions, a show that is all over the place and feels fake.One thing that annoyed me the most was how we could see the hands of the author trying to shove the story through our throats. The overall flow of the story should not be made obvious to the viewer - unless it is trying to achieve comedic effect, if it is made obvious then the viewer is going to loose its sympathy and attachment to the show as a whole.

It feels as the characters interacted the way they interacted because that was what they were suppose to do, the fan service was there for the sake of it and wasn\'t natural at all. Ironically it felt like everyone was reading off  of a badly written script and there was no hint of anything real. Since the story was faulty the characters followed suit and ended up flat and shallow, without any hint of real emotions or anything similar. With the characters failing the humor and anything else that might had saved the show also failed and as a result we got in our hands a failure of a show that couldn\'t do one thing right.Everything bad about it aside the show could still be watched if you just watch it for the sake of occasional fan service and pretty characters.

The music and art in The Alternative World are a disappointment across the board compared to The Magnificent World.The new opening theme is a completely forgettable Jpop ballad completely out of line with the exotic Mideastern feel of El Hazard as a whole, and the closing credits are downright scary, with hideously painted images of women\'s faces in flowers and linked hands circled by glowing halos, having nothing to do with the plot or story of the anime and looking like spooky...illustrations out of some evangelical Sunday School picture book.The Alternative World introduces several new major characters, but with such a huge cast and so few episodes to work with, the only one that comes off seeming like they might be a real person is Qawoor. Qawoor seems to have some mysterious past connection to Makoto, but like so many other things in this series, that revelation ends up being brushed aside and forgotten.As if all that isn\'t enough bad news, most of the events in The Alternative World do not actually take place in El Hazard, but in a new world whose history, geography, and politics are never explained in any detail. The climax of the series is one of those infamous ""dream endings"", and the final episode is the most boring onsen episode I\'ve ever seen. (Oh god, all the nipple-less breasts!

Instead it is left to a near random and uninteresting chain of events. ', ""Compared to the first El Hazard OVA, this anime was trash.Story: I finished this anime and couldn't really describe the plot to my friend. There were a ton of plot holes, which made the story confusing and hard to follow. When I wasn't confused, I was bored out of my mind.Art: The animation seemed to go downhill with every spinoff/sequel, and Alternative World had the worst art by far.Characters: The characters had no development whatsoever. They were all flanderized to the point where they were just shells of who they were in the first OVA. Qawoor was the worst. She was so pointless and annoying....Jinnai's stupidity and stubborness were just nauseating. Makoto was so confused the entire time, but he's still wholeheartedly admired by the other characters for being a cute nice guy. I really don't blame Jinnai for disliking him. Makoto was such a simp for Qawoor, and Nanami was such a simp for Makoto.Enjoyment: This anime failed miserably at its attempt to be comedic. It's main source of comedy was slapstick humor, which did not get a single laugh out of me whatsoever.The ending was also very disturbing. Diva basically r*p*s Jinnai. He was clearly NOT giving consent, but it's implied that she forced him into int*rc*urse to repopulate the Bugrom race. I feel like it was just played off for laughs since it was a woman forcing a man, which is just gross and sad.Bottom Line: DON'T WATCH THIS ANIME! It's cringey, unfunny, lazy, and disturbing.

Innocent Venus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1230/Innocent_Venus,"[""Innocent Venus is a very underrated, largely forgotten about series. Such a shame, as it's an exceptionally written, immensely satisfying production.We're introduced - in the beginning - to a shady duo accompanied by a young girl and a troublesome boy, who are on the run from a roster much larger and much more powerful than themselves. Innocent Venus starts off a little cliche, and occasionally fails to avoid banality, but as the plot progresses it becomes more complex, exciting and unconventional. It presents audiences with gleefully absorbing questions and defining plot twists, with a satisfying climax and ample pace.Despite fairly commonplace archetypes, the characters breath...a lot of life into the series. They invigorate the plot; their interactions and motivations keep you interested and guessing. Jin and Jo's relationship is especially thrilling to watch unravel. Change any of the characters and dare I say, the series would loose a little steam. The characters are written, animated, developed and voiced very effectively and above all else, they're memorable.The animation and art is - for the most part - extremely absorbing and well presented. Certain elements (such as the antagonists mecha-like machines) have had CG treatment, however. As a result, they don't blend particularly well with their surroundings. Nevertheless, the animation is very fluid and the more traditionally drawn characters, backgrounds and objects are crisp and detailed. Furthermore, the action sequences are compelling and well choreographed.The music isn't incredibly memorable, but does contain a couple of stand-out tracks. There's a beautifully composed recurring piano piece, which becomes somewhat of a focus in the series. However, the sound department don't particularly push themselves; they do a sufficient job.In conclusion, Innocent Venus is a thoroughly compelling series, with a captivating story and characters you actually care about. It's a particularly well written production, with multiple strong episodes and stand-out segments. It has become somewhat of a forgotten about series, which is a mighty shame. It isn't an anime that goes above and beyond, but it is nevertheless entirely worth watching and very deserving of praise. a lot of life into the series.

I was not expecting anything groundbreaking, but I was impressed by the visual panache and overall feel of the show. As it turns out, it is one of those series that starts off strong, and then loses its drive, only to pick it back up again in the final stretch. The problem is, by the time it starts to pick up the broken pieces of itself, it is a little too late to salvage the overall product. As rare as it is for me to...say this, I think this series would have been very well served to be even one episode longer, as the end feels like a mad dash to right the wrongs of the middle of the series.--Story: 3Let us face it: there is nothing groundbreaking about the story in Innocent Venus at all, nor is the writing particularly strong. In falling to so many cliches and failing to really get beyond them, the story of Innocent Venus really drags the rest of the series down. The plot twist of the series, which could have been a very high point--and still, to some extent, manages to be--is so forcefully pushed onto the audience it loses a lot of its weight. Also, though perhaps it seems odd to mention the opening and ending animations here, they actually hint heavily at the plot twist, and raise suspicion artificially in the early stages of the show. Had it not been for the opener and closer, I would not have been waiting for the plot twist from the earliest moments of the series, and, man, would it have been a lot more impressive. I normally ignore those animations for the purposes of a review, but in such a case when they actually negatively affect the series I felt it should be mentioned. Also, the sub-plots, particularly the ones that are the focus of much of the middle portion of the series, are simply abominable, and at times make the series nigh unwatchable. I can appreciate their attempt to diversify the story, but in the execution it fell off horribly.Character: 6In general, the characters in Innocent Venus can be described in one word: bland. At least, pretty much every character aside from Sana, Jin, and Jo fit this description. Mostly the cast is made up of flat characters whose entire character is established within a few moments of them being on screen, and typically stick close to basic archetypes, deviating ever so slightly from time to time. However, the relationship between Sana, Jin, and Jo, offers an interesting dynamic which is really one of the major strong points of the show. However, Jo is a weak link in this chain, his reticence a great impediment to any development they might have given him, and even Jin suffers from some drastic changes that really make him a completely different character. Sana is certainly a strong point, her girlish nature amusingly and dramatically at odds with the events occurring all around her. When the three's relationship is at center stage, the show generally flourishes, but when it takes a side seat to the secondary characters and various sub-plots, it is not a pretty sight to behold. And, while the characters design is not completely without merit, the secondary characters really get shafted in this department.Animation: 6Right in the first episode Innocent Venus impresses with its animation. The art itself looks great, and is very expressive. The character designs are interesting without being absurd, and everything moves about smoothly and naturally. Though it begins on a very high note, it begins to taper off noticeably rather quickly, and only rises to its former greatness in short spikes until the very end. Early on the action sequences will take you by storm, but in the middle of the series they serve merely as vehicles from one weak plot point to another, and all sense of drama and impact are lost to extensive use of shortcuts and a great deal of action taking place off screen. The 3d models used for the mechs look simple and out of place amidst the sharp characters and the deep landscapes, looking more like plastic models than dangerous weapons. In short, when the series shines, it's an intense, piercing experience, but more often than not it loses that and comes off weakly. During the majority of the middle portion of the series, in particular, production values fall to great depths, and at times it seems as if there is no salvaging it--and, indeed, this section does drag the entire series down a great deal, making what could have been a very good series into one that is merely okay. Especially bad are the naval battles, which run the gamut from unwatchable to simply bad, and are full of the sort of pseudo-military jargon I think everyone has come to expect from action series. Unfortunately, these battles have none of the other battles' flair or style, and are stale even compared the most perfunctory ground battle.Sound: 6Now, I will be the first to admit that soundtracks can be too overbearing, and dominate a scene to the extent that you sometimes wonder why they bothered with the animation. Innocent Venus generally takes it to the other extreme. Most of the music in this series is so subdued as to be completely unnoticeable, occasionally flaring up into existence to nudge a scene in the right direction. Thus, the soundtrack is not bad, per se, and certainly has its place in the series, but a little more weight would have been a good thing. At times this is not the case, primarily in one of two instances: piano pieces, which hold a fairly important place in the story, and during action sequences, during both of which the soundtrack really shines. One thing that can be said for the soundtrack throughout most of the series--certain sections in the middle the most notable exception--is that it is timed very well to what is happening on screen, and never leaves a sour taste in your mouth. However, even this trait suffers in the middle portion, unfortunately, the only thing not noticeably taking a hit being the voice-acting. On that note, the voice-acting is almost universally decent, but--aside from a few instances and Sana's seiyuu Nazuka Kaori--never impressive in any sense. However, because the seiyuu for Sana does such a good job in expressing her character and providing most of the fun in the series, and because she is present throughout much of the show, the voice-acting as a whole remains a modest strong point of the show.--Overall, Innocent Venus was an enjoyable ride, but it drags so much in the middle portion, and loses everything that made it exciting in the beginning. Though efforts are made to pick up the pieces in the ending stretch, ultimately they fail to make up for the miserable pacing and drop in production values that haunt the majority of the central third of the show. With a supremely forgettable soundtrack and uninspired voice-acting from all but one of the cast, nothing in Innocent Venus manages to stand strong throughout the series. The series loses it focus a great deal, and cannot manage to regain its lost concentration until it is too late. When events are focused around Sana, Jin, and Jo, and the relationship among them which is quite well developed, the series thrives, and is a genuine pleasure to watch. However, take this away and a cold, unpleasant taste is left in the audience's mouths.The Ten Second VersionStory: 3 - Full of cliches expressed through lackluster writing, the story is propelled forcefully by the series' stronger traits.Character: 6 - The relationship between Sana, Jin, and Jo is a remarkably strong point in the show, but the majority of the other characters are flat and dullAnimation: 6 - Early on and later on the animation is extremely well-handled, but during the middle portions it all suffers greatly. Static art is attractive, although many of the designs, both for characters and machines, could have used a lot more work. The 3d animation in the series is also poorly integrated.Sound: 6 - The music is mostly subdued, barely managing to push scenes in the right direction, although the piano pieces are very good. Some of the tracks are put to good use, however, and the dramatic timing is often quite good. As for voice actors, Nazuka Kaori shines as young Shana, and there are no glaringly bad ones, but overall the performances are lackluster.Overall: 5.5Seems a little out of tune... say this, I think this series would have been very well served to be even one episode longer, as the end feels like a mad dash to right the wrongs of the middle of the series.--Story: 3Let us face it: there is nothing groundbreaking about the story in Innocent Venus at all, nor is the writing particularly strong.

Especially bad are the naval battles, which run the gamut from unwatchable to simply bad, and are full of the sort of pseudo-military jargon I think everyone has come to expect from action series. Unfortunately, these battles have none of the other battles' flair or style, and are stale even compared the most perfunctory ground battle.Sound: 6Now, I will be the first to admit that soundtracks can be too overbearing, and dominate a scene to the extent that you sometimes wonder why they bothered with the animation. Innocent Venus generally takes it to the other extreme. Most of the music in this series is so subdued as to be completely unnoticeable, occasionally flaring up into existence to nudge a scene in the right direction. Thus, the soundtrack is not bad, per se, and certainly has its place in the series, but a little more weight would have been a good thing. At times this is not the case, primarily in one of two instances: piano pieces, which hold a fairly important place in the story, and during action sequences, during both of which the soundtrack really shines. One thing that can be said for the soundtrack throughout most of the series--certain sections in the middle the most notable exception--is that it is timed very well to what is happening on screen, and never leaves a sour taste in your mouth. However, even this trait suffers in the middle portion, unfortunately, the only thing not noticeably taking a hit being the voice-acting. On that note, the voice-acting is almost universally decent, but--aside from a few instances and Sana's seiyuu Nazuka Kaori--never impressive in any sense. However, because the seiyuu for Sana does such a good job in expressing her character and providing most of the fun in the series, and because she is present throughout much of the show, the voice-acting as a whole remains a modest strong point of the show.--Overall, Innocent Venus was an enjoyable ride, but it drags so much in the middle portion, and loses everything that made it exciting in the beginning. Though efforts are made to pick up the pieces in the ending stretch, ultimately they fail to make up for the miserable pacing and drop in production values that haunt the majority of the central third of the show. With a supremely forgettable soundtrack and uninspired voice-acting from all but one of the cast, nothing in Innocent Venus manages to stand strong throughout the series. The series loses it focus a great deal, and cannot manage to regain its lost concentration until it is too late. When events are focused around Sana, Jin, and Jo, and the relationship among them which is quite well developed, the series thrives, and is a genuine pleasure to watch. However, take this away and a cold, unpleasant taste is left in the audience's mouths.The Ten Second VersionStory: 3 - Full of cliches expressed through lackluster writing, the story is propelled forcefully by the series' stronger traits.Character: 6 - The relationship between Sana, Jin, and Jo is a remarkably strong point in the show, but the majority of the other characters are flat and dullAnimation: 6 - Early on and later on the animation is extremely well-handled, but during the middle portions it all suffers greatly. Static art is attractive, although many of the designs, both for characters and machines, could have used a lot more work. The 3d animation in the series is also poorly integrated.Sound: 6 - The music is mostly subdued, barely managing to push scenes in the right direction, although the piano pieces are very good. Some of the tracks are put to good use, however, and the dramatic timing is often quite good. As for voice actors, Nazuka Kaori shines as young Shana, and there are no glaringly bad ones, but overall the performances are lackluster.Overall: 5.5Seems a little out of tune..."", ""Inncent Venus is placed in a very hard section of anime that it is forced to content with. Since the anime has a mecha theme it is commonly compared up to the standards of other mecha anime. But this story offers a little heart, for a minii-series.Story- The story is based around on of those commonly used ideas. It is almost like the creators took a bunch of commonly used ideas and pinned them to the wall, turn around a threw some darts at them. The darts that stuck became the plot. But for having traditional development with a typical plot, it was quite an...interesting angle to follow the story form.For you were not simply gifted with the ideas of those that were central to the story but you go to see into the lives of the other side as well. That adds a fuller picture to what is going on in the plot.So yes it does have a military, on the run, mecha feel to it, but it brings to the table a story seen from all angles, that offers you to see into hte minds of not only the leads but those who oppose them.The overarching plot is really good and something I have have never seen before in an anime.When You finish the anime and then go back though it you can find those little details that you missed the first time. Especially in the opening sequences.Art- The art of this anime is beautiful. Everything look really well polished, when I was first looking at this anime I read a review in a magazine, there they said that they hired people who have never made mecha before to make the ones for Innocent Venus. I think that really came out. THe Mecha were believable and they moved well. They also didn't have the problem that mecha usually have where they look like they were obviously made somewhere else then that frame. What I mean is they interacted with the environment well.Sound: With the exception of the opening, I can't recall there being any really amazing sounds. The opening was not moved in the direction of the song but the song seemed to couple the images well. Almost as though it were written for the images.Characters- The characters were all stock characters with a little growth added for good measure. But that doesn't make them bad characters, just a little predictable. Although a few of the characters are well developed and deserve to be awarded for that.Enjoyment: The scenes are fast paced and the battle sequences are well timed, not spending too much time fighting but making each fight enjoyable. The dialog was amazing and very witty at times. IT is a plot that you can keep watching over and over because it just has that simple pleasure to it.I would urge you to try it and see if you like it. interesting angle to follow the story form.For you were not simply gifted with the ideas of those that were central to the story but you go to see into the lives of the other side as well.

At first I really enjoyed this series even when it started becoming laboriously convoluted to the point it seemed like they were randomly adding stuff to the plot to make it more ""interesting."" But, by that point I was caught up and interested in the characters and wondering what exactly was going on in their heads. Maybe I was projecting onto them too much from other anime I enjoyed, because looking back there wasn\'t that much character development....At anyrate, I hated the direction one of the characters ended up taking.

I have no desire to ever watch this again as a result.', 'Enjoyment / Overall :: 7The plot was good, had twists that kept me watching, and the characters were all interesting. The problem is that none of the characters have any background and there were some plot holes that bugged me. The thing is, all of this could have easily been fixed with more episodes. This series could have been great had it been longer, but ultimately, it wasn’t, so there was some wasted potential.Story :: 7.5The premise of Innocent Venus is pretty cliché: the main characters are protecting Sana from an evil organization and we don’t know why. The first half the anime is a...cat and mouse game. The organization is chasing them, Jo and Jin are on the run while trying to keep Sana safe. This part of the story was pretty interesting because we get to see cool fights, meet the characters, meet the bad guys, etc. Right around the half-way point things start changing because we start learning characters motives. This leads to a lot of action, it explains why Phantom is chasing Sana, etc. There are also a few good plot twists that keep you on your seat. Overall, I thought the story was interesting and had the potential to be really good.The problem Innocent Venus has is it was too short. With only 12 episodes, they could have done some better planning. The second half seemed rushed because they just said characters motivations instead of showing us and they didn’t elaborate on anything. A lot was just said without any prior hint, which felt almost “cheap”. They could have dedicated an episode to flashback to previous events to make motives more clear, then another episode or 2 giving us some background information. At one point, a character tells us the truth behind something in a minute. If there were more episodes, that could have been an episode flashback (yes, there was enough information for an interesting episode).Because they didn’t have more episodes, there were also a lot of plot holes and wasted potential. I can’t mention all of them because of spoilers, but some things could have had more detail like: Why are Jo and Jin together? Why are some characters close to each other? Also, another thing that was disappointing with the plot was the separation between Logos and Revenus wasn’t significant at all really…they could have used that more effectively.Characters :: 7For the most part, I liked the characters. They all have unique designs and personalities. Jo is an awesome fighter and doesn’t speak much.  Jin is a good fighter, but he’s kind and caring towards Sana (wants to protect her). Sana starts off very attached to Jin and he’s all she talks about. She’s very kind, but can be a little annoying at times, not enough not to like her though.The problem with the characters is they don’t receive much background information because it’s only 12 episodes. For this problem, there were a few solutions: 1. Make the show longer. 2. Simplify the plot to allow characterization.  I think they should have made the show longer because the plot was good and the only suffered was because there was a lack of background information.We don’t know why characters like Shiba and Renee were close. What happened in the past with them? There are other things like why Jo is with Jin, why did they join Phantom, where did they come from, etc. I don’t expect detailed background on all the characters, but when the main cast is only 3 characters and the background for one of them (Sana) could easily have done wonders for the plot, I think they could have easily added background information.Animation :: 8.5The animation wasn’t spectacular, but it was definitely good. All the characters have unique designs and the backgrounds were all nicely done with color’s and detail. The fight scenes were also animated well, with everyone moving fluidly. As for the mecha, I actually liked the designs of them. They seemed pretty original and looked cool. Not the best, but they did their part and worked well with the story. The biggest thing people will notice is that the mecha are all CGI. At first, it didn’t look that great, but as the show progressed, the CGI got better and I got used to looking at them. Overall, I thought the CGI was integrated quite well and they all moved smoothly.Sound :: 7I’ll start with the voice acting. I watched it subbed, not dubbed, so I’ll comment on the Japanese voice actors. Everyone’s voiced matched pretty good, I especially liked Jin, Sana, and Shiba’s voices. They seemed perfect for the roles they were playing. The only voice I didn’t really like was Jo’s voice. It fit pretty good, but I felt it was off a little. I can’t really explain it too well. Honestly,  I didn’t listen to any of the openings or endings so I can’t comment on them…I just don’t like Japanese music very much…sorry… cat and mouse game.

Overall I truly enjoyed this anime and recommend it for viewing."", ""I have conflicted feelings about this anime series. Overall, I enjoyed it, but there are issues I have with this anime that ultimately leave me unsatisfied.The story of Innocent Venus is somewhat dark, with a major plot twist happening in the middle of the anime. Plot twists happen all the time, but this one feels slightly forced, since one of the main characters change significantly, and this was the biggest issue I had with this anime. This also relates to the issue with characters. Because of the fact that the characters are mainly flat, with the exception of the three protagonist, I felt attached to...the three main characters. Such significant change to one of the protagonist, even though it is foreshadowed a few times, felt somewhat ridiculous to me. Furthermore, the story of these three protagonists is embedded in a grand, intricate plot that was rushed through 12 episodes. Basically, the pacing was poor. At the beginning, it was basically all Jin, Jo and Sana running away from the military. All of a sudden, after the major plot twist, many different plot points are thrust into my brain. War between the rich and the poor, the Phantom's secret intention, Shiba's role in this war, too much information was cramped in the second half of the anime, while the first half was slow, slightly boring. I would even think about adding a few more episodes to slow the second part of the anime down. Other than these two major issues, the story is interesting enough for me to give it a 7/10.Like I have stated in the paragraph above, the characters of Innocent Venus, with the exception of Jin, Jo and Sana, are flat. The main problem is that they are one-dimensional, that they are flat characters. We have the obnoxious brat, the pirate leader who is secretly strong and influential, the secretary of the enemy whose heart still yearns for the pirate leader, the evil mastermind that has secret intentions to gain more power. Everyone felt the same throughout the anime, barely any characteristics are changed. It does not help that the anime show us very few of their lines of thought, their motivations for change. The characters are definitely not a strong point for this anime, and the three protagonists mask the issues. Jin, Jo and Sana felt real. I fully understand their motivations, their desires. Even Jo, the one who is aloof in the first part of the anime, showed me that he truly cares about Jin and Sana. The protagonists are the shining star among the characters.I have no clue how the animation would stack up against other mecha animes in 2006, but the movements of the Gladiators and the way they fight are acceptable in 2014 standards. The design of the Gladiators, however, were not anything memorable like Gundams. Characters are fairly generic. The music complements the anime good enough, but it is nothing special. These are also weak points of the anime that I did not like.Innocent Venus, in the end, has some entertainment value. Even if there are problems that leaves me unsatisfied, I still enjoyed it nonetheless. The story will eventually drag you in if you can endure the slow start and the rushed ending, and you will grow to like Jin, Jo and Sana, even with the major plot twist. the three main characters.

This one, the original one, has the main characters, Rinko, Minami and Aoi, they're high schools girls with a normal life, however everything changes when jewel charms scatter all around the human world.Jewelpets find their rightful partners as they try to fight against Diana and her brother (in this series anyway) Dian, they also...encounter new jewel pets as the time goes on. Also the transformation of jewel pets somehow reminded me of Sailor Moon, not sure why, the two have almost no similarities.Art 6/10There's nothing that really interested me in this art, but I think the art style was pretty decent.Sound 7/10The english and czech opening got stuck in my head, even if I don't exactly remember it so I guess that's good.Character 6/10Jewelpet focuses more on the story rather than the characters, so there's not much to say about them, I enjoyed Ruby's clumsiness throughout various episodes though.Enjoyment and Overall 7/10As a person who was deeply fascinated by this and tried not to miss a single episode during childhood, I think the overall anime was fairly good.It's a normal magical girl anime, only with pets transforming into gems. So if you like that type of anime, I guess I'd recommend it to you. encounter new jewel pets as the time goes on.

Turns out he was a minor character. I like Tour instead now but its a bummer because I was hyped to see his story if he had one. Turns out hes just some reused 1 in a lifetime minor villian for every season and then the modern jewelpet just made him a 1 off filler cameo. That\'s the problem with the show... I\'ll get to...that.This goes out to the entirity of Jewelpet. Don\'t watch this.

Stop. I dont know how this show is still popular and how no ones mentioning this but it really needs to stop. Its a supposed niche made for kids and it gets stuff like that constantly?The story... All of the jewelpet anime\'s stories are really generic. They\'re all predictable and if you\'ve seen Precure then youd be familiar with the stories. So by default they\'re ""Good"" but not in a way that its their own. The jewelpets are just mascots/fairies and the main characters are just your flavor of the day pretty cure warriors.

It did okay, its popular af but it wont hold up to Pretty Cure.The characters are downright ugly. The humans look real uncanny and they look more like an 80\'s anime character than a mid 2000\'s.

I dont understand how furries are so attracted to these... things. For starters, their main thing. Their eyes. They\'re basically 70% of their big ol head. They\'re really weird and uncanny to look at. They have unnecessary shine.

Hidan no Aria,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8630/Hidan_no_Aria,"['There was a time when I, too, had faith in J.C. Staff. I still do, actually. I’m stubborn. But try as I might to cling fondly to the days gone by, to classics like Azumanga Daioh and Excel Saga, even guilty pleasures like Shakugan no Shana, it seems that J.C. Staff is relentless in their efforts to drive me away. An admirable mission, that.So here is Hidan no Aria. I’ll confess. I was excited. I have a soft spot for action harems, loathe though I am to admit it. I’m one of the last cynics in anime fandom who doesn’t completely loathe Rie Kugimiya (she’s...not bad, she’s got range; it’s not her fault the squeal is what sells, and everybody’s got to pay the bills). Takashi Watanabe of Boogiepop and Shana was directing, and early promotional artwork looked…well, not promising, but certainly not the worst of the genre. I didn’t get my hopes up, but I expected the kind of show I could guiltily binge on and then tell all my friends I hated to keep up the elabourate façade that I am a man of taste.All this is just so you know that I gave Aria a fighting chance.With all that said, it’s bad. I mean it’s really bad. Not Togainu no Chi bad, but nowadays my attention can only be diverted from erotic fanfiction and 80’s movies to tear an especially terrible Japanese cartoon a new arsehole, because I like easy targets. So that’s the terminology we’ll settle on—especially terrible. And it is. It is a new low for J.C. Staff.But I’ve beat around the bush long enough. Let’s get to the point.The world of Hidan no Aria is one where the Butei, an elite international martial organisation, trains its members at the high school level. That’s right. In this world, international treaties on child labour are unheard of, and hundreds of parents see no issue with sending their children to a school where the use of firearms is not only commonplace, but required. Furthermore, the students of Tokyo Butei High—quite unlike my high school classmates, most of whom, by the time graduation rolled around, had yet to master the delicate art of pissing straight—perform incredibly well in this environment. Oh, but it’s not just the coursework they have to worry about. Butei High students must apply their lessons to real life when they are targeted by the Butei Killer—a criminal who sends high-speed Saw-esque murder puzzles after the teenage students. This individual has yet to be apprehended, as Butei graduates and all other law enforcement agents have better things to do than bother with a serial criminal with a rigidly-defined M.O. who regularly targets minors, and endangers civilians in the process. Yep.Now, I wouldn’t still be watching anime if I had issues with suspending my disbelief, but would it really have been so hard to age the cast up four or five years, to college-age? The plot would remain practically untouched, and, really, it’s got nowhere to go but up. But I digress.The rest of the plot involves a lot of looking at girls’ underwear (whether it is on their bodies or off), and some nonsense about Sherlock Holmes and other fictional characters (and at least one out-of-place historical figure) that is so astonishingly, mind-numbingly stupid that I have no words for it. Aspiring writers, hark! Don’t always stick with the first idea you get, because it is usually righteously fucking ridiculous.The animators seem to stumble over the character designs despite the fact that they are not terribly complex. Characters are frequently off-model, and their movements are stiff and awkward. Their hair moves bizarrely, even by anime standards: when disturbed it jumps up suddenly at an odd angle and waves around for a while before jumping back into place. Fabric works much the same way. Inbetweens are practically non-existent, leading to movement that looks like jumpy cardboard rather than a fluid transition from one position to the next. Furthermore, all of J.C. Staff’s recent productions have had this weird kind of Gaussian-blur layer over every frame, making the outlines blurry and subdued. The animation isn’t awful, per se, but it’s mediocre at best.I don’t have much to say on the show’s score. It’s boring. The themes are fast-paced, but forgettable and generic, while most of the background music kind of blurs together. The purpose of a soundtrack is to elicit emotional response and set the mood for a scene. Aria’s music is just kind of there because they had, like, way too much money and thought it would be cool to buy a composer. The vocal work is...well, you know what you’re getting. Rie Kugimiya puts on the sort of performance she is infamous for, Junji Majima is a forgettable harem lead, and the rest of the cast could all switch places and I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.The real beauty of Aria (and I mean that in the most bitter, sarcastic, miserable way) lies in its titular character. Aria H. Kanzaki is evil. I really mean it. She is a special kind of sadistic, childish evil, unfettered by the cautious try-hard some authors exhibit when writing adults. She is rotten to the core. She is spoilt, murderously violent, infinitely selfish, and utterly loathsome. If she were the antagonist, I might even be giving this show a positive review. I would be forced to tip my hat to an author so skilled at manipulating his readers that he can craft a character that summons such immediate distaste in everyone. I’m not a violent person, but I’d say she needs a bit of discipline in the form of a high-speed baseball bat to the mouth.But she’s not the antagonist. She’s not even an easily-overlooked secondary character. Her name’s in the title. And we are supposed to love her. We are supposed to pile our disposable income on Blu-Rays and posters bearing her visage, on models of her likeness to sit precariously upon our shelves so that we can steal a peek at her plastic panties.Aria H. Kanzaki is really the lowest the tsundere phenomenon can go. I don’t have anything against tsunderes, really. In fact, when written carefully and realistically, they are some of my favourite characters. Aria is not a tsundere. She’s a psychopath and a bully. She is hysterical, she is capricious, she is downright mean—she is everything that might lead a man (were he so inclined) to roll his eyes and scoff and say, “Women! Am I right?”Which is a good segue into my next point.I’m not mad at Aria, because she is a fictional character, and that would be silly. I am mad, however—frothingly so—at the author. Chuugaku Akamatsu has written a character who he believes to be a sympathetic woman. The audience is supposed to watch her temper tantrums and violent fits the same way we might watch an angry child, despite the fact that Aria is more than old enough to know better. Her fits of rage aren’t horrifying—they’re cute! This sort of behaviour is just the thing the author—and, he perceives, his audience—expects out of a woman.Now, we could say that Aria’s temper—and, by extension, the exceedingly childish behaviour of most of the rest of the female cast—is just the author clumsily trying to write a realistically flawed character. People aren’t perfect, after all, and violently temperamental women (and men) do exist!But I’m not stupid, and, hopefully, neither are you.The author’s intent matters. The target audience matters. The moe phenomenon matters. Japanese society and its views on women matter. The context matters.Look. I’m not saying that you’re a bad person if you enjoyed Hidan no Aria. Do what makes you happy. I’m not saying that you’re a bad person if you enjoy any fiction that carries some unfortunate implications in its characterisation of women, people of colour, GLBT people, or any minority—it’s perfectly possible for a story that is otherwise well-written to stumble a bit when it comes to political correctness (and I hate that fucking term, because it implies that treating other people like human beings should be done out of obligation and not common sense), and this is okay, as long as it is discussed. And I’m not trying to take away your titty anime. There are plenty of shows that reward the viewer with gratuitous unmentionables while at the same time sporting a cast of realistic, relatable, well-written female characters. In fact, if Hidan no Aria was a good show that happened to have a horrible female lead, I might not even mention it. Well, maybe in passing.But Hidan no Aria is bad, and I hate it, and writing this review feels like a weight off my shoulders after nearly five hours wasted on this garbage. So I will mention it.

Well, maybe in passing.But Hidan no Aria is bad, and I hate it, and writing this review feels like a weight off my shoulders after nearly five hours wasted on this garbage. So I will mention it. And I did. And I think I’m done now.', 'I really am trying to not become one of those cynical anime watchers who think the best has already come and never will again, but you’re really trying my resolve this year Japan.  Hidan no Aria was a show that for whatever reason I had a great deal of excitement and anticipation for.  I was won over by the early pre-production artwork without knowing really anything at all about what it was going to be about or the source materials.  When I learned the seiyuu cast and the plot synopsis I was pretty sure what I was going to be in store...for.  In that sense I probably shouldn\'t have been disappointed at all.What Hidan no Aria gives us as a premise is about as generic and played as it comes.  A high school boy... sigh why is it I always have to start it with that?  Anyway he goes to Butai High School, a place where Japan teaches its youngsters to be assassins, thieves, and super powered shrine maidens.  It’s like any other anime high school except the students all carry guns and katanas.  No seriously it’s just like every other high school.  So from there our hero, Kinji, suitably useless and powerless Japanese male gets involved right off the bat with the more dangerous female classmates who either want his body or him dead or more often both.  Of course Kinji is able to tap into a hidden power of his own called ""Hysteria Mode"" which he enters from being sexually aroused.  Really I\'m serious here.  I can\'t make this stuff up.  Further nonsense ensues from this point and I honestly couldn’t make heads or tails of any of it from the beginning.As with most anime of this type it likes to throw out tons of nonsensical and contradictory terminology and other assorted garbage. While in the beginning it doesn\'t seem like that much of a stretch it really starts to take a turn for the bizarre after a few episodes.  That’s when we start having characters assigned names from other fictional and totally unrelated content.  Such as Sherlock Holmes, Lupin IV, Jeane of Arc, and Dracula?  It’s a mishmash of themes that have absolutely nothing in common with each other and make no sense when even applied to the story.  It’s almost like the author of the story just picked random names from a library shelf and jammed them into his story as if they applied some sort of deeper meaning to it.  The names don’t even have any bearing on how the characters act either.  Jeane of Arc has ice powers, Dracula is a werewolf, and Holmes is a gun totting, dual katana wielding loli.  Wuh?   This only further confuses an already pointless and directionless story which doesn\'t seem to stick to one theme for more than a few episodes before meandering off into another direction.   All in all it’s bad... REALLY BAD.  Perhaps the worst excuse for a story I have seen in anything to date.That brings us to the characters which really don’t far much better.  Our hero Kinji is barely worth mentioning.  Seriously when are they going to just stop giving the guys in anime names or even bother drawing on faces on them anymore?  Just go ahead and give in to the otaku pervs and just complete the fantasy by having replacing them with faceless stick figures to allow them to complete their 2D on screen fantasy.As for the girls the results are bad, even for a harem.  Other than Aria the other girls are pretty much unmentionable.  Aria is your standard loli tsundere.  She says all of the things you would expect of her archetype and is performed brilliant by the undisputed seiyuu queen of this type, Rie Kugimiya.  As much of a completely uninspired character or even acting performance that makes Aria up, it is Kugimiya that makes this series even remotely palatable to watch.  Sure we have seen her do this role dozens of times before but I for one really never grow tired of it.  In that sense it is a thoroughly Kugimiya type performance that is right in her wheel house and one that she completely hits out of the park.  The real question is how many people are, unlike me, totally sick and tired of it?J.C. Staff is usually pretty solid with their animation and production values and that doesn\'t really change here.  But a lot like Kugimiya, I suspect a great many viewers are becoming weary of seeing the same damn thing over and over again.  It would be nice to see them try to stretch themselves sometimes and be unafraid to take some risks.  The one thing that really did stand out to me was how utterly silly the various girls hid their weapons.  Take Aria, who is a tiny girl with an impossibly short skirt yet somehow manages to hid 2 enormous pistols under it and yet not be constantly seen when she is not drawing them.  In addition to the even more ridiculous dual katanas she hides, under her blouse.  It seems Aria\'s clothes are a lot like Doctor Who\'s TARDIS: bigger inside than it appears from the outside.  Not that this is the first time anime has played with physics before but this really seemed to stretch the realm of believability.From an acting and sound standpoint, Hidan no Aria is very good.  As mentioned I think Rie Kugimiya was in her element and delivered a very enjoyable performance.  The rest of the cast played their parts as expected.  The music was pretty exciting and good.  I especially enjoyed May\'n Scarlet Ballet.I actually found a great amount of this series to be amusing, mostly because I am a Kugimiya fangirl.  As nonsensical and clichéd as everything about this anime was there was plenty of amusement to be found in watching the characters act this way.  But at the same time I am fully aware that pretty much everything else about this show is terrible.  For that reason I can’t recommend it to anyone. for.

The real question is how many people are, unlike me, totally sick and tired of it?J.C. Staff is usually pretty solid with their animation and production values and that doesn\'t really change here.  But a lot like Kugimiya, I suspect a great many viewers are becoming weary of seeing the same damn thing over and over again.  It would be nice to see them try to stretch themselves sometimes and be unafraid to take some risks.  The one thing that really did stand out to me was how utterly silly the various girls hid their weapons.  Take Aria, who is a tiny girl with an impossibly short skirt yet somehow manages to hid 2 enormous pistols under it and yet not be constantly seen when she is not drawing them.  In addition to the even more ridiculous dual katanas she hides, under her blouse.  It seems Aria\'s clothes are a lot like Doctor Who\'s TARDIS: bigger inside than it appears from the outside.  Not that this is the first time anime has played with physics before but this really seemed to stretch the realm of believability.From an acting and sound standpoint, Hidan no Aria is very good.  As mentioned I think Rie Kugimiya was in her element and delivered a very enjoyable performance.  The rest of the cast played their parts as expected.  The music was pretty exciting and good.  I especially enjoyed May\'n Scarlet Ballet.I actually found a great amount of this series to be amusing, mostly because I am a Kugimiya fangirl.  As nonsensical and clichéd as everything about this anime was there was plenty of amusement to be found in watching the characters act this way.  But at the same time I am fully aware that pretty much everything else about this show is terrible.  For that reason I can’t recommend it to anyone.', 'This is bad, guys. I mean, it\'s really REALLY bad!\'Hidan no Aria\' has just about every cliche harem elements in the book. The premise focusing on a special occupation to try to be unique, the characters strip and trip randomly for fan service, violent retribution for accidental infringement, archetype heroines, obvious tsundere stuttering, ordinary high school student with hidden special powers, protagonist is surrounded by girls who are crazy about him for no reason... I can go on and on.The core premise is somewhat interesting. It\'s set in a school that trains mercenaries, and the students undergo various lethal training and get credits through actual...missions. However, there are also a lot of stupid concepts going on, like all them being ""butei"" (combat detectives), the Hysteria Mode, and the fact that almost every character is descendent of a famous historical and fictional figures - Lupin the 3rd, Sherlock Holmes, Joan of Arc, Tooyama Kinshirou, Himiko, Count Dracula... it gets embarrassing to watch after a while.The story consists of one improbable event after another. The character and villain\'s actions rarely make any sense. It gets so bad that a good guy would point the gun at the bad guy and say something like ""there\'s no escape now"", and the bad guy just runs without getting shot. I had no idea why this series needed to be about ""detectives"" as there were almost zero thinking going on. It\'s more like charge in first and see what happens next. It\'s also pretty absurd all the characters were carrying the gun and shoots around in the school campus, and of course, everything is bullet proof so no one gets hurt. The jokes get repetitive, with the protagonist getting into ecchi situation with random girls, and seen by one of the yandere/tsundere heroines and gets ""kaza-ana"".Worst of all is the protagonist\'s ""Hysteria Mode"", which gets triggered from sexual arousal. This is the stupidest activation trigger I have ever heard, and serves only as a tool for fan service.Art in this series is decent. The female characters are attractive, though extremely generic design. Character movement is very stiff and apparently low budget, but there are some nice slow motion action scenes that it\'s at least average quality in terms of animation.The voicing for Aria is absolutely horrible, a stereotypical tsundere voice with zero distinction. Not only that, it gets seriously annoying after a while. Other characters\' seiyuu were average at best. BGM is quite insignificant, and OP/ED were average.There is nothing in \'Hidan no Aria\' that sets it apart from hundreds of other harem series. It\'s obvious why a certain fansub group would trollsub a series like this, and in fact, the sound effects guys in this series started trolling in latter part of this series, like inserting sheep sounds at the mention of 「執事」, a word meaning ""butler"" but has similar pronunciation to Japanese word ""sheep"".Admittedly, Riko\'s character was extremely hot both in design and personality, and ecchi in this series was decent. It\'s one of those series you watch to kill time, and see how bad it gets. B-But it\'s not like I enjoy watching this series or anything! missions.

This is a show you’re bound to regret watching. It’s extremely clichéd, mediocre quality and a money-maker, and above all – annoying. But so ridiculously it sometimes is amusing.Still, two things make this series for me:1.\tAria’s hairpin which is sadly gone after a while,2.\tKinji’s Hysteria Mode.Beyond that, there is not much to see here. But then again – what can you expect from a series that was already highly overrated by the Japanese fans even before it aired? I should probably have said otaku instead of Japanese fans, excuse me, but that’s what happened, with...this series being the most anticipated one of Spring 2011 season. Why, yes – in Japan. Don’t they love Kugimiya.Story- and character-wise, what’s in it? Tsundere (but not the likeable kind, the I-have-seen-this-how-many-times-now kind) female lead – check. Male protagonist being useless 95% of the time – check. Veeeeery unexpected plot twist in early part of the show – check. A bunch of supporting characters that are there just to try to fill us in on the backstory and still fail miserably – check. Great. The two protagonists attend a mostly ridiculous school where teenagers are trained to be detectives - or rather super agents - and so far the plot has been focusing on how cute Aria is. But she is not. She is another Taiga/Louise/Shana clone created just to please the fans. There are moments when she is bearable; yet that is mostly when she is not talking at all. And the Holmes crap? I thought Lupin the 4th was quite funny, but they had to add Holmes the 4th into it. Wow, just wow. UPDATE: they also tossed Jeanne d’Arc in. I thought that nothing could surprise me anymore.And what about Kinji/Ryûji? The 5% he’s not useless is when in Hysteria Mode, which he is reluctant to enter because it makes him act retarded. In his opinion. It does not.In terms of visuals J.C. Staff did just reasonably. I like how the opening and ending sequences are animated, plus the fights - the fights are great eye candy. The rest is not something we have not seen yet. I’m just quite surprised that they do not animate the protagonist loli particularly well. Low budget? No way. Laziness? More like it. Little can be said about the art of “Hidan no Aria”. It’s not bad, it’s just nothing spectacular, and given how new anime can look, I’d call it a tad disappointing.The sound is a different story. Good background music, that’s certain; OP and ED, just fitting for this series, are average; but for once I must complain about the voice actors. Rie Kugimiya – if it was not for Kagura, she could disappear completely from the face of Earth. She does not create her characters. She IS them. Very, very disappointing. She brings nothing new into yet another show. I used to like her voice, but damn, isn’t it annoying. Now it’s just painful. Boring, too. Just remain Kagura, that’s what you do well (and Taiga, for that matter). Going on with the list: Mariya Ise was a good Stocking, but performs just typically as Riko; Junji Majima is Ryûji, end of story.Somehow I managed to watch the entire thing. SOMEHOW. The second half gets far worse than the first, which, frankly, is an achievement. Just do not watch it. At all.Very not recommended. this series being the most anticipated one of Spring 2011 season.

That statement alone should sound pretty awesome, right? ... Right?Unfortunately, this is not the case. Oh, on everything that is sacred, is this not the case. But, it\'s not enough to say that this is a load of crap that deserves any and every amount of ridicule that it gets; this needs to be broken down, bit by bit, to expose it for the grim piece of bloody, scarlet-colored turd that it really is.With that said, let\'s begin with the opening song--the thing the audience hears at the start of every episode.I, personally, have nothing against May\'n....However, this song began to get annoying after a while due to the immediate pretentiousness that it brings along. The gun and firing sound effects, the cathedral with a picture of (what I assume to be) the birth of Jesus, front-and-center, and then Aria, the heroine of the show, staring at the audience blankly in the face--it speaks for itself.Oh, and need I remind everyone that Aria\'s supposed to be the main character here? With all of the sarcasm in every fiber of my being, I don\'t think the opening made it clear enough! There needs to be even MORE Aria! Her shooting a bullet at the audience\'s faces? Perfect!Anyway, what are all of the guns about? Well, let me explain as frankly as I can.Apparently, in our modern-day world, it\'s perfectly okay and only natural to give teenagers, who are still going through emotional and psychological development, a vast assortment of armaments and weaponry and virtual access to anywhere in the world. Not only that, they\'re also taught how to use said weaponry to great detail and are sent on missions that could potentially endanger their lives.And they\'re accomplishing all of this... wait for it...... in a Japanese high school.Forget all of the legal trouble that would cause, how something as ridiculous as that would even get off the ground, and even the idea that such a thing may be better-off in the hands of ANYONE older by just a few more years; just use your suspension of disbelief, everyone!The first episode starts us off with the usual Kyon-type character, Kinji Tooyama, who isn\'t really the main character, but supposed to simply act as support. What is his aspiration for the future? Why, to live a normal, everyday life! Wow, really pushing the limits of characterization here, aren\'t you, J.C. Staff? I can\'t wait for him to live out his everyday--no, wait, he gets attacked by the villain of the show before the audience actually gets to know him. Pfft, so much for his goals!But, when he thinks that he\'s nearly dead meat, stuck in a death trap that will surely cost him his well-being, there goes the true heroine, Aria H. Kanzaki, to save the day! And this is pretty much the only time that she gets to be cool before becoming the laughing stock of all that is ""tsun.""Why? Because the Kyon-type character gets a raging hard-on from seeing Aria in her underwear after saving him and becomes the actual hero, stopping the baddies because he\'s too cool for school. Really. That happens.Kinji monologues later that he has a special ability known as ""Hysteria Mode"" that actually makes him an instantaneous, top-ranked assassin everytime he gets a boner; I\'m not even joking. This happens quite a lot throughout the series because Kinji just can\'t keep it down, and nearly all of the female characters lose their dignity to this because it\'s the only thing that makes him worth anything in this show.Hey, it\'s not like this could be Black Lagoon or Kara no Kyoukai where a woman kept her dignity, was a central character AND completely awesome. Come on, Hidan no Aria! I don\'t think there are enough breasts flopping around or widescreen panty-shots for the audience!But, wait! I\'ve spent all of this time talking about Kinji! What about Aria, the shining, tsundere selling-point of the show?Well, that\'s really all there is to her. Aria is a tsundere to the nth degree. She even initially calls Kinji her ""slave"" and lives with him, very similarly to ANOTHER show made by J.C. Staff. Heck, she\'s so tsundere that she becomes unlikable mere seconds after she speaks because of how much a squealing, raging runt that she is, and her gimmick is that she will constantly fire her guns at Kinji while screaming at him that he\'s either a pervert or stupid. The girl even admits that she doesn\'t have any friends. Hmm, I wonder why!Oh, and I nearly forgot to mention that the show tries to be cute by adding in references to fictional detective characters, such as Lupin and Holmes, stating that the ""H"" in Aria\'s middle name stands for ""Holmes"" and that she--a whiny, putrid, pink-haired good-for-nothing--is his descendant.And by ""good-for-nothing"", I mean it. Aria is supposed to be a top-ranked assassin--even given the nickname ""Aria the Quadra"" for her use of four weapons--and yet, she\'s always needing saving, doesn\'t have any regard for human life other than her own, and has the attitude of a spoiled, indecisive, quickly-amused child.Why is she regarded as the ""best"" again? Why is everyone putting the most difficult missions on her shoulders? Why couldn\'t the crazy world that this story encompasses just trade her in for a better lead character?Oh, yes, I almost forgot BECAUSE MERCHANDISING DEMANDS IT.Not to mention, the audience, as does Kinji, is clearly supposed to find her physically appealing, too. Sorry, but personally, I can\'t find a hateful, loathsome numb-nut attractive. I\'d rather go with the blonde chick who\'s into eroge and frilly dresses that also appears in this show, thank you.Moving on, when it comes to the plot itself, it\'s not even anything worth sneezing at. Many of the plot-twists are those anyone could see coming from a mile away, the characters also pull-off stunts that are near-impossible (if not, completely impossible under human conditions), and some characters appear only once or twice for plot-convenience and are never heard from or seen ever again (i.e., Reki, Jeanne d\'Arc, etc.). There are even some points in the story that are barely touched upon, such as the supernatural powers that come forth numerous times.The art is bland and one-dimensional, and the animation is typically stiff all of the time. The soundtrack is completely unnoticeable for the most part, save for the opening and ending themes, which are simply okay at best.Overall, without giving too much away about the plot, this was painful--just downright painful. It has a plot and setting that would make Swiss cheese blush and horrible characters that are unsympathetic, stereotypical, and--more than often--outrageously annoying; not to mention, a pretentious presentation of nothing special that is of a (hopefully) dying breed.If anyone else managed to sit through this garbage until the end (like I did), they deserve a medal. I can only hope that with such a low bar set, J.C. Staff will make their upcoming series, Kamisama no Memochou, an aspiring improvement.Please don\'t bother twiddling your thumbs with the possibility of a second season, J.C. Staff; otherwise, I fear the worst--that everyone will just stop caring~ However, this song began to get annoying after a while due to the immediate pretentiousness that it brings along. The gun and firing sound effects, the cathedral with a picture of (what I assume to be) the birth of Jesus, front-and-center, and then Aria, the heroine of the show, staring at the audience blankly in the face--it speaks for itself.Oh, and need I remind everyone that Aria\'s supposed to be the main character here? With all of the sarcasm in every fiber of my being, I don\'t think the opening made it clear enough! There needs to be even MORE Aria! Her shooting a bullet at the audience\'s faces? Perfect!Anyway, what are all of the guns about? Well, let me explain as frankly as I can.Apparently, in our modern-day world, it\'s perfectly okay and only natural to give teenagers, who are still going through emotional and psychological development, a vast assortment of armaments and weaponry and virtual access to anywhere in the world. Not only that, they\'re also taught how to use said weaponry to great detail and are sent on missions that could potentially endanger their lives.And they\'re accomplishing all of this... wait for it...... in a Japanese high school.Forget all of the legal trouble that would cause, how something as ridiculous as that would even get off the ground, and even the idea that such a thing may be better-off in the hands of ANYONE older by just a few more years; just use your suspension of disbelief, everyone!The first episode starts us off with the usual Kyon-type character, Kinji Tooyama, who isn\'t really the main character, but supposed to simply act as support. What is his aspiration for the future? Why, to live a normal, everyday life! Wow, really pushing the limits of characterization here, aren\'t you, J.C. Staff? I can\'t wait for him to live out his everyday--no, wait, he gets attacked by the villain of the show before the audience actually gets to know him. Pfft, so much for his goals!But, when he thinks that he\'s nearly dead meat, stuck in a death trap that will surely cost him his well-being, there goes the true heroine, Aria H. Kanzaki, to save the day! And this is pretty much the only time that she gets to be cool before becoming the laughing stock of all that is ""tsun.""Why? Because the Kyon-type character gets a raging hard-on from seeing Aria in her underwear after saving him and becomes the actual hero, stopping the baddies because he\'s too cool for school. Really. That happens.Kinji monologues later that he has a special ability known as ""Hysteria Mode"" that actually makes him an instantaneous, top-ranked assassin everytime he gets a boner; I\'m not even joking. This happens quite a lot throughout the series because Kinji just can\'t keep it down, and nearly all of the female characters lose their dignity to this because it\'s the only thing that makes him worth anything in this show.Hey, it\'s not like this could be Black Lagoon or Kara no Kyoukai where a woman kept her dignity, was a central character AND completely awesome. Come on, Hidan no Aria! I don\'t think there are enough breasts flopping around or widescreen panty-shots for the audience!But, wait! I\'ve spent all of this time talking about Kinji! What about Aria, the shining, tsundere selling-point of the show?Well, that\'s really all there is to her. Aria is a tsundere to the nth degree. She even initially calls Kinji her ""slave"" and lives with him, very similarly to ANOTHER show made by J.C. Staff. Heck, she\'s so tsundere that she becomes unlikable mere seconds after she speaks because of how much a squealing, raging runt that she is, and her gimmick is that she will constantly fire her guns at Kinji while screaming at him that he\'s either a pervert or stupid. The girl even admits that she doesn\'t have any friends. Hmm, I wonder why!Oh, and I nearly forgot to mention that the show tries to be cute by adding in references to fictional detective characters, such as Lupin and Holmes, stating that the ""H"" in Aria\'s middle name stands for ""Holmes"" and that she--a whiny, putrid, pink-haired good-for-nothing--is his descendant.And by ""good-for-nothing"", I mean it. Aria is supposed to be a top-ranked assassin--even given the nickname ""Aria the Quadra"" for her use of four weapons--and yet, she\'s always needing saving, doesn\'t have any regard for human life other than her own, and has the attitude of a spoiled, indecisive, quickly-amused child.Why is she regarded as the ""best"" again? Why is everyone putting the most difficult missions on her shoulders? Why couldn\'t the crazy world that this story encompasses just trade her in for a better lead character?Oh, yes, I almost forgot BECAUSE MERCHANDISING DEMANDS IT.Not to mention, the audience, as does Kinji, is clearly supposed to find her physically appealing, too. Sorry, but personally, I can\'t find a hateful, loathsome numb-nut attractive. I\'d rather go with the blonde chick who\'s into eroge and frilly dresses that also appears in this show, thank you.Moving on, when it comes to the plot itself, it\'s not even anything worth sneezing at. Many of the plot-twists are those anyone could see coming from a mile away, the characters also pull-off stunts that are near-impossible (if not, completely impossible under human conditions), and some characters appear only once or twice for plot-convenience and are never heard from or seen ever again (i.e., Reki, Jeanne d\'Arc, etc.). There are even some points in the story that are barely touched upon, such as the supernatural powers that come forth numerous times.The art is bland and one-dimensional, and the animation is typically stiff all of the time. The soundtrack is completely unnoticeable for the most part, save for the opening and ending themes, which are simply okay at best.Overall, without giving too much away about the plot, this was painful--just downright painful. It has a plot and setting that would make Swiss cheese blush and horrible characters that are unsympathetic, stereotypical, and--more than often--outrageously annoying; not to mention, a pretentious presentation of nothing special that is of a (hopefully) dying breed.If anyone else managed to sit through this garbage until the end (like I did), they deserve a medal. I can only hope that with such a low bar set, J.C. Staff will make their upcoming series, Kamisama no Memochou, an aspiring improvement.Please don\'t bother twiddling your thumbs with the possibility of a second season, J.C. Staff; otherwise, I fear the worst--that everyone will just stop caring~', '*Updated on May 30, 2011*Most of us can recognize tropes and cliches from a mile away, well consider this the picture book for tropes and cliches, which you can look all you want and if you\'ve seen this ""book"" before, it won\'t be much for those whom seen it already, despite the fact it\'s one of those books where you can hide a gun in.*The first review is a first episode basis review, after that it\'s the real deal.*EPISODE 1 REVIEW: It starts out with a teenage boy named Kinji riding his bike at ludicrous speeds that would make bmxers envious appears to be chased...after right off the bat by a...?A segway armed with an uzi and a speaker attached to it? Weird.But at least there\'s a better reason for him to speeding the way he is, there\'s a bomb under his seat, literally, and it is set to blow up if he lowers his ""Speed"".Lucky for him a young, long haired, flat chested (Whom\'s breast will be the butt of many ecchi jokes no doubt) girl named Shana! Er...Taiga! Oh wait, Aria, who comes to his rescue with CG gunfire.But this is what happened before any of this; the main character is getting ready for mercenary school (With guns, bullet proof vests, and all sorts of cool shit) while listening to his hormonal friend cry about everything the main character does or say making her instantly annoying (While the main character tries his best to keep a ""whatever man"" attitude), but she has big boobies and all is forgiven.Meanwhile a teacher at said school is giving out an introduction to a class about the school and mentioning a criminal who is out killing the students (The teacher really doesn\'t seem bothered by this so the adults in this anime probably don\'t give a shit).The anime then fast forwards back to where it left off and the two characters are in an awkward sexual position and the main freaks out and takes the chance to check out his companion who has issues with her bodily proportions whom also freaks out accordingly.But the antics come to a close as a pack of blood thirsty uzi segways starts to shoot up the place, but unfortunately for the segways the main character has the ability to abruptly swap out his character for a total badass who then, after chasing the segways away with CG animation gunfire, starts putting the moves on Aria who he thinks is a middle or elementary schooler (Who\'d blame him? and creepy), but of course she\'s in high school (Obvious as hell)!After that the main character proceeds to school while nonchalantly explaining that his family genes is the reason he can swap to a more fun character to watch called ""Hysteria mode"" (Oh I see, it makes sense now, I guess?), then when he reaches his homeroom, Aria is there and everyone calls them lovers.Afterwards Aria moves in with him out of the blue, the end.My obnoxiously massive sarcasms aside, this anime has many routes it can go judging off the first episode, but many of those roads may cause a severe case of dejavu for many viewers who at this point couldn\'t care less about another ecchi or harem anime, but for those who don\'t know the tropes and cliches or feel comfortable watching familiar elements will most likely enjoy this anime the most._____________________________________________________________________________REAL REVIEW*I\'m spoiling a lot, but frankly, I don\'t give a f**k*What\'s popular isn\'t necessarily good, but what\'s good isn\'t necessarily popular, Aria painfully falls into the former.STORY: J C has made some of the most popular anime out there, Shakugan no Shana, Toradora, Azumanga Daioh, and Toaru Majutsu no Index are all great examples. So obviously they want to continue the trend train with another runaway hit, right?Well this is the good example of ""Animate whatever random light novel that\'s out there, no matter what it is,"" syndrome, which is now common for many animation studios.Too common for J C unfortunately, my guess would be that J C took one look at the titular character and thought, ""Hey, she\'s underdeveloped physically, she\'s flat chested, and has long hair! By god, she\'s like the last couple of girls we animated, and even the novels she\'s in are popular! Let\'s animate this!""Well, let me put my syndrome in this way: it\'s kinda like the pokemon games, it gets staler and staler with each and every game, same ole same ole.Unlike the required updates for the pokemon games though, the anime J C puts out is lesser quality for this one, even Shana (An anime that\'s over 5 years old now) looks noticeably better than Aria, an anime that started in early-mid 2011, which anyone would easily be justified to call it lazy.But let\'s look at the story now, that always compensates any lack luster animation, right?Ehhh, it starts out being nothing special in the least, main male character starts to bond with Aria by doing small stuff like looking for a cat, or going on a date, though it was more babysitting than anything else. Though the male has his unique (Yet random) character trait that literally changes his entire character from typical main male lead who\'s just a tool for the ladies to mr suave lady killer bad ass, which is quite refreshing for that role... but he doesn\'t do it enough and just leaves you feeling more desired, though if it did happen more, the anime would just be a full on harem because he has to be (sexually) excited in order for it to happen.But the on going plot has to do with a criminal called the butei (Butei, sounds a lot like it\'s pronounced ""booty"" in english, obviously not a lot of thought was put into this name decision) killer, who arranges EVERY life or death situation like the movie ""Speed"" by hijacking vehicles from segways to planes and setting bombs all over the place, doing it once was good enough for people to smile at and say ""It\'s like that movie, that cool,"" but three more times? With each becoming more ridiculous than the last, like it\'s trying to out do it\'s self.Then the anime immediately train wreaks by episode 4.By that I mean character twists in that episode are embarrassingly ridiculous, one of the characters, the culprit (Who barely gets much screen time, that on top of her weak motives for doing the crimes) reveals that she is the descendant of Lupin, then reveals that Aria is the descendant of Sherlock HolmesSherlock Holmes vs Lupin, let it sink it and just try to convince yourself that this doesn\'t sound stupid in the least.There was absolutely no sign of Aria\'s relation to Holmes. 100% completely out of the blue, and for no good reason for either character, with only Aria\'s middle initial and a silhouette of Sherlock himself in the opening animation as lazy hints clues, all the while it abruptly ends the first main story.It\'s such a bad twist that even M. Night Shyamalan himself would facepalm.And for some reason they start treating the whole thing like they solved an actual case... Seriously, at the end of episode 5 one of them says case solved out of no where, which was just damn stupid of them to say because the criminal reveals herself to them and even runs away as well, what the hell has been solved? My limit towards nonsensical bullshit?She could honestly continue to rip off that movie to still cause mayhem and just because they know who she is, doesn\'t mean they can stop it, she did it four time or more and she can continue to do it again without anything to worry about, another person could just take over for her because that way of hijacking doesn\'t look hard at all to pull off.And speaking of the culprit, she herself is the most ridiculous and nonsensical person of the whole bunch.From revealing secrets to just seemingly making up whatever bullshit she wants, it\'ll just make you groan with irritation.Not to mention that she performs feats of sheer nonsense, to using her hair as a weapon with no explanation until episodes later (Even the most mediocre shonen series would at least explain at the moment for whats happening in the context of it\'s world), to using her own clothes as a parachute.Ridiculous, typical, looks cheap, and rehash, I\'m sure there\'s more words to describe the mediocre anime that is Hidan no Aria, but that\'s just enough for me.ANIMATION: The characters designs are really uninspired and just unfortunately are too similar to many of JC\'s past productions.To be honest, Aria looks exactly what would a cross between Shana of Shakugan no Shana and Taiga of Toradora would look like, just a shana with green hair.The animation is good, but not amazing, though I would be lying if I said the gun fights weren\'t exciting, but then again I\'ve seen them done better (Little assassins, a famous outlaw, and an iconic hellish vampire comes to mind).During many of the gun fights, CG animation is used, but I\'ll leave that to subjective views.SOUND: The Tsundere queen repraises her role once again, and that\'s the only thing really noticeable, the opening is alright and ending sounds great, but leaves no impression.OVERALL:The Good:+ Decent animation, outside of the CG stuff I mean.Mixed:+/- Rie Kugimiya voicing another tsundere.The Bad:- Retarded plot.- Cliched like you wouldn\'t believe.- The whole cast of characters are nothing more than the generic rip offs that are generic rip offs.- Half the time the anime makes no sense.- Episode 4, seriously that episode is bad from start to finish.- Rehashes too many of it\'s plot devices.You really can\'t blame me for reading too far into the anime, and it is kinda entertaining in it\'s own way, well it\'s stupid as entertainment (You can play a nice drinking game for every stupid element to help you get through it).You can say it\'s a whole new Shakugan no Shana, but the story is just too incompetent to even make that statement, even Aria herself has no redeeming qualities.I\'m sure they could\'ve redone the story in a way that would make more sense, plenty of anime companies have done so, but this one is just an obvious cash in. after right off the bat by a...?A segway armed with an uzi and a speaker attached to it?

Although the plot isnt that convincing, it is not a boring one. The beginning of the scenario is a commonplace, it starts with a highschool student, at the beginning of yet another year. The highschool not being seen as a true highschool, it can help to forget the number of anime possibily...seen starting like this.As for the art, it is a recent anime, so it is pretty good overall. For the soundtracks, the openingending, I found them pretty catchy (the singer for the opening is May'n, also known for the opening of Accel World), especially the opening.And now, the part that contributes the most (as well as the storyline) to Hidan No Aria's bad reception, the characters. Basically, the story revolves around two main characters, one guy (Kinji) and one girl (Aria), a tsundere. Obviously people who dislike the basic concept of tsunderes will probably dislike this anime, since there is a non negligeable part of it around her. She has everything to fits the cliche, she is even voiced by Rie Kugimiya, so your point of view will also depends if you got bored of her tsundere voice or not. Kinji, on the other hand, is less of a stereotype, and is entertaining to watch. He displays ... quite a unique trait.So, overall, this anime is more of a good distraction than a breathtaking anime, but still, isn't that the point of animes? From my point of view, if you are fine with tsundere/gun or sword fighting, give it a try, in the worst case you'd lose an hour or so. seen starting like this.As for the art, it is a recent anime, so it is pretty good overall.

This anime follows the same arc of girl comes into boys life and messes with it, however there are stuffs in this anime that doesn't fit, so I'll describe it through my ratings:Story: fair 6.As I've mentioned this anime follows the same arc as that of girl comes into boy's life and messes with it, ok, so the chiquita (Aria, the main female lead) comes into Kinji's life...as she mentions, she's in search of a partner and finds it in the muchacho (Kinji the male lead) who already made his mind to leave Tokyo Butei High School on the next school year. As the plot goes the chiquita needs him for his special ability and help her to prove her Madre's (the female lead's mother) innocence’s. However as the anime goes on until it’s final episode, things are getting a bit messy, from the muchacho being happy co’z he’s gonna be freed from the Chiquita after one successful mission, only to agree to be her partner a.la Sherlock and Dr. Watson, to protecting Shirayuki and eventually being part of his household and to forming up an unpleasant alliance with the conniving “Butei Killer” Riko in the last 3 episode of the this anime. Also, aside from action, school and comedy, additional genres started to add up like ecchi, martial arts, magic and supernatural. I kinda doubt if the existence of the EU and its members would end in the final episode.Art: Mediocre 5.Ok, so far the way the characters were drawn have resembles that from “Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka,” however, the illustrator’s concept of Aria is too awkward, there were scenes  were her pigtails are longer that her body, and the illustrator’s idea of arming her with 2  M1911 Colt pistols and 2 katanas doesn’t suit her very well. As for the rest of the characters drawn, I don’t have much to comment.Sound: Mediocre 5.nothing much to say her.Character: Poor 3.Characters:First of all, I really am disgusted with the author’s preference of using names of prominent characters both fictional and real life in relation to the cast of this anime, in fact it is even insulting to the authors and families of these prominent characters, such as Sherlock Homes, Arsene Lupin and even to the historical figure like Genghis Khan and Minamoto no Yoshitsune . So let me discuss each of main cast:Kanzaki Aria Homes- So, in this anime she’s an elite Butei “S” rank with a “Quadra” title under  her belt, also she’s a 4th generation of the Sherlock Homes clan. Ok, enough of that, the thing here is, unless Sherlock Homes did went into a relationship Irene Adler, somewhere in the late 19th century (my estimate would be in 1887 to 1905) then she would have not be the 4th generation but a 5th or 6th generation of the Homes clan, her character is simply a complete opposite of what Sherlock would be, she would be considered as a “Black Sheep” of Homes legacy  and if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle were to read or watch this anime he’ll be very pissed.Tooyama Kinji- he does as what is expected of being the muchacho in this anime with a harem genre, he doesn’t know what to do with them (his harem) except get his ass kicked. Now, now, so what gives about this muchacho? The author of this anime/manga have given him a disorder called ‘Hysteria Savant Syndrome” somehow the author just picked up some random psychiatric terminology and put them together without even knowing what it is, making him a complete idiot, the terminology itself are compose of  2 words that are an “Oxymoron,” so let’s identify the 2 psychiatric terminology: “Hysteria” – is defined as an unmanageable emotional excess due to over whelming fear that may be cause by multiple events in one's past that involved some sort of severe conflict. And “Savant” - a rare condition in which people with developmental disorders have one or more areas of expertise, ability, or brilliance that are in contrast with the individual's overall limitations. The muchacho doesn’t have any of those and the author should have just stick to “Multiple Personality Disorder” co’z that’s what he has.Riko Mine Lupin  the 4th – according to info she the 4th descendant of Arsene Lupin, here the author  obviously took the concept of  the anime  Lupin III and made it look like that Fujiko Mine another character from the same anime had finially made it out with Lupin himself  and the end product is Riko. Riko’s  character in this anime is more of being a conniving, manipulative and street smarts  as Fujiko Mine, her  Madre (mother), however she doesn’t have the wits to pull a heist  like her father,  another thing about her, is that one can’t tell whether or not she has feelings for the muchacho or was she just using him for her  whatever plans she has for the muchacho, the moment she reappears on the 9th episode it is mentioned that she made some kind of deal with the school ….you know, when a criminal make a deal with the prosecutor it always doesn’t mean a get out of jail ticket, there are a lot of factors that a prosecutor has to consider. And, as nauseating for me to say, the author of this anime just has no idea as to how deals like that work for a criminal who wish to cooperate. I haven’t read the actual writing of Maurice Leblanc but according to info Arsene Lupin is not only a gentleman thief, but is also a womanizer, so there will be a lot of 4th generation of the gentleman thief’s great grandchildren roaming around. Like Aria, she is can’t be the 4th generation of the gentleman thief, she would be instead be the 5th generation and not the 4th generation. Lucky for author of this anime and Lupin III anime that   French writer Maurice Leblanc who conceptualize the gentleman thief has long pass-away otherwise they’ll be looking at a law suit.Reki – Ok, now this character even get’s weirder, she armed with a   Dragunov sniper rifle which nearly every special op would shy away from and according to info she’s a descendant of  Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Genghis Khan……..seriously , another historical name dropping by the author. Definitely no respect for the historical figures, co’z there is no way that these people who even see each other or discuss any treaties. Don’t forget, that Genghis Khan’s son Kublai Khan failed to invade Japan. Also nearly every one of Genghis Khan’s sons are womanizers and there will be a lot of his generations roaming around Mongolia, Siberia and in China and nearly none of them will probably have no idea that they’re the descendants of Genghis Khan.Jeanne’d Arc – her appearance in the latter episode adds another genre to this anime and it becomes freakier, according to info she’s the 30th descendant of Joan of Arc and just like Riko, she was able to get a “Get Out of Jail” ticket by making a deal with the prosecutor . Ok enough of that, so does the first Jeanne‘d Arc have any supernatural powers? Well, she did unite France against the English in the middle ages, but man, I wonder if the author wants us to believe that there is some kind of mysticism surrounding the real Jeanne‘d Arc. Then again experts theorize that Jeanne‘d Arc herself is suffering from some kind of mental disorder which lead some inquisitors to believe that she’s a witch.  The myth that the Jeanne “d Arc that was burn on the stake is not the real one but a stand-in is not new, in fact there are some nutcase cults who believe that someone did volunteered to stand-in for her to be burned in the stake.Hotogi Himiko Shirayuki – Since she’s the muchacho’s childhood friend, I guess it’s obvious as to how her relationship with the muchacho would go,  being a Shinto shrine maiden and being a good fighter don’t go together unless she’s a Taoist nun ,which she’s not. I would have wish that she ends up with the muchacho, but, as always in this kind of anime, the childhood friend is always in the sidelines.Tokyo Butei High School – what about it? Info states that it is a high-school that teaches or trains kids as young as 15 -18 to become armed detectives, which by the way the author’s concept of it, is full of crap, co’z it kinda look like that the said institution is a “Private Military Contractor” training school, the reason is that everything mentioned what the students were doing is exactly what a PMC Mercenary does.Enjoyment: Good 7.Well, as I’ve said the comic part of this anime is enjoyable enough, the action part, hummm, it’s enjoyable as well, but, an uncensored ecchi would’ve made this anime awesome.Overall: Mediocre 5.I’ll leave this blank………… as she mentions, she's in search of a partner and finds it in the muchacho (Kinji the male lead) who already made his mind to leave Tokyo Butei High School on the next school year. As the plot goes the chiquita needs him for his special ability and help her to prove her Madre's (the female lead's mother) innocence’s. However as the anime goes on until it’s final episode, things are getting a bit messy, from the muchacho being happy co’z he’s gonna be freed from the Chiquita after one successful mission, only to agree to be her partner a.la Sherlock and Dr. Watson, to protecting Shirayuki and eventually being part of his household and to forming up an unpleasant alliance with the conniving “Butei Killer” Riko in the last 3 episode of the this anime. Also, aside from action, school and comedy, additional genres started to add up like ecchi, martial arts, magic and supernatural. I kinda doubt if the existence of the EU and its members would end in the final episode.Art: Mediocre 5.Ok, so far the way the characters were drawn have resembles that from “Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka,” however, the illustrator’s concept of Aria is too awkward, there were scenes  were her pigtails are longer that her body, and the illustrator’s idea of arming her with 2  M1911 Colt pistols and 2 katanas doesn’t suit her very well. As for the rest of the characters drawn, I don’t have much to comment.Sound: Mediocre 5.nothing much to say her.Character: Poor 3.Characters:First of all, I really am disgusted with the author’s preference of using names of prominent characters both fictional and real life in relation to the cast of this anime, in fact it is even insulting to the authors and families of these prominent characters, such as Sherlock Homes, Arsene Lupin and even to the historical figure like Genghis Khan and Minamoto no Yoshitsune . So let me discuss each of main cast:Kanzaki Aria Homes- So, in this anime she’s an elite Butei “S” rank with a “Quadra” title under  her belt, also she’s a 4th generation of the Sherlock Homes clan. Ok, enough of that, the thing here is, unless Sherlock Homes did went into a relationship Irene Adler, somewhere in the late 19th century (my estimate would be in 1887 to 1905) then she would have not be the 4th generation but a 5th or 6th generation of the Homes clan, her character is simply a complete opposite of what Sherlock would be, she would be considered as a “Black Sheep” of Homes legacy  and if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle were to read or watch this anime he’ll be very pissed.Tooyama Kinji- he does as what is expected of being the muchacho in this anime with a harem genre, he doesn’t know what to do with them (his harem) except get his ass kicked. Now, now, so what gives about this muchacho? The author of this anime/manga have given him a disorder called ‘Hysteria Savant Syndrome” somehow the author just picked up some random psychiatric terminology and put them together without even knowing what it is, making him a complete idiot, the terminology itself are compose of  2 words that are an “Oxymoron,” so let’s identify the 2 psychiatric terminology: “Hysteria” – is defined as an unmanageable emotional excess due to over whelming fear that may be cause by multiple events in one's past that involved some sort of severe conflict. And “Savant” - a rare condition in which people with developmental disorders have one or more areas of expertise, ability, or brilliance that are in contrast with the individual's overall limitations. The muchacho doesn’t have any of those and the author should have just stick to “Multiple Personality Disorder” co’z that’s what he has.Riko Mine Lupin  the 4th – according to info she the 4th descendant of Arsene Lupin, here the author  obviously took the concept of  the anime  Lupin III and made it look like that Fujiko Mine another character from the same anime had finially made it out with Lupin himself  and the end product is Riko. Riko’s  character in this anime is more of being a conniving, manipulative and street smarts  as Fujiko Mine, her  Madre (mother), however she doesn’t have the wits to pull a heist  like her father,  another thing about her, is that one can’t tell whether or not she has feelings for the muchacho or was she just using him for her  whatever plans she has for the muchacho, the moment she reappears on the 9th episode it is mentioned that she made some kind of deal with the school ….you know, when a criminal make a deal with the prosecutor it always doesn’t mean a get out of jail ticket, there are a lot of factors that a prosecutor has to consider. And, as nauseating for me to say, the author of this anime just has no idea as to how deals like that work for a criminal who wish to cooperate. I haven’t read the actual writing of Maurice Leblanc but according to info Arsene Lupin is not only a gentleman thief, but is also a womanizer, so there will be a lot of 4th generation of the gentleman thief’s great grandchildren roaming around. Like Aria, she is can’t be the 4th generation of the gentleman thief, she would be instead be the 5th generation and not the 4th generation. Lucky for author of this anime and Lupin III anime that   French writer Maurice Leblanc who conceptualize the gentleman thief has long pass-away otherwise they’ll be looking at a law suit.Reki – Ok, now this character even get’s weirder, she armed with a   Dragunov sniper rifle which nearly every special op would shy away from and according to info she’s a descendant of  Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Genghis Khan……..seriously , another historical name dropping by the author. Definitely no respect for the historical figures, co’z there is no way that these people who even see each other or discuss any treaties. Don’t forget, that Genghis Khan’s son Kublai Khan failed to invade Japan. Also nearly every one of Genghis Khan’s sons are womanizers and there will be a lot of his generations roaming around Mongolia, Siberia and in China and nearly none of them will probably have no idea that they’re the descendants of Genghis Khan.Jeanne’d Arc – her appearance in the latter episode adds another genre to this anime and it becomes freakier, according to info she’s the 30th descendant of Joan of Arc and just like Riko, she was able to get a “Get Out of Jail” ticket by making a deal with the prosecutor .

Some succeed, and some don’t. Which, in most cases, doesn’t work because it is nothing more than a gimmick in hindsight. So what better way than to plaster guns into your generic romantic comedy in the title and artwork and pray that action fanatics might have some slight interest. Look no further than Hidan no Aria to fill in another entry in the wrong category.Nevertheless, it is not necessarily the shallow spectrum point in the category. For all I know, there are some...apparent intentions of becoming a straight-up action show, and it succeeds somewhat in that department. There are some impossible logic drops scattered throughout most of the action. But for a show that is this inept plot-wise, there isn’t any reason to bash it any further. It wants its effort to be flashy and fast-paced. So by those standards, there are plenty of engaging conceptual scenarios they put into them.Like any show that stars Rie Kugimiya as the main heroine and a tsundere non-surprising, there is bound to be light-hearted comedy thrown in for good measure. When I mention “good measure,” I mean that haphazardly. When the humor is right in Hidan no Aria, it is put together and hilarious to watch Aria’s reactions to anything lewd. But man, when the jokes do not work, they fucking die horribly. It’s not the fact the quips themselves aren’t humorous, but the way they pace it together feels dragged out far too long than it needed to be. There’s even one instance where Aria calls Kinji a baka repeatedly for almost 8 seconds, and it becomes tedious to experience.These comedic interactions also falter because most of the characters are cardboard cut-out characters of different stereotypes and add nothing significant to them. All we can remember about them is the typical gags written for them. Shirayuki is a creepy childhood friend who has an intense crush on Kinji and gets jealous whenever a girl is close to him. Then there is Riko Mine, who somehow has an attraction towards Kinji that is never given much context as to why she wants him to begin with. No amount of layers upon layers of depth could be seen in any of them because of this fatal flaw. If you're going to show these girls in these positions, that is perfectly fine, but don’t expect someone to latch onto them for just those assets.I’d put some forward analysis on our male protagonist, Kinji Tooyama, only because there is something that needs to be said about protagonists typically written in these types of shows. We’re all familiar with the general romantic comedy protagonist who gets flustered and becomes idiotic. It is a redundant trope that we have gotten used to over the years; except with Kinji, he is not a character that possesses this trope. You’d think that would lead to him being likable, right? Well, the answer to that is yes and no. Nothing really to him makes him inherently riveting to watch in guiding through the plot, what little there is, to begin with. Just like the main female cast, all we’re shown about him is what his role is in the story and nothing else.Usually, I’d like to talk about a show’s plot in the first paragraph, but for Hidan no Aria’s sake, I won’t even give it the time of day for that honor. Not only that, but it almost seemed as though the plot was very second nature to the show’s intentions. Even though it looked like it wanted to, based on how it tried to put in a severe tone what seemed to have been a plot, it provides very few attempts to weave in a coherent story. The story is not only uninteresting but also difficult to follow because of the bad transitions to mindless comedic moments.With Rie Kugimiya on board with the main project, it’s always apparent to at least talk about the voice acting in the show she appears in. However, Aria is not one of the big highlights of her career. I say this from someone who may not be a huge fan, but I at least respect the range and energy she puts into her roles. It’s one of her roles where if you absolutely can’t stand her voice, Aria will not turn you into a new convert for her fanbase. Her iconic “baka” is probably the most thrown out in this show, more than any other show she’s been in, so that right there should signify whether you want to stomach through that or not.No expectations were any higher than medium when I went into Hidan no Aria. Still, I was surprised to say that its negatives don’t overshadow the positives too much. That, however, can’t make it a recommendation by any stretch. It won’t appeal to the people who want an insightful anime-watching experience. But it’s not going to be an easy sell for the action crowd. Don't expect much from it if you think you can repeatedly handle the screaming “baka” lines and the other nauseating character interactions.Grade: C- apparent intentions of becoming a straight-up action show, and it succeeds somewhat in that department.

On the other hand it might be a surprise, using genre conventions to its advantage, as Toradora did. As it turns out Hidan no Aria is a surprise... a very unpleasant one. Constantly bombarding the viewer with an endless stream of cliches while throwing in ridiculous plot twists in order to ""spice things up"", this is a far worse experience than your average generic rom-com.The show seems to be banking on J.C. Staff\'s previous successes. It...is directed by Takashi Watanabe, who had previously directed the popular Shakugan no Shana; plus has the voice of that show\'s star, Rie Kugimiya, as the show\'s heroine Aria. It also has Kugimiya\'s co-star in the massively successful Toradora, Junji Majima, as the male protagonist Kinji Tooyama. This in of itself feels like a cheap trick in order to win an audience. However, with such considerable talent, you would expect the show to at least be halfway decent.The story itself starts off decently enough, though quite predictable. Kinji finds himself in a life-endangering predicament and is saved by the petite but fierce Aria; a bond is formed between them as to be expected. The settings of the story are actually pretty interesting, with Kinji being enrolled in a school for armed forces, which explains why there are such heavily armed teenagers, albeit a rather silly explanation. Kinji himself has an entertaining gimmick with his ""Hysteria Mode"" which turns him from low-key and cynical to smooth-talking and arrogant. However, that is about the extent of praise that can be given, even this early into the show. Aria is the most annoying tsundere imaginable, falling straight into the pitfalls of the character type, and capturing none of its charm. Not even the queen of tsuderes herself, Rie Kugimiya, can safe this poorly constructed excuse of a character. Outside of hysteria mode, Kinji is just a typical, boring male lead. The rest of the cast is equally unimpressive, consisting of tired archetypes such as the possessive childhood friend, the stoic sniper girl, the impish antagonist, etc.What really makes this show a stinker, though, is the completely asinine plot. It is not just horribly written, it is actually insulting to the viewers\' intelligence. Characters\' motives are poorly justified, often cliche or just plain stupid. Sub-plots pop up right and left, just to come to train-wreak conclusions, or remain unresolved. The big bad crime syndicate, called the I-U, seems to be a group of gung-ho individuals who claim to be associated with each other, but show no coherent signs of being so. Really, it is more of a gigantic nonsensical mess than a plot. Most criminal of all is the shows use of historic figures and classic fictional characters as the reason behind everything; the list of names disgraced include Sherlock Homes, Arsene Lupin, Joan of Arc, and Count Dracula. All whom are concerned must be rolling around in their graves.The show\'s technical merits are the aspect most worthy of praise. Takashi Watanabe does his damn best to try and make this dreck entertaining, and to some degree succeeds. The actions scenes are generally exciting and the comedy scenes, while hardly ever working, at least feel like there was some effort put in by the production staff. The artwork itself is bland and generic; yawn-worthy, really. The music pumps up the excitement of the action scenes, but is otherwise pretty unnoticeable. This is the high-point of the show, and honestly... it is not all that high.The preview of the final episode features an in-joke, in which Aria seemingly forgets Kinji\'s name and calls him by Yuugi, Saito, and finally Ryuuji. Yes, this is a cute and funny in-joke for all who get it... but it is also a reminder of why shows like this are even created. It seems the modern anime fan is happy to consume just about anything, so long as it has established names attached to it.

Yes, because 12 episodes isn\'t that much, and the anime has its original side. Famous people references, gun / swords fight, great art and motion.But for me, a LovCom fan, I still enjoyed the anime, but was a bit sad at the ending, because the ending its like: ""Wait for the 2º Season""Story 8/10: The Story...a School for...some kind of ""SWAT"" students, to fight crime and escort civilians, those kinds of stuff. But the catch comes when most of them have special powers, or important grandfathers. You will get some kind of romance, but nothing special, why? Because of the power of the main character, where he gets on rampage/boss/assassin/master mode (its the best side of the story, where he gets f*cking badass) when he thinks/makes dirty stuff, or (OFC) when he looks to Aria (main female), here it starts some kind of ""romance"".Art 10/10: The art/motion its the best on the anime, you can see the really good drawn action time, the fights, the reload animation, the characters and the ambient.Sound 9/10: I normally don\'t mind about the sound, but when I do. Are on the fight scenes, I don\'t understand much about music, but it made me pumped while I watch it.Character 7/10: Well..You have one guy that gets OP when he gets excited whit girls, one girl (secondary) that doesn\'t talk much but its OP :D, another girl that gets embarrassed when he thinks about dirty things, another that only loves dirty things, and for the last, (drums) a girl that wants to marry the main male protagonist. Nothing from another world. In my opinion this is a typical Harem.Enjoyment 9/10: Yes, this is f*cking funny, and awesome. Nice gun/powers/swords fights. And yes, there are some echii sceens. Nothing too much.

Well when he gets on ""Hysteria Mode"" it was f*cking badass (best hysteria mode you will see on the anime), the way he talks to the girl, the way he ""kills"" the enemy...too Good for a first episode. some kind of ""SWAT"" students, to fight crime and escort civilians, those kinds of stuff.

Now that I\'ve finished watching it I have to say this anime really is bad. It did have some very good potential but the creators couldn\'t quite grasp it. Hidan no Aria had a good foundation, which is a high school that changes its students into mercenaries, but even though they had a good foundation in the end they didn\'t build the house as nice as they should have been (I hope you guys get this analogy)....There was a lot of foolish mistake made in this and for starters there was no story. The episode started with action right off the bat, with little explanation, then the creators decided to let the main character/narrator explain what was going on.Another mistake they made, which was really bad were the characters. There was little character development and a few of the characters for some reason had nicknames of Historic people, for no apparent reason. I honestly don\'t even know where the creators were going with this, but I think it was supposedly suppose to contribute to the \'story\' some how.I noticed while watching this, the characters repeatedly kept referring to an article that I guess the school came up with. I think it was Article 2, ""Trust your friends and help when they need it"". Lolwut, is this the best they got? I honestly feel that the creators came up with the mercenaries idea, and after that they just rushed into it. Also the whole bullet proof clothes thing really did ruin this anime. If the creators allowed wounding and blood, this would have been a whole lot better. Hidan no Aria really suffered because of the creators, the name doesn\'t even have any meaning!One thing I noticed some people were throwing around in they\'re reviews was that there was a harem going on throughout this, and I have to say I completely disagree. I feel people feel if there\'s even one girl that likes the main character for no apparent reason then that\'s a harem, wrong!Here\'s the definition that I strongly believe in for a Harem; Harem= when 3 or more girls have been confirmed to like the main character or have a strong fascination over him for no apparent reason or a not good enough reason.Two girls liking the main character at the same time is just coincidence and not a harem, so in Hidan no Aria\'s case, there was no harem, there was only one girl that confirmed she liked Kinji.But aside from all that, the art was pretty good, the characters were drawn well and so were the guns. The background were also drawn well, the art is probably one of the only good things about this show (yikes!).The sound was alright, the opening and ending themes could have been better. As for the voice actors, there were probably only two I felt fit the characters they were voice acting, which is Aria and Riko.Despite all that, I did enjoy this show. It entertained me, despite the nonsense it had. I really feel this show should be given a chance by everyone, although most people who reviewed it either said ""it sucked"" or ""it\'s okay"", I think everyone should give it a shot. There was a lot of foolish mistake made in this and for starters there was no story. The episode started with action right off the bat, with little explanation, then the creators decided to let the main character/narrator explain what was going on.Another mistake they made, which was really bad were the characters. There was little character development and a few of the characters for some reason had nicknames of Historic people, for no apparent reason. I honestly don\'t even know where the creators were going with this, but I think it was supposedly suppose to contribute to the \'story\' some how.I noticed while watching this, the characters repeatedly kept referring to an article that I guess the school came up with. I think it was Article 2, ""Trust your friends and help when they need it"". Lolwut, is this the best they got? I honestly feel that the creators came up with the mercenaries idea, and after that they just rushed into it. Also the whole bullet proof clothes thing really did ruin this anime. If the creators allowed wounding and blood, this would have been a whole lot better.

Sure, you can find a few here and there that stand out above the crowed, but most are mediocre and that\'s where ARIA THE SCARLET AMMO comes in. It might actually be lower than mediocre.The story is so cliche and so over used, that I was totally put off by it and stayed for the characters through the last four episodes. Boy meets, girl, she likes him he might like her, other girls...like him and they shoot people. Even people who hate anime know about this kind of anime, its so over done in so many anime. Kenji himself is somewhat unique, in the sense that he has a split persona that can only be released through looking at a women\'s panties or bra. Typical perverted character that only becomes awesome when he is perverted! The girl, Aria from which the show is named after is also a cliche, a little bratty kid who calls every guy a pervert that looks at her and wants to pump them full of holes (a line that gets tediously old after like the second time she says it)The only real development she gets is that she is a decedent of Sherlock Holmes and her arch enemy is, of course, another decedent of a master sleuth, this time being Lupin the 3rd. Throwing other characters names into the mix and calling them the great granddaughters of these guys feels like the creators of the show couldn\'t come up with clever names themselves so instead took the names of two of the most famous fictional characters in all of entertainment.The story itself skips between one bad guy after another. Not really giving much insight to who they are our what their true evil plan is, Aria and Kenji defeat them all with ease. The final ""true"" villain is so uninteresting and has so little time in the show that I didn\'t really care if they killed him or he killed them, I just wanted it to be done! The only returning characters are the chick that is the decedent of Lupin, who\'s just a stupid loli that has nothing cool to do, a sniper chick who has about twenty minutes in the whole show and a Buti with magical powers that ALSO GET THIS GUYS!!! has the hots for Kenji! But she also has no time in the show at all either.ARIA THE SCARLET AMMO probably needed more episodes to be called an actual show. But I don\'t think I could of watched a full 24 or 26 episode show of this. Its just so uninteresting and boring. The music is nice, going from fast pace to melancholy drama. The opening song has a nice beat and plays a lot through out each episode. I do think once Kenji goes into hysteria mode his other persona (minus the perversion) is a slick, well done detective-esc character, who does come up with interesting ways to get out of situations. Maybe a spin off show with him instead of Aria? I\'d watch that. like him and they shoot people. Even people who hate anime know about this kind of anime, its so over done in so many anime.

Hidan no Aria is merely but another step into failure by the largely hit or miss JC Staff, but what really manages to tick me off as a viewer is the complete lack of care and effort put into the production of this anime.Now listen. I had nothing against the initial setup of this anime, I originally started watching it (And kept doing so for who knows what reason) merely because the premise seemed to...be fun, although ridiculous. It was something for me to just watch for the shits and giggles, a guilty pleasure if you will.I never expected tons of depth or complexity in this anime, but I did expect to be entertained. I wanted to see an anime that would be almost the equivalent of a summer blockbuster action flick, which while certainly the highest quality entertainment out there, it still manages to be a fun little experience.Clearly, JC Staff had other things in mind. Instead of just trying to provide straight forward entertainment, Hidan no Aria was very roundabout with its approach.  An incredible amount of the show\'s time was devoted completely to fanservice and the usual anime tropes. Ranging from the main heroine Aria, who is yet another Kugerie Rie voiced loli tsundere from JC staff, who does nothing but treats the half spineless male lead like a slave, to the yandere childhood friend Shirayuki who dots on the main protagonist in a severely annoying manner, there was almost no character here that felt genuine or likable. I say the male lead is half spineless because supposedly whenever he gets a boner for one of the other girls he enters ""Hysteria mode"" and changes into some super skilled fighter with an arrogant, charismatic, and overbearing attitude. No joke here either.Honestly, I feel like I\'m writing about some action comedy, but the worst part about it all is that this plot takes itself fully seriously. There are several supposed ""dramatic"" moments in the series where we are expected to sympathize with each girl in the main character\'s little harem, especially Aria. There are several times in this series where one will be subjected to Aria\'s toddler tantrums because of things not going her way, and we are expected to sympathize with her when all she does is slave driver the main lead with a leash.But hey, even if the characters suck, maybe the action and plot is entertaining... Well one of the major facets of the plot is how these famous people in the world are often direct descendants of famous figures like Holmes, Dracula, Lupin, etc. Each of them bears their own pasts and problems, but really, it\'s just really, really stupid. I think by the end when you see that the Dracula descendant is a werewolf you will also realize just how stupid this plot line is.The action itself is often very lackluster. JC Staff\'s continual budget slashing just makes the show look like utter crap. Nothing about it stands out, and there\'s not enough of it at all. Not to mention that tons of of the action scenes are marred by again, fanservice since our main lead needs a boner to do anything productive. For some reason he is also relegated to support roles as well.But I digress. What\'s clear to me, is that there is a clear lack of effort put forth by JC Staff that is pervasive throughout the entire anime. The fanservice is hardly stimulating, especially when most of it is from a loli pink haired girl. The action lacks punch, and there is far too little of it. And worst of all, each and every character is an anime archetype or trope executed in a very uninspiring manner.If the creators of the show aren\'t even trying to make me like this, why should I? be fun, although ridiculous.

Also in my opninion the story of Hidan no Aria (I like the name better in Japanese) is not just an ordinary story. Yes of course, it is about a dude attending a high school, but that's not what this anime is about. Especially when you have read the light novel you know this is true. Also for the people that have read the...light novel, I do recommend to watch this anime :) .So, if you are interested in Action and Comedy you should definitely watch this anime!

Very enjoyable :D. . . (8)"", 'If you don\'t like reading and just wish to know my opinion on whether or not you should watch this anime, my candid answer would be: ""No, No, No, don\'t fall for the trap i did and just watch something else because Hidan no Aria is mind-blowingly bad"".You\'re still here?Well then, lets get into the nitty gritty.By the way, there will be SPOILERS HERE, I know I\'m not supposed to, but I can\'t write a review on how bad the anime was without \'em, so TEEHEESo, lets start with the characters,There is the VERY average anime male(Kinji), who holds the typical traits of...an anime male, who is the protagonist, which is rare because in most anime he\'d be 20 feet from the camera and is rendered blurry cause he ain\'t worth attention. Now, he is exceptionally normal except for the fact he has a specially ability which I call the ""boner ability"". When he achieves a boner, he basically bones all enemies and becomes super smart, super brave, and super duper duper stuff.There is the short girl(Aria), who plays the average short girl routine which is embarrassed about her height and bra size, and is apparently licensed to shoot anything without repercussion because she doesn\'t hesitate to dual-shoot anything. Also she is somewhat related to Sherlock Holmes but it give her anything.Then there is the rest of the characters, few male companions of Kinji who are also very average, Riko, Hotogi, the sniper, jeanne, and vlad. none of which were important till the end.Now the worst bit- the storyI liked where the story was headed(which is why I watched the whole thing) but it ended in another direction which got me disappointed and wilted.All the characters are part of Butei a school for free lance police that fight terrorists.-But seeing that the terrorists are aimed at the Butei, and Butei shooting up and bombard areas just shows how they improve their society which is to say of a negative effect.But never-the-less they are fighting crime, which is till ep 6 where Aria decides to use the Butei for her personal gain and try to free her imprisoned mother who is sentenced to 900 some years(no im not kidding).Then we find out that Riko is Lupin(which gives her the ability to use her hair like hands) and Aria is Holmes(nothing) and they must fight because fictional English books affect Japanese anime in more than just humor.Somewhere here Aria and Kinji meet Jeanne - Joan of Arc\'s relative which gives her the power of ice, which makes even more sense because history and fiction go hand in hand.Also around here is when Aria agrees to work with Riko who previously hijacked a plane to kill her, (which makes sense because you would work with people that tried to kill you with a plane) to steal something that Riko wants so that Riko can testify to clear her mother and go to jail herself - a fool proof plan indeed.Ending- Riko betrays them attempts to kill Aria(again), then gets stopped by Butei teacher, Vlad aka. count dracula who is also a werewolf. If you are drawing a big (WTF) around here its because I did too. Anyway Riko teams up with Aria and Kinji who have memories of goldfish and forgives Riko and takes down Vlad by shooting weak points marked out in nice white paint as if he was a first boss in a RPG game.Now if you are outraged that I didn\'t mention Hotogi- screw you, she wasn\'t important and all.Also if you thought my summary of how poorly written Hidan no Aria was somewhat confusing in any manner, then for you, watching Hidan no Aria will be like giving birth to a 30 lb. baby. an anime male, who is the protagonist, which is rare because in most anime he\'d be 20 feet from the camera and is rendered blurry cause he ain\'t worth attention. Now, he is exceptionally normal except for the fact he has a specially ability which I call the ""boner ability"". When he achieves a boner, he basically bones all enemies and becomes super smart, super brave, and super duper duper stuff.There is the short girl(Aria), who plays the average short girl routine which is embarrassed about her height and bra size, and is apparently licensed to shoot anything without repercussion because she doesn\'t hesitate to dual-shoot anything.

This is a very cliche Shana (main female protaganist is a loli tsundere with powers basically) lesque harem anime, but it has its good points too. There are a few twists and turns and the anime is kept at a brisk pace to back it up as well.The story is an albeit comicly overcomplicated world that isn't very well gone into detail. It takes place with the protaganist, who when sexually aroused changes from an introverted weakling to...the opposite in so called Hysteria Mode, extroadinary powers, control, and well basically he can do everything humanly possible. Yeah, see that target 300 yards away? It now has a bullet hole in it's center. He leaves his house with breakfast prepared by the obvious childhood friend flag character, Shirayuki Hoto, to a military school described in little detail where he then would resume training for, uh capturing criminals and stuff (bear with it, the anime gets better!). Anyways, suddenly he then gets attacked by a thingy ma bobby contraption best described as a machine gun on a scooter where he frantically tries to avoid losing his life (don't worry hes the main character he's probably not dieing in the first episode), and dadadada! (Stein's gate reference) he is saved by a myserious short underdeveloped character with bright pink hair that is safe to assume to be the Shana character of this anime otherwise known as Aria Kanazaki. He then goes into hysteria mode when fanservice is accidently given to him and he then shows off to the girl with a few impressive moves and a cool attitude. She of course gets interested in him, and the rest is history they team up, meet a few more interesting characters, have little tamper tantrums where she beats up on the protaganist throughout and the anime continues from there. 6I can't say too much about the art as it is decent quality in 2010 with maybe wanting a little more on the backgrounds and perhaps some of the city strips, but otherwise it is just what the anime needed. A nice, smooth, relaxed art that is to show all of the Tsundereish things  Aria does.9I liked the sound alot as well, if your a Rie Kugima fan you will probably like  the main female character. The rest of the voices are pretty average especially the main character who sounds all depressed if hes not Mr. fantastic mode. The opening(s), I don't remember if it had more than one, were great and fitted the anime well. The ending had a beautiful tone to it as well and contrasted the sunnier opening well. The bgm throughought was used appropriately, but sometimes felt you wanting more. Either way it was better that most anime of this genre. 9Okay, well the characters did get a little annoying. The main guy protagonist, Kinji, is kind of a depressed guy who only slowly starts to realize what hes got (the imaginary harem none have). I have never been a personal fan of the loli tsundere chacter really but if that is your thing Aria is the eptiome of it and you will love her and the gun's she produces at inappropriate times when she is embarassed. The childhood friend Shirayuki has some pretty funny lines and is very likeable, as long as you can tolerate the relationship she has with Kinji where she literally throws herself at him. A happy go lucky girl character,Rico, is very interesting and develops pretty well as the anime goes on. My favorite character and the saving grace of this cast of misfits is Reki who is a sniper at the military school/ cop school/ everything.whatever who is a quiet shy little girl and you only barely see her start to come out of her shell, but when you do it is rewarding. In total the characters blend averagely and form a pretty varied cast, hopefully some don't get too much on your nerves.You will also join some later characters whose names I am not going to spoil, but aren't gone into depth much anyways. 6For some reason, despite all these flaws, I really did enjoy this anime. When there was a funny scene it was downright hilarious. I encourage you even if you don't want to watch this anime to youtube Hidan no aria- I didn't get pregnant! because its one of the funnier scenes in anime I've scene and doesn't really need to be seen too much in context. Also, I plainly enjoy watching the girls fall over a guy like this in different ways that he doesn't deserve even if it is really unrealistic, it is just entertaining, and better than I think most harem portray it. The fight scenes were pretty average and relatively short, but it did shine a better light on the characters and their personalities under pressure. Also shows that the main character's two sides in contrast rather well ( if you can stand either side that is). Either way I enjoyed this series more than I expected with the combination of awkward bits of romance, comedy, stiff battle scenes, and well fan service. 8Overall this anime is a worthy watch, but I wouldn't make it a top priority, Take a break watch some TV finish that really good series you haven't had time to watch yet and when a break comes, try to fit this series in comfortably because it will be worthwhile to do so, hope you like bright pink hair and a bright red face with twin guns because you will be seeing a lot of it. 7 the opposite in so called Hysteria Mode, extroadinary powers, control, and well basically he can do everything humanly possible.

In total the characters blend averagely and form a pretty varied cast, hopefully some don't get too much on your nerves.You will also join some later characters whose names I am not going to spoil, but aren't gone into depth much anyways. 6For some reason, despite all these flaws, I really did enjoy this anime. When there was a funny scene it was downright hilarious. I encourage you even if you don't want to watch this anime to youtube Hidan no aria- I didn't get pregnant! because its one of the funnier scenes in anime I've scene and doesn't really need to be seen too much in context. Also, I plainly enjoy watching the girls fall over a guy like this in different ways that he doesn't deserve even if it is really unrealistic, it is just entertaining, and better than I think most harem portray it. The fight scenes were pretty average and relatively short, but it did shine a better light on the characters and their personalities under pressure. Also shows that the main character's two sides in contrast rather well ( if you can stand either side that is). Either way I enjoyed this series more than I expected with the combination of awkward bits of romance, comedy, stiff battle scenes, and well fan service. 8Overall this anime is a worthy watch, but I wouldn't make it a top priority, Take a break watch some TV finish that really good series you haven't had time to watch yet and when a break comes, try to fit this series in comfortably because it will be worthwhile to do so, hope you like bright pink hair and a bright red face with twin guns because you will be seeing a lot of it. 7"", 'I\'ve seen many ""this anime is crap"" reviews for Hidan no Aria, and felt that I, as a person who enjoyed this show should give his point of view about it.Before I start...I\'m pretty sure I\'m not the only one who enjoyed this since the average rating for this show is in the 7sThis can be seen as a typical harem anime at a few glances, which is true. However, that\'s not all of it. As you can predict from all the guns, this does involve a lot of (gun) fighting too.Story: I think the story line is great (note: I have no problems watching...same things over and over). The problem might be for some people is that this is a typical harem anime with all those typical females and the ""I avoid girls"" male.The setting is a bit unrealistic, involving high schoolers who carry guns and swords with them during school (also note that on average, 3% of the students die during their courses (only for the harshest course, but I mean, highschoolers dieing??)) However, this slight unrealistic part of the setting really does allow all of the crazy things to at least fit in (still sticks out like a sore thumb in my opinion).The second problem I had with the story is that the story is too spread apart, such as psychic abilities, a special item that artificially creates psychic abilities, and most of all, the characters (which I\'ll explain later)tl;dr?1.This is a typical harem anime with all the typical females.2.Setting unrealistic (which I really enjoyed)Art: I\'ll keep this short since I\'m not an art critic, and I personally don\'t see that much of a difference of art in most animes.Since this anime is already unrealistic, the art does fit well with Hidan no Aria.But I do see many problems with it: (naming the major ones)1. Too unrealistic (people manage to hide a gun about 1.5x their hand under their very short skirt.2. Again, too unrealistic (their hair moves really awkwardly in mid-air.3. Many  Unnecessary ecchi moments which is not in the light novelSound: I enjoyed the sound, that\'s all I can say.all the voice actors fit in with the character, especially Shirayuki.I loved the OP, and I skipped the EP, so I don\'t know.I felt that the bgms fit in with the situation, since I didn\'t realize of the BGM\'s presence until I looked back.Character: The characters itself are so good I might of rated it a 9 or 10... if not for the random historical/fictional names that usually makes no sense.The main character, Tooyama Kinji is a Butei that no longer wishes to stay as one, following an incident regarding his brother, who is also a Butei being bad mouthed by media after ""losing"" his life while saving the passengers on a cruise ""accident"".He carries this special genetic trait,""Hysteria Mode"" that allows him to be about 30x stronger and smarter when he becomes sexually aroused, but tries his best to avoid ""using"" it(hence avoiding females).The main female character, Kanzaki Holmes Aria is one of the top Buteis in the school. She is the typical tsundere, cruel character who treats Kinji as a slave and decides to beat him around when she is mad or when she sees Kinji with another girl.Another important female character, Shirayuki is a shrine maiden (miko) with psychic abilities. She is a great addition to Hidan no Aria, and helps create many comedy moments. She is the childhood friend of Kinji, who basically is in love with him. She is a yandere, nuf said.Now the part which I mainly dislike, the naming of the characters:Tooyama Kinji: I\'m actually fine with this, but some of my friends aren\'t. He is based off Tooyama Kin-san, a historical Japanese cop (I think) in the Edo era.Kanzaki Holmes Aria: This is obvious, she\'s related to Sherlock Holmes. She is the Fourth Generation Holmes. The problem is that she has absolutely no deducing abilities, unlike Sherlock Holmes.Mine Riko Lupin (4th): Lupin the Fourth. I think her character fits Lupin, but the part that I don\'t get, is that she is sort of friends with Aria. Lupin and Holmes as best friends anyone?Joanne the Arc (twenty-something generation): This naming has nothing to do with the character, so I dislike this.It\'s getting long, so I\'m gonna stop here, but there are so many historical character\'s decendents gathered in one highschool, which makes it really awkward and forced.Overall: I liked the anime, but I felt that the anime should of been a little more loyal to the light novel, since I felt that the light novel is better. If you enjoyed the anime, try reading the novel (not sure if there are english versions, but if you can read Japanese, go for it) and you will enjoy it.If you can handle all the contradictions and unrealistic things in the anime, go for it.

To put it straight the anime does have action and comedy and school but its hardly the main part of it, its all about girls and guns (and swords) and the cliched over-used recycled gibberish scenarios (hence the G-shock). As a matter of fact, neither girls nor guns nor both put together made the anime any good but a lot of us (including me) are sucker for these types and thus the popularity.The plot is set in a school that...grants special students permission to take up missions and engage in combat using arms and ammunition. So you get talented snipers, gunmen, sword masters and special ability users produced by the school. Our protagonist, Tooyama Kinji, after a sad incident has decided to quit the combat division and live a normal life when suddenly he gets involved with a killing incident, a girl falls from sky, and activates his 'Ero-super-mode/ Hysteria mode' by contact with the flat-breasted Aria to set off the new course for his life.. so you can see :1-sudden accident2-girl falls from sky (special girl=cloud, these days)3-perversion=power and4-rescue heroine :all 100% checked for predictability.After being persistently sought after for his Hysteria mode (activated by ecchi stimulation and heightens his senses out of his urge to protect females) he decides to help Aria absolve her mother from false accusations.The protagonist is surrounded by a flat chested tsundere, a plump yandere childhood friend and a femme fatale as a starting dose to his harem, hopefully the other female encounters will also enter into harem cruise if they dare to make a sequel. The plot throughout is quite predictable and strewn with your usual harem scenarios, depth and mystery are hardly much of a factor and most scenarios are mediocre or dumb or both. Therefore, as an intellectual facade to give a perception of depth and mystery they decided to use the offsprings of famous characters- Holmes IV, Lupin IV, Jeanne de Arc (was it 38th ?) and the Dracula himself who was generously available due to his immortality. Except that Holmes IV has more intution than deduction abilities, Lupin IV has to use others to steal, Joan of Arc 38th can use ice and of course! all of them are girls. By the way, Dracula is a 'stupid cur with black-and-white fur' (a werewolf like creature with white spots on his otherwise brown skin to mark 3 of his 4 weak spots --FYI that's so you can kill him easily). If they thought that they could create a masterpiece by stuffing something from everywhere they couldn't have been more wrong.Seriously, the story could hardly have been good when the basis itself is flawed. I regard the story as mediocre and generously award it a 6/10.[spoiler.. on a side note the last episode really pissed me off; Vlad, the EU no.2, great villain, is actually a dumb wolf, defeated in less than one episode. At last, at long last they f***ing ruined their own credibility.]The animation is not so good. The character sketches are good for the most part, the coloring scheme is good. But, the animation fares poorly, for one the scenes are not so fluid, they seem cut-off sometimes and another the angles are definitely not the best they could have given. I don't think they spent much in the animation department cause although the guns and characters are well made the action scenes don't come out as great. The backgrounds aren't spectacular either.The sound department is fairly better than the others. I don't have very sharp ears to analyze the quality of voice-acting and BGM and grade it qualitatively but I consider most of the voice acting as good and the BGM nice though not spectacular. The OP seemed good to me, the ED was good and had a great accompanying animated scene.The character zone is also starved and plagued with stagnation and cliches . Kinji, the male lead is a retarded and weak student with a hidden potential due to which he is either coveted by or recklessly thrown in the midst of dangerous women. A masculine instinct to protect females gives him the strength to survive. The female leads include a flat-chested tsundere loli Aria with the greatest potential to sexually excite the hero, a yandere childhood friend madly in love with him and a dangerous seductress bent upon using him for her own devious schemes. The rest of the characters are also derived and hardly have a hint of originality. The development follows - the predictable route to a classic harem. Well, since Aria plays a greater in the plot, her development is comparably better.You can see how much of a hypocrite I am since, despite all the scorn and cynicism, I still gave the enjoyment a 7/10. That's because, even though it's full of shortcomings, I still like the anime because of its comedy-harem nature (not that i watch every harem but I do watch a lot of them).As an overall opinion, if you're into it because of mystery or action or something new, I suggest you drop it and watch better ones.

Well I have and I was quite interested in the plot synopsis, so I watched it and I wasn't disappointed. The action was solid throughout the whole thing and so I enjoyed it, however the plot couldn't be more generic. Bad guy, mystery, Big boss , beat big boss, The end. That's basically the...plot and so it was a bit of a let down in total.Characters and Art (7)Well the characters aren't flat so its good, however they do fall into some stereotypes, the protagonist being strong only when it counts, tsundere partner, the innocent looking bad guy and etc. They're quite well designed and their animation is quite good, so it was well above average.

A school operating to train armed detectives. There are car bombs, and traps, and undercover work… Theres even classic names like holmes, Lupin, dracula. The issue is, Hidan no Aria becomes incredibly average.Whenever I look at the the score sheet the 'average' next to the five sticks out to me. Why? There are so many things that can make a show average. It is very unfortunate that Aria appears to implement all those. The end result is this show becomes more of a guilty pleasure, than anything else. Let us examine our male lead. A normal...Butei who upon getting sexual arroused becomes powered up. In a long line of lists for stupid but amazing powers, Kinji's hysteria mode is actually among the top. He sure is kick ass when he is in it, but it still leaves you asking why it has to be like that.Of course the answer is fanservice. I have nothing against fanservice, the guiltiest pleasure of all, and Aria is not short in this. There is romance mixed in, but  unfortunately that line of the story hits a roadblock as soon as it becomes a harem, and to make it better or worst one is a tsundere and the other a yandere. Although I will give it props for actually throwing kisses out there too bad it doesn't really made jack squat.Now thankfully you can't really do the action scenes wrong. There are plenty of fights in Hidan no Aria, and they are all pretty good. Sword fights, gun fights, gunkata (youtube it? I didn't know it already existed). It actually wasn't that bad, although the final boss is an immortal with Achilles's heels and is pretty lame.The story is okay covering about three arcs in total. The first one is the introduction of Aria as she is impressed by Kinji's hysteria mode and asks him to help her fight back against a car bomber who targets Butei. The second involves protecting his childhood friend who is also at the top of their class from an assassin, and to finish it off the third arc is an undercover operation. The introduction to the arcs are fun to watch, but  the aftermath feels slightly underwhelming, especially when they implement the 'befriending' idea in a show where they arrest criminals. It makes even less sense then usual.Hidan no Aria was a guilty pleasure. I enjoyed watching it, but when you reflect back on it you realize how bad it is.

Mainly, I don\'t like it because it seems dull.  From the looks of things so far, I can guess that the tsundere girl and guy with hidden potential are going to fight against something, together of course.  I\'ve seem too much of it.  And of course, there is cliche moments...the guy sees the girl naked.  Big woop.[9] Art: J.C. did well here.  As expected.  I haven\'t seen anything outstanding though, so I\'ll leave it as a 9.[9] Sound: Voice actors and actresses, amazing.

Ever watched Shakugan No Shana or Toradora?  The voice actors are the same from Toradora main characters to Hidan No Aria main characters.  Sure, they\'re amazing VA\'s, but what hurts the most is the similar personalities.  Aria strongly resembles both Shana from SNS and Taiga from Toradora.  What makes me mad the most, is that in episode two, Aria is saying \'URASAI URASAI!"".  I MEAN WAHT THE HELL.  THAT\'S SHANA\'S LINES.  THAT\'S JUST A NO NO.  Aria\'s personality is generic too.  She\'s tsundere, raging and hitting and yelling before slowing revealing her soft side.  Frankly, she\'s annoying.  She beats up the guy for no reason sometimes.  Also, she tells the guy to be his slave.  Strong resemblance towards Toradora.  This guy, I don\'t even remember his name, but I said before he had hidden potential.  Just like Yuuji from SNS.  I suppose it\'s a bit different, but all this unoriginality is messed up.  I hate it.[6] Enjoyment: Idk.  I felt like it was a 6.

Tohyama Kinji is a junior student who has the unique body which activates a Hysteria Mode. It’s supposedly a genetic condition, when Kinji gets sexually aroused. He turns into a “mega playboy” with superhuman judgment and reflexes. The end result is an extremely suave change in personality. He tries to hide it to others in order to live a peaceful life. But trouble comes to find him when he becomes a victim of a bombing incident, where he meets the Butei high ""Assault""...department elite, Aria H. Kanzaki.Story & Characters (1/10)In the near future Japan, teenagers learn to be a Butei, an elite force that specializes in arms and hand-to-hand combat, at Tokyo Butei High. Toyama Kinji is a Butei, but he doesn\'t want to be. Just as he makes up his mind to leave, however, he stumbles across an anti-Butei Killer and needs a rescue from the fiery, gun-toting Aria. She\'s tiny, she\'s skilled, yet she has the temper of a little brat, and after seeing Kinji ""transforms"" into his hysteria mode, which is a flirtatious, damsel-rescuing prince, to turn the table and rescue her, she wants him to be her partner. Together they battle the Butei Killer, go to school, and get tangled up with other forces who have evil plans.A little hope can be a dangerous thing. Take Aria the Scarlet Ammo. Its first episode had a few glimmers of interest, so we spend the next six hoping that something will come of them, only to be crushed at every available opportunity by brainless fluff plots and excruciating harem capers. Genre tropes aren\'t bad by nature, but the way a few series carry and blow them into something unexpected is worth watching. Bad ones use tropes as crutches, to allow them to hobble without doing the work of manufacturing their own appeal. This anime is one of those. One minute Kinji declines Aria\'s offer of partnership, then a childhood friend who hopelessly mewls over him bursting in to create one of those must-have-harem-comedy, then the next Aria\'s spouting she\'s a direct descendant of some badass historical figure. Wow, talk about another facepalm. Wait a few moments and Kinji playing a center idiot in the harem, and suddenly he\'s a retro hero with the allergic cool look and professional womanizing skills. The entire anime is littered with the corpses of failed harem adaptations; Aria isn\'t making canny use of its tropes; it simply is them, blown up until they can\'t be ignored... or enjoyed.And then there\'s the main characters; like any show that names itself after its main character, it\'s fair to say that everything should be laying on the shoulder of its main character. However, Aria isn\'t a tactical role. She has a frail moe look contrasts to the great skills she possesses, and is indeed indeed to any of Kugimiya Rie\'s many diminutive tsunderes, but only a resemblance. She has none of the genuine traits or any of the depth of Kugimiya\'s heartbreaking character; she\'s a parody, and not a funny one. Her anti-Kinji personality is a typical trait to reveal the insecure, cute and cuddly girl tacked onto the end like a particularly phony afterthought, and somewhere in there there\'s a few scenes in which she\'s desperately in need of rescuing despite she claims to be the best Butei at school helps absolute nothing.Aria is clearly an action series mixed with harem, which itself should sound a warning bell. Kinji is a straightforward harem lead, who has the personalities of one and acts like one. His hysteria mode, though is a funny one, is still a cheap trick. The other two heroines are shy miko Shirayuki and lust-addled (gentlewoman?) thief Riko. They\'re all superior martial artists, and all hopelessly smitten with him. Turns out they\'re all descendants of some historical figures like Aria, and lousy ones, too. Each represents a superior harem trait, and they aren\'t just a string of pointless rumbles, but an oddball of tale.Art (4/10)It\'s the strategic focus of the fights, however, that really gives one hope. They\'re part of a battle, which despite its controlled nature and lethal weapons, still has many of the opportunities for strategy, betrayal and trickery that a real battle would have. Aria and Kinji\'s battles are good action showcases, pumped up with nice visuals to portrait the daily battle in the life of a Butei. Unfortunately it isn\'t all there is to the episode. There are characters to introduce, which generally involves a big dramatic entrance and a quick survey of each girl\'s loli-flavored character design.The only sign of life is the show\'s dumb slight of gags, which is admittedly spotty but also contains hints of fanservice. When Riko makes her escape by using her own uniform as parachute, revealing her busty body, or a matter of concern about Aria\'s flat chest or screeching at Kinji for being a pervert, are all a silly joke and a mean to pique the interest of the people who would enjoy things like, well, small girls with big eyes.Sound (6/10)Tsundere specialist Kugimiya Rie returns to voice the character type that she specializes, but she was just simply reprising her role for Shana, and to be paired with Majima Junji, who she has chemistry since Toradora! and whose characters are just a mere copy of the old one proves to be weaker. They are veterans enough, however, to confine them mostly to invisible supporting roles, so you\'re unlikely to notice unless you\'re specifically listening for them. The music score does try its best to pump up the pace and energy, but it feels worn-out like a half-hearted effort.Overall (3/10)You hear it a lot, you watch it a lot, and you facepalm because of it a lot. It takes a while for the series\' amusement at its own genre-pandering, trope-plundering ridiculousness to register, though. There\'s very little in the way of humor during the first episode, and the way it lunges from one cliche to the next, taking little care to properly connect them, makes it much easier to cringe at the towering derivation of it all than to laugh at it, much less laugh good-naturedly. Oh, and just to kill things a little more dead, the villains are both random and really, really annoying.Some series fail because of a lack of anything fresh to work with; others fail because of deficiencies in execution. Aria the Scarlet Ammo squarely falls into the former category. It doesn\'t have any good ideas and does not do anything to make a new start, and is not sexy enough in the way it does them, to be entertaining as anything more than an ignorance. department elite, Aria H. Kanzaki.Story & Characters (1/10)In the near future Japan, teenagers learn to be a Butei, an elite force that specializes in arms and hand-to-hand combat, at Tokyo Butei High. Toyama Kinji is a Butei, but he doesn\'t want to be. Just as he makes up his mind to leave, however, he stumbles across an anti-Butei Killer and needs a rescue from the fiery, gun-toting Aria. She\'s tiny, she\'s skilled, yet she has the temper of a little brat, and after seeing Kinji ""transforms"" into his hysteria mode, which is a flirtatious, damsel-rescuing prince, to turn the table and rescue her, she wants him to be her partner. Together they battle the Butei Killer, go to school, and get tangled up with other forces who have evil plans.A little hope can be a dangerous thing. Take Aria the Scarlet Ammo. Its first episode had a few glimmers of interest, so we spend the next six hoping that something will come of them, only to be crushed at every available opportunity by brainless fluff plots and excruciating harem capers. Genre tropes aren\'t bad by nature, but the way a few series carry and blow them into something unexpected is worth watching. Bad ones use tropes as crutches, to allow them to hobble without doing the work of manufacturing their own appeal. This anime is one of those. One minute Kinji declines Aria\'s offer of partnership, then a childhood friend who hopelessly mewls over him bursting in to create one of those must-have-harem-comedy, then the next Aria\'s spouting she\'s a direct descendant of some badass historical figure. Wow, talk about another facepalm. Wait a few moments and Kinji playing a center idiot in the harem, and suddenly he\'s a retro hero with the allergic cool look and professional womanizing skills. The entire anime is littered with the corpses of failed harem adaptations; Aria isn\'t making canny use of its tropes; it simply is them, blown up until they can\'t be ignored... or enjoyed.And then there\'s the main characters; like any show that names itself after its main character, it\'s fair to say that everything should be laying on the shoulder of its main character. However, Aria isn\'t a tactical role. She has a frail moe look contrasts to the great skills she possesses, and is indeed indeed to any of Kugimiya Rie\'s many diminutive tsunderes, but only a resemblance. She has none of the genuine traits or any of the depth of Kugimiya\'s heartbreaking character; she\'s a parody, and not a funny one. Her anti-Kinji personality is a typical trait to reveal the insecure, cute and cuddly girl tacked onto the end like a particularly phony afterthought, and somewhere in there there\'s a few scenes in which she\'s desperately in need of rescuing despite she claims to be the best Butei at school helps absolute nothing.Aria is clearly an action series mixed with harem, which itself should sound a warning bell. Kinji is a straightforward harem lead, who has the personalities of one and acts like one. His hysteria mode, though is a funny one, is still a cheap trick.

All members who have worked on this review are mentioned at the bottom. In addition, this review will also contain a “Value in the Anime” section detailing life lessons and values that make this anime worth watching.-------------------Hidan no Aria is a relatively recent anime that, while rated poorly, has lessons that can be derived from the experience.Story: We mostly agreed that the plot was good at the beginning. It was interesting, it was engaging, and it was amusing. Less than halfway through the series though, the plot starts...to go downhill. Some of the sub plots, such as the characters being descended from the famous and infamous were notable, though it isn't expanded on. Quickly, the plot switched to an episodic set-up, which led some of us to feel as if we had suddenly skipped a few episodes.Some of the other prevalent plot devices, such as the bullet-proof uniforms seemed to have no purpose other than as a comedy and action device that allows for okay comedic and action scenes. The uniforms lowered the tension, as they force the viewer to think that there is no way anyone can die. Violence, overall, is treated nonchalantly.The show seemed to promise some speck of realism at first, though this is set aside as the plot introduced characters with superpowers. We felt this was a completely unnecessary addition, as the plot was interesting and fine without super powered people running around. It is also rife with plot holes, and the motivations of the villain(s) are never fully explained. It is cryptic, in an extremely unflattering manner.Art: The animation wasn't bad. It lacked huge amounts of stills or jerking. It was fluid and fight scenes looked nice enough. The backgrounds were decent enough to take a second to look at, but no more than that. The characters designs were a little bland though, and there was nothing outstanding about it. There was no individuality to the animation. No creativity or anything to set it apart from all other anime. It was good but it was nothing new.Sound: The opening song was nice though the OST was nothing special. While it did help set the mood and tone at some points, it didn't play to the mood well. We did, however, feel that the seiyuu did a good job on this anime, though our preferences differed. The seiyuu were able to make us feel the emotion of the characters well enough, creating a memorable performance. You could call them a saving grace.Characters: This, however, was one of the weakest points of this anime. It could have been strong, given proper fleshing out, however the effort was not made. This is a harem anime, but we did not see the purpose of it. All harem members degenerated into clichéd templates that disappeared as soon as their roles were fulfilled. While one would expect this to help the main relationship be fulfilled, it did no such thing.The relationship between Aria and Kinji seemed to be a very strong and based off of a solid, mutual understanding, but this bond between them seems to only exist to be broken. The main character’s ‘second personality,’ Hysteria Mode, is often used as a bad plot device. Our reactions on this personality are split, but we agreed that while amusing to watch, Hysteria mode existed as a fail safe for the writer--an example of lazy storytelling.Enjoyment: We all agreed that this anime was at the very least somewhat enjoyable to watch. As with many things, this was especially true in the very beginning. However, as the plot degenerated, our enjoyment followed suit. We started to enjoy this anime less and less as the plot became episodic and filled with moe and fanservice. Even the fight scenes got harder to enjoy as violence in this anime was treated so flippantly.Values in the Anime: There is value in this anime that makes it worth watching--certain life lessons that we can all take to heart.Trust in Your Friends and Allies: This is a point thoroughly covered throughout the anime, and is even said multiple times by the characters. While not true all of the times, trusting in your friends, your family, your allies, are things that humans need to learn. Trust is an important human value, as no one can do everything alone. Even if it’s hard, and even if some people will betray you, learning to trust and share your burdens with people will lead to an easier life.Violence is not a Toy: Violence is repeatedly treated as nothing more than comedy in this anime. Guns are carried like phones or pencil cases, and they are used just as frequently. It is hard to take fight scenes seriously because guns are waved around so much in the lighthearted scenes, and because of the bulletproof uniforms. However, violence is not a toy. It is not something that should be done just for fun like in this anime. Guns should not be waved around and shot every other second simply because other people probably won’t get hurt by them. Always respect everyone around you, and use violence as a last resort.Story: 5/10Art: 7/10Sound: 6/10Characters: 4/10Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 6/10 (Not an Average)VIA (Value in Anime) – Graveyard DivisionTo find the true gem’s in anime!Vigilate et discite!Officer “Kami_no_Kage”Agent “Moros_Fate”Agent “fortepiano” to go downhill.

Staff think their idea of comedy is funny when it really isn't? This is why no one likes them anymore. And Aria the Scarlet Ammo (Hidan no Aria) is yet another piece of awful on their ever-piling list of mediocrity.The premise seems interesting enough. You have this school where students are trained to become mercenaries and law enforcement and such. The main character, Kinji Tohyama, attends this school and he has this strange power that makes him more badass, but it's only triggered when he gets sexually aroused. No idea how that exactly is supposed to work. Anyway, he's relunctant to become...a Butei and wants out. One day, he's attacked by a remote-controlled armed segway and he's saved by the titular character.Now here's where it gets bad. Let's start with the main reason why this series is awful: Ms. Aria H. Kanzaki herselfAria is supposedly an S-Rank Butei, which is the highest rank a Butei can achieve. Can you tell? I can't, because she does absolutely nothing worthwhile throughout the whole run of 12 episodes. To make matters worse, she's nothing more than an awful carbon copy of that other tsundere. Extremely tsun, Has a flat chest and complains about it, physically abuses whatever poor unfortunate guy has to put up with her, Voiced by Rie Kugumiya. I don't care about her trying to clear her mother's name for a crime she didn't commit, because she acts like a childish, annoying, unlikable brat; I just wish someone would just smack her in the face, already.The other females aren't good either, but at least they don't threaten to pump you full of lead every time.Believe me, as much as Aria alone can kill anyone's enjoyment of this series, that's the least of the issues here. Some major characters are revealed to be descendants of various fictional characters like Sherlock Holmes, Joan of Arc, etc. Aria is Holmes' descendant, hence the H in her name. Does she perform any interesting deductions? Nope. Is Joan of Arc's descendant vulnerable to fire? Kinda, sorta. In fact, none of that goes anywhere. It's just tacked on for no good reason.Since this is adapted from a light novel, you'd expect it to cover as much story as possible in 12 to 13 episodes. But while most light novel adaptations have a sense of closure and sometimes leave you wanting more, this one does none of that. It ends with the same unfunny antic that makes you think if J.C. Staff had given up on it.If this show doesn't convince you that abusive tsundere characters like Aria are flat characters (chests notwithstanding), I don't know what will. If it weren't for her, this would've been at least an average series with interesting premises that goes nowhere. a Butei and wants out.

The foundation of the story are strong, the characters design are good, the art are well-drawn (especially the weapons), the sounds are fantastic.The settings are: students went to a special school in Japan which trained mercenaries. A lot of people are, well, not pleased with this saying it\'s too unrealistic. Lemme remind you guys that this is fiction, it\'s fictional! Where...the hell in the world that have a school, training high school students to become mercenaries?!The main characters are basically the descendants of all the famous families in one way or another.-->The male lead which have a certain circumstance called ""Hysteria mode"" which turn him into a super whenever he\'s sexually excited, this plot, some says cliche which the protagonist gets power from something perverted, there for, he\'s a pervert. But actually he\'s not a pervert at all since the beginning he already state the fact that he had a hard time dealing with girls and they overlooked that.--> The female leads, which are descendants of Sherlock Holmes, Arsene Lupin and a long line of Miko(s). As for this, they says it cannot be related since the design are much too different, well, I\'ve got a thing or two to say about that. Originally, both Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin are fictional character which were created by Conan Doyle and Maurice Leblanc so what\'s wrong with creating the descendants which are different from them?! Not always do the descendants have to be better than the head of the family. As for the Miko(s)\'s descendant, this character is totally fictional so I don\'t have anything to say.For the storyline, they says it doesn\'t fit. I\'m not trying to offend or anything but I don\'t think you guys have brain if you says it doesn\'t fit. It fits perfectly and may as well remind you what I\'ve already said at the beginning, this is fictional!And one more thing, if anyone interested in watching this, the original light novel series are definitely the thing for you!P/s: I\'m deeply sorry if this review offended anyone, I don\'t have any intention of sort so I hope you guys can forgive me if I did. the hell in the world that have a school, training high school students to become mercenaries?!The main characters are basically the descendants of all the famous families in one way or another.-->The male lead which have a certain circumstance called ""Hysteria mode"" which turn him into a super whenever he\'s sexually excited, this plot, some says cliche which the protagonist gets power from something perverted, there for, he\'s a pervert.

The story unfolds more in action sequences then anything, basically, this character is introduced, then another is, wow, they have a beef with their individual families, etc. The story is pretty exciting! Without spoiling, I will say you will enjoy it as certain weapons are introduced etc.The Art - is very different from what you would call ""generic"" anime, the characters are drawn differently, in a more seasonal way, and the action...scenes just fit well with it. While the shadowed drawn parts may TRY to make the character seem sinister, it just comes off as cute to me with how its drawn. Its definitely fascinating to compare Hidan No Aria to other anime such as Clannad, or Kokoro Connect.The music really didn\'t do much for me, besides the opening, which had chanting. Chanting really does it for me in music, its amazing once theres chanting in there...but, the opening music for this show reminds me more of a roman-like setting when its really in a setting for boutei and action.The characters become lovable overtime, and so does the main protagonist. I will say, anybody can like these characters and their banter between one another. As situations get worse you find yourself asking, I wonder how this character is going to react etc.I enjoyed this anime alot. I enjoyed it more when I watched it, and then went to read the manga. The only problem I had was the overall pace. Things go by a little slow, especially if something big is revealed, the characters don\'t act on it as they are presented they would be.I highly recommend giving this anime a watch, and if you liked it, read the manga. It has just the correct amount of comedy and action for my enjoyment, I hope it does for you too! scenes just fit well with it.

""I love this anime, omg this guy gave a review criticizing it, better criticize his/her review by clicking not helpful."" I\'m always like: It\'s called Helpful or Not Helpful, not Agree or Disagree.Moving on, Hidan no Aria is another tsundere, romance, action, fantasy anime done by J.C. Staff, so no...surprises that there is harem in this anime. Personally, I don\'t care if there\'s harem in an anime, so I couldn\'t care less, but I\'ve always had a soft spot of harem romance animes, especially with this one. Hidan no Aria was one anime I was very excited for, since it included my favourite genres, and it look like it had a promising story line and stares a cute anime girl as the main character.If you\'ve seen Zero no Tsukaima or Shakugan no Shana, you\'ll probably get a sense as to what Hidan no Aria will present you with. A guy doesn\'t want to do this or that or get thrown into another world the doesn\'t want to be in, and falls in love with a girl and bam, you have a tsundere romance + harem.For some reason, I particularly enjoyed watching Hidan no Aria. The story and plot may have not been the strongest suits in the anime, but I found the animation to be very fluid. Here and then, I see reviews saying ""Oh the animation isn\'t realistic"" Well a couple years ago everyone fell in love with Dragon Ball which compared to now has crappy animations and those other animes, but no, today it\'s all about realism and how realistic the drawings or character movements are. Personally, the animation in Hidan no Aria for me was very fluid and eye-pleasing, and I would give it a solid 10 in Art.The soundtrack for Hidan no Aria is definitely not the strongest soundtrack J.C. Staff has done, but it\'s above decent. I liked it, and found it often set the atmosphere very well for action scenes. I give Sound an 8. The opening is kind of catchy, but it\'s really a matter of your own personal taste.The characters in Hidan no Aria are not very unique, in that there are similar to the past tsundere romances J.C. Staff has done. However, they od have likeable personalities and not to mention the multiple cute anime girls this anime throws in. In terms of character development, well, there\'s not  much room for character development in 12 episodes, which is why I want this series to have a Season 2. You obviously see a change in the way Aria (the main character) treats Kinji (the main male character) since it is a tsundere romance. Other characters also develop somewhat, but are otherwise not as noticeable. To me, character development didn\'t really matter because I watched this with the mindset of this being a cutesy tsundere action romance anime, so I give this section a 6.Overall, even though the anime may not have been original, I would say its definitely worth your time to check it out. If you have disliked the past J.C. Staff tsundere romances such as Zero no Tsukaima or Shakugan no Shana, this one probably won\'t be any different. For some inexplicable reason, Hidan no Aria is an anime I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would based on my impressions from the reviews. I give enjoyment a 9 and overall rating of 9. It may not have been ground-breaking or moving or a deep plot, but it had all the elements that I was watching for which was basically action, romance, and just that kind of casual anime to watch for the cutesy stuff and comedy. Comedy is very well-fitted with this anime. surprises that there is harem in this anime. Personally, I don\'t care if there\'s harem in an anime, so I couldn\'t care less, but I\'ve always had a soft spot of harem romance animes, especially with this one. Hidan no Aria was one anime I was very excited for, since it included my favourite genres, and it look like it had a promising story line and stares a cute anime girl as the main character.If you\'ve seen Zero no Tsukaima or Shakugan no Shana, you\'ll probably get a sense as to what Hidan no Aria will present you with. A guy doesn\'t want to do this or that or get thrown into another world the doesn\'t want to be in, and falls in love with a girl and bam, you have a tsundere romance + harem.For some reason, I particularly enjoyed watching Hidan no Aria. The story and plot may have not been the strongest suits in the anime, but I found the animation to be very fluid. Here and then, I see reviews saying ""Oh the animation isn\'t realistic"" Well a couple years ago everyone fell in love with Dragon Ball which compared to now has crappy animations and those other animes, but no, today it\'s all about realism and how realistic the drawings or character movements are. Personally, the animation in Hidan no Aria for me was very fluid and eye-pleasing, and I would give it a solid 10 in Art.The soundtrack for Hidan no Aria is definitely not the strongest soundtrack J.C. Staff has done, but it\'s above decent. I liked it, and found it often set the atmosphere very well for action scenes. I give Sound an 8. The opening is kind of catchy, but it\'s really a matter of your own personal taste.The characters in Hidan no Aria are not very unique, in that there are similar to the past tsundere romances J.C. Staff has done. However, they od have likeable personalities and not to mention the multiple cute anime girls this anime throws in. In terms of character development, well, there\'s not  much room for character development in 12 episodes, which is why I want this series to have a Season 2. You obviously see a change in the way Aria (the main character) treats Kinji (the main male character) since it is a tsundere romance. Other characters also develop somewhat, but are otherwise not as noticeable. To me, character development didn\'t really matter because I watched this with the mindset of this being a cutesy tsundere action romance anime, so I give this section a 6.Overall, even though the anime may not have been original, I would say its definitely worth your time to check it out. If you have disliked the past J.C. Staff tsundere romances such as Zero no Tsukaima or Shakugan no Shana, this one probably won\'t be any different. For some inexplicable reason, Hidan no Aria is an anime I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would based on my impressions from the reviews. I give enjoyment a 9 and overall rating of 9. It may not have been ground-breaking or moving or a deep plot, but it had all the elements that I was watching for which was basically action, romance, and just that kind of casual anime to watch for the cutesy stuff and comedy. Comedy is very well-fitted with this anime.', 'If you dont want to read skip to the LAZY REVIEW at the bottom:This anime starts out pretty great. Guns, Girls, and protagonist on a bike. Usually i do a ""One episode trial check"" when i just watch the first episode before watching an anime. it passed the trial test with flying colors, and i decided that it is going to be a good anime.The story is an interesting twist on the generic ""girl meets boy, girl decides to live with boy, other girls dont approve"" harem setup. The powers of the characters are pretty well distributed, and have an interesting activation for one...of the characters. there are quite a few different plot twists that surprise, but the story ends in an cliffdrop ""to be continued"" type ending with no definite ending.the visuals are great, the girls are pretty MOE, and the overall art style is great. the characters look nice, with good facial features, and the explosions and action scenes are well drawn.The sounds are pretty good, with pretty good soundtrack.The character development is great, the characters (although visually generic to anime) are well developed and unique. the character traits have interesting twists, and there might be a few unexpected character changes.the story is enjoyable, the characters are fun, it is not a very serious anime at times, but at others it gets very ""edge of the seat"" serious. this whole anime was great, and the only thing that puts a damper on the story is the lackluster ending.Overall its a good and interesting anime, with fun, slightly ecchi, haremy, action, shooting and very serious bits at various points. just when you think you figured the story out, there will be a twist that will surprise you.LAZY REVIEW: Good Story, Fun and Action with some dramatic bits.

You might as well read this to save your time.This anime is just ridiculous.I don\'t even know what to say...The person who wrote this aberration should feel really bad.The only enjoyment I got out of this was laughing awkwardly once in a while to the sheer madness of the plot.I wonder what went on in the ""writers"" head...""Ok, so hear me out! This is like a story about kids that go to school that teaches you to kill, but you can\'t kill anyone...(even though the characters are shooting at each other all the time.) They do missions for people that need their help, because society sure needs the help of gunfighting children, screw the police or army. There are also other rules like some good ol\' cliché ones like ""never leave your friends behind"" and other similar ones.Also, the main character gets all pumped up when he gets to see some skin and. It\'s called ""hysteria mode"".Oh and also, there are also other ridiculous superpowers mixed in there.Oh and most of the characters are like the grandchildren of famous historical characters.Oh and we should totally get Kugimiya Rie to voice the obnoxious and loud leading female character, the character is written just for her. She\'s just like all of the 5237756 other cute tsundere lolis she voices.""That\'s just the tip of the iceberg.I have NEVER read, watched or experienced anything with a plot as ludicrous as this one.Seriously, stay away from this one. The art is mediocre, story unbearable and the characters are horrible. (even though the characters are shooting at each other all the time.)

Unfortunately, there are only a few anime like this such as Black bullet, Shakugan no Shana and Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai (that is all I can think of) yea there are not that many so Hidan no Aria is probably the last one of this genre for me.Although it may be the last but it is also one of the best, it was a very thrilling ride from the beginning towards the end not the actions though, the loli. Aria is such a...kawaii tsundere loli but most of all, she is the sexiest loli I have ever seen, I get to see her ""reveal"" a couple of times and I was like ""I lost"" and I turned to hysteria mode then I imagine stuff with 30 times more brain cells than average person.Story 9/10:Very fun story, the ""hysteria mode"" thing was pretty unique. Although those big oppai people keep stealing the Kinji and Aria scene screen time but Kinji seems to like Aria the most anyways so the story progresses at an acceptable pace unlike that gay Sakai Yuuji from Shakugan no Shana which took 3 seasons 72 episodes to get to see that one scene.Art 10/10:Beautiful character design and scenery as expected from J.C. staff. No flaws.Sound 10/10:*Listens to OP* - what a trash song, so ugly choir.*Listens to ED* - yea as trash as the openni- wait a second. *looks at the ending\'s visual* - OHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!Yea the songs are trash but I add the ending to my favourite playlist anyways, when the song plays I see the Aria image in my head and that\'s the beauty of this song 10/10.Character 10/10:Aria\'s existenceEnjoyment 10/10:I really enjoyed the show. I want to rub Aria\'s belly.Overall 10/10:I\'m very sad that this show may be the last I will  see of this kind of anime. I like it even more than slice of life and it would suck to only watch CGDCT without any boy MC in the show or those normal shows without any lolis in it so I will continue reading this manga to keep experiencing this pleasure. kawaii tsundere loli but most of all, she is the sexiest loli I have ever seen, I get to see her ""reveal"" a couple of times and I was like ""I lost"" and I turned to hysteria mode then I imagine stuff with 30 times more brain cells than average person.Story 9/10:Very fun story, the ""hysteria mode"" thing was pretty unique.

I even wrote the summary for wikipedia on the 12th episode because nobody has written one for a few of the episodes.  So now I will get on with the review.I have watched about 20-30 anime in completion now, mostly ecchi and action stuff.  This of course is both.  At first I wasn't going to watch the anime because it has guns and for some reason I get very bored when I watch anime with guns and with robots (none in this...(no offense lol)).  I had been trying to find a few anime to choose from this season of anime and randomly picked this one.  Best decision of my life lol.The story is original in its on way.  There are many anime about people who go to some special school for like martial arts or shooting, but this one was quite different.  It didn't really focus on school too much like the others and was very fast paced.  Kinji and his hysteria was also something that I liked a lot.  I don't know why, but it really got me.  The story though was great and I really loved the humor and at night while I watched, my dad was yelling at me to shut up.  I couldn't stop laughing.I loved the art style too.  I am pretty picky and normally judge books by its cover by looking at the art style.  All though I respect many old anime, because of the way they are drawn such as lupin the 3rd and such, I get bored easily but they were good when they came out i guess.The different characters were very good too.  I loved how the characters were all so different and you got to the feelings of almost each one.This anime is definitely going in my favorites and I recommend it to everyone looking through this season of anime that is coming to a close.  Sorry this review kind of sucked because its my first one and i talk about non-important things.  Hope I helped :). (no offense lol)).

Hope I helped :)."", ""Alright, this is my first review so here goes nothing.I for one actually liked Hidan no Aria. I have watched many anime in my time, from ghost in the shell to sailor moon to zero no tsukaima and while it is generic, there was something different about it that drew me in.Let's face it the story wasn't particulary inspired and the art was not the standerd i'm used to and the charecters were completey unlikable.And i think thats why I enjoyed it as twisted as that seems. Aria is a spoiled brat which is why I like her, she isn't the typical hero i'm used...to even though she could fall under your typical tsundere. She treats people like dirt at all times though I ended up feeling sympathetic over her mother. You can see how she ended up so uncaring and bitter.The male lead Kinji also falls under the unlikable category and yet once again he makes interesting for me. His casual, frustrating sarcasm is so different from what i'm used to in this sort of anime. His hysteria mode is obviously of  multiple personality disorder and uninspired and yet I'm greatful for that. To often advance modes and forms take over an anime, completely smothering it.Riko is manipulative, impulsive and sadistic, but I couldn't help but narrow my eyes with Kinji when she acts innocent. Its generic, she has to be up to something, but what next, how will she betray them next because she has to. I can't help but smile when I realised how right I was.All and all the story is not complex which is perfect for some light viewing though it occaisionally requirs comedy relief to keep you interested.I rarely if ever care for an animes art work though it can add a little bit extra to the experience. Though I wouldn't let that take away from my own viewing experience.Music is important in anime. I have been known to acquire GB of official soundtracks and I was disapointed by its soundtrack which was a blur, you could not careless as one track went to another.As may have noticed I like the fact that the charecters didn't have to be  likeable which I enjoyed immensely. It was one of the none generic parts of this anime.Overall, It was an enjoyable viewing experience which I would recommend to anyone who wants a change of pace in an action and comedy anime that still manages to be light viewing, even if it does have an unique sense of humour. to even though she could fall under your typical tsundere.

It\'s made by the same studio and has a lot of the same elements as Shakugan no Shana. The difference is that it takes place in a more realistic world, and instead of swords, characters battle with guns. With all of that said, I enjoyed Hidan no Aria very much. I enjoyed it as much as Shakugan no Shana, although for different reasons. Shakugan no Shana had great storytelling and characters evolving over time. Hidan no Aria is more about dumb fun. It\'s stupid, yet, entertaining.The story takes place in a time where an...elite group of detectives, known as ""Butei"", are the watchdogs assigned to take down crime. One of the detectives is Kinji Tooyama. There\'s nothing too special about Kinji, which is why he gets the surprise of his life when he is targeted by a man known as the ""Butei killer."" Luckily, Aria sees this happening and comes to save the day. Afterwards, they form a friendship and decide they must do whatever is necessary to take down the ""Butei killer"". This is an okay story for a series, such as Hidan no Aria, but it goes downhill later on. While the majority of the series takes place in a realistic world, the end goes into fantasy territory and becomes a bit ridiculous. Again, if you switch your mind off, you\'ll have a good time.When it comes to the animation, Hidan no Aria is beautiful to watch. Knowing that, I found it odd that Hidan no Aria didn\'t look as visually pleasing as Shakugan no Shana, which came out more than four years beforehand. Some parts of Hidan no Aria looked better than others. In particular, the scenes during the OP are beyond amazing. I just wish the entire series looked as good as what was shown during that opening.Speaking of the OP, it\'s phenomenal. Easily one of my favorite OP\'s of all time. The song is extremely catchy and totally fits the mood of the series. Usually, I skip OP\'s after seeing them a few times, but not with Hidan no Aria. I always watch the entire thing. It\'s masterful work! The ED is good too, yet, I wanted more from it. When it comes to the music used in the actual episodes, they work well. Nothing too memorable. Of course, that\'s not a bad thing. Better to not be memorable than something that is remembered as bad.As for characters, Aria is great, but the fact of the matter is that she\'s an exact copy of Shana. If you loved Shana, you\'re going to love Aria. Period. Since I fall into that category, I had no problems with Aria whatsoever. She\'s a tsundere character and does exactly what most tsundere characters do. No surprises. Oh, and she\'s also related to Sherlock Holmes. Why is this important? It\'s not.Kinji is pretty much an exact copy of Yuuji from Shakugan no Shana. I guess Kinji is a bit of a stronger character since he\'s a detective and all, but that doesn\'t say much. One thing I liked about Kinji is that he has something called ""hysteria mode"", which happens when he gets pleasured by a girl in some shape or form. During ""hysteria mode"", he pretty much becomes a bad boy and takes risks he wouldn\'t normally do. It\'s stupid, but fun.There are other characters as well, but they seriously aren\'t very important. A lot of them are part of the series for fanservice. Honestly, the series would\'ve been better off without them. They don\'t really add much. One of them in particular, Riko, is rather dull. She\'s introduced as a strong character, but seems to lose that sense of relentless during the second half of the series.Despite the negatives I have, I still loved Hidan no Aria. I can\'t recommend it because I know that only a small portion of people will truly appreciate such a series. You literally have to turn your brain completely off and just go with the flow, no matter how crazy and stupid things get. If you can do that, you\'ll enjoy Hidan no Aria quite a bit.

I\'m not an ""anime scholar"", I\'m just expressing my humble opinion.I\'ve just finished the entire series and I must say two things: I started watching it because there was a tsundere and it wasn\'t an utter dissapointment. It\'s entertaining, period, nothing more to add in it\'s favor.It isn\'t groundbreaking in any sense, in fact, it seems to be something made in haste, trying to put together several elements we all like... And failing at it. Not miserably, though. Maybe  some more dedication in the plot, a little more dedication in character development, and a lot more episodes could...have been the difference between ""mediocre"" and ""very good"". Nevertheless, I seriously doubt that the premise (""Super-cops High School"") would earn something more than an 8 from me. It\'s like chocolate and pizza: each one is great, but together, they suck.I\'d only recommend it if you have nothing to do while waiting for the next episode of Shakugan no Shana III (like myself) or if you are a tsundere fan (me, again).Over and out! have been the difference between ""mediocre"" and ""very good"".

It's not the best anime ever but it was defiantly enjoyable. i get how the world/setting doesn't really make sence the some people with a school full assassins, thieves, and super powered shrine maidens who carry guns and katanas. but i think u can over look that, i mean i didn't even think about that when i started...watching the show.some people think that the Sherlock Holmes, Lupin IV, Jeane of Arc, and Dracula stuff is totally unrelated, stupid and shouldn't in the anime but so what if aria and riko are ancestors of  Sherlock Holmes and Lupin i didn't care about that at all. i guess they could have named the antagonists something else instead of Jeane of Arc and Dracula. but again, i just overlooked it.i can understand why people didn't like the characters too well they did some pretty stipid things like ordering people to be their slave, locking the door and asking to have sex in the school grounds, putting a penicle in ur breasts etc but isn't that what a romantic comedy anime suppose to be like, i mean i could name so way worse perverted stupid scenes in other animes like Seikon no Qwaser, Sora No Otoshimono and high school of the dead. i do agree the Hysteria Mode thing was pretty stupid though.there was one character that i hated and that was kinji, i mean seriously, they drawn him so badly to the point where it really didn't make any sence for any of the girls to go for him. he is totaly incompetent and a total idiot, except in Hysteria Mode but even then he's pretty bad.But overall i don't think this show is all that bad, really. Reason being i like the action/romantic comdey genre and i liked the characters Shirayuki, Riko and Reki. i like how riko says her name, her recklessess, her unpredictable character and her combat skill. i like Shirayuki because of her combat skill and her emotional character and i like reki because of her emotionlessness. so that's the reason why i don't hate this anime. it certainly keept me entertain which is the main purpose of any anime. And i think the action scenes were done very well. watching the show.some people think that the Sherlock Holmes, Lupin IV, Jeane of Arc, and Dracula stuff is totally unrelated, stupid and shouldn't in the anime but so what if aria and riko are ancestors of  Sherlock Holmes and Lupin i didn't care about that at all. i guess they could have named the antagonists something else instead of Jeane of Arc and Dracula. but again, i just overlooked it.i can understand why people didn't like the characters too well they did some pretty stipid things like ordering people to be their slave, locking the door and asking to have sex in the school grounds, putting a penicle in ur breasts etc but isn't that what a romantic comedy anime suppose to be like, i mean i could name so way worse perverted stupid scenes in other animes like Seikon no Qwaser, Sora No Otoshimono and high school of the dead. i do agree the Hysteria Mode thing was pretty stupid though.there was one character that i hated and that was kinji, i mean seriously, they drawn him so badly to the point where it really didn't make any sence for any of the girls to go for him. he is totaly incompetent and a total idiot, except in Hysteria Mode but even then he's pretty bad.But overall i don't think this show is all that bad, really.

That means that flagging this as ""not helpful"" simply because I state my personal opinion(s) is rather ignorant.Right, on with the review.Some might say that this anime was cliche, easy to read, boring, blah, blah, and blah -- and hey, I agree! But to me the second most important thing about anything is how much I enjoy it from the very beginning to the very end;...quite frankly, I enjoyed this anime a lot from start to finish.(I\'ll leave the story review at the very end, for those of you who don\'t want to run into any spoilers)So, let\'s start off with the art (8/10):_____________________________________________________________(I\'ll leave the story at the very end, for those of you who don\'t want to run into any spoilers)Personally, I liked the art a lot.

Since this kind of art is my favorite, I decided I\'d give it a 8/10.Sound quality (again, 8/10)_____________________________________________________________The quality of the voiceovers was superb, but then again, it\'s FUNimation. I thought that the occasional comedic sounds in it\'s proper placement was rather hilarious aswell, especially this one scene where the main character opens a drawer full of panties and horror-epic music begins to play.This leads to the next part of the sound review, the music. The music in this anime was quite good. The intro and credits were decent.Character (8/10)_____________________________________________________________First off, I\'m a big fan of Kinji and Aria\'s voice actors (Junji Majima and Rie Kugimiya, fun fact -- they voiced Ryuuji and Taiga in ""Toradora!""). I loved how the characters reacted to eachother aswell, it reminds me a lot of Zero no Tsukaima. The reason I gave it only 8/10 though is because I do think that it\'s a bit cliche, and I already knew what was going to happen... but none the less, I always love these types of characters interacting.Enjoyment (8/10)_____________________________________________________________I give enjoyment an 8/10 for the following reasons: though this anime is cliche, the action scenes are fast paced and fun to watch. The comedic romance will have you actually expressing emotion (atleast, it did for me) by either groaning at someone, loving, facepalm-ing, WTF-ing, or just being straight up annoyed with someone for a bit. I\'m also sort of a sucker when it comes to lolis and the main muchacho being lovey-dovey with eachother, I know -- gimme a break.Overall I give this anime an 8/10.... Alright, story review up ahead.

That just leaves us with the story.The story is a great tale and while not the most original, does it in a way that keeps it fresh and keeps you interested. The anime has its best moments at the beginning. The problem actually comes at the end, or to be more specific the last episode. While I do love this anime and would watch it nearly any day, I...feel I have to be blunt. The ending is the worst ending I\'ve ever seen in my life, anime or otherwise, arguably worse than Avatar\'s. The ending is just so out of left field that I don\'t think I can think of a reasonable argument to defend it. The whole story follows a single plot line and you do get the feeling, even from the beginning who\'s going to be the ""final boss"". However this anime decided it wanted to have a twist ending, the problem is its so much of a twist the viewer is left with a million questions, none of which are answered.Now I don\'t mean to scare you away from the anime by any means, in fact this is a more highly recommended anime I give. Its just that the ending can not be overlooked, and while I do re-watch this anime on occasion, I usually skip the last episode and just insert a better plot twist in my head.Either way, with exception of the ending, the anime is a cool action thriller that has elements of mystery that keep you in suspense, and the banter between the two heroes is always enjoyable to watch. I recommend it so check it out if you get the chance. feel I have to be blunt. The ending is the worst ending I\'ve ever seen in my life, anime or otherwise, arguably worse than Avatar\'s.

I find such plot idea to be really interesting, and the anime explores it with adequate measures.Now, the male main character, Kinji, is the regular kind of apathic guy, that seems to be almost a cliché on ecchi animes, this attitude of his annoyed me at first, but on the roll of events, he becomes a better person,...and this is quite pleasant to see.Saa, I would enter in details regarding the girls involved, but I think it may be better if I refrain myself from doing so and just give a quick insight on her personalities to avoid spoilers. There is, in order of appearance: Shirayuki, a gentle, seemingly innocent girl. Aria, tsundere, loud mouthed and the main character. And, last but not least, Riko, a perverted and twisted girl. They are quite interesting counterparts and all of them have their interesting points... On a side note, Shirayuki is my favourite.The overall plot is interesting, but gives me a feeling of being far too hurried up, and the ending gave me a feeling that a new season is yet to come, otherwise, this anime leaves many questions in the air, the excess of special powers here and there seems to be a bit too much, I wonder if there should be so much variety for such a short anime. But, all that aside, the anime offers lots of fanservice and many comical scenes too, that gives a good atmosphere between the action packed fight scenes.What I really feel obliged to compliment, though, is the sound. The music is great and is applied on just the right moments, it fits on the atmosphere swiftly and the participation of May'n is really something else. But, I can't rate it a 10, because I still have this weird feeling that something is off, it is a slight, subtle feeling, but still relevant.On a final note, the art is very good, I admire the style of the author not only for the characters, but the ambient and guns. Nozaki-san deserves a pat in the shoulder.This was my first review, I hope it was useful and I am sorry that it turned out to be so long.

I always want to find an anime that ends with the main heroine and the MC as a couple, even better if the heroine is a tsundere, because it´s really hard to find a complete tsundere route.2) It has an upcoming second season and I needed to see the first one to be on the same page. I´m not saying that this next season of Hidan no Aria will be good, the plot is not too complex at all, but I...wanted to see how the producers make the story revolve around the same MC again even if the new plot-device character is only there dor Aria.3) The kuudere or just kuu sniper girl. She had a lot of potencial, the classic too good for the MC to be with female character that does awesome stuff every scene she´s on.I kinda liked the MC´s hysteria mode, how it triggered and everything, but with the progression of the series they made it less epic in comparison as the first chapter, wich was a let down.Apart from this three points there´s nothing outstanding or even apealing for the show. I really desliked how try-hard it felt when they mentioned the whole *aria middle name* stuff and, oh lord, the *villian identity* part, the  ""Then you are *villian identity* right?"" part, ugh, that killed the little hope I had with the villian, wich was predictable as truck since the chap 10 or so.Another thing that I found wierd was the panty shot censorship, at least on the page I watched the anime. Maybe I´m use to panty shots so I´m no longer affected by them, and when I see obsious censorship I think ""wow, for japan to censor anything? this must be some serious sheet"", but I found the censorship a little out of place.Over all not a great anime, but well, it could have been worse wanted to see how the producers make the story revolve around the same MC again even if the new plot-device character is only there dor Aria.3) The kuudere or just kuu sniper girl.

With the generally negative reviews, I thought I'd tell you why.It seems like the show has an average score of around 7, but the reviews seem to run a bit more negative. It does seem like the sort of show a critic would pan, considering that it has ecchi and harem elements, and doesn't really attempt anything new.However, I don't really hold those things against a show, per se, although a show attempting something new and pulling it off can score pretty major points by pulling it off well. This show executes on what it does pretty well, *given* that...it knows that it didn't really attempt to break any new, innovative ground. It has cute, appealing characters, and I've never seen anything anywhere reference the pretty awesome sound of the show, although the OP stands out enough that I've seen occasional praise of it, more so than the show.I also like the .... not shounenness of it? I come from the seinen demographic, and the show has seinen source material. I wouldn't call the show a seinen show, per se, it just doesn't have that immature shounen feel that can turn you off if you don't come from the target demographic.I won't belabor any points here, except to say that I think you will really like the show, under the following conditions:1. you *like* harem and ecchi elements2. you don't expect a show self-consciously trying to break new ground or carry a serious message3. you can appreciate solid execution of old tropes4. you lean toward the seinen demographic5. you like a good soundtrackI just hate to think of all the people who would like this show as much as I do, and never give it a chance because it lands on the wrong side of the sorts of things that people who tend to write critical reviews tend to value, breaking new ground, not relying on old tropes, and not relying too heavily on lowest common denominator elements, like fan service. For me personally, I simply value excellent execution, and by my standards, the show seems criminally underrated. it knows that it didn't really attempt to break any new, innovative ground.

Kinji and Aria partner up when the find out the butei killer together. Kinji is an E rank butei.Aria is called Aria the Quadra she carries two guns and two swords. Aria middle name is Sherlock Holmes IV Aria has two pink pigtails. ', 'I think people are being way to harsh on this anime. Because I enjoyed it pretty much. I\'ll explain thoroughly. Check the overall review for just a quick explained one.Story: 7/10 Butei\'s. An Martial Art Orginations that train High School Students to masters of weapons. These students are trained into something like an ""Super Police Force"". The butei\'s works like a police force, and throughout the series the act like one, including arresting people and have the same basic rules as police enforcements.It\'s just that Butei\'s are trained to an unnatural level. Some students have got some supernatural powers through Blood Genes and families who...often relate to famous people like Jeanne d’Arc 500-2000 years back, Which persons they are blood related to have no bigger difference. So the writer have had a little fun, took our world, throwed in guns weapons in a High School making it kinda a Training Facility, also alternating the past for Blood Genes Powers.And we follow mainly 2 people, Kanzaki, Aria H, and Tooyama, Kinji. Kinji have a supernatural power to kinda, ""super heightened"" all senses to a supernatural level. Making him one of the best Butei\'s in the school. The school also have the Butei\'s in ranks, S-Rank, being one of the highest. Which Kinji is better then the most powerful S-ranked, Aria, in his Heightened State called Hysteria Mode. This mode activates when he basically gets enough turned on by a female body. Mostly, Aria activates it the best for romantic reasons.So! :DMostly all side-plots relate to the main story.I, in no way can say if this is Original or Not. But it\'s a new story with different settings and I found it very unique to my watching experience.You get to see a lot of perverted stuff and comedy. The main plot can be deceiving what it is until maybe half the episodes. But none the less, the side plots are good action, good comedy, slightly ecchi feeling, but it\'s not ecchi. If it ever comes to boob action, the sometimes have censored with big annoying white beams. It\'s just perverted comedy.It somewhat like an police serie, (but don\'t think its anything like one) where you have your side plots that revolves mostly in-front, while the main plot hangs in the back, continuing little by little in between until the end of the series.Art: 8/10The art is not great, but absolutely not bad. Everyone resembles High School Students, the school uniforms does suite the idea of an High School Training Facility, as I would call it. I\'ve noticed a little that it\'s cheap at some points, but very rarely. The models of the eyes (especially the female ones) are new to me, which gave me a more unique feeling to this anime.Not in any way, should you have problems watching this art. I enjoyed it a lot. It\'s great, but in ratings in terms of detail and time put down to the art compared to masterpieces. It\'s an 8.Sound: 7/10The opening is really discussable. It\'s not original, but it has a nice flow to it. I don\'t like the gunshots in the opening music. It totally ruins the feeling of a good music. Especially when the gun shot sound is awful just by itself.Background music, I honestly say, it\'s not much focus. It gets the job down and it\'s good. But I can\'t remember anything of the background music. (even now after writing this review, i watched the final 5 episodes) The Opening is to me very remember-able though.Voice acting.. Personally, when I started watching this series, I didn\'t want this High School loli type because I have seen a lot of these, and I liked it in the beginning, now it\'s just annoying. OfCOURSE the voice actor for Aria is Kugimiya, Rie, if you don\'t know who she is and the kind of voice she does the most, she voices the heroine, main female character for Toradora, Astarotte no Omocha!, Hayate no Gotoku!, Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima and many more. All of these have a very similar heroine in matter of personality. It\'s like they took the same girl, and put a different set of clothes on her.Character: 7/10This Anime is a harem even though it\'s not in MAL details. You have one guy, namely Kenji, and he is the only guy you will see. One or another guy comes in rarely.Aria, as explained before. Nothing original at all. But fitting. Kugimiya, Rie is a excellent voice actress regarded highly in the industry. But these loli, short-tempered, small breasted heroines are not fun anymore. But that does not effect the ratings in my opinion.They are more main characters, Mine, Riko. Hotogi, Shirayuki.The characters all have unique personalities and everyone gives you different laughs. Riko is the girl who likes kinji in a perverted way. Shirayuki is the one that loves him and protects him with her life. One great harem.You will get conflicts between the girls because everyone want Kinji for themselves. I personally love these kinds with conflicts of love in all ways. Perverted, funny, and so on. And it is what you will get.Enjoyment: 8/10Even if this series had some downers that is not even worth mentioning, it was a great series and I expect a second season. I laughed a lot, this is comedy mild-ecchi and super funny. Good action with martial weapons and guns, good side plots that turns out to all be a part of the story.Overall: 7/10Overall, it\'s a well deserved 7. Could easily be 8. You will get Action with martial weapons and guns. Comedy revolves around a harem type where all the girls like the same guy (funny girl fights that get really serious and conflicts), mild ecchi-comedy, you wont see underwear frankly anything, just a little bit, then it\'s censored. Side-plots that revolve around the main story, all good and funny. I enjoyed it a lot and I\'m looking forward to the second season if one is to be made.I would recommend this to people whom like action and harem. If you don\'t like ecchi, i would say don\'t watch it. This is more a guys anime then girls. But it\'s also up to the individual. often relate to famous people like Jeanne d’Arc 500-2000 years back, Which persons they are blood related to have no bigger difference.

The models of the eyes (especially the female ones) are new to me, which gave me a more unique feeling to this anime.Not in any way, should you have problems watching this art. I enjoyed it a lot. It\'s great, but in ratings in terms of detail and time put down to the art compared to masterpieces. It\'s an 8.Sound: 7/10The opening is really discussable. It\'s not original, but it has a nice flow to it. I don\'t like the gunshots in the opening music. It totally ruins the feeling of a good music. Especially when the gun shot sound is awful just by itself.Background music, I honestly say, it\'s not much focus. It gets the job down and it\'s good. But I can\'t remember anything of the background music. (even now after writing this review, i watched the final 5 episodes) The Opening is to me very remember-able though.Voice acting.. Personally, when I started watching this series, I didn\'t want this High School loli type because I have seen a lot of these, and I liked it in the beginning, now it\'s just annoying. OfCOURSE the voice actor for Aria is Kugimiya, Rie, if you don\'t know who she is and the kind of voice she does the most, she voices the heroine, main female character for Toradora, Astarotte no Omocha!, Hayate no Gotoku!, Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima and many more. All of these have a very similar heroine in matter of personality. It\'s like they took the same girl, and put a different set of clothes on her.Character: 7/10This Anime is a harem even though it\'s not in MAL details. You have one guy, namely Kenji, and he is the only guy you will see. One or another guy comes in rarely.Aria, as explained before. Nothing original at all. But fitting. Kugimiya, Rie is a excellent voice actress regarded highly in the industry. But these loli, short-tempered, small breasted heroines are not fun anymore. But that does not effect the ratings in my opinion.They are more main characters, Mine, Riko. Hotogi, Shirayuki.The characters all have unique personalities and everyone gives you different laughs. Riko is the girl who likes kinji in a perverted way. Shirayuki is the one that loves him and protects him with her life. One great harem.You will get conflicts between the girls because everyone want Kinji for themselves. I personally love these kinds with conflicts of love in all ways. Perverted, funny, and so on. And it is what you will get.Enjoyment: 8/10Even if this series had some downers that is not even worth mentioning, it was a great series and I expect a second season. I laughed a lot, this is comedy mild-ecchi and super funny. Good action with martial weapons and guns, good side plots that turns out to all be a part of the story.Overall: 7/10Overall, it\'s a well deserved 7. Could easily be 8. You will get Action with martial weapons and guns. Comedy revolves around a harem type where all the girls like the same guy (funny girl fights that get really serious and conflicts), mild ecchi-comedy, you wont see underwear frankly anything, just a little bit, then it\'s censored. Side-plots that revolve around the main story, all good and funny. I enjoyed it a lot and I\'m looking forward to the second season if one is to be made.I would recommend this to people whom like action and harem. If you don\'t like ecchi, i would say don\'t watch it. This is more a guys anime then girls. But it\'s also up to the individual.', 'Note: I may possibly be overrating this anime since it is the first one of it\'s type that I have watched. Take this into consideration before deciding if my review is helpful or not.Art (8/10)Just what you would expect from an anime in 2011. Nice detail and color used in virtually all scenes. With this being the first anime with guns that I have watched, I may have overrated the art a bit. Despite this, I truly do believe that the guns and bullets were animated quite well. The way they bounce off and hit objects looked real for the most part. Solid artwork overall....Characters (8/10)At first, I thought that the stars of the show were only going to be a loli tsundere female and a useless male protagonist. I\'m glad that I was wrong. With the addition of a yandere (Shirayuki) and a kuudere (Reki), along with the seemingly bipolar Riko, I found the nice variety of personalities extremely interesting. For the most part, I found all the characters likable in one way or another. Yes, even a yandere like Shirayuki (whom I hate) had at least one good point in her character. With each of the aforementioned females having at least one episode that centered around them, the series became more interesting. Although they had limited screentime, I felt that the other side characters (Mutou and the rest of Assault) didn\'t get enough character development. However, I understand that since time restraints may have been the cause for this.Sound (7/10)This time, I\'ll focus on the voice acting first. With Kugimiya Rie and Majima Junji (Taiga and Ryuuji in Toradora!) pairing up once again, it felt a bit nostalgic when I heard Aria and Kinji speak. Aside from the excellent voice acting, the other sound aspects of this anime fell short. Although the OP and ED are not terrible, they are certainly not memorable. The BGM felt like it wasn\'t even present with the instrumental version of the OP being played at the most critical scenes. After accounting for all of this, the voice acting by itself wasn\'t able to impress me enough to increase my score for this category.Story (9/10)After reading the synopsis, I was given a brief idea of what this anime would be about. The idea of a loli twin-tailed tsundere wielding pistols and fighting against evil with the help of a ""sometimes skilled"" partner sounded generic but interesting. However, I was quite surprised at how the story developed. Yes, there were some really predictable and lame scenes but I was quite forgiving since this was my first time watching this type of anime. According to others, this adaption was done poorly but since I haven\'t read the LN yet, I\'m basing my score on what I saw, regardless of what happens in the LN.Overall (8/10)A decent anime overall. Nothing too spectacular but it didn\'t bore me to death either. With a great variety of characters and a interesting story, I enjoyed watching Hidan no Aria. As for a second season, I don\'t really mind if there is going to be one or not. If there is, I will definitely watch it since this season met my expectations. The somewhat cliffhanger ending was a bit annoying though. If you got nothing better to do, just give Hidan no Aria a try. There\'s a chance that you may like it despite what many critics say about it.

To tell you the truth, I had really good expectations for this anime, since a lot of my friends recommended it. Sadly, those expectations were quickly dashed. One thing I don\'t like in an anime is bad storytelling. And oh boy, was it bad.....In the first few episodes, it was pretty solid. All of the settings were established cleanly. The characters were introduced pretty nicely. And the story itself was good. But after awhile, things started to go in a totally different direction. A hunt for a notorious...detective killer suddenly turns into a paranormal quest to destroy Dracula? Really? I was really wondering what happened to the director\'s sense of direction. Maybe it could have worked if they added more episodes to at least lay down a good story foundation, or they could have changed it into a different setting entirely. Some of the main characters in the Manga and Light Novel were even degraded into measly secondary and supporting roles. What was Takashi Watanabe thinking?And the plot twists were also horrid. But if they had used their twists well, maybe they could have redeemed themselves even by a little bit. Sadly, that was not the case. They had the opposite effect actually. Most of the plot twists were horrible and completely not needed. Well, maybe some of them did work. But the fact still remains. It was bad.The art was sort of disappointing as well, though I didn\'t mind it at the time. Although they managed to show the feelings of the scenes they were portraying, it was.... unsatisfying. It could have been better, really.The sound was pretty good. Yet it wasn\'t anything special. The OP and ED were catchy, and I found myself listening to them time and time again. I even learned how to play Kameria no Hitomi during the summer. Honestly, the OPs and EDs seemed a bit better than the story.The seiyuus were also pretty sync with the characters. Especially Rie. I have always been a fan of her voice acting, along with other Tsundere voice actresses. She really gave life to Aria and her ""tsun-ness"" (forgive the term).I don\'t really think I can recommend this anime to any certain group of people. I did enjoy a bit of it. I was disappointed in the end though. But it did receive a good amount of recognition, considering it made the cover of some Anime Magazines. If your one of those people who like action-harem anime without a solid story line, I guess you could check out this anime then. detective killer suddenly turns into a paranormal quest to destroy Dracula?

I continued reading and watching the anime/manga but then it came the part when...they reveal that Aria is from the family Holmes and Riku from Lupin, I just started to think WTF is that for? Including fiction characters on the anime just because they didn\'t had imagination to think in something better. But it just came worst with the familiar from a historical heroine Joan Of Arc.Despite that I continued to watch and reading the anime and manga, thinking that probably there would be more story or the story could improve with the time.But then the final part on the anime appeared an I just became stupefied with the fact that Vlad was the Dracula and became a giant Wolf. WTF is that?The fight against Vlad just happened too fast, they could actually put an effort for an awesome fight during 2episodes at least. Vlad 4th Weak Point was just to easy to find.Then I dropped the manga, because the anime was a FAIL and I thought ""Until now the manga is following the same story of the anime, probably if I read it will be the same thing and the same deception""So that why I am giving Hidan no Aria a 3.Story: 3- I think it was poor;Art-7 I think the Art was the best thing on the anime, the rest was really poor;Sound- 6 I actually hated the opening, but the rest of the sound were fine;Character-3  The fact of being character related to fiction character or historical heroines was bad. Kinji ""pervert mode"" I think it\'s Ok, but the fact of every girl is after him is just to conventional;Enjoyment-3 I laugh a few times but it wasn\'t the anime that amazed me or gave me chills;Hope that helps you and sorry if it has some errors. they reveal that Aria is from the family Holmes and Riku from Lupin, I just started to think WTF is that for?

Kinji Tohyama goes to a school for butei, or as we like to call them in America, detectives. He ends up being targeted by the Butei Killer who tries to take him down by attaching a bomb to his bicycle and sending killer segways with machine guns attached to them after him. As you can tell, this anime doesn’t take itself very seriously. He meets a pink haired girl named Aria and together they go on wonderful adventures in order to clear the name of Aria’s mother, who has been sentenced to jail for thousands...of years because she has apparently been pinned with the murders of every person in the world. The mother part is never fully explained and makes no sense whatsoever. As the series progresses we meet Shirayuki, a girl in love with Kinji and jealous of Aria; Riko, an insane girl who dies a  lot of sexual advances on Kinji; and Reki, a rather quiet sniper girl. The show is divided into three story arcs over the course of its twelve episodes, four episodes dedicated to each book.The story, as you can tell, is not too good. It’s like a summer blockbuster film in that it has a very loose plot that is just there to provide for tons of action and adventure. And Aria does deliver in the action and adventure department. For those wishing to have something to think about or wishing for a more story driven adventure, this isn’t where you want to go. It’s like the Transformers of anime, only with less explosions, less giant robots, and less Shia Lebouf.There’s this subplot about Kinji’s brother that we never hear much about, and something about an ex-girlfriend  that is hinted at during episode eleven, and shown in episode twelve. The problem is, these things are not resolved and in order to get the resolution I’ll have to read the books which you can read a translated version of thanks to some fans, but it is not the tightest translation and the books read more like a script trying to be a novel.AnimationThe animation of the show is beautiful and you can tell that most of the production funds went into the animation (though the story was already in the book, so they didn’t need to fund writers as much I guess). The animation is perhaps one of the shows strongest suits. From the beautiful backgrounds to the well drawn characters and fluid action scenes, the animation is great.SoundThe sound is good. The opening is a typical J-pop piece but it’s not at all bad. The ending song is also typical, nothing stands out there. The voice actors are good and add to the comedy and few emotions displayed throughout the series. The sound is another good point of the series, but there has been better music in anime before.CharactersI’m going to get flak for this, but I enjoyed all the characters. They were not totally fleshed out, but they each had their own quirks and silly things about them that made them more likeable despite some of the genericism. Kinji is a very typical anime male surrounded by a bunch of girls; he’s bashful and denies everything concerning romance. His quirk is the fact that when he pops a boner, he goes into Hysteria Mode, when he is super suave and can fight like crazy. It’s a silly idea, but I thought it was quirky and funny. Aria is Kinji’s main love interest and she’s the great great grand-daughter of Sherlock Holmes. She is searching for a Watson and finds Kinji. She’s a slave driver and comes across as bitchy but she is scared of lightning and thunder and I guess she’s a typical teenage girl if you gave a bashful teenage girl two pistols.Shirayuki is in love with Kinji and is a priestess who can do crazy stuff with her sword. She’s very bashful yet is always trying to bed Kinji. She’s always fighting Aria and when Shirayuki interacts with Aria, it’s always funny.Riko is the great great grand-daughter of Arsene Lupin and she has this weird quirk where she can use her hair as a weapon. It’s stupid, sure, but it doesn’t not fit in with the rest of the series. She’s the only character that you can feel any sympathy for because of a childhood problem we learn later on, and she also is the only character that has any sort of development. It’s not a lot, but there is some.Reki is a quiet sniper girl. She has very few lines and doesn’t do too much in the series, though I would have liked to see her more. She was the only truly badass character. The rest were kind of badass, but they also came across as funny and silly so it negated the badassery.There are three bad guys in the series. One of them I’ve already described. The other two are not well developed at all, and are just bad guys. Nothing much to them, just something to shoot at.OverallAria the Scarlet Ammo is, in movie terms, a popcorn movie. It’s got little substance, but a lot of flash. It looks good, it has great action, but its bad guys aren’t that exciting and the characters are all there to be complete opposites of each other and provide comedic relief and some tension during fight scenes. That’s not to say it’s not good. I loved it. I liked all the characters in some way or other, I liked the action sequences; everything but the story.It’s frivolous fun. It contains a lot of juvenile humor concerning boobs and boners, it has that typical anime thing where we get lots of shots of thighs and cleavage for no reason but fan service, and it has fun action sequences. It’s fun. It’s not something for the guy looking for story, it’s not something for the girl looking for meaningful action and romance. If gone into with the right mindset, Aria can be a good way to blow a few hours.

If you go in expecting something with tons of substance, then you’ll be disappointed.', 'So I came with big expectations to this show. I really thought, that it would be funny - and the first episode did this job pretty good. But after that : it just became horrible.I want you to know, that I even watched 7 episodes of this bullcrap, before writing my review. But with every episode the story became more and more a compilation of clichées and bad plotwist - no bad is not the right word. They were pathetic.First of all, lets make a short Overview of the grid from my review:[1] Story[2] Artstyle & Logic[3] Animation[4] Sound[5] Characters...[6] EnyojmentOkay so here it comes: Hidan no Aria, one of the most dissapointing animes ever to be watched.1) The Story beginns somewhen in the 21. century - at least it seems like it does. Why does it only seem? Because they don\'t even give a complete watch over the city. Anyways: In order to stop the problem of upcomming crime there was a group called the ""Buttei"" founded. They are somekind of soldiers who work like the police in order to remain safety for the citizen. BUT they work for money. Well you know the police-officer from the neighbouerhood also gets his wage every month.Most of them are children (don\'t ask me why - they probably think that it is cool)No really - there is not a actual matter WHY they are still childern - it makes no sense in no way of sight. There are plenty of Girls wich are really really clichée-based and their characters are sooooo flat - a thing you can\'t tell about their chests. Yes: nearly every girl - no matter if she is just 14 or 18 years old - they all got tripple Z over 9000...So then lets continue: The ""Buttei"" have a ranking based on their skill-levels. A concept that is so well known and there were so many ways to make it interessting: but they failed. It\'s just nonesense.They have a problem - a self-claimed ""Buttei-killer"" is on his pseudo-bloody trip of ripping the buttei appart with doing terror-atacks. Oh yeah well you know - instead of just blowing random bikes up etc. you could just fuckin\' blow up the whole island. Yes: the Buttei have built a artificial Island on wich they have built a giant school. What? Thats totaly normal.After 7 episodes it just makes me wanna cringe and cut out my brain - the pain is just to much for me.2) Okay so lets continue with the artstyle: It\'s okay. It\'s not something special, there are no real overthought color-palets or anything like that: they cust painted their world a bit with a standart 24bit color-program. And it doesn\'t even match. Yes I know - its from 2011 and digitla-painting wasn\'t as developed as nowadays. BUT there are shows from 2006 wich did a better job at this - so its just failing also on this point. There are some detail-works - especially on the bra\'s or skirts of the girls.Then there are a huge amount of logic fails: okay - you don\'t know wich I mean? Let me tell you some of them:Episode 1: a girl jumps from a roof of a building with about 7-8 floors. That would be about 30 meter. Yes. She jumps - falls about 1-2 seconds and THEn opens her parachute. She would have ended as sludge on the concrete.Then there are these moments when they shot. Okay I understand they are super high equiped and trained killer-elite fuckers. BUT: how can you manage to avoid a bullet at 1400 feet or nearly 500 km/h. With a distance of about 15 metets (episode 1 or 2) or even less (episode 4,5,6) they would have to react within 0.1 to 0.036 seconds. WELL FUCK.Also: you can\'t cut a bullet in halfes with a sword or a knive and even if you would manage to do some with idk your magical-dick-mode or whatever he uses (yes he has to get horny to get into that mode) : They bullet would not fly apart that fast that it wouldnt hurt you. It you still rip you apart cause of a distance of aproxiamtely 0.25 meters (farthes) or less (more logical).Then - yeah of course if a car flips it explodes instantely. NO IT DOESN\'T.A bomb with about 3500cc of plastic-explosives - yeah of course it makes a 60 meters high fountain of water and a explosion of more than 30meters in diameter when exploding UNDERWATER. No... jsut no. Please die whoever decided to make this happen.3) They where okay. The main animation was still acceptable - but the cgi. They used standart-explosion animations from things like windows-movie-maker in a DRAWN world. They didn\'t even manage to draw a plane of so - they animated it: and they did horrible.4) Well the original-synchro is okay. You can\'t really say something bad about it, I don\'t have to rage on this one. BUT the opening soudntrack for example: it is just shit. IT\'s soooo dreadfu and aaah no I just can\'t stop bleeding from my ears when hearing it. Sorry but I had to skip it after the first time in order to protect my ears from getting cancer.5) There are no really special characters. They have no real story wich is somehow new or even interessting: they just packed a train full of shit and let it go - and it crashed and hell yeah: it crashed hard. Every-single girl in the show is a over-sexualized version of a doll with giant boobs, no real character nor a development. They are just useless. Then: oh yeah the boys, The main-character is okay. Not good but also not as poor as the rest. You can life with him. Only thing: why didn\'t he jsut shot the fucking girl when she was starting to tell her evil-plan and her relation to his brother Nii-san and the EU. Oh ps: thanks for pulling the European Union into dirt ;) I\'m sure you didn\'t even overthing what the EU is. Anyways. All the other boys are not even there to be a part of the story. They are just fillers to tell bad news or make horrible comedy. Do you get it? It\'s a harem with bad action, clichée girls, shit story, plotholes of the doom, forced and bad plottwists, appealing music and hell of a lot pain for my brain.6) The first episode was really okay - i even laughed. But afterwards it becomes really bad. I mean - really really bad.I\'d rather watch Euphoria than this show.I think they did a horrible job. They had a well known but still interessting concept but they\'ve ridden it with full speed into a wall and then tried to make a show out of the bit\'s of crap that was left.2/10 overall [6] EnyojmentOkay so here it comes: Hidan no Aria, one of the most dissapointing animes ever to be watched.1) The Story beginns somewhen in the 21. century - at least it seems like it does. Why does it only seem? Because they don\'t even give a complete watch over the city. Anyways: In order to stop the problem of upcomming crime there was a group called the ""Buttei"" founded. They are somekind of soldiers who work like the police in order to remain safety for the citizen. BUT they work for money. Well you know the police-officer from the neighbouerhood also gets his wage every month.Most of them are children (don\'t ask me why - they probably think that it is cool)No really - there is not a actual matter WHY they are still childern - it makes no sense in no way of sight. There are plenty of Girls wich are really really clichée-based and their characters are sooooo flat - a thing you can\'t tell about their chests. Yes: nearly every girl - no matter if she is just 14 or 18 years old - they all got tripple Z over 9000...So then lets continue: The ""Buttei"" have a ranking based on their skill-levels. A concept that is so well known and there were so many ways to make it interessting: but they failed. It\'s just nonesense.They have a problem - a self-claimed ""Buttei-killer"" is on his pseudo-bloody trip of ripping the buttei appart with doing terror-atacks. Oh yeah well you know - instead of just blowing random bikes up etc. you could just fuckin\' blow up the whole island. Yes: the Buttei have built a artificial Island on wich they have built a giant school. What? Thats totaly normal.After 7 episodes it just makes me wanna cringe and cut out my brain - the pain is just to much for me.2) Okay so lets continue with the artstyle: It\'s okay.

All of the characters are relatively likable, as they each show a different asset of skills. All in all, I very much liked this anime as it was very enjoyable as long as you take into mind that their will...be plot holes as the series only covers a small part of the whole thing.EDIT: After finishing the series, it feels like it's only half done.

It wasn’t spectacular like I had hoped but it wasn’t terrible like I feared. Even though the theme song is mostly about Aria the story basically revolves more around Kinji who is just trying to live his life at a Butei High School. The series was funny at times but sometimes got to be downright annoying. The plot basically changes so fast I almost couldn’t keep up. This is one of those echiis where almost all the girls are in love with the same guy but the difference is these girls might end up KILLING EACHODER...in the fight for his heart. I personally though the ending was a shoker so did not expect it (and I am rather good at guessing whose the bad guy in anime’s)so If you like watching hot girls with short skirts kicking ass you should watch this. in the fight for his heart.

Even though the genre mixture of Action, Comedy, Romance, and School can work fine together, you still have to be careful with it.You can have a anime that has lots of action and serious moments, and plenty of comedy, you just need to know when to place where.I\'ll be straightforward, stuff I didn\'t like:-Out of place/Too much added and bland comedy.-CharactersI probably would\'ve enjoyed this anime more if it was just a episode-by-episode anime (I...liked how the OVA was) about Main-Boy and Tsun-girl go with highschool pals and complete missions together as Butei. But unfortunately no.With anime like this you it\'s hard to have both cliche anime comedy....and adding the ""serious moments"" into it too, it makes it hard to take seriously, with the added fanservice during those ""serious moments"" doesn\'t help it either.The other issue is with the characters, most of them are reallllyyyy ANNOYING.I would have been fine if the characters had begun annoying, but gradually developed into good characters, but that doesn\'t happen.Let\'s take Aria for example, she\'s being the standard, abusive tsundere loli, she gets into a couple SHOULD-BE ""personality-changing moments"" with the main guy, she should change at least a little bit, at LEAST her view on him. But no, she still acts like a b.Only thing that changes is she likes him a lil bit, but is still an asswad to him!Just in general, one part of the show I feel like had potential was its story shift. But it also could\'ve done way better, so I don\'t actually like the story shift, I just like the concept...a little.From the majority of the characters being revealed as descendants of history-making people from Europe, and them all having ancestral grudges to each other, was actually pretty interesting. I haven\'t watch AA yet, but if it expands more upon this, I feel like I would enjoy it more.Pretty much, this anime is....ok depending on how you look at how the genres are executed.

Those people are just brainless... Its true that those people who read the novel may be little disappointed since this adaptation changes and leaves out many great parts and details, but its still great.Story: I think that the story is well done. Its about a High School for Butei but i will skip the summary since everyone knows it already. What i like is that it takes known characters like Lupin, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Cleopatra and others and makes a good story out of it....It has known items like Durandal and Ragnarock and others too.I like supernatural stuff and i like how they implemented that element here and it fits the story well. Its unique. I dont want to spoil anything so i will just leave it at the general stuff but you just cant go wrong when its about girls with guns, detectives and high school and lots of action. Comedy is great too.Characters: The characters are great aswell, most of you already know but the 2 main chars are voice by Rie and Junji which as a pair was also seen in Toradora. That was good shit and its nice to see them here aswell. Im a fan of Kugimiya Rie, always like her tsundere loli characters(Shana is mai favu of all). So yea they did a great job, i mean its hard to resist a tsundere loli with twintails, pink hair and guns thats voiced by Rie.Art & Sound: That is normal as you would expect from a modern anime, its great but nothing too special.*I really recommend the light novel for those who did not read it yet, its lot better than the anime and manga. I gave this a 10 but the novel goes above that in terms of ranking and is really worth it. The story gets really good in the later parts, hope to see them in a second season.

Anyways, this is a good anime, i really had a good time watching it with my neighbor and...i would be happier if they make more episodes. then, here it comes:IN MY OPINION:The story: well, you know, girl falling from the sky, gets into the main character´s life, messes it up, usual stuff, BUT, in this case in particular, they involved the ""girls with gunz"" concept, i like that!

Thats why this anime is so good you only have the male and female protagonist in each \'mission\' that way the 3rd character is someone different which allows a person to keep interested it whats going on.I recommend this anime to people who like lots of action with surprisingly lots of comedy mixed in.Sometimes you just have to feel sorry for the male protagonist but on other occasions you just want to be in the same boots too. where i heard this it really comes to mind when watching this anime and seeing her relationship with her fellow butei.You can really connect with the main 2 characters and with other characters it adds a funny flare to it as well it also allows more interesting things to happen.No one wants something where the same people do the same thing over and over again.

The series is hard to judge as on one end (character development) it sticks strictly to the books while on another end (plot/setting) it is so radically implausible that it is hilarious.I found the series fairly average though your mileage will vary. There\'s some decent action sequences and a bit of ecchi. The harem aspect isn\'t too terribly strong and the plot continuity breaks apart towards the end of the series. If girls and guns (or Rie...Kugimiya) is your thing, then I\'d try a few episodes.Animation:The animation is Aria is fairly good. I like the color scheme and the gun fight animation sequences, and the character designs are cute. There are definitely ecchi sequences including some white fog though some if it is more intentional rather than accidental (Riko *cough*). The series can be summed up as fruit salad including a bunch of guns and explosions and lots of girls on top of the main lead.Sound:I really dislike the singer in the OP, which totally ruins the otherwise somewhat dark yet fast-paced song. The ED is a rock piece with a decent main melody but a bit too slow-paced. The BGM is fair and consists of a wide variety of instrumental guitars and a few electronic pieces.As for VAs, we find Rie Kugimiya in her typical short-girl with a tsundere personality. Special props to Mariya Ise for her role as Riko with her combination of cuteness and sexual suggestiveness. Perhaps one reason why I\'m willing to add the sequel to my watchlist.Story:This is where the review gets tricky... this series in innovative in how it puts a whole bunch of radical ideas together, yet utterly plain in adopting tsundere behaviors and following harem traditions. It does a good job introducing the wacky setting but like many other series ends up losing its way near the end of the series; a good comparison can be made at this point to Date a Live. In both shows, the ending is a bit overboard and early antagonists eventually are adopted as supporting assistants.The overall plot takes an arc-based approach with each arc culminating in a showdown with an antagonist. These arcs build on each other and the show ends with a hilarious battle that doesn\'t really resolve much, hence the sequel.This is definitely one series that was probably better in its novel form as there are lots of teasers and references that will not make sense unless you read the novels or you wikipedia all the details. Not to mention a lot of plot holes and unanswered questions.Character:As with the story section, you have a lot of strange characters. The school has lots of students that are apparently descendants of well known figures such as Sherlock Holmes and thus they ""inherit"" special/supernatural abilities. Our main character, for instance, has an ability to go into ""cool-guy"" mode when he is aroused by women, a mode in which he somehow turns into 007 and becomes ridiculously good at shooting/charming/thinking/lock picking, etc.The character development is fairly muted, as more of the focus is on just character interactions, i.e. an increasing number of girls fighting over our main lead. These interactions are fairly humorous as it often involves cat fights with guns/swords but otherwise follow a typical harem progression.Value:Despite the series using a bunch of cliches and some other strange elements, this was a decent watch, if just to laugh at the hilarity of it all. Rie Kugimiya does her typical job and you even get a few nice action sequences.Riko is definitely what you\'ll remember and probably enjoy the most in this show; not quite a Yuno Gasai, but memorable nonetheless.

These interactions are fairly humorous as it often involves cat fights with guns/swords but otherwise follow a typical harem progression.Value:Despite the series using a bunch of cliches and some other strange elements, this was a decent watch, if just to laugh at the hilarity of it all. Rie Kugimiya does her typical job and you even get a few nice action sequences.Riko is definitely what you\'ll remember and probably enjoy the most in this show; not quite a Yuno Gasai, but memorable nonetheless.', ""For me this wasn't that bad. When i see other peoples complaints about this i can see why some don't like this. But i did actually get some enjoyment out of this. Even with some problems.There are a couple things that are wrong with this but i'll just list a couple.1. The MC for most of the season is kind of annoying and an idiot. He also tends to be really rude to his childhood friend who has a crush on him and is nothing but nice.2. There are a good amount of stories that are brought up that are never resolved or...are given any actual effort put into some. Even near the end we are introduced to a character that we've never seen before and is hinted has a history with the MC yet we are only given two scenes with her that don't provide anything.3. There is a love triangle happening and these tend to always help ruin my opinion of the show. This get's kind of annoying but not the worse i'v seen of this happening.Over all i found this a pretty fun story if you don't take everything way too seriously. This tends to have a lot of comedic and serious stuff in it so there is a fine line on whether to take this seriously or just watch it for fun. are given any actual effort put into some.

But one thing I find interesting about a lot of these reviews is now petty some of them can be at time. Such as if an anime doesn't conform to their view of the perfect anime is, it's trash. I however like viewing anime with an open mind and I love to turn people onto decent anime. Not perfect anime, but anime you can sit down and watch and enjoy, laugh, smile,  feels something . Anything at all. So I'm going to review this anime and I hope my review inspires you to...watch and decide for yourself.The story of this anime Is not too complex. It's actually very funny, but also very quirky as well. Basically a school exists for people who are interested in certain fields of combat/investigation. Our characters are decendants of people of legends such as Sherlock Holms and Lupin the Third. Which is an interesting concept to me. It's a fairly simple story which leads up to a nice little reveal and ending that isn't too hard to swallow. It may be a bit off the wall at times, but it's anime. Anime isn't to always be based in reality.The art style is normal. Nothing too out of the ordinary. It doesn't shine or throw anything too catch my eyes besides the choreography.  I'm also going to say the sound isn't too bad as well. It all fits for this type of anime. There isn't happy music when something sad is going on. It's not blowing me away with an orchestra and sending me on a beautiful trip.  It's plain,  and that's ok.The characters are a bit bland and follow anime tropes to a T. Which I'm ok with. You won't be subjected to feels but you will get a good laugh here and there. Voice acting was standard. Nothing would make this anime any more normal except maybe a perverted male friend who constantly gets our MC in trouble bur...its fine as is.Did I enjoy it? Heck yeah. I laughed my tail off. The story is fine,  sounds and acting were average and the characters may have been bland but I'm not a perfectionist. Something that makes me laugh and smile and is enjoyable to watch deserves praise. And this anime in all its averageness deserves praise for being highly enjoyable if you are looking to kill time and have a good laugh. I recommend it if you want to smile a bit and want to see something to get down off of those deep ride anime that send you on a rollercoaster of feels.This is a downtime anime when you wanna chill and relax. Not a complex story, no deep characters. Just a good old time to be had. watch and decide for yourself.The story of this anime Is not too complex.

Just a good old time to be had."", ""Im guessing the first thing that captures most people when choosing an anime to watch is how captivating the synopsis is, and how 'cool' the characters look, however i don't think this approach is working for me.Story: 4 - Hidan no Aria boasts a premise which feels like something borrowed from many different shows, however as high school animes seem to be so popular i can't fault them for going with it. A school where the students named Butei are taught to become merceneries and always carry a handgun feels like an interesting storyline, however it all just doesnt come together and leaves you wanting...something more. What annoyed me is how irrelavant a lot of things are, i mean even the name doesn't make sense ' Aria the Scarlet Ammo', i mean it just sounds like a bunch of words that could describe the anime were put into a box and a child just picked them out whilst not being too bothered about the order either. The story is there is no story, every episode just seems like a mini fight between the main characters over the love or just sexual presence of the protoganist who's name i can't even be bothered to write because he was irrelevant as well. He is portrayed to be a weakling who can only become some amazingly super smart and cool protective person when he enters 'Hysteria Mode' and this can only be set off by him being sexually aroused of all things. Now i could just go with it if they at least explained how this had occured and where this ability had come from, however like many things in the series it was just left unanswered, like what is the fate of his brother who apparently died on a ship, and why is he letting someone stroll around with him like they are best friends, someone who might know his brothers.whereabouts and not even bother asking. He just seemed really drab the entire time and would come alive for maybe 30 seconds when he was in hysteria mode. Also 'IU' the supposed criminal organisation that have been trying to kill 'Butei', no information whatsoever is given about them or what they stand for or their goals, however their female operatives seem to share a similar trait of ditching the organisation and being best friends with the protagonist who they were trying to kill.Sound + Art: 8 - I guess the art style is one of the shows saving graces, it looked fresh and the art work on the characters and there weapons looked pretty amazing if im honest however other then that not much stood out. The opening was pretty catchy, i did find myself skipping the ending however but that is just my personal taste. The voice actors all seemed placed rightfully according to their character type, Rie Kugimiya as Aria did a great job as the tsundere type that she is well known for and she is one of the reasons i wanted to keep watching, however i did think i was watching Toradora at moments (one of my fav animes) not only due to how many times she said idiot but how similar the characters looked, and their hate of big breasts haha.Characters: 5 - The characters just didn't really stand out to me, and that doesn't mean they were not fun or enjoyable but they just all fit into character types that i have seen many many times before, but what i like about Hidan no Aria is that it knows this and doesn't shy away from it, which results in some pretty funny and random moments. The main male Kinji Tooyama is the quiet, bored, dissaproving of his lifestyle kind of guy, even though he for some reason finds himself with three different girls all after him, and to be honest even though the creators are trying to push him to Aria, i still didn't see any affirmation of his feelings to her in particular other then he gets turned on faster seeing her naked then other girls, and if this is what passes for love nowadays then i am seriously behind. Aria is the typical hot headed Tsundere however with her the rage just seems over the top, and i can't put this fault only on her as the other characters such as Shirayuki also suffer from this, this annoying random urge to kill any female that Kinji is speaking to, now maybe because guns are natural in their school setting i shouldn't really care but i expected a bit more emotion and opening up (from the heart) instead it was replaced with who can unbutton their top the fastest. So yeah i would have preffered some more emotional scenes espicially if they were going to put a group of girls after him like that, some people say its a harem, some say its not and i can see both reasons why, all i know is you won't find any of your hopes fufilled.Enjoyment: 5 - Do i feel like i've wasted hours of my life, honestly yes. Did i enjoy some parts of it, also yes. Would i recommend you to watch it, hells no. There are so many other things you could do then keep asking yourself questions that are never going to be answered whilst watching this. Its like a tease, when you think its going good and you were right to keep watching it will name the characters after fictional people such as Holmes and Lupin and Dracula, some of which i don't even think were in the same time period. This names were also something that were not given an explanation and i still to this day don't know why they were included. I don't hate this anime, but its not one i would recommend to my friends, espicially any of those who are starting out and don't want to be put off for life. Wow, so that's my first review done. I hope i didn't nag too much but some things just needed to be said. something more.

I'm not sure why that appealed to me so much, but I think it's a great backdrop for an anime.Going into the anime, I didn't take it too seriously; after all, I had read the MAL summary. With a story like that, it shouldn't be taken too seriously. That's probably why I got such great enjoyment out of the entire show. It did stray a bit from the original premise of a mercenary high school towards the end, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment.The other thing...that was interesting was that Aria was able to pull off a pianoish battle theme, which was really cool. And overall, the OST stood out to me as quite good.I'm not a fan of chibish girls like Aria, but I was willing to put up with it for this anime.You also have your usual assortment of character tropes, but I also expected that, and I don't think they abused them to the point where it became annoying.Overall I think it was my enjoyment factor that really made me want to keep watching, not one particular trait of the anime. that was interesting was that Aria was able to pull off a pianoish battle theme, which was really cool.

Why the best protection for a female fighter is provided by an outfit that disrupts the enemy thinking with the necessity to appreciate some naked skin? Why it is so necessary to make it clear that a heroine speaks while having her panties on? I guess the goals of all that and Hidan no Aria are the same.This anime passes some tests for greatness. Do I want to skip the opening or the ending song...after hearing that 10+ times? No. Do I wonder how 20+ minutes of an episode could pass by unnoticed? Yes. Have I remembered a moment from this anime all of a sudden next day? Yes. Is viewing of any episode a reliable way to change the weather? Yes, absolutely.Can I expect everyone to share that with me? Well... there is a precondition.Hidan no Aria may look like a high school story, or mystery, or fighting, or harem, or tsundare act, or comedy, or drama. I may, if you believe it is. The precondition is that you do not.If you do, it will turn out to be a mediocre or even bad anything, from a harem to a fighting. Technical perfection going nowhere. If you do not, just relax and enjoy the show, the same technical perfection is worth it. This way the anime can stand on its own.However, it should not. Hidan no Aria quotes, resembles, links to lots of other anime, from Claymore to Sizumiya, from Daphne in the Brilliant Blue to Shana, from Elfen Lied to Freezing. And all that appears to be some quite serious anime. Something that, when taken really seriously, may be painful to see. Aria, not being serious at all, takes that pain away.It clears that which all the hot springs and panties have left behind. It makes the show lighter and easier. You do not need to pretend you do not see some things any more. The scenes in a bath are more efficient from this moment on.For that purpose, it is enough to see Aria once. I will see it again, but this is optional. Maybe that is why DVDs are not selling well enough and there may be no second season.I would miss it, but Aria has already done its job well and we can leave without the next one for a while, say for another 10 years. after hearing that 10+ times?

Usually JC Staff does a great job with the light novel adapatations of Shana, Index, and Zero no Tsukaima, so I wasn't really worried. Unfortunately, saying that they dropped the ball on this series is a gross understatement. Don't get me wrong, the series is probably fine by itself if you've never read the original work, but since I had, it left a lot to be desired for me. Moments...that were once moving, emotional, and suitably epic are in most cases reduced to coming off as cheesy and ridiculous. Since there is almost no introspection from Kinji, many of the events that were so cool in the novel end up looking like complete bullshit and arbitrary deus ex machina. It's still a fun watch, but you've been warned--don't take it seriously. One thing I will say, all the girls are deliciously cute. Recommended for fans of Zero no Tsukaima, Shana, Toradora, Astarotte no Omocha, and any other show where Kugimiya Rie voices a loli. that were once moving, emotional, and suitably epic are in most cases reduced to coming off as cheesy and ridiculous.

What little bit we got is borderline amazing, however it doesn\'t contain much of plot twists or just plain content of epic scale.

His power is so damn original to (atleast non-h shows) that i was almost knocked out when i realized what it actually was.

However, when he gets caught in a bombing on the way to school, he encounters Aria Kanzaki, the most powerful S-Rank Butei student in Assault Studies.Captivated by his amazing skills, Aria sets out to make Kinji her partner. Can a guy who desires peace ever team up with this loli tsundere S-ranked Butei student?Here’s something truly amazing...about this anime. It’s an Action anime with some Romance, Ecchi and Harem. It has Supernatural elements in it. It has terrorism as a base premise, a bit of historical elements and some good old fashion mild nudity. There is so much in this anime that it manages to balance all of these important aspects. It’s truly an outstanding anime.This is a JC Staff anime and that studio knows how to properly balance elements to make an anime shine. If you’ve ever watched some of its previous works like Shakugan No Shana or Toaru majutsu no Index then you’ll love Hidan no Aria. Those two shows also have action, romance, ecchi and a hint of harem. You can trust JC Staff to deliver another awesome show like that.The other characters where nicely done as well. The other girls, who sadly fall on the clichéd, are interesting on their own. Even though we have probably seen their type done to death in other anime, they still make the story more solid and more fun to watch. The interaction between the characters is nicely done and I believe this is the time to thank the seiyuus for that. There are some minor characters in the anime that appears seldom but even they have a great personality. It’s great even though, yes, we have all seen it before.The action sequences are also nicely done. It’s not the best you’ll ever see and there is actually more talking than biting in the action parts. There is still character development during these fights so the fighting is not that prominent though the conclusions of the fights are very fun to watch. There’s nothing wrong with the action sequences despite its lack of actual action. There is enough to further enhance the story and make the characters shine.JC Staff is never lazy with the animation. The fight scenes are nicely animated and completely thought out. The anime uses some CGI elements like in the guns and bullets, the light rails and some of the vehicles in the first arc. I’m never a fan of CGI but it make the anime look more “cooler”, I suppose.The character design isn’t new. If you have seen Shana and Index then you have basically seen all the characters in Hidan no Aria. In a way, it helps the viewer familiarize with the anime but at the same time, you do wish the change it up a bit. I guess if it’s not broken then don’t fix it, right?The OP and ED soundtrack was not that great in my opinion. I does not really stand out and sounds like your typical opening and ending song. It does not jump out and grab you like some great songs does. The songs were overshadowed by everything else in the anime. about this anime. It’s an Action anime with some Romance, Ecchi and Harem.

I guess if it’s not broken then don’t fix it, right?The OP and ED soundtrack was not that great in my opinion. I does not really stand out and sounds like your typical opening and ending song. It does not jump out and grab you like some great songs does. The songs were overshadowed by everything else in the anime.', '""Listen up, I have decided you should become my slave""---- AriaYeah if that isn\'t all the warning you need not to watch this show I don\'t know what more I can say to help you make the decision.Aria Kanzaki  maybe the most ridiculous and ulikable character to ever grace broadcast television, and I include Eichman  and Hitler in the running. She is incredibly poorly written horribly inconsistent and downright annoying. Quite literally whenever she opens her mouth she kills the show and seeing as she is the name character and one of the two primary main characters that\'s a real problem.Kinchi Toyhama...is nearly as bad. I can\'t begin to say how sick I am of anime leading men, who not only can\'t act in their own interests but in his case he doesn\'t even have any interests. Just how the hell do you work up a harem/romcom when no one has the slightest interest in sex or romance ?The series actually has a semi interesting detective/action story line. The problem is that story and characters go hand in hand and there\'s just no way you can have a good story built with these characters. Well unless the authors felt like dropping pianos and anvils on them from great heights. Otherwise forget about it. It\'s just awful. You don\'t want to see it go on. You really wish one of the killers would just get lucky and kill the characters so they would be out of their misery and everyone else would be as well .The only saving grace to Aria is the presentation. The music is good, the art is good and at times interesting.TL:DR avoid like STDs is nearly as bad.

It involves a high school known as Butei High, where teenage kids can go live out their badass fantasies of fighting their way through Tokyo and being legally allowed to carry a gun and break shit with it. Most detectives that go here are literal shit unless you are an S rank, the highest you can go. Who needs normal education ammirite?Aria the Scarlet Ammo is about, well, Aria....She is a descendant of Holmes and is an S rank Butei. She’s the badass loli who will fuck all shit up and leave nothing standing in her way. Her ability to break shit and make it look cool is seconded by none. Eventually she meets Kinji Tohyama, who is also an S rank, but is a lazy bastard who doesn’t want to do much of anything. That is… until he sees boobies.The whole premise of the story revolves around Kinji’s ability to see boobies and get turned on. Once he’s in his mode, he becomes the perfect Butei. This gives him the perfect excuse to get a face full because he will just go and save half of Tokyo afterwards, meaning no one bats an eye at how he did it. Not only can he become a badass upon sight of boobies, but he can (anal)yse any situation he’s in and decide how to act in a split second. He’s also a great shot.As Butei continues to be threatened by dumbass terrorists who think they can win against a flat chested loli and a horny highschooler, these 2 must do something about it. Not only are they threatened by terrorists though, as crazy (hot) yanderes join in the threat, and maybe even the ones they know could be threatening them! The story has many twists and turns with solid development, and the action is more than enough to keep your attention. Not much feels out of place as the developments happen.The best part of the series is how Aria's and Kinji's stories develop. Their relationship is a unique one among anime as they fight badassily. The accurate emotions they feel, Aria's inability to tell just how Kinji might feel, and Kinji's ability to be lazy in general is entertaining and will leave you wanting them to grow closer.Animation is perfect. Nothing to complain about here. Move along.Sound? Who the hell comes here for sound? (If you must know, the intro and outro give it a good “Holmes” feel, and the voice actors do a great job of drawing out emotion in each of their characters.)Overall this is good shit. A very recommended series for those who want a little extra in their life at a PG-13 rating. Heh.Tl;dr: Lots of lewds, embarrassed lolis, horny high schoolers, and yanderes make this a series worth watching.Disclaimer: Aria best loli girl She is a descendant of Holmes and is an S rank Butei.

There\'s plenty of guns, fist fights and explosions to get your attention, but mechanically the series is average in just about every way, whether it be the story, art, voice acting or characters. Nevertheless, it\'s not particularly lacking in anything either, and for all of its problems, it still has just enough fun and thrills to make it enjoyable.Story (6/10):""Aria the Scarlet Ammo"" is set in Butei High, a boarding school where students...are trained in combat as an effort to counter the worsening crime rate around the world. As Butei, students are permitted to arrest any criminals they come across and being attacked is perfectly normal for one. One such student is Kinji Tohyama, a second-year who comes from a long line of famous heroes, the source of which is a genetic condition called Hysteria Savant Syndrome, which gives them enhanced abilities, but also alters their personality to that of a chivalrous womanizer. However, Kinji wants nothing to do with his family\'s legacy, and at the start of the series expresses a desire to transfer out of his school and live a normal life. Unsurprisingly, things don\'t work out for Kinji- after being attacked one day on the way to school, Kinji is saved by a master Butei called Aria H. Kanzaki, and ends up revealing his power to her. This causes her to take an interest in him, and she more-or-less forces him into becoming her partner in an attempt to clear the name of her wrongfully imprisoned mother, who\'s been framed for dozens of crimes committed by various people, one of which is the Butei Killer, who\'s apparently behind the death of Kinji\'s older brother.Now I\'ve always been one to give credit where credit is due, so I\'ll start by talking about what the plot does right. The pacing is very good, with the story taking its time to help us understand the characters as well as the life of a Butei. And while the overall plot feels like it\'s just begun at the end, it does wrap up the immediate problems introduced in the anime itself instead of leaving things on a cliffhanger, with one main villain being behind everything, which ultimately results in a final showdown, and for a final battle it does not disappoint.If there\'s a reason for the relatively low rating, it\'s the feeling that we\'ve seen all of this before. The series follows a formula so predictable that you see nearly all the twists at least an episode before they happen, which isn\'t such a good thing in a series that heavily relies on twists. Even the rare one you don\'t see coming instead comes out of absolutely nowhere, showing that the writers just don\'t know how to do the right amount of foreshadowing. I also wouldn\'t recommend watching the OVA, as it has nothing to do with the story of the anime and is an anti-climax if I ever saw one.Art & Animation (7.5/10):In general, the visuals of ""Aria the Scarlet Ammo"" are not very good. The textures are muddy and dull, several of the character\'s faces look very strange, particularly Aria\'s, and the animation relies too much on super-deformity. That being said, there are some nice effects in the series, such as the guns, and while there is fanservice, it\'s never to the point that it\'s in your face.Sound & Dialogue (7.5/10):""Aria the Scarlet Ammo""\'s soundtrack is very generic and almost entirely forgettable. Unfortunately, this includes the opening, which I skipped every time, though I\'ll admit I liked the ending theme a bit more. The voice acting is rather middling as well; while the cast does feature some great talent like Todd Haberkorn, Brina Palenica and Leah Clark, these are far from their best performances, which probably isn\'t helped by the fact that they all sound exactly like they do in ""Mirai Nikki"", despite at least two of them voicing completely different characters. Overall, I\'ve heard worse, but I\'ve certainly heard better.Characters (6.5/10):One of the first things you realise about Kinji is that he is very different from a typical harem male lead, in that he\'s far from what you would call a nice person. He\'s bitter, cynical, sarcastic, rarely has a good word about anyone and has zero tolerance for the quirks of the girls who surround him, whether it be Aria\'s bossiness or Shirayuki\'s clinginess. However, despite him saying that Hysteria Savant Syndrome alters every part of his personality, he overall doesn\'t act that different when it\'s active, and there were honestly times when I had trouble telling whether it was on or not. His attitude can also be a bit too much at times, and there\'s at least one occasion where he\'s an absolute asshole for no good reason. I actually found Aria to be a kinder person than him, which is saying something since she has \'I\'ll pump you full of holes\' for a friggin\' catchphrase! That said, Kinji does have a good heart deep down, and I\'ll admit there were times when I enjoyed his no-nonsense attitude. And when you learn about his past and what he\'s been through since then, it\'s hard not to see why he\'s like that.The other half of the main duo is, of course, Aria herself, who\'s very similar to Kinji in some ways and the complete opposite of him in others. As a tsundere, she constantly denies her feelings, though she actually takes it one step further than the norm by going ballistic whenever someone even mentions relationships, though she\'s incredibly easy to piss off in general. She\'s also very stubborn and prideful and hates to admit when she\'s made a mistake, to the point that she\'ll often demand proof from people before she\'ll believe something that goes against her initial assumption. That said, her stubbornness works just as much for her as it does against, as she is unshakably determined. She\'s also a lot more fragile than she\'d like to admit, which makes for some really cute moments, and much like Kinji, the series does a good job at keeping her sympathetic due to her dark and troubled past and equally troubled present. While she can definitely be overbearing at times, she\'s at least self-aware enough to know this, and I will say that I liked her more than I did Kinji.UlAs a whole, the real problem with the female characters in the series is not that they\'re poorly-written or unlikable, but that they all fall into typical harem heroine archetypes- we have the tiny, flat-chested tsundere (Aria), the weird, stoic girl (Reki), the refined student council president (Shirayuki) and the shameless flirt (Riko). It also doesn\'t help that all of them plus Kinji have some kind of complex, with even Shirayuki showing a dark side as early as the second episode. Don\'t get me wrong, sometimes giving a character a complex is good, but here it just gives them a pointless edge to their personality to try and make them seem more fleshed-out than they really are. Reki also gets relatively little screen time compared to the others- while Aria has a constant presence in the series and Shirayuki and Riko both have an entire arc that revolves around them, Reki only makes sparse appearances here and there. It\'s a shame because, if it weren\'t for that, she\'d probably be my favourite character outside the main duo. The main villain also proved to be pretty weak in spite of all their build-up, amounting to little more than a petty bully with no clear end goal i.e. a goal they could theoretically reach and then stop being a villain.Enjoyment (7.5/10):During the show\'s 12-episode run, Aria and Kinji will face off against a psychopath on a plane, attempt to disarm a bomb on a bus in a scenario not unlike the film ""Speed"", infiltrate a mansion disguised as a maid and a butler and participate in a host of other crazy set-pieces. ""Aria the Scarlet Ammo"" can be called many negative things, but \'boring\' isn\'t one of them. The good pacing also works well to ensure the anime stays entertaining throughout, which almost makes up for the show\'s many other problems.Overall:""Aria the Scarlet Ammo"" does exactly what it says on the tin. There are no surprises and it does nothing exceptional, but it\'s still a perfectly pleasant way to spend a few hours of your time on. That being said, I ultimately wouldn\'t blame you if you decided to give it a pass, as there are plenty of other much better action anime out there, some of which have a premise very similar to this one.Score:6+7.5+7.5+6.5+7.5=35/50=7.0/10 are trained in combat as an effort to counter the worsening crime rate around the world.

Not the worst waste, that honor is held by Avenger.I think the story could have been so much more....but it wasn't.  It was like hey her is some Sherlock Holmes...oh and here is some wolves...oh and some werewolf vampire thing...Seems like they just through this story together without much thought to anything else.The manga might be better but who cares. "", 'Alright, this anime started out well enough, it seemed to hurt itself over time. I found myself watching the first episode and becoming hooked to its action scenes, especially with the remote control scooter things with Uzis bolted to them. After that everything seemed to go downhill, with enemies rushed through and scenes pushed to late to be of use to the character or even the viewer. However, we\'re here for a review, so lets begin.Story: 5With what little story I could gather from its mangled body of plot holes and misinformation, I have formed that the main character and the other people within the...anime are special in that they can shoot guns, solve crimes, and be good at it , however they are in training. Their official designation are ""Butei"" and the main character is a special one at that. He has a condition called ""Hysteria Mode"" which gives him the superhuman ability to be deadly accurate, skilled with blades, as well as having a split personality. The story surprisingly starts of well, but plummets all the way to the end. Even the end season boss was lackluster and unsurprising. It was easily forgettable in my eyes anyway.Art: 9This is one if the reasons  I didn\'t quit, with many of the scenes being well drawn and the characters looking delightful and well rounded, with many characteristics drawn nicely, and the scenery is charming to say the least.Sound: 9Another reason I didn\'t give up. Many of the characters voices fit well with themselves, especially Aria\'s bitchy, bratty, but accurate age voice. The songs are not to shabby and are worth a couple of minutes of listening.Characters: 7To be fair, the characters within the anime are done nicely, but do not stick out much from the framework of stereotypical characters within anime. Few seem to be unique in that they can do something someone can\'t, but in basic characteristics, seem to be awkward at best. Aria, for example, is introduced as the main heroine of the show next to Kinji, being a loli, she feels somewhat inferior to other woman when it comes to feminine characteristics, and constantly makes scathing remarks toward more endowed women.

Their official designation are ""Butei"" and the main character is a special one at that. He has a condition called ""Hysteria Mode"" which gives him the superhuman ability to be deadly accurate, skilled with blades, as well as having a split personality. The story surprisingly starts of well, but plummets all the way to the end. Even the end season boss was lackluster and unsurprising. It was easily forgettable in my eyes anyway.Art: 9This is one if the reasons  I didn\'t quit, with many of the scenes being well drawn and the characters looking delightful and well rounded, with many characteristics drawn nicely, and the scenery is charming to say the least.Sound: 9Another reason I didn\'t give up. Many of the characters voices fit well with themselves, especially Aria\'s bitchy, bratty, but accurate age voice. The songs are not to shabby and are worth a couple of minutes of listening.Characters: 7To be fair, the characters within the anime are done nicely, but do not stick out much from the framework of stereotypical characters within anime.

Fantastic story and a amazing art style for it's time, it was one the only anime that I was really addicted to. I also loved the sound of bullets whizzing by and how well the action scenes were animated. I think the characters were like the icing on top of the cake, I like to love relations they had and loved Kinji's hysteria mode he looks and sounds badass. I hope would enjoy it!!!

If your looking for an anime that combines cute girls, guns, explosions, and a fair amount of comedy then this is the anime for you! The only part I didn't necessarily like about this anime was the story line. It wasn't that the story line wasn't good enough, but instead that it seemed to end way to quickly. I've watched in Sub and Dub, so i can say that both versions are worth it to watch! If your not hooked by the end of...the first episode then i advise you give the second a try, because the second episode is what really got me interested!

He is rude, impolite and just not nice but for such silly reasons. He can recognise a girl's feelings and one that he likes back yet acts all high and mighty. She may be scared to admit it but that's her character. At times I do think ah he isn't too bad he then ruins...it very quickly.Other things in terms of what didn't really make sense were in Episode 7 Aria is the true hero she did what no one thought of, she turned on the lights and then the enemy lost the advantage.

The series struggled to find the right balance between its ecchi/fanservice elements and the more serious aspects of its story.On the positive side, the action sequences were generally well-animated and enjoyable to watch. The varied array of weaponry and fighting styles employed by the characters added some variety to the combat scenes. However, these exciting moments were often undercut by the show's overreliance on gratuitous fanservice and sexual humor that felt tonally jarring and out of place.The characterization was also hit-or-miss. While some characters like Kinji had interesting backstories and arcs, many of the supporting...cast felt one-note and existed primarily as vehicles for fanservice. The relationships between characters rarely evolved beyond surface-level romantic tensions or shallow comedic misunderstandings.Narratively, Hidan no Aria lacked a strong, cohesive storyline to tie its disparate elements together. Individual episode plots were largely self-contained and failed to build meaningful dramatic stakes or progress any overarching narrative threads. By the end, it felt more like a loosely connected series of vignettes rather than a focused, well-paced story.The presentation was decent, with a nice Japanese setting and music that suited the tone the show was going for when it wasn't indulging in fanservice. But overall, Hidan no Aria squandered its promising setup by failing to strike the right tonal balance and prioritizing cheap thrills over more substantial character and narrative development. A missed opportunity that will likely only appeal to die-hard fans of the genre. cast felt one-note and existed primarily as vehicles for fanservice.

However the mechanics sadly lack consistency. The show tends to treat Hysteria mode as a deus ex machina kind of feature. Most problems faced by the protagonist are solved through the power of his boner, which comes across as a hindrace for the character developement. This is especially true in his interactions with female characters. More often than not, conflicts and disagreements are solved by him going into HSS and the women melting away...like wax in his hands. One can consider this as a integral part of the story but I did not come around feeling, that this often does not give the female characters the credit they deserve.The main protagonist has a trait called ""Hysteria Savant Syndrome"", which enables him to call upon enhanced strength, stamina and cognitive and coordinative abilities. It is activated by sexual arousal (of course) and thus a convenient in-universe explanation for the ridiculous amount of fanservice in this show. It enables him e.g. to avoid bullets and retaliate with extreme precision. The protagonist himself does not like the ability, because under its influence he becomes irresistible and behaves like Casanova, for which he is ashamed afterwards. As a consequence he is a loner that avoids women but by the law of Harem-Anime is inevitably swarmed by a estrogen tsunami of female characters.The characters are generally very stereotypical. The protagonists Harem consists of a loli tsundere, a childhood friend yandere, a villanous tease and many more. In the light novels we also find a mysterious kuudere, a sister, a trap, a dandere, a furry, an actual guy (hinted) and several older women. Mostly if you know the main cliché they play into there is almost nothing further to know. The yandere character will ALWAYS behave like a yandere under all circumstances and without exception. This soon renders the interactions calculable and hardly surprising, but if you like two girls catfighting over a guy with swords and pistols over and over again...The protagonist is not really an exception, so we are stuck with the usual dense, broody loser/loner type Harem-Protagonist. What sets him apart at least partially is his deeply cynical attitude. The one job that he does not want to do is that of a butei. The one job he happens to be actually good at is that of a butei. He is roped into the entire story by the female tsundere lead and constantly complains about the chaos happening around him. His snarkiness comes across mostly in the light novels and not at all in the anime. He acts very little on his own accord and is mostly dragged along by the other characters. This is somewhat justified as his role is that of Arias partner.The singular one most annyoing part of the show is by FAR the leading heroine: Aria Kanzaki. She is a childish, prideful and stubborn patchwork of all complexes known to mankind. She is as loud and abrasive as her behaviour is irritating. I do not generally dislike maniacs in leading roles, as long as they are interesting to some degree. Unfortunately in the same way as all characters Arias\' behaviour is constrained to her tsundere role, so I couldn\'t help myself cracking a hearty smile when she got slapped.In conclusion the characters are mostly nothing special and fit a typical harem-anime. If you aren\'t tired yet of seeing the same clichés reiterated you could give it a shot.The humour is mostly based on the stereotypical behaviour of the cast and/or physical humour. If we were given a cent everytime the tsundere threatens to shoot people because she was embarassed, we\'d be rich by the end. Of the first episode.The humour is one among many things that puts a stretch on the credibility of the universe. Two girls fighting and shooting at each other within a student dorm room and completely wrecking it in the process is somehow not punished at all. Opening fire at the protagonist in public because YOU drank from HIS cola is of course completely rational human behaviour. I am more than willing to suspend my disbelief for a good joke, but it really went overboard at times.The fanservice belongs to the most annoying and reoccuring elements of the show. This kind of fanservice is the reason I lock the door when watching anime, despite the fact that I live alone. There are probably not many Rom-Com clichés the writers didn\'t pull here, from convenient falling, intruding the bathroom to accidentally discovering undergarments and indirect kisses (i.e. Drinking from another\'s drink) we must suffer through everything. A lot of the fanservice was mostly a cheap, awkward filler, and sometimes very uncalled for. Nonetheless there are scenes that, despite the shame- ,need-, use- and tasteless display of half-naked girls, actually contain story or (behold!) even character developement.The story follows a standard redemption plot, where the titular heroine tries to bail her falsely accused mother out prison. By the laws of her origin she needs to find a partner, which she believes to have found in the protagonist. The protagonist is soon recruited (by force) as her ""slave"" and dragged along various missions.Albeit predictable at times the story is surely interesting enough to keep watching, even though it becomes more and more absurd as the show continues. One might even continue just to see what kind of bullshit the author is pulling out of his ass next. (It\'s not better in the light novel. Rule Nr.1: As soon as magic enters, things go south.)My main problem with this show is, that the author is constantly sabotaging himself. There is so much potential buried in there, that is sacrificed to useless fanservice, stupid comedy and generic writing. The protagonists Hysteria Mode serves as an example. His main trigger for Hysteria mode (read: sexual arousal) is his partner Aria, who is underdeveloped in both body and mindset. If you consider, that the protagonist does not like ""what he does"" when under the influence of HSS, you could interpret this as him being a self-aware sexual predator and pedophile. This is a topic the story never deals with. Additionally there is so much more that could be made of the characters in this show. Instead of acting by themselves they fall into their stereotypical roles again and again, displaying the same kind of behaviour without any kind of developement. The problem is that I sometimes had the impression, that there was more to the characters, their actions, motives and intentions. It seemed as if they had a hidden depth, that the author would shy away to openly show.Riko Mine is a good example. One finds out that she is a very traumatized woman, that constructs her aggressively sexual personality as means to cope and survive. BUT this is just briefly mentioned and then never again, shoving her back into her role as the villanous tease. This constant self-sabotaging is just sad and discouraging to watch. I am not even sure if the author noticed the possibilities he created. Which is at least preferable to believing he willingly threw them away... like wax in his hands.

Aria is not only always jumping to conclusions she  is just flat out annoying. She complains about how nobody trusts her in one scene, and then in the next doesn't trust the other main character when he tries to explain what happened in a situation. I just can't stand Aria, I couldn't even fully finish the anime. I thought she would have character growth, but I can honestly say by episode 7 she still is just as stupid and annoying.The story itself is not so bad....The wit that is needed to solve the problems tends to make it somewhat more interesting than many other action anime that focus solely on beat-em-up style violence.The music is not great but it could be worse. The art is also somewhat good. None of this really matters, because Aria makes the sieries neigh unwatchable.

I\'ll try won\'t go into a full summery and then explain why I think that is like an essay.(SPOILERS)The story takes place in a world where there are armed detectives called Butei created by the Intergovernmental Armed Detective Alliance(IADA) to combat the worsening crime rate around the globe. It\'s an interesting concept and it makes for interesting action scenes of crime and how the cast would deal with it. We would also see more elements thrown in to build the world of the story.Our main characters are Tohyama...Kinji and Kanzaki H. Aria, Kinji has a special inherit ability he called hysteria mode which activites the amount of neural transmitters 30 times more than an average person. What this means is that it makes the function of his central nervous system such as his ability to think, judge, his reflex, increase exponentially, hysteria mode only activates when he\'s sexually excited. It\'s not like he gets a erection or anything, hysteria mode\'s true nature is explained as the impulse to leave children behind, as a result Kinji becomes totally different than what he normally is personality wise and will always help women. He doesn\'t like to use hysteria mode because it\'s ""embarrassing"" but it\'s actually because the girls exploitered Kinji\'s condition and made him do what they wanted.Aria is a typical tsundere but is also a strong butei, she\'s the 4th generation of Sherlock Holmes, and it\'s not like they just plugged it in out of nowhere it was explained relatively early on when Kinji hired Riko to do a background check on Aria. it ties into what\'s to come in the future which the anime isn\'t at. Her goal during the season is to free her mother from police custody because she was accused of doing crime as the butei killer which went into hiding. People say that she is pretty annoying and stuff, in all honesty I don\'t think she was that annoying since she had the right to be angry with Kinji at the start and even though she acts like a child sometimes it wasn\'t at the level where you would be so annoyed and infuriated at. Yes, she\'s kind of selfish, who isn\'t, she\'s not at the level which other reviews are expressing.The story starts with Kinji rushing to school on a bike that was planted with a bomb but he doesn\'t know that, he got threaten by the butei killer that planted the bomb. This wasn\'t the only bomb threat coming from the butei killer, a bus was planted with a bomb and a plane was hijacked by the butei killer who was revealed as their classmate Riko during the plane hijack. Riko turns out to be the 4th generation of Lupin and by proving she is better than Aria who is the 4th generation of Holmes she can earn her family\'s approval who has always looked down on her. Everything that happened to this point was all because of Riko manipulating them behind the scenes so she could have a showdown between Aria and her Watson which was Kinji. She reveals about an organization named IU which becomes the main antagonist for the rest of the season. There was Riko and then there was Jeanne d\'Arc who tried to take Shirayuki to IU, and finally Vlad, he is responsible for a long year of crimes under Aria mother\'s name and he has a cross that was a keepsake of Riko\'s mother, the trio steals the cross and defeats Vlad, this is a little something I disagree with in the anime because in the manga it was Riko who told Kinji about the hidden weak spot which made more sense to me, even though Kinji explained why he thought it was Vlad\'s weak spot it was more of a gamble than anything.The story is actually interesting and most of the questions can be answered through anime alone. People seem to expect that a 12 episode season can express all the plot of a series that has been running for a long time, just looking at the manga alone the anime only went through 44 chapters and a few more pages from 45. The story is greater than you would think.Now, I\'ve seen too many not recommended reviews and from reading, well probably all of the negative reviews from this page there were a lot of them who kept nitpicking on small things and completely disregarding what it\'s actually trying to show. I\'ve seen the them disliking the story and characters and whatnot, how there was unnecessary fanservice, and pretty much a lot of people saying that the story is poor and the characters and their gimmicks are trash. I\'ve seen 2 accounts of people saying that Aria does nothing in the show which I can understand since she didn\'t do anything major in the show, she was acting as a support in the majority of it. I\'ve also seen others say it\'s a cliche harem, there was only Shirayuki and Aria next to Kinji, and yes there was fan service of Shirayuki tempting Kinji, Riko\'s clothes turning into a parachute was clever in my opinion, and the scene where the girls were stripping in the locker room is also fanservice. Each of them shouldn\'t be taken too seriously and the anime does explain why Kinji was at the locker room and why Shirayuki was tempting Kinji. Compared to other ecchi show\'s like Highschool Dxd and To Love Ru Hidan no Aria is tame in comparison. Aria\'s tsundere attitude is there but her seriousness in her work as a butei is also shown. People say it\'s a romantic comedy and there are instances of generic ecchi scene\'s, it\'s a troupe in ecchi romance it\'ll do you good to expect it. If you are numb to it, it shouldn\'t affect you and it doesn\'t really affect the story either.So that\'s it from me, I hope you can give this anime a chance. Kinji and Kanzaki H.

Riko turns out to be the 4th generation of Lupin and by proving she is better than Aria who is the 4th generation of Holmes she can earn her family\'s approval who has always looked down on her. Everything that happened to this point was all because of Riko manipulating them behind the scenes so she could have a showdown between Aria and her Watson which was Kinji. She reveals about an organization named IU which becomes the main antagonist for the rest of the season. There was Riko and then there was Jeanne d\'Arc who tried to take Shirayuki to IU, and finally Vlad, he is responsible for a long year of crimes under Aria mother\'s name and he has a cross that was a keepsake of Riko\'s mother, the trio steals the cross and defeats Vlad, this is a little something I disagree with in the anime because in the manga it was Riko who told Kinji about the hidden weak spot which made more sense to me, even though Kinji explained why he thought it was Vlad\'s weak spot it was more of a gamble than anything.The story is actually interesting and most of the questions can be answered through anime alone. People seem to expect that a 12 episode season can express all the plot of a series that has been running for a long time, just looking at the manga alone the anime only went through 44 chapters and a few more pages from 45. The story is greater than you would think.Now, I\'ve seen too many not recommended reviews and from reading, well probably all of the negative reviews from this page there were a lot of them who kept nitpicking on small things and completely disregarding what it\'s actually trying to show. I\'ve seen the them disliking the story and characters and whatnot, how there was unnecessary fanservice, and pretty much a lot of people saying that the story is poor and the characters and their gimmicks are trash. I\'ve seen 2 accounts of people saying that Aria does nothing in the show which I can understand since she didn\'t do anything major in the show, she was acting as a support in the majority of it. I\'ve also seen others say it\'s a cliche harem, there was only Shirayuki and Aria next to Kinji, and yes there was fan service of Shirayuki tempting Kinji, Riko\'s clothes turning into a parachute was clever in my opinion, and the scene where the girls were stripping in the locker room is also fanservice. Each of them shouldn\'t be taken too seriously and the anime does explain why Kinji was at the locker room and why Shirayuki was tempting Kinji. Compared to other ecchi show\'s like Highschool Dxd and To Love Ru Hidan no Aria is tame in comparison. Aria\'s tsundere attitude is there but her seriousness in her work as a butei is also shown. People say it\'s a romantic comedy and there are instances of generic ecchi scene\'s, it\'s a troupe in ecchi romance it\'ll do you good to expect it. If you are numb to it, it shouldn\'t affect you and it doesn\'t really affect the story either.So that\'s it from me, I hope you can give this anime a chance.', 'This was the second anime I ever watched, and I love it to death! Even the second season which some may say is junk was still pretty good in my opinion.As for what it is in a simplified form Aria and Kinji are both high and low ranking butei whom team up to take down Vlad and find the butei killer. Overall amazing characters at time some characters can be shallow but overall very good characters. I love the dynamic between Aria and Kinji and them working together. Also I personally am not a mega fan of romance amines this has a bit in...it and is still stand able. Overall worth a watch Ive rewatched it 3 times once in sub and 2 times in dub and both are amazing.Also worth watching the second season for sure even though its less focused on the dynamic duel we learn to love! it and is still stand able. Overall worth a watch Ive rewatched it 3 times once in sub and 2 times in dub and both are amazing.Also worth watching the second season for sure even though its less focused on the dynamic duel we learn to love!', '*first review on MAL* *warning some spoilers for future light novel events as well as anime events* *apologies in advance if I get stuff wrong my memory of the series is hazy and I might recall events wrong please msg me if I do so I may correct it*Okay first off I have to mention that a lot of the reviews don\'t bring up the light novels, as suck this review will be more of a comparison of the two for why it fails even more. After reading the novels and comparing to the anime I must say the anime is completely watered down. While...they get the jist of things it seems like Kinji\'s internal snarking has been replaced by full out violent gunfights, which sucks because his snarking is one of the better things about the series.Another thing to mention is I am a younger generation of anime viewer so the book of cliche\'s isnt quite set in yet, and I am not nearly as cynical as other people here. I\'m a simple guy, fairly easy to please and I think for people watching it with my mindset it\'s mediocre at best terrible if you\'ve read the light novels.The Harem Angle is played up a bit too much now and small moments where Kinji just gives his two cents on Butei life is replaced by random wacky hijinks to give his haremettes more screentime. Because of this characters get flanderized into into stock static archetypes the mainstream knows and the characterization suffers. Most people, exasperated with the tsundere trope no doubt, will wonder ""why the hell does Kinji but up with this brat"".Now if the characterization was done properly we would get glimpses into Kinji\'s past life, the whole with his brother and how he got alienated with the butei lifestyle. After learning that Aria has had a bad relationship with her main family and ESPECIALLY after meeting her mother we learn that Kinji feels a strange sense of kinship. She\'s trying to live up to expectations and trying to be like her idol, Sherlock Holmes. Once again if the studio bothered to actually TRY and get characterization across we\'ll learn that Kinji used to idolize his older brother and was kinda like Aria in that respect explaining why he sticks with her.Shirayuki from this version is just flat out crazy. Her past as a ""caged bird"" is barely touched upon making it seem like a half assed explaination for WHY she\'s a psycho yandere. The LNs have an entire festival scene where she and kinji just hang out, act like friends, and talk about her past. It\'s more or less stated she has near no contact with men outside of Kinji and his brother so to her him taking punishment to get her outside to a festival, so she could experience just a little bit of normal life outside of being a miko was probably the biggest act of love and kindness she\'s ever recieved. In the anime this borders on being a throwaway explaination Kinji gives. Also don\'t remember if this happened in the anime or not but Reki helps lead Kinji to where durandal is. (please msg with corrections if it did).Riko, this one is a toughie cause I can\'t read her character as well. However there were more ""practice"" scenes for the manor infiltration and she NEVER talked about abandonign Aria in the novels. Overall she ended being more childish, more perverted, and more selfish than in the light novels, just liek everyone else.The clunky writing also throws out any kind of foreshadowing the novels had.Hey ya know that green haired girl Reki who just sort of appeared on a helicopter there were more scenes with her. Like a scene where Kinji asks what the hell is up with her headset. It\'s actually foreshadowing for a future arc when she sorta holds him hostage while also claiming that their lovers (it\'s complicated just read the LNs if you actually want to know) Minor complaints here since she doesnt get any kind of actual role yet.Also, what the hell was up with Kana? If you only watched the anime fuck would you know about it. This one was probably a decision to avoid cliffhangers that may never be expanded on but it still hurts the series because now if it ever does get a second season (doubtful) since it will likely be poorly explained. This is expanded upon in the novels where his reactions hint at Kana having died.For an actual review of the anime, overall this series has a fairly interesting premise. It\'s enjoyable for mainstream viewers with lower expectations who can deal with the stock characters. However if you\'ve read the light novels you might find the adaptation to be somewhat frustrating because it replaced small character moments and foreshadowing for more action and dumb harem sketches. Characterization falls completely flat and you\'ll be wondering why the HELL did they decide to skimp out on moments that flesh out the characters a bit more and give insight into why they act the way they do. Motivations are relegated to throwaway explainations and dramatic moments get shooed away for more harem comedy. If you see this series as just an anime and can lower your expectations to deal with this cliched series than it\'s a decent time waster. For people who actually like the premise and want to know about the characters and the world go read the light novels, they actually have some sort of substance beyond the harem route. they get the jist of things it seems like Kinji\'s internal snarking has been replaced by full out violent gunfights, which sucks because his snarking is one of the better things about the series.Another thing to mention is I am a younger generation of anime viewer so the book of cliche\'s isnt quite set in yet, and I am not nearly as cynical as other people here.

The characters aren\'t given much depth and the story just...ends. There\'s something very wrong with the pacing and literally nothing get truly resolved. In the beginning I enjoyed it, but once I got to the end it left much to be desired. I was hopeful because there was a ""second season"" according to funimation, but it\'s not even the same thing. The characters are completely different- except Aria, but she\'s not even the main character. The story isn\'t about her. There was no need to even put her name in...the title. Hidan no Aria isn\'t a a great series because there\'s a lack of depth. A second season could have added to the story, but since one does not exist. I\'m thinking that manga will probably tell the story a little better. It\'s a better option. the title. Hidan no Aria isn\'t a a great series because there\'s a lack of depth. A second season could have added to the story, but since one does not exist. I\'m thinking that manga will probably tell the story a little better. It\'s a better option.', 'I first found this anime playing an osu! map about 3 weeks ago, which featured the OP for Hidan no Aria AA, the ""sequel"" to the original Hidan no Aria, which is this. As of writing this review, I am yet to watch Hidan no Aria AA, and I am debating whether I should due to it being made by a different studio.After reading through the concept for the series when searching this up, I was sceptical whether to watch it or not as it seemed very action-based, which usually isn\'t my thing. But after watching the first episode, I was glad I decided to...start it as I found it very enjoyable and fun to watch. I recommend you stop here and go and watch it, as my opinions might affect how you watch this anime, but for those who either don\'t care or have already watched it, here is my review:STORY: 7/10The story was OK in the sense that it (mostly) made sense and the plot was easy enough to follow that I could watch it without having to figure out where each part of the plot fits in to other parts of the plot. It\'s entertaining enough that you want to go back and keep watching, but not so much that you binge it all in one night and then regret it because you want to watch more. After reading other reviews, I\'ve also found that people didn\'t enjoy the whole ""we\'re all descendants of famous historical figures"" thing all the characters seemed to have going on, but I really enjoyed this side of the show and I thought it added an extra layer to the backstory of each character. However, I have a few negative points about the story, one of them being the Shirayuki plot arc halfway through the series, which I thought was unnecessary and only added to her character and not the story itself. I also didn\'t really like the ending, which I\'ll save to myself to avoid spoilers.ART: 8/10Art isn\'t something that\'s usually a make or break thing for me in an anime, so long as it doesn\'t look too western and isn\'t so bad that I cringe whenever a character is on screen. The art in Hidan no Aria is good in that sense, as the character designs serve their purpose and the scenes panning over the cityscape were well-drawn as well. I thought some scenes could have done with maybe a little bit more lighting, but other than that I enjoyed the art style. I also really liked the scenes where they used 3D models alongside the 2D drawings, like the car\'s guns in the bus hijacking episode.SOUND: 7/10Again, like art, sound isn\'t too make or break for me, so I usually focus on the soundtrack to the anime in these reviews unless the sounds are exceptionally good. The OP and the ED were catchy and fit the themes of the show, but the songs used in the scenes throughout the anime were fairly generic with nothing of note to really say about them.CHARACTERS: 9/10The characters in the show were the main reason I watched the show all the way through, as the previous scores have shown it was OK to watch. The only character I don\'t like very much is probably Shirayuki, which isn\'t really her fault as the story forces her to take on an almost annoyingly timid role to play up to her shyness from not being exposed to the outside world too much. She wasn\'t too bad later on in the show, where she for some reason turned into a female simp for Kinji. As for the rest of the characters, I loved all of them as they complimented each other SO well, due to their polar opposite personalities. If I had to pick a favourite, it would be Aria as she grew on me as the series went on, however my second favourite would be Reki. If the series had expanded her character more, no doubt she would be top of the rankings, however the lack of development leads me to put her in second.Overall, Hidan no Aria is the kind of series you watch to unwind from a day of work or school, and while yes it doesn\'t blow you away as a series, it\'s still fun to watch and most people can enjoy it to a certain degree, even if your just watching because of it\'s Ecchi elements.I also recommend watching the Sub if you can. I begun watching the first episode in Dub and switched over after 5 minutes. The voice acting isn\'t particularly good on the Dub side, and the voices don\'t fit the character at all.Other than that, enjoy! :) start it as I found it very enjoyable and fun to watch.

Kishin Taisen Gigantic Formula,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2215/Kishin_Taisen_Gigantic_Formula,"[""The Good:- Great art style.- The cell shading is some of the best I've seen in a tv series.- A wide variety of mecha designs kept the series interesting.- Battles between cell-shaded mechas = awesome.The Bad:- Plot progression is very slow.  It was a struggle to watch more than 2 episodes in one sitting.- Most of the series was devoted to presenting background stories of various mecha pilots/translators.  Unfortunately, the lives of the these pilots and translators were boring.  The fact that these flashbacks were presented DURING the mecha battles made things even worse....Conclusion:This would have been a great series had it been condensed to fewer episodes.  They went through great lengths to familiarize the viewers with the pilots of every single mecha; but there was just too many characters.  As a result, I found it hard to sympathize with any of them (with the exception of the Japanese and Chinese crew).  Cut the flashbacks in half and add more mecha airtime and this series would've been ten times more entertaining.

I\'ll try to keep from spoiling the final arc too much, however.If giant robots is your thing, this is not a bad concept. The Greek pantheon appears in modern times scattered to the four corners of the earth (because Reasons™), and demand that the people give them weapons and armor and two humans to operate their new robotic bodies so that they can duel one another in single combat. They call this the ""Wisest World War"", and while I would\'ve preferred that some world leaders settle their differences in a Roman-style coliseum complete with lions, I suppose this beats nuclear weapons.The...robots themselves are a bit more of a reflection of what the production team or the original authors/artists thought each country would build, with a cursory knowledge of each Greek deity; the best example is Minervas XI, which because Game Balance (??) can either be totally armored or be a glass cannon firing an insanely powerful guided shot— I\'m not sure if that would fit Athena\'s strategic style, but it sounds like a stereotypical German weapon in a Japanese mind. Vulcanus I: He\'s got a giant hammer that... fires missiles? You\'d think he would be a decent melee guy (like Cid from FF IV) or like Engineer from TF2. This the least ridiculous thing (but still ridiculous) about the show, but more on that later.If character drama is your thing, there are about 11 mini dramas in this show in addition to the main drama involving Shingo and Mana, and all of them are actually quite good. The show also doesn\'t dwell on one drama or another, but summarizes each pilot/translator pair\'s backstory in about 15 minutes before their battle commences. The ""synchronization of consciousness"" or whatever ""kyoumei kanno"" translates to is an interesting plot device and yet a necessary one in order to tell the stories of most of the nations\' robot operators.The remainder of the plot is one prime weaknesses of the show, in addition to poor or extremely rushed planning. I\'m not sure what the story was trying to achieve (other than Shingo\'s growth as a pilot) by having Russia attack, then cancel as soon as their mech is damaged, lather, rinse, and repeat. Fellas, we already know Japan is going to win (the ultimate ikasama or rigged championship), so can Japanese writers kindly dispense with the tired ""Yamato spirit wins all"" trope? Next, the final arc of the show portrays the Japanese military as weak and ineffective stooges for American interests, willing to commit war crimes to that end. Seriously? I\'m no Japanese patriot, but that was a cheap shot—dramatic, but still cheaper than a sale at a dagashi-ya. And the only point of that is to set up a mano e mano showdown with the Susa-no-o completely unarmed. I\'ve seen sloppier writing, but this is pretty bad. It\'s like they ran into the production deadline for episode 21, got desperate, threw this together after slamming some whiskey down, and said, ""Whatever! Let\'s go with thish!""And yet, they saved their best shenanigans for the Americans. Keep in mind, this show aired in the mid-to-late 2000s, so a dangerously corrupt megalomaniacal President wasn\'t a thing at the time. In this show the Americans coerce the Germans and Italians to fire cheap shots into the British/French combat zone and eliminate them (along with somehow coercing the Japanese into throwing their fight and likely killing Mana in the process). There\'s one world leader at that time I would definitely pin such a scheme on, and it ain\'t Bush or even Cheney. No, this sort of thing reeks more of radioactive polonium, if you get my drift. That\'s not all, the show almost bends over backwards to avoid pissing off China—""OK, sure, you attacked us, but we\'re friends now!"" Real-life China would be like ""Oh really? Well then, we\'ll just take Okinawa, because really, you don\'t need it...""And did anyone tell the production crew that the Star Wars (SDI) initiative failed because you would need the energy equivalent of a thermonuclear bomb to fire an orbital laser powerful enough to disable an ICBM? No? They played Command and Conquer Generals instead?I know hiring English speakers is Hard, but given a choice between cutting a ton of scenes and keeping horribly broken English performances, I\'d pick the former. The translation of some of the military jargon is all right, but it\'s clear that these translators probably never saw a script for an American sci-fi drama, because the phrasing decisions are laughably silly. ""How horrid"" or ""That\'s Japanese"". So Ray is a girl from the 1940s, her grandparents\' naming choices are rather... questionable (Zion? Who names their kid Zion??), and the guy aping Doug MacArthur is brain-dead. And for some reason a USAF colonel thinks in perfect Japanese, down to the warrior philosophy and ethos. Of the soldiers I\'ve encountered, most consider Japan to be a cool place, but no one went full samurai like Zion did in dialogue.Visually... The character designs are interesting, but it\'s like when the schedule really started to get tough, they couldn\'t find decent animators for the characters. Most of the time after the first couple of episodes, Shingo looked like any other anime character, and yet the opening animation continued to repeat that glassy-eyed shot of him. The unorthodox designs often proved difficult to animate largely because some facial expressions don\'t lend themselves to some ""minmal"" animation tricks like only animating the mouth (while the face and jaw are stationary) Personally I thought the designs made the characters look like porcelain dolls, and it didn\'t help that they used that ""porcelain doll"" expression as the final shot of the opening animation for 19 episodes. From episode 20 onward the opening animation is finally updated to what the creators probably wanted it to look like, and I much prefer this sequence as it\'s more colorful, the shots are timed with the music, and the final frame doesn\'t make Shingo look like a mannequin.The ending credit animation was clearly done by another studio, possibly at a time when the character designs were still in flux. During the broadcast, I was thinking, ""Who the hell are these characters?? Is this an artistic thing?"", and it was only after the second playthrough when I realized that was Mana, Masahito, and Kana. Now that\'s pretty bad QC.If it weren\'t for the fantastic (probably synth) orchestral soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano, I might have dropped the show around episode 6. Sawano is also the composer for the soundtrack of Gundam Unicorn, and one of the ""heroic"" themes is a stylistic predecessor to the theme of the Unicorn Gundam. Another track that stood out to me is a march that begins with the timpani followed by the strings in a marcato beat and eventually drawing in the entire orchestra, using chords that reminded me of the famous melody from Prokofiev\'s Romeo and Juliet. Shingo\'s theme is also very good, swelling just before Susa-no-o opens a can of whoop ass.To sum up, interesting concept, good mechs, good character drama, epic soundtrack, distracting visuals and almost irritating set pieces, particularly the ""Americans"". robots themselves are a bit more of a reflection of what the production team or the original authors/artists thought each country would build, with a cursory knowledge of each Greek deity; the best example is Minervas XI, which because Game Balance (??) can either be totally armored or be a glass cannon firing an insanely powerful guided shot— I\'m not sure if that would fit Athena\'s strategic style, but it sounds like a stereotypical German weapon in a Japanese mind.

In this show the Americans coerce the Germans and Italians to fire cheap shots into the British/French combat zone and eliminate them (along with somehow coercing the Japanese into throwing their fight and likely killing Mana in the process). There\'s one world leader at that time I would definitely pin such a scheme on, and it ain\'t Bush or even Cheney. No, this sort of thing reeks more of radioactive polonium, if you get my drift. That\'s not all, the show almost bends over backwards to avoid pissing off China—""OK, sure, you attacked us, but we\'re friends now!"" Real-life China would be like ""Oh really? Well then, we\'ll just take Okinawa, because really, you don\'t need it...""And did anyone tell the production crew that the Star Wars (SDI) initiative failed because you would need the energy equivalent of a thermonuclear bomb to fire an orbital laser powerful enough to disable an ICBM? No? They played Command and Conquer Generals instead?I know hiring English speakers is Hard, but given a choice between cutting a ton of scenes and keeping horribly broken English performances, I\'d pick the former. The translation of some of the military jargon is all right, but it\'s clear that these translators probably never saw a script for an American sci-fi drama, because the phrasing decisions are laughably silly. ""How horrid"" or ""That\'s Japanese"". So Ray is a girl from the 1940s, her grandparents\' naming choices are rather... questionable (Zion? Who names their kid Zion??), and the guy aping Doug MacArthur is brain-dead. And for some reason a USAF colonel thinks in perfect Japanese, down to the warrior philosophy and ethos. Of the soldiers I\'ve encountered, most consider Japan to be a cool place, but no one went full samurai like Zion did in dialogue.Visually... The character designs are interesting, but it\'s like when the schedule really started to get tough, they couldn\'t find decent animators for the characters. Most of the time after the first couple of episodes, Shingo looked like any other anime character, and yet the opening animation continued to repeat that glassy-eyed shot of him. The unorthodox designs often proved difficult to animate largely because some facial expressions don\'t lend themselves to some ""minmal"" animation tricks like only animating the mouth (while the face and jaw are stationary) Personally I thought the designs made the characters look like porcelain dolls, and it didn\'t help that they used that ""porcelain doll"" expression as the final shot of the opening animation for 19 episodes. From episode 20 onward the opening animation is finally updated to what the creators probably wanted it to look like, and I much prefer this sequence as it\'s more colorful, the shots are timed with the music, and the final frame doesn\'t make Shingo look like a mannequin.The ending credit animation was clearly done by another studio, possibly at a time when the character designs were still in flux. During the broadcast, I was thinking, ""Who the hell are these characters?? Is this an artistic thing?"", and it was only after the second playthrough when I realized that was Mana, Masahito, and Kana. Now that\'s pretty bad QC.If it weren\'t for the fantastic (probably synth) orchestral soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano, I might have dropped the show around episode 6. Sawano is also the composer for the soundtrack of Gundam Unicorn, and one of the ""heroic"" themes is a stylistic predecessor to the theme of the Unicorn Gundam. Another track that stood out to me is a march that begins with the timpani followed by the strings in a marcato beat and eventually drawing in the entire orchestra, using chords that reminded me of the famous melody from Prokofiev\'s Romeo and Juliet. Shingo\'s theme is also very good, swelling just before Susa-no-o opens a can of whoop ass.To sum up, interesting concept, good mechs, good character drama, epic soundtrack, distracting visuals and almost irritating set pieces, particularly the ""Americans"".']"

Even though there are only six episodes I felt they did a great job with theme selection per episode....Each episode minus 5 and 6 have their own unique story.

It does play a lot into the yaoi feeling of this show. All the characters from his brother to anyone else in the school are really out of control. All of them seems a bit too stereotypical, Kazuya is pathetic, Mitsuru is cruel, Shun to cutesy, and yet, we sympathize with the characters when they tell us their sad stories. The worse characters for that craziness seems to be Mitsuru Ikeda and Shinobu Tezuka. All four of them seem to...have a love hate relationship the whole time. My little fan girl was squealing the whole time for the little hints of Yaoi.The episodes feel really rushed, making things confusing.

The general concept sounded like fun, and I had heard good things about it. I even purchased the old DVD of it to watch it properly. The DVD version has a different english dub than the original english dub on VHS and LaserDisc, though. I've heard mixed opinions on both, so I wasn't sure which one to watch. I settled on the DVD version, anyway. The other night I put it in and watched all six episodes in one sitting. Yes, there's only six episodes. They're relatively short and easy to sit...through. By the time I was done with the series, I felt extremely disappointed. It definitely wasn't for me. Each episode involves the cast going through a random situation. The situations don't have the most entertaining plot lines in the world, either. I found a lot of the material to be quite boring. It certainly lacked clever writing and humor. The last two episodes do go together, however. They were also a bit of a letdown for me, though. The series didn't feel like it got a true ending like it deserved. It's all over the place, and anything but captivating. As for the positives, I did like the main character, Kazuya. A lot of the characters didn't do much for me, though. The animation also looks really nice. I'm a fan of the old-school look, so I liked it. It's nothing too crazy, but it did embody the standard look of the time period. Overall, I found this anime to be lacking in almost all fields. The story did nothing for me, and I don't think I laughed once. I wasn't moved by it in any way. Maybe I'll have to give this one another try someday. If you want to watch something that's lighthearted and sort of fun, then give Here Is Greenwood a try. It's short, and it's watchable.

I often mention ""folding"" in my anime and film reviews, it\'s a term coined by some cognitive scientists who study the film industry, it can be roughly defined as the dynamics of how we create stories on different levels of abstraction, especially using a visual vocabulary, sometimes it\'s too obvious it verges on the ironic, but it\'s to my utmost interest when it\'s done very subtly the normal viewer wouldn\'t notice it usually. Anime and manga is semi-primitive compared to cinema in this.Here\'s a classic example though, the folding is explicitly ironic, we have in the 3rd episode a show...within a show, filmed as a play inside the dorm of the students, it\'s clever fan service and narrative twists and turns for girls who love to see pretty boys around each other, it\'s worth observing compared to other examples, and there\'s a spark of innovation with the role of a mangaka who actually caused all of the narrative around this specific fold, that\'s something. Midori, Evangelion and Millennium Actress tried to explore that more creatively. There\'s also another folding device with a sensitive girl ghost who enters the fantasy of one of the boys, possibly mirrored by a soap opera show one of the characters is watching. I also liked how the characters developed and grew within each other.It\'s lite and fun stuff, but I\'d recommend it only if you\'re interested in the making of the thing than the final result itself. within a show, filmed as a play inside the dorm of the students, it\'s clever fan service and narrative twists and turns for girls who love to see pretty boys around each other, it\'s worth observing compared to other examples, and there\'s a spark of innovation with the role of a mangaka who actually caused all of the narrative around this specific fold, that\'s something.

Kuro no Su: Chronus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20889/Kuro_no_Su__Chronus,"[""There are two anime studios I can safely say I’m a huge fan of without any real caveats: Ghibli and Studio 4c. The former delivers for me more in terms of consistency, but the latter is by far my favorite in terms of how they use animation. As such, whilst a few of my more Studio Rikka-inclined colleagues were eagerly looking forward to Harmonie, I was more looking forward to Chronus. And I’ve got to say, whilst I don’t think it’s great overall, it delivered way better than the former did.First off, I loved how the first half or so basically resembled Boogiepop Phantom or...Serial Experiments Lain in terms of presentation in order to represent the main's powers regarding the supernatural. I love that sort of cryptic direction when it's done well, and Chronus pulls it off in a way that can be a bit heavy, but not to the point that I can't see what's going on. Said presentation disappears in the second half when the story goes more traditional and kind of action-y, but it's still kept visually interesting through the free-flowing animation and colorful visuals. Movement was pretty fluid and it delivered on visual intensity whenever it needed to. In short, this thing is pretty damn interesting, visual-wise. But is said visual style being applied to something worthy of it?Well, I think the story is pretty damn cool. A kid grows up with the ability to see soul-stealers, but he doesn’t do anything about it because he doesn’t see the point. But when said soul-stealers go after his female friend/crush, he realizes he has to take action. In essence, it’s a romance anime just like Harmonie was. However, this romance is between a girl who is about to die and a dude who’ll brave different dimensions and scythe-wielding specters in order to save her.In short, it’s a romance anime where cool stuff actually happens rather than one where you just blab about said cool stuff like you’re in a typical VN adaptation and proceed to do nothing but weakly tie it together with the most basic of plot elements. When you tie it all in with the awesome visual style and a pretty damn cool ambiguous ending to the thing that leaves me wanting more, you know you’ve got something worth watching.Yeah, this looks to be my favorite of the Anime Mirai stuff this year. Unless A-1 gained talent just for their contribution or something. Serial Experiments Lain in terms of presentation in order to represent the main's powers regarding the supernatural.

All have in common that the brave and more or less (but increasingly) distinct saviour and hero Ikusabe Wataru fights evil in his mighty fighting robot. This is the second season of the franchise, which was broadcasted a half year after the end of the first season. In the meantime, the anime Madou King Granzort had been shown in the same timeslot.The basic structure of this season is the same as its prequel: The world is split into seven levels, in each of which a final boss as well as one stage boss for...each episode await the hero to be heroically defeated. Only very few side quests distract the hero from this path and helpful characters will make sure to excplain him the next goal of the main quest. Shibaraku and and Himiko accompany him on his quest while other friends from the first season join in later. A around the half of the episodes, some budget seems to have appeared in the studio and gets allocated into character development and story building. After not much happened for over 20 episodes, quickly all characters get some backstory thrown at them for some actual story telling to commence. By this, the end of the series feels a little bit rushed, while the first half felt even more insubstancial than some parts of the first season. All in all however it is still entertaining thorughout all episodes and builds up the expectations that are fulfilled with the OVA ""Owarinaki Toki no Monogatari"".The experience of the magical Soukaizan realm is well underlined by beauiful backgrounds and atomspherical music. In many fighting scenes however, frames are heavily reused and the quality of art heavily varies with the importance of the scene. Although the exclusive use of songs by the band a・chi-a・chi, which is certainly an integral part of the marketing strategy, makes me sometimes feel a lack of variation, all opening and ending songs fit perfectly with the style of the series and are accompanied by good animation. The background music is mostly unobtrusive, only some songs might have been used a little bit less often.Most main characters where already introduced in the first season. Umihiko is the only notable new main character, I did however enjoy him very much. At first he seems to be quite similar to Toraou, he is however very unique and the only character with a majour backstory. (Umihiko, I love you<3) The other characters are further developed, especially by their relationships. Wataru seems to have grown in confidence and Himiko sometimes behaves even more ignorant of her environment than she already did before, does however also show some development of slowly becoming more mature. Although Shibaraku recieves some character development, he stays a sidekick more than any other character. Kurama (Mr. Bird) is mostly developed in his relationship with Umihiko and Toraou became to have a strong friendship with Wataru, did however not lose his original behaviour.Although the first half of this series only progresses very slowly, it has its funny moments and still portraits a colourful realm of adventure. Enduring the first half is then rewarded with the so far best part of the franchise and while the end leaves several open questions, you will certainly not regret watching this childish, cool and interesting adventure.Please watch the successing OVA, it is very good and gives the franchise a great finale. (Before it returned with Chou Mashin Eiyuuden Wataru. I have however yet to watch that series.) each episode await the hero to be heroically defeated. Only very few side quests distract the hero from this path and helpful characters will make sure to excplain him the next goal of the main quest. Shibaraku and and Himiko accompany him on his quest while other friends from the first season join in later. A around the half of the episodes, some budget seems to have appeared in the studio and gets allocated into character development and story building.

Macross Δ Movie: Gekijou no Walküre,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36077/Macross_Δ_Movie__Gekijou_no_Walküre,"['""You never deviate as far as when you think you know the way"" (Chinese proverb)A few days ago I had the opportunity to see Macross delta film - Macross Δ Movie: Gekijou no Walküre and I was pleasantly surprised.I came with the prejudice that it was a simple summary of the series in order to sell us more albums of the band walküre, having as a precedent the macross delta series, I did not expect much from this movieBut here the surprise, the film is VERY GOOD, it is noted that Kawamori this time took the place of director, although it retains the technical cast...of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in

in the movie than from the TV edition.', '""You never deviate as far as when you think you know the way"" (Chinese proverb)A few days ago I had the opportunity to see Macross delta film - Macross Δ Movie: Gekijou no Walküre and I was pleasantly surprised.I came with the prejudice that it was a simple summary of the series in order to sell us more albums of the band walküre, having as a precedent the macross delta series, I did not expect much from this movieBut here the surprise, the film is VERY GOOD, it is noted that Kawamori this time took the place of director, although it retains the technical cast...of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

in the movie than from the TV edition.', '""You never deviate as far as when you think you know the way"" (Chinese proverb)A few days ago I had the opportunity to see Macross delta film - Macross Δ Movie: Gekijou no Walküre and I was pleasantly surprised.I came with the prejudice that it was a simple summary of the series in order to sell us more albums of the band walküre, having as a precedent the macross delta series, I did not expect much from this movieBut here the surprise, the film is VERY GOOD, it is noted that Kawamori this time took the place of director, although it retains the technical cast...of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

the macross delta series, I did not expect much from this movieBut here the surprise, the film is VERY GOOD, it is noted that Kawamori this time took the place of director, although it retains the technical cast...of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film

original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in

and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in

giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called

not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto

of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in

each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I

with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that

Thunder glowZettai Reido NovaticHighly recommended for those who did not like the Macross Delta TV series, you can see the movie even without having seen the delta series, very good work by Kawamori. of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to

technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are

Thunder glowZettai Reido NovaticHighly recommended for those who did not like the Macross Delta TV series, you can see the movie even without having seen the delta series, very good work by Kawamori. of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not

Thunder glowZettai Reido NovaticHighly recommended for those who did not like the Macross Delta TV series, you can see the movie even without having seen the delta series, very good work by Kawamori. of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is

of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto hikattaraNamidame BakuhatsuonGiraffe

of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto hikattaraNamidame BakuhatsuonGiraffe

macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto hikattaraNamidame BakuhatsuonGiraffe

Undoubtedly. But this film kinda understands what was the TV Delta’s problem and trying to do something about it. The problem is almost nothing can be done with the source material like TV Delta, and reimagining in the Macross F way never took place for some reasons unknown to me, so the film still succ. Graphics got better, CGI improved from “make me unseen it” to “acceptable”, flat characters became more flat because their developments got cut alongside with filler parts or shortened to a fewer scenes.This version of Delta improved in some parts and deteriorated in others, which resulted in...the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length. the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length.', 'i Might\'ve been biased so much but Macross Delta"" Gekijou no Walkure not a good movie to start Macross delta, but a movie to see because you miss the series and you want to listen to new walkure songs.The thing is I\'ve been following Macross series since the first one, and this movie really not up to the Macross standard by plot point of view. the director was lazy enough so they recreated the recap movie for Macross delta series. completely different with past Macross movie like ""SDF Macross:  Do You Remember Love"" which takes the different take compared with its series and both...of Macross F movie which totally revamped the whole ending which makes things so much better because its a new kind of thrill you got different when you finished the series.The animation is a bit meh for the movie, still acceptable for TV series though. But the 3D amazed me so much because the inconsistency they got in this movie. some part like ""Change!!!"" 3D really blew me away because how good they direct the whole thing and the other like final battle, 3Ds looks like a cheap scene and totally unacceptable.IM SUPER BIASED IN THIS SECTION, but the soundtrack for the whole movie is really good. I love every single second watching it. there are 4 new songs added here including Walkure ga Tomaranai, Walkure ga Uragiranai, Change!!! (the best part of the movie) and Dancing in the Moonlight. Also, they included the past Walkure songs that you could enjoy because at the current stage, Walkure sitting on the number 3 best Macross singer my version (first is Fire Bomber, second Sheryl Nome, Fourth Lin Minmei and the last is Ranka Lee)its sucks, i know... but like Mamma Mia movie, you can watch the movie without disturbed that much with the plot and focused more onto the songs which I pretty much sing along every song (yep i pretty much memorized a lot of walkure songs) of Macross F movie which totally revamped the whole ending which makes things so much better because its a new kind of thrill you got different when you finished the series.The animation is a bit meh for the movie, still acceptable for TV series though.

and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto hikattaraNamidame BakuhatsuonGiraffe

Undoubtedly. But this film kinda understands what was the TV Delta’s problem and trying to do something about it. The problem is almost nothing can be done with the source material like TV Delta, and reimagining in the Macross F way never took place for some reasons unknown to me, so the film still succ. Graphics got better, CGI improved from “make me unseen it” to “acceptable”, flat characters became more flat because their developments got cut alongside with filler parts or shortened to a fewer scenes.This version of Delta improved in some parts and deteriorated in others, which resulted in...the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length. the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length.', 'i Might\'ve been biased so much but Macross Delta"" Gekijou no Walkure not a good movie to start Macross delta, but a movie to see because you miss the series and you want to listen to new walkure songs.The thing is I\'ve been following Macross series since the first one, and this movie really not up to the Macross standard by plot point of view. the director was lazy enough so they recreated the recap movie for Macross delta series. completely different with past Macross movie like ""SDF Macross:  Do You Remember Love"" which takes the different take compared with its series and both...of Macross F movie which totally revamped the whole ending which makes things so much better because its a new kind of thrill you got different when you finished the series.The animation is a bit meh for the movie, still acceptable for TV series though. But the 3D amazed me so much because the inconsistency they got in this movie. some part like ""Change!!!"" 3D really blew me away because how good they direct the whole thing and the other like final battle, 3Ds looks like a cheap scene and totally unacceptable.IM SUPER BIASED IN THIS SECTION, but the soundtrack for the whole movie is really good. I love every single second watching it. there are 4 new songs added here including Walkure ga Tomaranai, Walkure ga Uragiranai, Change!!! (the best part of the movie) and Dancing in the Moonlight. Also, they included the past Walkure songs that you could enjoy because at the current stage, Walkure sitting on the number 3 best Macross singer my version (first is Fire Bomber, second Sheryl Nome, Fourth Lin Minmei and the last is Ranka Lee)its sucks, i know... but like Mamma Mia movie, you can watch the movie without disturbed that much with the plot and focused more onto the songs which I pretty much sing along every song (yep i pretty much memorized a lot of walkure songs) of Macross F movie which totally revamped the whole ending which makes things so much better because its a new kind of thrill you got different when you finished the series.The animation is a bit meh for the movie, still acceptable for TV series though.

the macross delta series, I did not expect much from this movieBut here the surprise, the film is VERY GOOD, it is noted that Kawamori this time took the place of director, although it retains the technical cast...of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great

the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer and Reina, but I also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto hikattaraNamidame BakuhatsuonGiraffe

The problem is almost nothing can be done with the source material like TV Delta, and reimagining in the Macross F way never took place for some reasons unknown to me, so the film still succ. Graphics got better, CGI improved from “make me unseen it” to “acceptable”, flat characters became more flat because their developments got cut alongside with filler parts or shortened to a fewer scenes.This version of Delta improved in some parts and deteriorated in others, which resulted in...the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length. the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length.', 'i Might\'ve been biased so much but Macross Delta"" Gekijou no Walkure not a good movie to start Macross delta, but a movie to see because you miss the series and you want to listen to new walkure songs.The thing is I\'ve been following Macross series since the first one, and this movie really not up to the Macross standard by plot point of view. the director was lazy enough so they recreated the recap movie for Macross delta series. completely different with past Macross movie like ""SDF Macross:  Do You Remember Love"" which takes the different take compared with its series and both...of Macross F movie which totally revamped the whole ending which makes things so much better because its a new kind of thrill you got different when you finished the series.The animation is a bit meh for the movie, still acceptable for TV series though.

I love every single second watching it. there are 4 new songs added here including Walkure ga Tomaranai, Walkure ga Uragiranai, Change!!! (the best part of the movie) and Dancing in the Moonlight.

Movie: Gekijou no Walküre and I was pleasantly surprised.I came with the prejudice that it was a simple summary of the series in order to sell us more albums of the band walküre, having as a precedent the macross delta series, I did not expect much from this movieBut here the surprise, the film is VERY GOOD, it is noted that Kawamori this time took the place of director, although it retains the technical cast...of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS

also criticize ""the decrease"" of characters such as the air knights and the members of the squadron delta especially Mirage that does not have even half the role she had in the series.3) Love Triangle: 4/10IT DOES NOT EXIST, although the film implies that Mirage has feelings for Hayate, the script is responsible for making it clear to us that Hayate likes Freyja, which is not bad since it solves the romantic plot in a clear and forceful way.4) Art of the characters: 7/10You can see that it is a movie, the colors are improved and a very good CGI animation was achieved in the part of the concert of the song change !!!, negatively the difference between the new animation and the ""borrowed"" animation of the series is very evident5) Mecha design 7/10There is nothing new with regard to the series, one could add the transformable ships class macross Elysion, the ""armored""  version of the vf-31 sigfried and for the fans ""hard core"" of the macros mecha: the vf-31 with the Lil Draken modules  as if they were fast packs and the Sv-262Hs Draken III with  mirage´s  colors.6) 3D animation and battle choreography: 8/10The improvement with respect to the series is noticeable, not only the battles are more dynamic, the part of the walküre concert that takes place in al shaal, the ""battle"" with music by the group is very well achieved, 3D  point capture technique  was used  for the movements of the idols during the choreography of the song change !!!, that gives them more natural and realistic movements.7) Music: 10/10Macross delta stopped being a covert advertising campaign of a group of idols called walküre and transformed into a production worthy of being called ""macross"", the music is better suited to the point that the musical themes are reflected as in frontier what that happened at a certain moment, to the point that the lyrics of the songs seem to be narrating what is currently happening on the screen, also highlight the instrumental music that is responsible for highlighting key moments in the story giving it an identity of its own.It highlights the fact that unnecessary scenes and musical themes of the series that did not contribute to the development of the plot were eliminatedWalküre musical themes that DO appear in the film:Walküre ga Tomaranai (without Freyja)Bokura no senjouRun ga pika tto hikattaraNamidame BakuhatsuonGiraffe

Undoubtedly. But this film kinda understands what was the TV Delta’s problem and trying to do something about it. The problem is almost nothing can be done with the source material like TV Delta, and reimagining in the Macross F way never took place for some reasons unknown to me, so the film still succ. Graphics got better, CGI improved from “make me unseen it” to “acceptable”, flat characters became more flat because their developments got cut alongside with filler parts or shortened to a fewer scenes.This version of Delta improved in some parts and deteriorated in others, which resulted in...the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length. the same 5 sad Mirage’s smiles out of 10 for me.Still better than a TV due to length.', 'i Might\'ve been biased so much but Macross Delta"" Gekijou no Walkure not a good movie to start Macross delta, but a movie to see because you miss the series and you want to listen to new walkure songs.The thing is I\'ve been following Macross series since the first one, and this movie really not up to the Macross standard by plot point of view. the director was lazy enough so they recreated the recap movie for Macross delta series. completely different with past Macross movie like ""SDF Macross:  Do You Remember Love"" which takes the different take compared with its series and both...of Macross F movie which totally revamped the whole ending which makes things so much better because its a new kind of thrill you got different when you finished the series.The animation is a bit meh for the movie, still acceptable for TV series though. But the 3D amazed me so much because the inconsistency they got in this movie. some part like ""Change!!!"" 3D really blew me away because how good they direct the whole thing and the other like final battle, 3Ds looks like a cheap scene and totally unacceptable.IM SUPER BIASED IN THIS SECTION, but the soundtrack for the whole movie is really good. I love every single second watching it. there are 4 new songs added here including Walkure ga Tomaranai, Walkure ga Uragiranai, Change!!! (the best part of the movie) and Dancing in the Moonlight. Also, they included the past Walkure songs that you could enjoy because at the current stage, Walkure sitting on the number 3 best Macross singer my version (first is Fire Bomber, second Sheryl Nome, Fourth Lin Minmei and the last is Ranka Lee)its sucks, i know... but like Mamma Mia movie, you can watch the movie without disturbed that much with the plot and focused more onto the songs which I pretty much sing along every song (yep i pretty much memorized a lot of walkure songs) of Macross F movie which totally revamped the whole ending which makes things so much better because its a new kind of thrill you got different when you finished the series.The animation is a bit meh for the movie, still acceptable for TV series though.

unnecessary part of story and streamlined a clumsy 2 season anime into a 2hr-ish movie.What it does is keep the good part of story, highlight and focus on those parts, then pretty much remake all the Valkyrie (mecha) battle scenes on par with at least those of Macross Frontier level (of which the TV version of Macross Delta never be able to do so)And then of course put almost a whole album volume of new music while keeping some of the best from the TV in the...movie.My recommendation for those never into Macross Delta is that just watch the movie and ignore the TV edition, you will get more

in the movie than from the TV edition.', '""You never deviate as far as when you think you know the way"" (Chinese proverb)A few days ago I had the opportunity to see Macross delta film - Macross Δ Movie: Gekijou no Walküre and I was pleasantly surprised.I came with the prejudice that it was a simple summary of the series in order to sell us more albums of the band walküre, having as a precedent the macross delta series, I did not expect much from this movieBut here the surprise, the film is VERY GOOD, it is noted that Kawamori this time took the place of director, although it retains the technical cast...of the series, the direction of Kawamori was noted.Not only the story unfolds very naturally, but it does not bore and unlike the series is not a compendium of good pop songs with a forced story, no, it is a story of a band of idols with their conflicts and how together they surpass all the challenges of a world at war.The characters are better achieved than in the series and although the film ends the same as in the series, the development of it makes reaching that end enjoyable and logical.It is like a building that one rises little by little and culminates with a great battle (classic in macross at this point) and unlike the series the film leaves us a teaching.Kawamori eliminated all the inconclusive arguments that the series raised and that only hurt the central script, this time each song, each dogfight, each character play a certain role to reach that final climax and, yes, gentlemen, the macross delta movie CLOSES THE HISTORY , GIVES A FINISH TO MACROSS DELTA HISTORY, giving rise to new deliveries of this franchise without having to continue exploiting the history of macross delta.Here is the analysis:Note: it is a personal opinion based on what I saw in the film and comparing it with the series and other series / movies of the macross franchise.1) History: 8/10Finally the history of macross delta is understood, not only there is an outbreak of a virus called Var, which is fought by the tactical sound unit: walküre, the story is mature, leaves aside all the sub-frames that hampered the development of the series, it is understood that the original idea of delta was not bad, it was only badly scripted and misdirected, this time with a revised script and a good direction, each fact, each moment of the film allows the development of the story, THE BEST: the macross delta film closes the story of Delta, allowing the continuity of the franchise with new ideas and visions of the Macross universe2) Characters: 7/10The story focuses on the band Walküre and it shows, the secondary characters are relegated to a supporting role for the development of the story, the story does not revolve in a single point, it is the story of a group and the members of walküre mature as characters, with unique characteristics, they finally stop being ""one-dimensional characters"", I highlight the work of improving the characters of Roid, Messer
