Kidou Senkan Nadesico: The Prince of Darkness,https://myanimelist.net/anime/219/Kidou_Senkan_Nadesico__The_Prince_of_Darkness,"['I recommend all Nadesico fans to NOT watch this movie.""What were they thinking when they made this?"" - That\'s the first thing that comes to mind when looking at Prince of Darkness. This isn\'t Nadesico, this isn\'t the GEKIGAN FLARE-yelling, hotblooded- yet lighthearted- and satiric view of the real robot genre that made Nadesico unique, interesting and a brilliant watch. No, this is a dark, murderous, hideous shadow of Nadesico. It\'s what you get if you lock Nadesico into a dark room for a couple years, continuously poke it with a cattle prod and feed it nothing but raw meat. It\'s just not the same....But it tries to be.====WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS===Story:Ok, well for starters, the story is ABYSMAL. Basically the movie comes in parts. Part 1- introducing the viewer to what happened in the time skip between the movie and the end of Nadesico.  Part 2- gather all the crew together. Part 3- none of the crew does anything, other than Ruri, and the whole movie ends in virtually the exact same way as the series. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AKITO. Yes you heard me, Akito does not revert to his lovable anime self, no he leaves this movie as a cold-hearted killer who shoots first and asks questions later. After all the series\' development to get him involved with Yurika, he just up and leaves her at the end of the movie. This alone makes the plot of PoD horrible. It just takes away all the good things from the series and throws them in the bin. There is NO Gekiganer in the movie, aside from one line where it is briefly mentioned in passing. This is despite the Jovian\'s entire race was centred on the thing for centuries. I\'m sorry but I just don\'t *get* that.Now, don\'t get me wrong, there are a few funny lines, but I could count them on one hand, and they simply do not justify the complete and utter abandonment of everything Nadesico had represented.Art:The artwork is amazing. The Black Selena is an incredible-looking mech, and as with the series, the quality of animation is very high. I have no complaints at all about the animation. However, this does not justify the plot.Sound:Again, no complaints, the sound is at least good enough for me to not have anything bad to say about it, and thus I give it the thumbs up.Character:Ok, here\'s a big thumbs down. Yurika has all of what, three lines in this show? Akito is NOTHING like his previous self.Minor characters, such as prospector or Megumi are delegated to single-sentence appearances, and serve no real role whatsoever.  Ruri has almost all of the screentime, with the only other character of notable significance being Ryoko (oh, and the Jovian- the Joe Umisubame (gekiganger) lookalike, I can\'t remember his name, he gets a little development). Sure, this isn\'t bad if you\'re a Ruri fan, but the colour and depth of the cast is one of the pivotal things that made Nadesico great. This movie chucks that into a paper shredder and lights it on fire. You simply get no charater development whatsoever, and the development you do get is largely negative, as in Akito, who is the complete opposite of his three-years-prior self.Enjoyment:None. As a matter of fact I felt sick after whatching this. The animation was good. There were a couple of funny lines. But what was once a bright and funny show is now a dark and pessimistic gloom-fest. Sorry but I actually REGRET watching this, rather than enjoy it.Overall:This series departs from the Anime in such as colossal way that it is simply a complete and utter punch in the face to someone who came here looking for more Nadesico goodness. Watch the Gekiganger OVA, that thing\'s far more deserving as Nadesico\'s sequel. Don\'t watch this. But it tries to be.====WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS===Story:Ok, well for starters, the story is ABYSMAL. Basically the movie comes in parts.

Watch the Gekiganger OVA, that thing\'s far more deserving as Nadesico\'s sequel. Don\'t watch this.', ""Before I get to anything else, let me point out something: This movie isn't intended to be watched right after the anime with no information given. There was actually a video game made that takes place in between the television series and the movie where a lot of important things happen. You can watch the movie right after the anime and probably still understand it, but it might distract you from the story of the movie trying to figure out what happened. It's called Martian Successor Nadesico: The Blank of Three Years. I don't think it's necessary to actually play it (I haven't), but finding...and reading a plot summary is helpful.With that out of the way, let's begin. It's obvious that this can be a very polarizing movie: Just take a look at the reviews on this page. An 8, a 10, a 4 and a 1. So there's definitely a big element of personal preference here. Personally, I think that it does have some pretty big flaws in parts, particularly in terms of some character development, but it's entertaining enough to make up for it.The story is fast-paced and exciting. The getting-the-band-back-together elements of the story, while cliche, are very entertaining, and the final battle at the end is typical Nadesico fun. That said, there are definitely some flaws. There's one in particular that stands out: The villains, the Martian Successors, have motives that are only vaguely defined - it's stated briefly in the movie that they want to control all aspects of society and life, and that plus some of their regimented attitude makes you think they might be a bit like Nazis or something, but you're never told HOW exactly they're going to change the universe for the worse if they come into power. Without this important information, they seem pointless and silly, and their whole plot just becomes kind of dumb. It's especially disappointing since for some reason the English version was named after these villains instead of the Jovians, and yet once you see them it doesn't take long to realize that there's no good reason to name the series after them. Most of the story, though, remains quite entertaining. I was especially interested in the way they built upon the sci-fi concept of the chulips that they had explored in the original series.The art is as good as ever, even better than the TV series. Admittedly, it was a 1990s series, so the animation was not always top-quality, and nothing much to write home about compared to some of the series of today, but I've always felt the more 90's style character designs had a lot of charm, and the animation was always perfectly adequate. It's improved upon, though, in the movie, since, you know, higher budget and all.The music is just as great as usual, with more of the orchestral type stuff that really energized the original series, and it energizes the movie as well. The voice acting is the same as it ever was in the dub, which is the version of the series I watched and so the version of the movie I watched, for consistency. I know some people don't like the dub at all, but I personally love it, and I felt it was just as good as it was in the original series. I liked especially how Ruri sounded older but still like herself. None of the characters we've already met are recast and the voices of the new characters fit in seamlessly, so all in all I'd just say that whatever you thought of the dub the first time around will be exactly the same as what you think of it here. The Japanese appears to be just as good, but I wouldn't really know for sure. Oh, and the sound effects are pretty good I guess. I wasn't really paying attention to that.Ruri pretty much takes over the helm of main character from Akito in this installment, as she's the captain of the Nadesico B and basically gets to do all the coolest stuff in the movie. Personally, though, while she definitely got a lot of the spotlight, I didn't think she took much away from the other characters. It's interesting to see where they've ended up and how much they have grown in three years, but they don't change so drastically as to be unrecognizable and there are still plenty of great character moments. Nearly every character from the series gets at least a few moments to shine here, and Hikaru and Izumi in particular provide some welcome comedy relief toward the end of the movie.A couple characters really get the shaft, though. Although she's plot-important, probably crucial actually, we also don't see Yurika very much during the movie - although admittedly some viewers might be glad to be rid of her. And Akito himself gets some pretty lackluster development. His character frankly becomes a lot less interesting.There are also a few new characters, mostly the crew populating Ruri's Nadesico B. They aren't quite as interesting as the characters from the anime, but they're likable enough and fit in with the rest of the cast. The new villains, however, have basically no real character whatsoever. Even the leader just seems like some random guy, and their whole group really isn't given much of a good reason for doing anything that they do.The most disappointing thing about the movie is probably the ending. By this I don't mean the resolution of the Martian Successor plot threads that began in the movie; that's fantastic. What I do mean is that there are a lot of things left hanging open-ended by the finish, and unfortunately it's the last Nadesico related thing that was ever produced before there were some disputes between the creator and the anime company. There was going to be a sequel in 2005, but it fell through. While I still hope there might be a continuation of the show someday, I'm not holding my breath. Knowing this is the last bit of Nadesico we'll probably ever get is a bit of a downer and it does make a lot of the ending unsatisfying.All in all, although I think it might have helped a bit more to consider character development and plot more, especially the matter of who exactly these villains are and why we should give a damn, but it's still a pretty good movie. Even though the story can be a bit ridiculous at times, it's still a lot of fun. And although it's disappointing that this is pretty much the end, you can always imagine what comes next in your mind.Or hell, write some fan fiction if you want. Frankly, it could be better than any continuation we might actually get. and reading a plot summary is helpful.With that out of the way, let's begin.

It did have its good parts but they were sparse at best.  They spent way too long trying to convey what everyone was doing post-series but then decided to just flat-out stop at a certain point and try to get the plot up and running... to no avail.the final battle follows closely with what the plot was doing and you...honestly have no idea how or why everything is happening.  The dude who[SPOILER] shot Tsukumo in the series just shows up and tells everyone to stop fighting and they do, without hesitation or explanation as to why.  They're just captivated by his hair, i guess.And they also succeeded in turning Akito into a mopey little bitch.  Hooray for Shinji's Disease and its ability to grasp the heart of ANY mech protag.i was really hoping this would turn out as awesome as the show was, but i just felt sorry for it. honestly have no idea how or why everything is happening.

It boasts an utterly confusing beginning where I\'ve no idea what\'s going on, a build up to something that vaguely resembles a climatic showdown... only to follow up with an anti-climatic finish....It left me feeling that the movie had ended prematurely. The most glaring fault is that ""Prince of Darkness"" is simply too short. For a while the plot looked like it might be heading somewhere interesting, but the whole thing turned out to be stupidly simple - it\'s just a very straight forward old crew battles new threat storyline, but confusingly told and filled with incomprehensible technobabble.And of course, because the story has moved on since the series, there is no talk of ""Genkiganga"" which, for me, was almost the only source of entertainment in the original series.As far as I can tell, the only thing about ""Prince of Darkness"" that\'s of value to fans of the series is that it allows them to see how the crew have moved on since the end of the series, which admittedly is vaguely interesting in its own right. But apart from that, I struggle to think of any good reasons to watch this. It left me feeling that the movie had ended prematurely.

But apart from that, I struggle to think of any good reasons to watch this.', 'Spoiler alert: it sucks. Prince of Darkness sucks hard. It\'s become such a punchline that it doesn\'t even feel worth a professional stripping-down of how it fails on nearly every level. This is particularly saying something coming from me, as I consider the original Nadesico TV series one of the best mecha anime.First things first, it\'s widely circulated that Prince of Darkness turns so many people off because it relies on information only presented in a Japanese-only Sega Saturn visual novel. However, ""The Blank of Three Years"" has had its story shared and revealed that this is hyperbolic apologism for Prince of Darkness. According to...the most detailed explanation I\'ve found (https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/junk_guild/martian-successor-nadeisco-the-blank-of-3-years-t383.html), the Sega Saturn game\'s details are largely superfluous and explain only everything we don\'t need. It explains how the cast generally ends up where they are, but we don\'t need to see how Ruri Hoshino became a captain before the events of Prince of Darkness. You would logically assume that due to her accomplishments in the TV series that she would reach a higher position in the military in three years. Minor details like these were never the question. However, the entire central plot to Prince of Darkness? Akito and Yurika\'s tragic accident and the explanation of the Hokushin Six and the Jovian Federation\'s maneuvers since the end of the TV series? Strap in, because the visual novel doesn\'t explain shit and your only narrator is the Prince of Darkness film.And what a narrator it is. I wish I could say PoD\'s only narrative problem was the lack of explanation for critical character-altering events, but it pales in comparison to the movie\'s absolutely dreadful pacing.  It feels appropriate that watching this movie corresponded with me beginning medication for my ADD. This is one of the most cramped storylines I have ever borne witness to. The scenes cut at a breakneck pace, everyone speaks a mile a minute, and the exact second any information is finished presenting in this blitzkrieg format another scene assaults you with a bevy of new visual and expository information. Keep in mind that all of this ecstatic presentation is dressed by the TV series\' particular irreverence and you find this tidal wave takes on a practically psychedelic hue as fourth-wall breaks, bizarre framing and camera angles that don\'t logically connect, non-sequiturs, slapstick and absurdist comedy, and an assault of colorful visuals tint what\'s already an obscured and flimsy narrative into something hideous and amorphous.With regards to unpleasant surprises, I was pleased to see that the movie\'s tone wasn\'t quite as bad as I\'d been led to believe. I was expecting a ton of contrived darkness that contrasted heavily with the TV series\' parodical light-hearted nature, and while that absolutely exists here, it\'s confined within certain aspects of the plot. If anything, this is worse. Maybe you\'d adjust to the movie over time if it initially started out with a darker tone and kept it consistent the entire way through, but instead the atmosphere is largely ridiculous and carefree. This becomes a problem when the entire emotional thrust of your plot is built around the tragic kidnapping and torture of Akito and Yurika. You\'re supposed to sympathize with how these innocent characters were brutally broken down off-screen, but you only have Akito\'s anecdotes about the experience to share (because the visual novel was worthless, remember) and every single time they\'re surrounded by bright, bouncy, silly anime characters. It completely undermines the choice to take the characters in a darker direction, taking what was already an insult to the original series\' spirit and then reaping none of the possible dramatic benefit from it. Akito\'s new vengeance-fueled, silent and mysterious persona is a personality 180 and cliche to the point of seeming like an utter joke. And a joke it may very well could be, considering how much of the series was, but here\'s the difference: it\'s a bad joke. By not fully committing to the tonal change it’s impossible to parody the whole “grimdark” shtick.Any implication of irony with regards to Akito’s characterization and plot is only gathered from good faith based on the TV series and not within the context of the movie itself. The light-hearted tone of the rest of the movie doesn’t feel like it’s meant to highlight Akito’s newfound cynicism because it never directly interacts with him. The tone of Akito’s plot and Ruri’s plot are switched between constantly but never mixed. Sure, everyone’s still completely in love and obsessed with Akito for no reason as usual and desires to help him throughout the movie, but in the extremely rare instances Akito gets to interact with the rest of the cast, the surrounding cast always adjusts themselves to his tone and get super serious. By doing this there’s never any implicit criticism of the way Akito’s behaving, it’s accepted as is and there’s no punchline or payoff as a result. Something I might expect the original show to do is that Akito is eventually broken down by the Nadesico crew’s indominatable irreverent spirit that he’d forgotten and reverts back to his old self in the final moments, thus the movie acknowledges the ridiculousness of Akito’s new persona and therefore the trope itself. Instead, nothing happens. Akito accomplishes his revenge and flies off to nowhere, showing us no signs of further change as he abandons Yurika and undoes all character development from the series by doing so, never to be seen again. In other words, even if we give the writing staff all the good faith we can and assume the awkward tonal shifts are a gag, they’re still pulled off in an ineffective way that gives no commentary to what they might be parodying. They’re simply doing it and leaving it at that. And at that point, what’s the difference between parody and a genuine presentation that’s just handled poorly?Well, Prince of Darkness looks great, I’ll give it that. The TV series is probably one of the nicest looking shows of its decade, showing off vibrantly colorful painted animation at its peak, right before the industry made a hard swing towards more digital techniques. It’s almost worth seeing for that alone and experiencing that visual warmth of the series one more time. On the other hand, the on-screen action is so utterly chaotic as described earlier that you’d better keep the pause button constantly on the ready if you want to gawk at any frame’s level of quality. It almost feels like a waste in that regard. The whole movie has the feel of being an OVA chopped to pieces to fit into a film with no new transition scenes added to facilitate the cuts. Likewise, if this sequel was an OVA it would probably improve dramatically. Not only would it strengthen the impact of its visuals, but it would at least make the storyline itself go down smoother. It wouldn’t necessarily fix the mishandling of Akito’s storyline, but the whiplash would diminish, and viewers would have more breathing room and time for the contextual reconstructing of the events that happened before the movie instead of constantly being bombarded with new distractions. I can’t think of a good way to end this review, but Xebec couldn’t think of a good way to end the series, so there. Fans of the TV series, you’re not missing anything. Just assume everything worked out in the end and everyone lived happily ever after. We’re all better off that way, and not simply because it’s a happier ending. the most detailed explanation I\'ve found (https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/junk_guild/martian-successor-nadeisco-the-blank-of-3-years-t383.html), the Sega Saturn game\'s details are largely superfluous and explain only everything we don\'t need.

Sure, everyone’s still completely in love and obsessed with Akito for no reason as usual and desires to help him throughout the movie, but in the extremely rare instances Akito gets to interact with the rest of the cast, the surrounding cast always adjusts themselves to his tone and get super serious. By doing this there’s never any implicit criticism of the way Akito’s behaving, it’s accepted as is and there’s no punchline or payoff as a result. Something I might expect the original show to do is that Akito is eventually broken down by the Nadesico crew’s indominatable irreverent spirit that he’d forgotten and reverts back to his old self in the final moments, thus the movie acknowledges the ridiculousness of Akito’s new persona and therefore the trope itself. Instead, nothing happens. Akito accomplishes his revenge and flies off to nowhere, showing us no signs of further change as he abandons Yurika and undoes all character development from the series by doing so, never to be seen again. In other words, even if we give the writing staff all the good faith we can and assume the awkward tonal shifts are a gag, they’re still pulled off in an ineffective way that gives no commentary to what they might be parodying. They’re simply doing it and leaving it at that. And at that point, what’s the difference between parody and a genuine presentation that’s just handled poorly?Well, Prince of Darkness looks great, I’ll give it that. The TV series is probably one of the nicest looking shows of its decade, showing off vibrantly colorful painted animation at its peak, right before the industry made a hard swing towards more digital techniques. It’s almost worth seeing for that alone and experiencing that visual warmth of the series one more time. On the other hand, the on-screen action is so utterly chaotic as described earlier that you’d better keep the pause button constantly on the ready if you want to gawk at any frame’s level of quality. It almost feels like a waste in that regard. The whole movie has the feel of being an OVA chopped to pieces to fit into a film with no new transition scenes added to facilitate the cuts. Likewise, if this sequel was an OVA it would probably improve dramatically. Not only would it strengthen the impact of its visuals, but it would at least make the storyline itself go down smoother. It wouldn’t necessarily fix the mishandling of Akito’s storyline, but the whiplash would diminish, and viewers would have more breathing room and time for the contextual reconstructing of the events that happened before the movie instead of constantly being bombarded with new distractions. I can’t think of a good way to end this review, but Xebec couldn’t think of a good way to end the series, so there. Fans of the TV series, you’re not missing anything. Just assume everything worked out in the end and everyone lived happily ever after. We’re all better off that way, and not simply because it’s a happier ending.', ""I watched this movie against the word of many of my friends who were fellow fans of the series.Touching on a case by case here:Story: Completely off from how the original series presented itself. The series ended on a well rounded note, and this movie was created to pretty much throw that to the wind. The mood and tone difference between this movie and the series its supposedly based off of is totally dark dark night and bright day. The movie itself seems to be standalone with the way the plot is built. Its completely against the series writing.Art: Amazing. The one shining...beacon in the dark that is this movie. Very crisp, very well done.Soundtrack: Its OK, nothing to get excited about.Characters: The plot was bad, but some of the character writing was just terrible. I'd have tolerated everything else, but to completely re-write Akito Tenkawa as a deep dark figure just gave me headaches. We're going from a person who was so excitable, so energized, to someone who is droll, moody, and emo. Come on, please. I believe this character is a person, but he is not Akito Tenkawa in any fathomable light.Enjoyment: I was too busy planting my head in to a wall.Overall: This anime came forth with amazing animation, only to be driven down in to the grave by terrible script writing, bad hindsight, and absolutely atrocious character re-writing. I'm absolutely appalled that anyone gave this movie above a 2.  And it only gets that far with me because of the animation. beacon in the dark that is this movie.

It basically was revolution we found akito and back o the usual gimmicks.The art and everything was good for a 1990's anime.The characters well same off as the tv series nothing new.For the people who liked the tv series i recommend u watch the movie at your own risk it will leave u just like it left u at the end of the show clueless and wanting more "", ""A great movie that show that after math of the original TV series, plus it also show life of Nadesico's crew after the war is over. I do wish they will spend more times progressing the plot instead of showing the daily life of every characters, I guess they were planning to have more than one movie.It is very unfortunate that the story is unfinished, there won't be any sequel to conclude the story. There were 2 dreamcast games that kind of follow the story after the movie, but it barely moved the plot, and it ended in another cliffhanger.As a big Nadesico fan, I...personally loved the movie, but it is hard to recommend an incomplete product. personally loved the movie, but it is hard to recommend an incomplete product."", 'Although certainly not nearly as good as the series, the movie truly wasn\'t too bad. The biggest thing that hurts the movie is that the game ""Martian Successor Nadesico: The Blank Three Years"" was never released in English. Because of this, a number of important plot points are completely missing in order to understand the movie.However, even when you know the plot of the game, the movie feels very rushed, and does not have a very satisfying conclusion.  This is somewhat addressed with another game, ""Martian Successor Nadesico: The Mission."" However, this game also leaves us with yet more questions.There were originally...intentions of expanding the franchise further, but these plans fell through.Had the series been continued, and if ""The Blank Three  Years"" was available in English (or as an additional OVA would be even better!), then this I definitely recommend this series for everyone. However, as it is, I would only suggest serious fans bother tracking it down. Falling into that latter category, my score is probably inflated a little. intentions of expanding the franchise further, but these plans fell through.Had the series been continued, and if ""The Blank Three  Years"" was available in English (or as an additional OVA would be even better!), then this I definitely recommend this series for everyone.

Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25939/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_ViVid,"['Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha is a franchise I didn’t think I would enjoy, I wasn’t really into magical girl shows at the time but I’d heard good things so I gave it a shot. I love Nanoha now, it’s a great series, I even like the less popular StrikerS season quite a lot.So when I heard they were adapting the manga Nanoha Vivid into an anime, I was pretty excited, more Nanoha couldn’t be bad right? Oh boy, here we go. Where do I even start with this thing, one of the most disappointing sequels in my recent memory?One of the biggest complaints about Nanoha...StrikerS was that the title character herself, Nanoha, was reduced to a supporting role while it mostly focused on new characters. Oh what I wouldn’t give for her to have StrikerS level of involvement, while in that show she was mostly secondary, she was still story relevant and drove the plot along, even having a major scene in the finale.In Vivid she’s a housewife.Yes, Nanoha, one of the most powerful magical girls in any series has been reduced to a housewife. Outside of a single training fight in the midpoint of vivid, she has done literally nothing else. This show is now about her adopted daughter Vivio, something that I’m not totally against in concept, but it continues to get worse. Even Vivio herself, the new title character (Vivid) has also turned into a supporting cast member. The last Five or so episodes were completely lacking in Vivio, she didn’t even have a single important scene in the finale!Sure, the first season has a dual protagonist dynamic with Nanoha and dark magical girl Fate Testarossa, but those were the only characters in focus. A’s managed to add new cast without detracting from the fact that Nanoha was the lead character, and StrikerS is slightly infamous for it’s lack of Nanoha. But at least in StrikerS Nanoha is actively training the cast in focus, making their victories a victory by proxy for Nanoha, their trainer.In Vivid it’s as if they realized that Vivio is a super boring character, she’s almost instantly sidelined by her Chinese knockoff Fate-chan, Einhart Stratos. It gets worse as the show progresses, with episode 10 featuring less then 30 seconds of footage of Vivio OR Einhart, as it shows us a completely irrelevant tournament fight about characters we know almost nothing about. That fight was a joke, they built up one of the girls as a threat, but she’s totally wrecked by somebody we’ve barely even seen before, making it complete filler for a series with a very limited episode count.This show is boring, I mean really, really boring. There hasn’t been a single exciting event of note in the entire 12 episode run, because nothing has any consequences. Gone are the first season’s world effecting, galactic level crisis events. Now we have hotsprings, loli fanservice (not that we had none of that before, but there’s more now), and tournament battles with simulated damage. That’s right; nobody is even in any danger of getting hurt at almost any point in this show, if there’s no threat then why should I care what happens? It’s not like they developed any characters into somebody I would want to root for in a sports competition.I guess if you want a fluffy slice of lifish story with magical girls you could enjoy this. But the almost completely different tone of the series is extremely off-putting to me, a fan of Nanoha for its darker take on magical girls. And don’t even get me started on Vivio and Einhart’s magical devices, some of the dumbest shit I’ve seen in years. Nanoha’s magic device is a necklace that turns into a staff; Fate’s is a wristband that turns into a poleaxe. Vivio’s magical device is… a STUFFED RABBIT!How am I meant to take any of this seriously when a goddamn cartoon rabbit is involved in Vivio’s transformation sequence, where she also turns into a more adult mode (when Nanoha was able to kick ass as a loli, I guess Vivio just sucks). Oh yeah, Einhart’s device is a cat, not a stuffed animal cat, an actual, normal cat. Her device is just a cat, what, why?On the animation side of things, A-1 Pictures does an adequate job of animating the fight scenes, though there is no standout animation like you might see in an Ufotable or Madhouse production. However I do have a problem with the style of the show, and I’m not sure if this is a problem with the manga which I have not read, or the adaption. That problem is the setting backgrounds, Nanoha as of season 3 is set on an alien world full of magical technology, and Vivid is set in the same world. So why does it look like Japan? Did they forget the setting was no longer modern Japan or something; everything looks so standard it barely feels like the same show anymore.The music is so utterly unremarkable that I have nothing to say about it, other then it’s not offensively bad so I guess that’s a plus! But no really, I don’t know much about music, nor do I really pay attention to it unless it sticks out in a big way, like Gurren Lagann’s soundtrack. Of special note however would be how absolutely poorly the music in episode 11 was handled, the episodes starts right away with a blaring rock track that doesn’t fit the action on screen and is far too loud, with similar music coming in at terrible times all throughout, all too loud as well.Now, this part is just personal theory, but let me try and explain what went wrong. Seasons 1 though 3 of Nanoha were all written to be a TV anime, they have a distinct beginning middle and end paced for their episode counts. Vivid however, is an ongoing manga, adapting only a fraction of the content. This would certainly hurt the concise, well planned pace of the other three seasons. It still doesn’t excuse the baffling design decisions and lackluster characters however. It’s also the only reason you should ever introduce a new character in the final episode with no buildup then act like they’re important only for the show to just END, the pace is that of the manga, which is ongoing and thus does not work for an anime.I was going to write here “this is an anime I’d only recommend to hardcore Nanoha fans” but no, a hardcore Nanoha fan would probably be even more disappointed then I am. This is barely a sequel to StrikerS and almost feels totally disconnected to the rest of the series thanks to this far more lighthearted tone, I really can’t recommend this unless you’re desperate for some magical girls, but you’d be better off watching a different magical girl show instead.Edit: Upon further reevaluation, my enjoyment of the initial episodes the first time around was gone, and my score has updated to reflect this.

I was excited when they announced Vivid, because it\'s the first new Nanoha anime to come out since I really became a fan. So how does it stack up? For me it was a 7.5/10 series (rounded down to 7 for reasons I’ll get to) and mostly met my expectations, but it also had some issues that kept it from matching the heights of previous seasons. Here are a few of its biggest strengths, weaknesses, and things that could...go either way depending on your personal tastes. If you don’t want to read everything you can skip to the tl;dr section at the bottom for my quick take on whether or not you should watch Vivid.Strengths:+ Some of the new characters. Corona and especially Einhart are worthy additions to the Nanoha cast, with the latter’s personal growth driving much of the story. Rio has less to do in these 12 episodes but also shows some promise if there’s ever a second season. Several characters who played smaller roles in StrikerS also get more (and welcome) development.+ Voice cast. Returning veterans like Nana Mizuki, Yukari Tamura, and Kana Ueda have been voicing these characters for a decade and don’t miss a beat here. The real star of Vivid to me, though, was Mamiko Noto as Einhart. She\'s a complex character who has to be played as confident and ambitious, but still likable and sympathetic, and Noto\'s performance has the right mix of noble-born grace and emotional vulnerability to make the character work. I also liked Yumi Uchiyama in a small but memorable role as a delinquent fighting in the tournament.+ Lots of well-animated fight scenes. The switch from Seven Arcs to a higher-budget studio in A-1 is most noticeable in the fight choreography, which compared to earlier seasons has more dynamic motion and hand-to-hand combat, a much wider variety of combat styles, and a whole lot less of characters just standing in one place and beamspamming each other.+ World Building. StrikerS gave us some of the history of Midchilda. Vivid goes further back in time, exploring some of the history of the Belkan home world and the Ancient Belkan empire. Anyone interested in learning more about the Nanohaverse will enjoy those parts.YMMV:* The entry barrier. This is NOT a series for first-time Nanoha watchers. Most returning characters get little or no introduction (and a lot of them are walking spoilers for past seasons). Some, like Ixy, never even appeared in the anime before, only the audio drama CDs, but Vivid still expects you to know who they are too. The show doesn’t review old concepts like intelligent devices or the differences between Belkan and Midchildan magic, either. Veteran Nanoha fans will appreciate not hearing all that again, but anyone coming into this series without watching the first three seasons is going to have lots of unanswered questions.* Missing old favorites. This is basically a spinoff series focusing on Vivio and her new friends, and the returning cast with the biggest roles all come from StrikerS. Except for one arc, even Nanoha and Fate are rarely seen outside their homes, while other fan favorites from seasons one and two only make brief cameos or don’t appear at all.* Genre switch. Even though it has transformation scenes and a few other magical girl trappings, Vivid isn\'t a true magical girl series. It’s really a shounen tournament battle series with all the staples of that genre: training scenes, monologues about getting stronger, rivals-turned-friends, new characters who are abruptly introduced and given backstory two minutes before their first big fight, etc. If you like that kind of anime, great. If you don’t, Vivid’s not going to change your mind.* Fanservice. Nanoha’s no stranger to fanservice anyway, but compared to previous seasons Vivid ups the stakes with lots more panty shots, ripped clothes, girls bathing together, and so on. A-1 also updated the old character designs to look ""cuter"" than before. As usual, some fans will welcome these changes, and some won’t.Weaknesses:- The Stakes. The first three seasons of Nanoha all involved major threats, with deadly consequences if Nanoha and her friends failed. Vivid’s stakes are so much lower that it practically feels like a slice-of-life show compared to its predecessors, and the dramatic tension that powered the climaxes of earlier seasons just isn’t there.- Vivio. While I applauded Mamiko Noto earlier for the way she balances Einhart\'s personality, Vivio\'s a much more straightforward ""cheerful child"" type, and Kaori Mizuhashi doesn’t have to stretch herself much in the role. Unfortunately, it also makes Vivio a rather one-note character, and not nearly as interesting or as developed as her rival Einhart. That may change if we get a second season, but saying that also brings us to one of the biggest problems with this series.- The Ending. As in, there isn’t one. It just adapts 12 episodes worth of material from the manga and stops. Now this isn\'t an issue if A-1 announces another season, but right now Vivid is glaringly incomplete. That\'s also the biggest reason I’m only giving it a 7, at least so far.Tl;dr:Watch It: if you liked all three prior seasons of Nanoha and you’re just happy to spend more time in its universe, even if it’s mostly with a new set of characters.You May Be Disappointed: if you really just want more of the classic season 1 and 2 characters (none of them have large roles in this series), or if you aren’t a fan of shounen tournament battle anime, since that’s Vivid\'s main genre.Don’t Watch It: if you’ve never watched Nanoha before, because you\'ll only get confused and spoiled.

I do feel like this anime was to get viewers interested in the original manga itself, however they still should of focused on the anime's story and it's main characters progress.I like how they kept the previous voice actors for majority of the characters, it bodes well.Maybe they should make a second season (I think it would be pretty good for all those characters that didn't fight in this...season, to appear clearly in the next one).This series is quite different from the previous three, it's not as climatic (in a life or death manner), this involves more slice of life/competition within itself kind of anime; it's good however not intense.Overall, I do like where this anime is coming from, but it lacks in a lot of ways. So hopefully, there is a second season that has more episodes (preferably 24).For all those out there who are interested in this anime;- If you've watched the previous three seasons: go ahead, it's a whole new experience though might be disappointing for few. It's still a pretty good watch.- If you haven't watched the previous three seasons: this might pose a problem, since it's different completely different to the previous three, but if you intend to, watch the three seasons first. :) season, to appear clearly in the next one).This series is quite different from the previous three, it's not as climatic (in a life or death manner), this involves more slice of life/competition within itself kind of anime; it's good however not intense.Overall, I do like where this anime is coming from, but it lacks in a lot of ways.

Although, this one was handed over to A-1 Pictures. Which isn't that odd when you consider that Seven Arcs is more into the business end of animation these days and less into actually animating. Let's start with a quick recap of the prior series. In Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha, our young heroine gained magical powers and developed a serious crush on young Fate. Their budding relationship was adorable. In Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's, the two teamed up against a sympathetic threat. In the process their first love started blossoming into a...deeper and more meaningful relationship, which was adorable. In Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS, the two were fully grown, living as a couple and adopted a child together. Eventually rescuing their young daughter from the machinations of a nutter and his elite force of female cyborgs. Their relationship continued to be adorable. If there are two things I can predict based on the other series they're that Nanoha and Fate will have an adorable relationship and the transformation sequences are going to be awful. Let's see if those patterns continue to hold up with Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid.Story:Vivid takes place four years after Strikers and follows ten year old Vivio as she practices her martial arts under the tutelage of Nove, one of the reformed cyborgs, alongside her two best friends, Corona and Rio. The three are quickly joined by a fourth student, Einhald Stratos, whom Nove invites in order to guide. Vivio is instantly enamoured with Einhald in a way that's somewhat reminiscent of how her moms were when they met. The four participate in a mock battle with most of the main cast from Strikers, minus Hayate and her guardian knights. Lutecia and Nove use the opportunity to tell Einhald about the Inter-Middle tournament for young mages. She agrees to enter, encouraged by Vivio. The rest of the series is about Vivio, Corona, Rio and Einhald preparing themselves for and facing the first few rounds of the tournament.The biggest issue with this one is that it has no real stakes. In the prior three series, there was something major and important that the characters were fighting for. Including Vivio's life in the last series. In this one, we're primarily following four kids who are competing in a tournament. Even if they lose they can compete again next year and lose nothing important. There's no real tension from the plot as a result. About the most tension we get is over whether or not Vivio will confess her feelings to Einhald. The plot itself is also one we've seen before, a lot, usually as part of a bigger work but sometimes by itself like this. At this point, it's quite a banal spectacle. The series also suffers from some gratuitous fan-service scenes because when your main characters are ten you really need those. Way to keep it classy, A-1 and/or manga writer Tsuzuki Masaki.That being said, the story does flow from one narrative point to another really effectively and, even though it is a standard plot, it's well told. There are lots of good slice of life moments. Both with the Takamachi family and with Vivio and her friends and it is interesting to see what became of the reformed combat cyborgs. I also appreciate that they didn't try to force a more serious situation and have Nanoha and Fate inexplicably absent or beaten in order to let Vivio take the lead.Characters:The characters are still a strength of the series. We don't see as much of a focus on Nanoha, Fate and their comrades but they're still strong characters. The new characters we get are fleshed out well and get some development. Even their major opponents in the tournament have enough to them to give them a good level of verisimilitude. The interactions are Vivid's biggest strength. The dynamics amongst these characters are really well done whether the mentor relationship between Nove and the girls, the familial stuff between Vivio and her moms, the sapphic tension or just the friendly relationships. They're all really good.Art:Well, I was right about the transformation sequences. They're still terrible, lovingly outlining all the contours. The artwork also suffers from gratuitous fan-service, some of which involves ten year old girls. Even some of the designs suffer from being fan-service based. Like Sister Chantez and her battle habit complete with under-boob. She's fourteen, by the way. Far too young to be showing under-boob. That being said, most of the character designs are really good and don't do that. The action scenes are almost really good, except that the crass  fan-service rears its ugly head and a lot of the action sequences result in the girls getting their clothes torn in a way that's supposed to be sexy. Remember last series where they fought for their lives and, somehow, kept their clothes largely intact? Why exactly is it that they can't manage that when having sparring matches? I get the feeling that the answer involves despicable art direction.Sound:The performances remain stellar. Saito Chiwa gives a really strong one as Nove, also as Subaru but Subaru has less of a role in this series. Mizuhashi Kaori, Noto Mamiko, Fukuen Misato and Kitamura Eri all do excellent vocal work as our main four. The music is also really good, suiting the series perfectly.Ho-yay:There's a lot. In addition to our NanoFate moments, Subaru and Teana still appear to be an item but the main focus is on Vivio and Einhald. The two of them aren't really as adorable as Nanoha and Fate were in prior series, but they get a lot of good moments and their blossoming love is really cute. There's also an episode where Sein does something that's completely uncool, but still homo-erotic.Final Thoughts:Vivid is the weakest instalment in this franchise yet. That isn't to say it's bad, it has a lot of strong moments, excellent characters and great sound, but the narrative itself is a lot weaker than prior instalments and it really suffers from the crass and gratuitous fan-service. So, while still a good series, it's not a superb one. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week I'll end the year with a look at Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. deeper and more meaningful relationship, which was adorable.

In many aspects, it is very different from the previous seasons; however, when viewed as something independent, rather than another part of the ongoing story, I find it quite appealing.Where the old series explores such themes as child abuse, usage of children in terrorism and human experiments; ViVid deals with a sport instead. Whereas the old Nanoha is dark and tense, ViVid is much more lighthearted and optimistic. While in previous installments Nanoha was an important character integral to the story; in ViVid she is only a housewife in the background.For many,...such a drastic change was unwelcome, and I can understand this standpoint: the people came here expecting to see another season of -Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha-, but instead they were given this.However, for this review, let\'s imagine that these four words were never a part of the series\' title; and talk about -ViVid- as a story of its own.The main story doesn\'t present us with anything groundbreaking, but I haven\'t noticed any significant flaws either, aside from the less than perfect placement of the season boundary. The Belkan side story is interesting to me, and it adds flavor to the Nanoha lore; so I rate it as very good.I am not a very good judge of art and sound since I only notice when they are obnoxiously bad. I did not notice such things in ViVid, if you wonder.Characters are likeable. Their development is smooth, and follows the causes behind it.As for the enjoyment, I personally liked this series better than the actual Nanoha ones. Due to several things, such as notoriously bad English of the devices or less than reasonable actions of characters, especially villains, made them seem more like ""narm"" than actual tragedy to me. ViVid avoids that entirely, and that made me enjoy its story much more. such a drastic change was unwelcome, and I can understand this standpoint: the people came here expecting to see another season of -Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha-, but instead they were given this.However, for this review, let\'s imagine that these four words were never a part of the series\' title; and talk about -ViVid- as a story of its own.The main story doesn\'t present us with anything groundbreaking, but I haven\'t noticed any significant flaws either, aside from the less than perfect placement of the season boundary.

And unfortunately – after finishing the anime – I can definitely see why.Story – 7/10After the emotional finale of StrikerS, I thought to myself where can the story go next? We have seen Nanoha and Fate’s journey throughout their childhood, adolescence and currently, their lives as young adults. What is the next step in their journey? Why raising their daughter to become a mage!This is the plot of Vivid in its entirety, except the focus isn’t placed on Nanoha and Fate,...but instead on their daughter, Vivio. We follow Vivio and her friends on their quest to become the best mages throughout the multiverse, by attempting to win a tournament, filled with colorful faces new and old. If you have ever watched any shounen anime with a tournament arc, Vivid probably has the same exact plot. Before the tournament starts we get to see Vivio and her friends train in their respective martial arts / magical abilities. This is one of the aspects I love about the Nanoha universe, as the characters fight with a combination of physical and magical abilities, with characters being proficient at either one or both. We get to see some slice of life aspects during the run of the anime, but unfortunately they feel out of place in the overall plot of the anime. Also there is no prominent villain this season, mainly because the focus of the series is a competitive tournament arc. The main highlight in the plot was the fight between Einheart and Carona, as that fight was equally parts strategic and skillful.Does the anime have a fantastic plot? No, but after all it’s more Nanoha and I that is something I can never complain about.Art – 6.5/10I don’t want to complain about A1 Pictures any more than I have in the past. I have found them notoriously guilty of neglecting the overall quality of an anime whenever they believe it isn’t going to sell well, which makes complete sense from a business perspective but as a fan of the series, I get annoyed when a series with potential gets neglected in favor of another bland and tasteless isekai. My biggest problem with the animation is that the overall quality is really average when compared to other modern anime series. This isn’t just the case of a studio with a tiny budget, as the SAO money would probably allow them to create their own independent nation. Overall, everything regarding Vivid’s the art feels lazy, from character design, to action scenes. You know that there is something wrong with the animation when the manga’s art far surpasses the quality of the anime.Sound – 7.5/10I really enjoyed Vivid’s soundtrack. It has everything I love from an action series. Heart pounding beats during action scenes and relaxing tunes during slice of life segments. The soundtrack might not be the most memorable, but it manages to get the job done and finally gets that sweet promotion it deserves. The vocalists who sung the opening and ending scenes are both talented and have a nice relaxing tone to their voices.  Voice acting in a Nanoha series is usually great and Vivid doesn’t disappoint. A lot of the voice actors haven’t been changed which made this fan extremely happy. There wasn’t a single seiyuu who I found annoying or mediocre.Character – 7/10Twelve episodes aren’t enough to make us invested in such a massive cast of characters. If you haven’t watched an entry to the Nanoha franchise previously, watching Vivid and fully understanding the series might be near impossible. The biggest problem I had is that not all of the new characters introduced this season had a backstory. It is hard to get invested in the trails of the characters when you don’t know anything about them. Vivio is a sweet girl, who has the simple dream of becoming an outstanding mage, alongside her parents, friends and mentors. Her friends are Einheart, Carona and Reo, all of which have their own individual personalities. My favorite character introduced this season is Carona, because her goal of wanting to prove she is a capable fighter not only to her friends and mentor but to herself. It is a simple goal, but it made her feel all the more human.Enjoyment – 7/10I would have really wanted to enjoy Vivid, but unfortunately the anime felt too average and lazy. All the core pieces of what made the previous Nanoha seasons a joy to watch are there. That unfortunately is what completely ruined the viewing experience for me, (other than the lazy art). All the elements are there, but it doesn’t manage to do anything with it.Overall -7/10Vivid is an average anime. Everything about it feels average in the truest sense of the word, as the plot doesn’t push any boundaries or at the very least manages to build on the massive Nanoha universes extensive history. Vivid should rather have been made into a long running anime, because adapting the first few chapters of the manga just makes everything seem much more mediocre. As a Nanoha fan I would recommend that you go and read the manga as it is a still on-going series.Thanks for taking the time to read my review! but instead on their daughter, Vivio.

Nanoha was great until A's. After she grew up in the subsequent series, the story deterred. I cannot recommend the story to anyone else at all.They're going to do the championship and then what? Nanoha is no longer the starring role (she's already 22 and unimportant - thus boring), it's Vivio. The story is poor. While all these fighting is enjoyable, I wish they went back to Earth. Showed us the normal life style again and then tell us another mishap at...the place with which she needed to protect yet another monster or even that her friends learned/found magic to fight with her. This series completely disappointed me - just like Nanoha StrikerS. the place with which she needed to protect yet another monster or even that her friends learned/found magic to fight with her.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryYou know.. it was somewhat boring and somewhat fun. From standpoint of previous seasons, this was a bad sequel because old Nanoha (1st and 2nd season) were serious and darker tuned with fun trademark magical girl spell circle Anime. From standalone point this anime was okay.But probably my biggest complaint would be that it was too bright and cheerful and combat became sport. And the whole Anime was about cute girls doing cute stuff and then doing some flashy magic and martial arts fights. In a sense...this whole thing is a fanservice. (cute girls doing cute stuff, nostalgia, magic, fancy battles, a tad bit lewdness etc..)Story is for most part non-existent. And since it\'s a direct sequel to the whole franchise, this would be also aspect that made me axe the score.✦Art&SoundArt was quite good, lot of cute character designs, great looking magic, well done fights sequences and overall art is quite simple and vivid.But hence the issue bringing 1st and 2nd season in the game. Which again I have to mention, an issue where more serious toned Anime turns into modernized generic/flat colored and artstyled piece of work. With a little bit lewd side fanservice, but minimal.Music&OST was okay, didn\'t impress nor dislike it. Had some presence, but was nothing special.✦CharacterFate X Nanoha, don\'t care what facts say from previous season. For me they are a lesbian married couple and Vivio is their lovechild.Anyhow, characters I did like for the moe-blob slice-of-life side of the Anime. They were cute and fun. That there really is all to comment. Nothing serious here, simple magic school battle fiesta series.✦Enjoyment&OverallAfter 1st and 2nd series things were changed too much and went in a downhill as the whole franchise.But as standalone this season this was fine. Cute, colorful, simple,magic circles were okay, magic overall was splendid, fight sequences were nice enough.Nevertheless it got modernized and kinda turned into less serious and more boring than the first seasons. Fair amount disappointment, still hoped the seriousness would continue. In the end I did enjoy it for what it was, even though I did end up fast-forwarding a bit some episodes around the end.To sum up. It wasn\'t as trademark magical girls and was more of a ""modern generic school battle magic fiesta, with slice-of-life cute girls doing cute stuff aspect"" this whole thing is a fanservice.

What this feels like is you're getting the middle section of a larger story, with no hand holding about what happened before and what happens after.

There's never really any story beats in this series that feel like make it so I should care about any of these new younger girls. They are superficially connected to Nanoha and so don't need to actually establish any emotional connection, apparently.It's also strange to see how wildly the genre has shifted over the course of the last couple seasons. It barely feels like a magical girl anime anymore. It's like My Hero Academia with mahou shoujo set dressing. It's lazy. It's boring. It doesn't even have an ending.

It's not the series' fault, as it genuinely does try to stay on-topic with what it presents and progress reasonably. The issue is that the series feels way too ambivalent to commit to anything at times, as well as a few other issues. Unfortunately, Nanoha is no longer the series it was when it started; Nanoha herself actually barely appears outside a few seasons, and even Vivio fails to get any significant amount of spotlight. You can forget Fate and Hayate too, Fate appearing...once or twice all season long, and Hayate only appearing a single time for a very minor scene. So, what's the hook? A girl named Einhart Stratos, who has the memories of a past lifetime and the regrets of the person who used to be, as well as his mysterious relationship with a woman.The first major issue with Einhart is that the show rather debatably ignores her backstory and developed lore, for better or for worse. Instead, the focus shifts to how it affects her current life without really delving into her past at all, aside from where the series used it as a plot stepping stone to its current situations. Instead, her development is used to show how she can adjust to her normal life, make friends, and hone her skills. ...Which is actually a great message on its own, even if it does come off as a bit of a deceptive concept. Despite this, her character is remarkably well-developed; it's surprising how well they manage to flesh her out despite this, showing how she copes with her past.The tournament arc, supposedly the main arc, takes a backseat and isn't mentioned for quite a while into the series, appearing somewhat underwhelming when it does by following a rather strict formula and not changing things up. I'm not saying it's bad, but it could have used a bit more creativity and thought. once or twice all season long, and Hayate only appearing a single time for a very minor scene. So, what's the hook?

This was before ""ViVid Strike!"" aired, so I was expecting this side story to be a one and done deal. I thought the idea of a short, slice-of-life that focused on Vivio\'s life with her two mothers would be both heartwarming and a nice change of pace from the darker atmosphere in ""StrikerS"", but it was less of a ""Today\'s Menu for the Emiya Family"" and more like a championship face-off, with an even larger cast, that have minimal characterization and are impossible to have any emotional investment in!⚠️ This review of Mahō Shōjo Lyrical...Nanoha ViVid will be spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersSince Fate and Nanoha are never really shown at all, only enough to give a nod to the returning viewers, the main ""yuri"" romance (the guiding light of ""ViVid"") is the flirty friendship between Vivio and Einhart Stratos! The little sprinklings of Corona and Rio are cute, but it\'s difficult to really have a stake in their characters by comparison, especially since Vivio was so important in the previous (""StrikerS"") series!Many of the characters that had distinctive personalities in ""StrikerS"" are shaved down and given off-model faces, similar to what you would see in the ""Kanon"" anime adaptation. I blame the difference in mood to the replacement in directors, Keizō Kusakawa (the mastermind behind ""A\'s"", ""StrikerS"", and the reanimated films) was replaced by Yūki Itō (※director of the first ""Granblue Fantasy"" adaptation).

Though I knew Vivio from the ""StrikerS"" series, there wasn\'t a lot of emotional complexity or intrigue to her character (until ""ViVid Strike!""), she felt like just another generic magical girl spin-off like Sasami Kawai (an alternate universe variant of Sasami Masaki Jurai from ""Tenchi Muyō"") and Illya von Einzbern (""Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya""), this character archetype is used so often, that I\'m sure that Madoka Kaname\'s character in ""Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica"" was meant to be a spoof of it.To condense the bulk of my argument against this series, if you want fanservice and magical, loli characters that know kung-fu, then this is a show that you might find enjoyment from. Regardless, it strays away from Keizō Kusakawa\'s ironclad vision of sci-fi, dark subplots, and technical magic at its finest.

Their collection performances (in the first two series particularly), are just that monumental! I would compare Ms. Tamura\'s role in ""Lyrical Nanoha"" to her roles as Michiru Munakata (""Uta-Kata"") and Io Euclase (""Granblue Fantasy the Animation""), though Ms. Tamura is one of the most versatile voice actresses, when it comes to the variety of characters that she\'s voiced over the years!

Ms. Mizuki is able to alter her glass masks between the abused, little girl to the fiercely, cold magic user in a matter of seconds; despite Fate\'s fractured persona, the performance came off as organic and natural, and nothing seemed forced. I would say that this was Ms. Mizuki\'s ""career-defining"" role, and the adulation and recognition that the character receives is well-deserved!

Ms. Mizuhashi has a talent of making the child version of Vivio impossibly adorable, while the adult version can kick some major butt! I would compare her voice as child Vivio to her roles as Michiru Matsushima (""Grisaia no Kajitsu"") and Akane Suzumiya (""Kimi ga Nozumu Eien""), because they\'re more youthful-sounding, whereas Vivio\'s older self can be comparable to roles like Mami Tomoe (""Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica"") and Miyako (""Hidamari Sketch""). Great job with the character!※He\'s in all the other iterations, too, but he\'s more of a pivotal character in the first arc.Mamiko Noto as Einhart Stratos, notable roles:* Karen Minamino, AIka* Fiona, Allison to Lillia* Mayumi Fujimiya, Aquarian Age* Felicità, Arcana Famiglia* Azusa, Azusa Otetsudai Shimasu!* Alice Gehabich, Bakugan Battle Brawlers* Saya Irino (""Black★Gold Saw""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅✅✅* Makie Otono-Tachibana, Blade of the Immortal* Takami Komoda, Bokura no ✅* Lilica Evette, Burn Up Scramble* Kotomi Ichinose, Clannad ✅✅* Satomi Anzaki, Dear Boys* Yukihime, Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera ✅✅✅* Jil, Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk ✅* Yuka, Elfen Lied* Mavis Vermillion, Fairy Tail ✅✅✅* Satellizer el Bridget, Freezing* Alex Benedetto, Gangsta.* Yukinari Sasaki, Girls Bravo* CAL-141, Halo Legends* Mitsuki Ikuta, Hit wo Nerae!* Aya Tōjō, Ichigo 100%* Ana Coppola, Ichigo Mashimaro (""Strawberry Marshmallow"") ✅✅✅* Rin, InuYasha ✅✅* Ai Enma, Jigoku Shōjo ✅✅* Ayano Satō, Joshikōsei: Girl\'s High* Neiro, Kaiba ✅✅✅* Aoi Kannazuki, Kaibutsu Ōjo* Kōta Oyamada, Kanokon* Fujino Asagami, Kara no Kyōkai ✅✅✅* Sawako Kuronuma, Kimi ni Todoke ✅* Kyoko Asahina, 北へ。 ～Diamond Dust Drops～* Emi Kizaki, Kurogane no Linebarrels* Nodoka Miyazaki, Mahō Sensei Negima!* Ōka Sayama, Manyū Hikenchō* Shimako Tōdō, Maria-sama ga Miteru ✅✅✅* Yuri Takikago, Mawaru Penguindrum ✅✅✅* Rin Asogi, Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne ✅✅✅* Anna Liebert, Monster ✅✅✅* Shizu Murasume, TO LOVEる ✅✅* Tsukiko Sagi, Paranoia Agent ✅* Inia Sestina, Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse ✅✅✅* Narue Nanase, Narue no Sekai* Akira Sakura, Shadow Star Narutaru ✅* Moriko Morioka, Recovery of an MMO Junkie ✅* Saeko Okuyama, Niji-iro Hotaru: Eien no Natsuyasumi* Haruka Nogizaka, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu* Ririka Nishizono, Occultic;Nine* Fūka Yamagishi, Persona 3* Tomoe, Queen\'s Blade ✅✅* Nayu Hasegawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅✅✅* Aria, Saint Seiya Omega* Yakumo Tsukamoto, School Rumble* Iona Urazoe, Selector Spread WIXOSS* Kenshin Uesugi, Sengoku Collection* Limone, Simōn* Matsuri Shihō, Sola ✅✅✅* Yuki Sōya, Taishō Baseball Girls* Noel Hiiragi, Tansu Warashi.* Aisa Himegami, Toaru Majutsu no Index ✅* Esther Blanchett, Trinity Blood ✅✅* Benten, Uchōten Kazoku ✅✅✅* Rinko Jerrard, The Law of Ueki* Masane Amaha, Witchblade ✅✅* Kotori Monō, X ✅✅* Hazuki Azuma, Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito ✅✅* Kaori, Yojōhan Shinwa Taikei ✅✅* Megumi Hasegawa, よみがえる空 -Rescue Wings-* Tiffania Westwood, Zero no Tsukaima* Kotone Sasaki, Zettai Junpaku♡Mahō ShōjoCommentary: Ms. Noto gives Einhart Stratos the same bright-eyed, ingénue-type of demeanor as Renge has in ""Non Non Biyori""!

I would compare this role to her other voices in ""Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse"" as Inia Sestina, and ""Ichigo Mashimaro"" as Ana Coppola! She\'s now known for playing mostly sexy characters, but her brief stints as more cute characters really worked for her, as well.

I would compare her delightful persona in this show to her role as Konjiki no Yami (""To LOVEる""), though less on the kūdere side — she still plays a character that is the trifecta of adorable, attractive, and a strong fighter! I would also compare her to Asuka Kurashina (""Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm""), because her genki-energy metaphorically drips through the screen. Ms. Fukuen is a great seiyū and gets far too little recognition in English-speaking countries for the fantastic work that she does!Eri Kitamura as Rio Wezley, notable roles:* Yui, Angel Beats! ✅* Koharu, Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman* Sawako Machida, Bernard-jō Iwaku. ✅* Saki Yūtenji, Bihada Ichizoku* Kagari Izuriha (""Chariot""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅✅✅* Saya Otonashi, Blood+ ✅* Anji Zo, Bloodivores* Mina Ashido, Boku no Hero Academia ✅* Liliana Kranjčar, Campione!

I would compare the role of ""Rio Wezley"" to her performances as Karen Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series, boyish and can pack a mean punch, and Yui (""Angel Beats""), single-fanged characters unite! Her pep and cuteness helps animate the series, with the rest of the girls! Great job!Conclusively, I would say that the most ""vivid"" part of this installment in the ""Nanoha"" franchise is the voice acting, the story is just your standard shōnen series... but, with magical girls and adult transformations. This would probably be a franchise that would air alongside ""Beyblade"" in a Saturday morning cartoon block, if there weren\'t so many sexual shots. I give ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid"" a 3/10, not the worst Nanoha show though, since I enjoyed it more than the Detonation OVA.Rating: ★★☆☆☆ Nanoha ViVid will be spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersSince Fate and Nanoha are never really shown at all, only enough to give a nod to the returning viewers, the main ""yuri"" romance (the guiding light of ""ViVid"") is the flirty friendship between Vivio and Einhart Stratos!

Their collection performances (in the first two series particularly), are just that monumental! I would compare Ms. Tamura\'s role in ""Lyrical Nanoha"" to her roles as Michiru Munakata (""Uta-Kata"") and Io Euclase (""Granblue Fantasy the Animation""), though Ms. Tamura is one of the most versatile voice actresses, when it comes to the variety of characters that she\'s voiced over the years!

Ms. Mizuki is able to alter her glass masks between the abused, little girl to the fiercely, cold magic user in a matter of seconds; despite Fate\'s fractured persona, the performance came off as organic and natural, and nothing seemed forced. I would say that this was Ms. Mizuki\'s ""career-defining"" role, and the adulation and recognition that the character receives is well-deserved!

Ms. Mizuhashi has a talent of making the child version of Vivio impossibly adorable, while the adult version can kick some major butt! I would compare her voice as child Vivio to her roles as Michiru Matsushima (""Grisaia no Kajitsu"") and Akane Suzumiya (""Kimi ga Nozumu Eien""), because they\'re more youthful-sounding, whereas Vivio\'s older self can be comparable to roles like Mami Tomoe (""Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica"") and Miyako (""Hidamari Sketch""). Great job with the character!※He\'s in all the other iterations, too, but he\'s more of a pivotal character in the first arc.Mamiko Noto as Einhart Stratos, notable roles:* Karen Minamino, AIka* Fiona, Allison to Lillia* Mayumi Fujimiya, Aquarian Age* Felicità, Arcana Famiglia* Azusa, Azusa Otetsudai Shimasu!* Alice Gehabich, Bakugan Battle Brawlers* Saya Irino (""Black★Gold Saw""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅✅✅* Makie Otono-Tachibana, Blade of the Immortal* Takami Komoda, Bokura no ✅* Lilica Evette, Burn Up Scramble* Kotomi Ichinose, Clannad ✅✅* Satomi Anzaki, Dear Boys* Yukihime, Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera ✅✅✅* Jil, Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk ✅* Yuka, Elfen Lied* Mavis Vermillion, Fairy Tail ✅✅✅* Satellizer el Bridget, Freezing* Alex Benedetto, Gangsta.* Yukinari Sasaki, Girls Bravo* CAL-141, Halo Legends* Mitsuki Ikuta, Hit wo Nerae!* Aya Tōjō, Ichigo 100%* Ana Coppola, Ichigo Mashimaro (""Strawberry Marshmallow"") ✅✅✅* Rin, InuYasha ✅✅* Ai Enma, Jigoku Shōjo ✅✅* Ayano Satō, Joshikōsei: Girl\'s High* Neiro, Kaiba ✅✅✅* Aoi Kannazuki, Kaibutsu Ōjo* Kōta Oyamada, Kanokon* Fujino Asagami, Kara no Kyōkai ✅✅✅* Sawako Kuronuma, Kimi ni Todoke ✅* Kyoko Asahina, 北へ。 ～Diamond Dust Drops～* Emi Kizaki, Kurogane no Linebarrels* Nodoka Miyazaki, Mahō Sensei Negima!* Ōka Sayama, Manyū Hikenchō* Shimako Tōdō, Maria-sama ga Miteru ✅✅✅* Yuri Takikago, Mawaru Penguindrum ✅✅✅* Rin Asogi, Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne ✅✅✅* Anna Liebert, Monster ✅✅✅* Shizu Murasume, TO LOVEる ✅✅* Tsukiko Sagi, Paranoia Agent ✅* Inia Sestina, Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse ✅✅✅* Narue Nanase, Narue no Sekai* Akira Sakura, Shadow Star Narutaru ✅* Moriko Morioka, Recovery of an MMO Junkie ✅* Saeko Okuyama, Niji-iro Hotaru: Eien no Natsuyasumi* Haruka Nogizaka, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu* Ririka Nishizono, Occultic;Nine* Fūka Yamagishi, Persona 3* Tomoe, Queen\'s Blade ✅✅* Nayu Hasegawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅✅✅* Aria, Saint Seiya Omega* Yakumo Tsukamoto, School Rumble* Iona Urazoe, Selector Spread WIXOSS* Kenshin Uesugi, Sengoku Collection* Limone, Simōn* Matsuri Shihō, Sola ✅✅✅* Yuki Sōya, Taishō Baseball Girls* Noel Hiiragi, Tansu Warashi.* Aisa Himegami, Toaru Majutsu no Index ✅* Esther Blanchett, Trinity Blood ✅✅* Benten, Uchōten Kazoku ✅✅✅* Rinko Jerrard, The Law of Ueki* Masane Amaha, Witchblade ✅✅* Kotori Monō, X ✅✅* Hazuki Azuma, Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito ✅✅* Kaori, Yojōhan Shinwa Taikei ✅✅* Megumi Hasegawa, よみがえる空 -Rescue Wings-* Tiffania Westwood, Zero no Tsukaima* Kotone Sasaki, Zettai Junpaku♡Mahō ShōjoCommentary: Ms. Noto gives Einhart Stratos the same bright-eyed, ingénue-type of demeanor as Renge has in ""Non Non Biyori""! Her character is so charismatic and mesmerizing to watch, her staple lines of introducing her name, brought joy to A-1\'s somewhat ""botched"" production of the show! I would compare this role to her other voices in ""Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse"" as Inia Sestina, and ""Ichigo Mashimaro"" as Ana Coppola! She\'s now known for playing mostly sexy characters, but her brief stints as more cute characters really worked for her, as well.

I would compare her delightful persona in this show to her role as Konjiki no Yami (""To LOVEる""), though less on the kūdere side — she still plays a character that is the trifecta of adorable, attractive, and a strong fighter! I would also compare her to Asuka Kurashina (""Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm""), because her genki-energy metaphorically drips through the screen. Ms. Fukuen is a great seiyū and gets far too little recognition in English-speaking countries for the fantastic work that she does!Eri Kitamura as Rio Wezley, notable roles:* Yui, Angel Beats! ✅* Koharu, Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman* Sawako Machida, Bernard-jō Iwaku. ✅* Saki Yūtenji, Bihada Ichizoku* Kagari Izuriha (""Chariot""), Black★Rock Shooter ✅✅✅* Saya Otonashi, Blood+ ✅* Anji Zo, Bloodivores* Mina Ashido, Boku no Hero Academia ✅* Liliana Kranjčar, Campione!

I would compare the role of ""Rio Wezley"" to her performances as Karen Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series, boyish and can pack a mean punch, and Yui (""Angel Beats""), single-fanged characters unite! Her pep and cuteness helps animate the series, with the rest of the girls! Great job!Conclusively, I would say that the most ""vivid"" part of this installment in the ""Nanoha"" franchise is the voice acting, the story is just your standard shōnen series... but, with magical girls and adult transformations. This would probably be a franchise that would air alongside ""Beyblade"" in a Saturday morning cartoon block, if there weren\'t so many sexual shots. I give ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha ViVid"" a 3/10, not the worst Nanoha show though, since I enjoyed it more than the Detonation OVA.Rating: ★★☆☆☆']"

If you read the manga you can notice the changes that they made (like how they turn scary looking monsters to hilarious CGI beasts).The characters are great, the story is weird and goes unexpected ways every episode. and most impotantly it's done by a passionate staff who add to the humour...with their shitposts. The Seiyuus performance is also great as you feel how much fun they are having with it.This type of humour might not be for eveyone though.

Not really, especially if you are interested in watching something quite wild.Let me start by saying that the cast in this anime is dominated by degenarate.There's a booze addict...woman, extremely horny and devoted dude,a weird cult leader and there's even a girl that willing to amputate her boobs cause she mistakenly think that the MC like flat chested girl.Also worth to mention that almost every single of this depraved characters is voiced by an sss tier,imagine having Hanazawa Kana,Yuuki Aoi and Takanashi Rie in the same project and not only that,they make a loli god that love to be naked voiced by akari kitou,amen to that, that's a fcking wet dream become true right there.I also wanna talk about the animation,the animation of this anime is pretty good,i can even safely say that it's above average standard for nowadays anime but then they pulled out a fcking CGI that almost as bad as southeast asian fantasy drama show from early 2010 and for god sake,that has to be intentional, ain't no way that shit is unintentional cause even if they run out of budget because they hired a high class VA,im pretty sure they can still make CGI better than that.The music is good,Akari Kitou done an amazing job on the ending and the opening song is so good that it can make the melody echoes in your head for a few days,also wanna point out that it's kinda weird that such a wholesome sounding song with a melody as soft and as calming as hymm you heard in a sunday school was made to be an opening for an anime as bizarre as this.This anime also contains a lot of scenes that would triggered some certain group of people in some certain social media that gonna write a 26 paragraphs essay about how much they hate this anime and fanservices and im all for it.One of the best isekai in this season, it's a hit or miss,some maybe hate it and despise all the charactes so much but some maybe already fall in love with Mitama.Give it a try! woman, extremely horny and devoted dude,a weird cult leader and there's even a girl that willing to amputate her boobs cause she mistakenly think that the MC like flat chested girl.Also worth to mention that almost every single of this depraved characters is voiced by an sss tier,imagine having Hanazawa Kana,Yuuki Aoi and Takanashi Rie in the same project and not only that,they make a loli god that love to be naked voiced by akari kitou,amen to that, that's a fcking wet dream become true right there.I also wanna talk about the animation,the animation of this anime is pretty good,i can even safely say that it's above average standard for nowadays anime but then they pulled out a fcking CGI that almost as bad as southeast asian fantasy drama show from early 2010 and for god sake,that has to be intentional, ain't no way that shit is unintentional cause even if they run out of budget because they hired a high class VA,im pretty sure they can still make CGI better than that.The music is good,Akari Kitou done an amazing job on the ending and the opening song is so good that it can make the melody echoes in your head for a few days,also wanna point out that it's kinda weird that such a wholesome sounding song with a melody as soft and as calming as hymm you heard in a sunday school was made to be an opening for an anime as bizarre as this.This anime also contains a lot of scenes that would triggered some certain group of people in some certain social media that gonna write a 26 paragraphs essay about how much they hate this anime and fanservices and im all for it.One of the best isekai in this season, it's a hit or miss,some maybe hate it and despise all the charactes so much but some maybe already fall in love with Mitama.Give it a try!"", ""Holy Cow!

The main character, Yukito, is a complex and fascinating figure whose journey to find meaning and purpose in a godless world is both heart-wrenching and inspiring.One of the standout aspects of KamiKatsu is the quality of its animation, which is...simply breathtaking.

I feel like I\'ve been trolled by this show. At first, I thought, ""There\'s no way this CGI can be any worse than this,"" and then I watched episode 4. I felt defeated. There\'s no way they didn\'t do this on purpose. It has to be intentional. The studio has to be on some kind of drug to have produced such a masterpiece like this. They know they can do good CGI when they want to, its proven by episode 4 that they can do a good CGI. CGI aside,...the comedy is basically a shitposting and a good one at it. Other than that, the mc basically has no any OP ability well ofc except that loli god.TL;DR: It\'s a shitposting in anime form. the comedy is basically a shitposting and a good one at it.

Aoi Akashiro is a genius, and that says it all. If you\'re a fan of unpredictable plot, unexpected twists and turns, you\'ve come to the right place.I\'ll start my second paragraph by repeating: Aoi Akashiro is a genius. You don\'t believe in God? Are you an atheist? Are you a scientist? After watching this anime, you will discard your ridiculous principles, because there is a goddess here - LOLI! Even if you\'re not an atheist, why worship all sorts of Buddhas, Poseidons,...Zeus (what\'s in fashion now), if you can worship LOLI? One Lola goddess and the population of the entire globe will be converted to monotheism.The protagonist, Yukito, finds himself in a world where, left behind in a village, he realizes that none of the inhabitants know the word ""god."" However, it is time to find out, as we have an evil empire that wants to destroy the village for unexplained reasons.

In a way, the anime makes fun of many things, but not all viewers understood that and therefore gave it a low rating.Well, I recommend this anime only to people who like to laugh with all sorts of cringe-worthy crap like boob jokes, alcohol and various isekai things.

The world is at my beck and call!""KamiKatsu: ""Hold my beer, because I got drowned by my own family member passing on the mantle of being the next cult leader, and instead, woke up to a delightful handjob from a girl who doesn\'t know anything! Ah...jack and jerk off, like the pleasant guy I am...""In all senses of the word, mangaka Aoi Akashiro\'s Kaminaki Sekai no Kamisama Katsudou a.k.a KamiKatsu: Working for God...in a Godless World, is one fine unhinged work, made intentionally worse or funny (depending on how you see it) by debut director Yuki Inaba inputting CGI like it was a joke and then sharing it on Japanese Twitter to proclaim that fact, I don\'t know what to say. But in all seriousness, I\'m very glad that KamiKatsu (the short name form of the show) exists to dish out a plate of Isekai reincarnation parody that, aside from the KonoSuba spin-off of Megumin, is a breath of fresh air in the never-endingness of typical, boring Isekai works that we always get in each and every season. And I mean it, deep down in my heart, that comedy works like Tsuki ga Michibiku Isekai Douchuu a.k.a Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy, are what the anime industry sorely needs in a time where Isekai reincarnation shows are a dime a dozen. It\'s like someone saying, ""Shimoneta, but Isekai? Holy hell, this is another cuck fantasy!""Being reincarnated into a world where kingdoms and gods are well established regardless of good and evil is painstakingly stereotypical. However, in a world where a person reincarnates to see the exact same thing but without gods or religion, that is a frightening aspect. And for better or worse, that is the life of the MC: Yukito Urabe. He is the son of a cult founder who worships their god, the omnipotent Mitama-sama, and is chosen to be his father\'s organisation\'s next guru to participate in a death-defying ritual. But in an unfortunate sleight of hand, things start to go awry, and Yukito sadly loses his life through simple drowning, with the wish that he wants to be reborn in a godless world.Through sheer coincidence, he awakes in a world, seemingly reincarnated into a second life, only to find that he\'s been given a handjob by a girl who does not know what a dick is. And understanding things further, Yukito indeed lands in a godless world, but that\'s not what it seems, as people are being killed for their ""faith"" on the obtuse angle that death is absolute. And this, unfortunately, is worse than what Yukito would\'ve imagined of a world that\'s free of religion. To that, he responds to his God, Mitama, who comes down from Heaven like an angel, but is awfully weak afterwards because they need followers as their fuel. And in this post-apocalyptic distant future where gods don\'t exist, Yukito and Mitama would make this right by amassing followers to give the latter powers that would make him reign supreme over others.I\'m not going to lie; I really like the idea of being in a world where there are no gods or religions. Though it\'s not unique and something that the Japanese will consider taboo because religion runs very deep in their blood, it\'s fascinating to see through the eyes of Aoi Akashiro, one person\'s intent to make THE plot within a ""plot"", that despite the freedom of what people choose to do and/or follow, they are still bound to the same degrees of their limitations if factoring in the need for the reestablishment of new gods in a godless world.To say that Yukito Urabe got off on the wrong foot because of his circumstances is truly an understatement. He is a very rash character who wants demands at his beck and call, and in similar ways, I can relate to him being straightforward, but methodical in his approach against those seeking to have their own religions created and fought in the post-apocalyptic world. Such is the interaction with the isolated village that Yukito is home to, between sisters Alural and Siluril, and fellow residents Roy and Clen. First off, Alural and Silural, you can\'t tell me that they\'re pure waifu material for the people that they care about in the isolated village where rules are non-existent. And aside from their buxom bodies, Alural is the true degenerate of the sisters, having had an unhealthy obsession with Yukito since his first day appearing naked in front of her. Speaking of degenerates, Roy is the not-so-masterclass pervert and masochist of the world. Being unbashful and shameless about his pursuits of the perverted tropes, anything works for him unless he\'s convinced otherwise.And then there\'s Clen, whom Yukito thought, for once, was the closest to being a normal resident in the god-forsaken, isolated village. But Clen is only a disguised alias for his true identity, because ""he"" is a she and hails from the Empire that kills innocent people for their ""un""-lawful ways, which Yukito witnessed for himself as blasphemy. Coming to him as an Archon, Loki is one of many false gods who\'ve witnessed the calamity on Earth, but also has the power to manipulate events, more than knowing the truth of said Empire. Sure, there are others that are seen in the anime, like the youngest Archon Atar, the erotic cult leader Gohonzon a.k.a Dakini, and the creature summoner Gaia, as well as the always manipulated Empire commander Bertrand, with the sex-changing every so often, but for the most part, they are the antagonists that both Yukito and Mitama must face if they want to change the face of the world into their reign and oppose any evil that could harm the development of their ""religion"". It\'s THE plot within a ""plot""! How meta.Studio Palette is a rather new studio, besides the fact that they\'ve collaborated with Silver Link on last Fall\'s Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru a.k.a The World\'s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat, as the studio\'s first credited work. The first FULL credited work, however, belongs to KamiKatsu, and for the most part it holds up well, except for the fact that if you take in the liberties of newbie director Yuki Inaba and his staff team going all ""Bocchi the Rock!"" style with the 8-bit figures and downright horrible CGI monsters (that technically aren\'t a far cry from the manga adaptation of the LN), and that one infamous CGI tractor live-action-made-anime meme scene that serves to be the butt of the joke. If the episode titles aren\'t an indicative factor well enough, take the replies on Japanese Twitter that ""this is all a jokuuuu"" for all you care as a grain of salt, but this is too hilarious and meta in and of itself to be presented in a rather ""unique and creative"" way that only the medium of anime can do.Sound-wise, it is, dare I say, a pleasant surprise. I know; I\'m also shell-shocked. Rin Kurusu\'s OP ""I Wish"", besides being a pleasant song that gels well as a song on its own, with the OP visuals giving it a good spotlight. So, to unironically say that it\'s one of the best OP songs we\'ve gotten this Spring, I\'m not kidding at all. Give or take about Akari Kito\'s ED being fine to decent, but the OP really sells the show for me.When a show wants to sell itself to you in the category of ""it\'s so bad, it\'s good"", see it from two points of view: either that the source material itself presents itself as one, or it\'s the anime staff team that gives it that vibe. And KamiKatsu definitely leans more towards the latter. It\'s both a work and a show that you should and shouldn\'t take seriously, though it all matters if the message is cohesive enough for you to warrant watching. But if I can give a resounding message, it\'s that KamiKatsu is undoubtedly one of the best Isekai this season. It\'s wild, it\'s frenetic, and it\'s trollish, but it has a soul and a god to worship and adore.""We know we are not worthy. O great Lord Mitama.""

The best way i can describe is ¨Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas meets Konosuba¨. It is a mixture of Isekai, Dark Comedy, Dystopian Drama, Parody and Religion Critique that somehow manages to work.Without giving too much away, the plot consists of the usual isekai protagonist being trasported to another world (this time Truck Kun is innocent) and arrives into a harmless village in the middle of nowhere. Up to this point, your typical isekai format...however soon enough everything starts deviating from the usual isekai template,What you can expect is:-Good...2D animation (it reminds me of Prison School).-A lot of Dark Comedy (it makes fun of deep topics such as religion and fascism).-A lot of parody of the Isekai Genre (Lolis, Fan Service, the worst CGI i have ever seen which i think is purposely bad)-An Edgy Kazuma-like protagonist.-A story that somehow starts getting serious later (and it works!).All in all, i strongly recommend you give this show a chance.

I expected some unhinged dirty over the top humor and it surpassed my wild expectations. Here is what needs to be understood about the show. It wastes a lot of effort on Ending scenes of the show, making lots of different endings from 8bit art style to PSOne era 3d graphics and keeps shifting them nearly every episode. With that amount of effort it uses shit (and I mean shit) CGI as part of gags or hilariously bad edited videos of farming machines being used a couple of times, or 3d made monsters.

A genuinely fun and unique isekai. If you can make it past the awful CGI, you’ve got something very special on your hands with this one.Kamikatsu sets itself apart from other fantasy shows in a couple ways. For one it doesn’t have an OP MC. Yukito has to use his wits and ability to manipulate people like pawns to get ahead and survive in this new world. Fans of Tomodachi Game and You Zitsu will find similarities in all three protagonists methods. Additionally, the setting of the story is something I’ve never seen...in the medium. Instead of being a generic fantasy world with magic, adventurers and other JRPG elements, it’s a grim and eerie mix of futuristic technology and medieval.The connection between religious followers and power in the world is actually not too far removed from reality. We know that historically those with the most followers have been in control of society for better or worse. I really loved seeing Yukito and company try to expand their influence and establish a religion in this godless society. It’s something that you just don’t see in this medium.  Yes, your traditional fan service tropes are there , so if you’re squeamish about that, you’ll probably have a bad time here. I’m not, and it only enhanced my experience.Mitama, Yukito and all the characters are great in this. It’s genuinely one of the funniest anime I’ve ever seen. I’d rate it slightly below Konosoba on a hilarious scale. There’s also a surprisingly complex level of characterisation for several characters in the show. It may not be Fate level writing, but it’s good enough to make them more than just cardboard cutouts.The world is packed full of mystery or every week I had more and more questions about how society in the series came to be what it is. Every week we got more answers, but also new questions were created. The backstory and lore here is actually the biggest selling point for me. Yea, I love waifus and fan-service stuff, but to really hook me you have to have a decent story. This has it. The backstories with the Archons were also really interesting.Now, as I mentioned, truly enjoying this show requires getting over the God awful CGI that they have going on here. I genuinely could not tell you why they chose that style. I’ve heard some people say it was supposed to be a reference to early 2000s video games? Which doesn’t really make sense to me, but whatever the reason, it’s bad. It’s janky, not pleasant to look at and is really jarring as it’s often used in conjunction with the standard drawn 2D art. When they’re not doing the CGI, the show actually looks like. The characters are drawn really well, the fights have surprisingly good animation, etc.Depending on my mood and the time of day you ask me, Kamikatsu was my 2nd or 3rd fave show of the season. I loved it. It made Wednesdays such a joy to look forward to and I’m really sad it’s over. It’s one of the more original fantasy stories, has a chad MC and some really good fanservice. A no brainer must watch imo.Kamikatsu gets 10/10. in the medium.

I’m not, and it only enhanced my experience.Mitama, Yukito and all the characters are great in this. It’s genuinely one of the funniest anime I’ve ever seen. I’d rate it slightly below Konosoba on a hilarious scale. There’s also a surprisingly complex level of characterisation for several characters in the show. It may not be Fate level writing, but it’s good enough to make them more than just cardboard cutouts.The world is packed full of mystery or every week I had more and more questions about how society in the series came to be what it is. Every week we got more answers, but also new questions were created. The backstory and lore here is actually the biggest selling point for me. Yea, I love waifus and fan-service stuff, but to really hook me you have to have a decent story. This has it. The backstories with the Archons were also really interesting.Now, as I mentioned, truly enjoying this show requires getting over the God awful CGI that they have going on here. I genuinely could not tell you why they chose that style. I’ve heard some people say it was supposed to be a reference to early 2000s video games? Which doesn’t really make sense to me, but whatever the reason, it’s bad. It’s janky, not pleasant to look at and is really jarring as it’s often used in conjunction with the standard drawn 2D art. When they’re not doing the CGI, the show actually looks like. The characters are drawn really well, the fights have surprisingly good animation, etc.Depending on my mood and the time of day you ask me, Kamikatsu was my 2nd or 3rd fave show of the season. I loved it. It made Wednesdays such a joy to look forward to and I’m really sad it’s over. It’s one of the more original fantasy stories, has a chad MC and some really good fanservice. A no brainer must watch imo.Kamikatsu gets 10/10.', ""Since the first episode, i found this anime pretty interesting. It has a pretty unique concept. the 5th episode is probably the turning point of this anime. I hope more people will watch and appreciate this one. Hoping that things get better from this point on.The art style is good, not the best but good regardless. Not to intense but no too soft either, its fitting.MC is pretty cunning and strong but still a normal human (not OP). Some chara are strong but can't be considered op.Try it if you like trying something new. Honestly, i appreciate these kinds of unique settings...rather than the old bland getting-OP-with-no-reason-whatsoever isekai animes. rather than the old bland getting-OP-with-no-reason-whatsoever isekai animes."", 'Help me. HELP ME.Sometimes I really wonder why I\'m doing this. I write reviews as a hobby, I make Youtube videos out of those reviews hobby-wise (subscribe to me lol) but then at some point there comes a stage where all the fun I have writing, recording video and editing absolutely cannot compensate at all for the agony I had while watching the anime. And often I still watch the series through - but not this time.And the anime starts so promisingly - a guy is supposed to become the next leader of a cult and has been prepared for it all his life, so...he was tortured, so to speak. Accordingly, he has no interest in religion at all, especially when he is to be drowned in a final ritual. However, he wakes up in a strange, medieval world, only to get the strangest handjob ever and subsequently be castrated.Up to this point, the series could still be quite funny. It\'s a bit ridiculous, but with the right humor, even a story like this could be funny! No, no it wasn\'t.And I honestly don\'t know where to start.First of all, it\'s noticeable that the animations are very reminiscent of a visual novel - later they use really poorly edited, real footage. This - let\'s call it nice unusual graphics - you may still endure if you are interested in the story. But it was annoying to the maximum from the beginning.At first we have no idea where the story is going. Actually, we watch the protagonist all the time as he repeatedly falls flat on his face and embarrasses himself, even though everyone is actually always laughing with him, I really had to be ashamed of his stupidity. But then this stupid, illogical, funny little anime takes such a dark turn that I almost spit my drink in front of the screen. In the process, the entire atmosphere, the genre is completely turned on its head, completely killing the little bit of charm that this goofy, little, funny, silly anime managed to somehow build up after all. And the whole thing happens again later.Without spoiling much, the goddess that his father\'s sect worshipped now appears. She really exists and now the real plot of the anime begins: The protagonist wants to protect his newly won friends, who are now threatened by the nation. To do this, however, he must bring religion into a world that knows no gods, sacred, religion or miracles, so that his goddess becomes more powerful, because only she can save the village and thus his friends! He tries different approaches and does it in the end with a very nasty way that I personally would celebrate if the anime wasn\'t already completely dead to me and most importantly, he does it with a lot of timeskips. I hate timeskips.Let\'s move on to the two nice plot twists I mentioned earlier. How do I say that without spoiling? It turns out twice that nothing is as it seems and that the world is actually much darker than the anime has led you to believe so far - you know what I hate even more than timeskips? A ""the world is so nice and colorful and great and silly and happy (doom music (but in bad) kicks in) END OF THE WORLD; DEPRESSIONS; DYSTOPY"" - why start out so silly and then suddenly think you have to make everything completely brutal and gloomy and sad?!In addition, all explanations are missing - even if an explanation seems to be in the offing, it then suddenly turns out that it was just a recap episode and actually the biggest twist of the series (so far) remains completely unexplained - at least at first, I was so fed up afterwards that I abandoned it.In conclusion, I\'ll just say that the anime started out only to turn into exactly the type of series with all the elements I hate. These include:- Timeskips- missing/stupid explanations- plot twists that turn the entire concept of the series on its head- fanservice, which is not appropriate for such a dark storyline- stupid deaths (in this case suicides)- dystopiasI didn\'t explain all of this in the review, but I wouldn\'t have been able to without telling the two twists completely.Overall, this series is really godless - godless bad. 1 out of 10 sacred sites. he was tortured, so to speak.

The animation is frankly mediocre and lazy at times but at the same time, it\'s done so artfully that it\'s hilarious to me. It creates some iconic scenes such as literally every animal in this anime being depicted in horrible CGI and the infamous Mitama tractor scene which is just some real-life video with a filter and a character\'s face pasted on top.Although the humor is pretty cheap and won\'t be to everyone\'s taste, if you don\'t take this anime too seriously and just turn off your brain, the...sheer insanity of what happens in just one episode makes it one hell of a ride. It basically feels like a shitpost turned into an anime. If you\'re just looking for something crazy fun, I would recommend this anime.Beyond the bizarre nature of their animation choices, the plot is okay. It doesn\'t really have any logic to it, it\'s pretty predictable, and as you keep going, you start to wonder what Yukito is doing all this for. It makes no sense and actually, all the character\'s motivations are flimsy so this is not an anime to find some unique commentary on society or even a coherent storyline, to be honest.The characters themselves are pretty one-dimensional and trope-y, but the author has pushed them to the absolute extreme of their personalities which makes it entertaining if you like to see deranged people. Yukito as a protagonist in the isekai genre is honestly refreshing because I\'m tired of seeing the ""nice guy"" harem trope. He\'s manipulative to get what he wants but he just wants to take care of the people who treated him well, so he\'s likable. Plus he\'s not a pervert and is always wondering what the heck is wrong with everyone, the classic straight-man type.The opening and ending are bops. The JP voice actors are absolute powerhouses. It\'s not the same boring route as the other toilet paper isekai animes. I\'d say give it a shot if you\'re tired of the same old same old.

Eh, to be honest I\'m not really sure what to follow. Here we have another isekai, where a man named Yukito is reincarnated into a world with an ""end of life system"", a term meaning the government can kill you whenever they feel like it. He...meets some villagers, and tries to save them from their planned execution. Upon trying to do so, he meets with a god named Mitama, the only god in a godless world (heh, sorry). From there, uh, yeah stuff goes nuts. The story is pretty hard to follow, but it really adds to the chaos. Sometimes, the plot can try to get serious and can actually get genuinely interesting sometimes, but this sentiment is quickly lost.The characters. Not much to say. The main character is aloof to any sort of perversion, yet he is constantly making the world work in his favor, just because he can I guess. Mitama is much the same as Aqua from Konosuba, an idiot at times, and a turbulent relationship with the main character. Other than that you got uh, drunk bartender girl and her airhead sister, silver hair loli robot, forever alone dude.... yeah.The animation is disgustingly awful. The CG used is so poor that it honestly looks like a PS2 game, not even blended in. In one scene, they literally superimpose a character\'s head over a damn live action video of a tractor, like how crazy can you get. Even the base animation is not very impressive, but man is it quirky. The animation is all over the place, it perfectly shows off the chaos.So why did I like this anime? It\'s funny, hilarious even, straight up. It is quite obvious that the studio behind it didn\'dxct take it very seriously at all. They just pull whatever they can think off out, and somehow, it works.Look, if your looking for a serious anime that you can sit back and watch and feel in awe by the end, don\'t even bother.

I see more hate from the community that seems to take it more seriously than it presents itself. The story grows from a wacky/shallow, somewhat fairy tail-esque plotline into a story that's unique to the anime in its own right.The unique blend in 2d, 3d and 8bit animation work to keep that goofiness alive, even as the plot takes a darker turn the further you progress. Every character in the anime shows some type of growth, has some type of back story and the writers have done a great job of weaving that information into...the plotline in a way that doesn't take you from the main point. No one is apparently overpowered, in the sense that raw power doesn't guarantee or not guarantee a win in the conflicts presented.

Yes can sound like your generic isekai but this anime does dive deeper into what actually happened with the MC Yukito.The comedy used in this anime is Konosuba tiered as a comparison, with there being alot of people with different personalities, from Mitama the obnoxious cult god, Yukito who has a hatred for gods yet a tactical mindset, the people from the village who who're kind of oblivious with Roy being the most dumbest guy to walk the earth. And then the other gods who have different ideologies.

I know it won't be a lot of people's cup of tea, but for me this hits the nostalgic feel I have for the retro shows that were openly silly and straight forward about fanservice and made for no other reason than to chuckle at the absurdity.In an era where even shonen like Kimetsu no Yaiba or Tensei Slime, comedies like KonoSuba or Tomo-chan's a Girl, and every other genre forces fanservice in an unironic way, it feels very refreshing to see a show that reminds of the era where it was done as a joke like Golden Boy, for example.I...don't know how to explain it but back in the day fanservice (and harem dynamics) wasn't that common in shows that weren't outright ecchis that would focus on the whole harem and fanservice thing (Burn up Excess, or Agent Aika come to mind). You'd get your To-Love Ru type shows, but the comedies focused on their hijinx and the shonen on their plot.I don't know, it's my experience, and the rest of this season could be horrendously bad, but so far, I'm enjoying it tremendously for what it is. don't know how to explain it but back in the day fanservice (and harem dynamics) wasn't that common in shows that weren't outright ecchis that would focus on the whole harem and fanservice thing (Burn up Excess, or Agent Aika come to mind).

I'm not a conessieur with some refined tastes. I'm just someone that watches what garners interest in me, whatever it may be. And this EASILY did. So hell yeah i'd recommend! Just have some fun with it. Turn your brain off. Hell just watch the first 5 minutes of the first episode, and let that be telling of what  kind of absurdity is to come XD"", ""Horrible CGI, absolutely unhinged story writing and humor, borderline hentai fan service.I finished the season and still don't really know what I watched, but I want more.CGI is comically bad. Which is fine because it's basically a spoof series, and the CGI components aren't the focus of the story.The animation is also very simple, and combined with the bad CGI you can tell the budget for this show wasn't high. The animators did a phenomenal job of creating something fun with their budget.I won't try to rate the characters or the story because I still have no idea wtf is happening even after finishing...the season.I will, however,  say that Loki's design and outfits are really hot.Everyone should give this a try, unless you don't have headphones in which case you should make sure you're alone when you watch.I don't think this deserves a 10/10, but just because people are rating it so poorly because of the bad cgi, I want to try balance it out a bit because it definitely deserves a 7 at the very least the season.I will, however,  say that Loki's design and outfits are really hot.Everyone should give this a try, unless you don't have headphones in which case you should make sure you're alone when you watch.I don't think this deserves a 10/10, but just because people are rating it so poorly because of the bad cgi, I want to try balance it out a bit because it definitely deserves a 7 at the very least"", 'This show is a hilarious masterpiece. Despite the bad CGI, which some viewers may have misunderstood, it was intentionally done to create a humorous effect. The small budget forced the creators to go all out with the ""shitpost"" style CGI, resulting in an amazing and unique visual experience. Fans of the manga will notice the clever changes made in the adaptation, such as turning scary monsters into hilarious CGI beasts.The characters are fantastic, and the story takes unexpected twists and turns in every episode. The passionate staff behind the show adds to the humor with their witty jokes and references. The voice acting performances are...also top-notch, capturing the fun and enjoyment of the cast.It\'s important to note that this type of humor may not be for everyone. However, if you enjoy weird Japanese comedy, this show is an absolute goldmine. In fact, it might just be the best anime of the spring season in 2023, if not one of the best anime ever made. Aoi Akashiro, the mangaka behind it, is a genius, and their talent shines through in every aspect of the show.The world of ""Kaminaki Sekai no Kamisama Katsudou"" is a unique and hilarious take on the isekai genre. The protagonist, Yukito, finds himself in a world without gods or religion. However, he soon realizes that an evil empire is threatening to destroy his village for unknown reasons. With his powers and the help of a powerful loli goddess, Yukito sets out to save his village and bring about a scientific and technological revolution.Despite the initial laughs at the show\'s 3D animation, it is a work of beauty that surpasses even the highly acclaimed Ufotable Studios. It\'s a shame that more studios haven\'t reached the same level of quality. The anime industry could learn a lot from ""Kaminaki Sekai no Kamisama Katsudou.""While I\'m not usually a fan of isekai, this show stands out for its clever mockery of the genre\'s cliches through amusing dialogues, moments, and exaggerated facial expressions. It\'s filled with cringe-worthy humor, including boob jokes, alcohol, and various isekai tropes. Unfortunately, not all viewers understood the show\'s intention and gave it low ratings.In conclusion, if you appreciate offbeat humor, unexpected plot twists, and a fresh take on the isekai genre, ""Kaminaki Sekai no Kamisama Katsudou"" is a must-watch.

YES, it has hilariously bad CGI that looks like it came from the early 2000s; yes it has relatively low budget, but is it hilariously entertaining? YES, absolutely! Do NOT think of this as yet another isekai (there's a big twist about that); this is show is like an elaborate sh*tpost with a lot of raunchy ecchi comedy. Not all anime needs to be avant garde masterpieces, but not all anime needs to be generic by the numbers schlock either. This series did what it could with what little budget it had, and ended up...with appealing waifus, goofy characters, and an overall hilarious and entertaining story that still has a very clear direction. If you're willing to put up with a bit of raunchiness, I'd highly, highly recommend giving this a watch; if nothing else, you will be entertained. with appealing waifus, goofy characters, and an overall hilarious and entertaining story that still has a very clear direction.

Just the fact that I had to use 2 instead of the promised 1 should give you an idea of how, TRANSCENDENT, REVOLUTIONARY, PEAK, (among many other words) this anime truly is. If you are wondering whether this anime is good or not, here\'s the short answer - it depends. If like me, you\'re a person who isn\'t afraid to have a few laughs in fun and enjoy this golden dumpster fire, then this would undoubtedly be a 10/10. If you simply are coming in thinking that this will be a good...Isekai like Slime or Overlord, then you will be disappointed. But if you were to take my advice, definitely go watch it. It is indefinitely the best anime of the season, if not year.Plot: 10/10In short, it\'s an isekai anime about some high school kid who died and got isekai\'d. However, i have to applaud the author for his genius, as the way the MC was isekai\'d is pretty original. You don\'t get to see someone isekai\'d by drowning in the ocean with cheers from a much of religious oily muscular men everyday, after all. However, the story/plot of this anime is much, much, grander than that. First of all, I have to say that this anime is peak comedy; it isn\'t afraid to mock itself in ways that leaves the viewer rolling on the floor in laughter. However, if you remove the Ecchi, Comedy, and other ""anime"" elements from this show, what do you have? A story that explores the themes of governmental power abuse and how the oppressed rise with hope. The story even at some point alludes to dystopian novel/films about infertility such as ""Children of Men"" and ""The Handmaid\'s Tale"" (pardon me for inserting this horrendously exaggerative statement, but I\'m just trying to convey how truly beautiful this work of art is). I really respect the author for presenting such a real topic in an entertaining way. Of course, if you are looking not for plot, but for ""plot"", there are many instances of that as well. Overall, this anime\'s story is such a fresh idea, something rare for the isekai genre as a whole.Animation: 8/10Look, the animation isn\'t amazing or anything. In fact, there are lots of CGI, but hear me out. Honestly, with the comedic tone of the anime, the CGI doesn\'t make the anime bad, but instead elevates the humor, in my opinion. For instance, if you were to look at the CGI in Chainsaw Man or AOT, it isn\'t bad at all, but definitely takes you out of immersion for a while. The studio did a really good job, transforming what I presume is a low budget anime, into a modern masterpiece that stands in the hall of fame with other masterpieces such as Code Geass and Steins;Gate. Sometimes, you just need to learn to enjoy what you have. You can tell that the staff are passionate and also having fun in the production while watching this. This score is not higher, because although I say all this, the animation obviously cannot compare with the anime this season with higher budgets, such as Oshi no Ko and Jigokuraku.Music: ?/10Honestly, I wasn\'t paying much attention. But I can tell you that it wasn\'t anything special in particular. Nothing too out of this world.Characters: 8/10The characters are not like: ""OH! She/he just like me fr!"" They aren\'t really relatable in the sense, but you can feel their personalities really well. When even the comedic relief character seems to have personality, you know it is good. I don\'t have much to say, the characters by themselves don\'t really stand out, although their designs are really good. The main factor that makes the characters likeable is the comedic relief they provide.Overall, I gave this an anime an 10/10, because of how truly ingenious it is. But that\'s just me personally speaking. If you were to watch this anime rationally, I would say that the overall rating is probably accurate.

You can\'t watch this anime, and expect wholesome or deeply thought provoking situations to occur. The jokes get crude. The adult themes are blatant. the mash up of art styles (giant dinosaur like CG monsters, pixelated chase/run away scenes, live action backgrounds with anime characters in the forefront, the not-so-subtle censoring methods) is ridiculous... but it adds a flair to the absurdity of the KamiKatsu world.This anime is not for you, if the idea of ""mocking"" religion, and/or exposing the business of religion, makes you...upset. This anime runs on using religion and worship to gain superpowers and rule the world.This anime does a FANTASTIC job at not taking itself seriously.

Just when you\'re fully invested in the plights of a particular character, a well placed comedic break happens.Very well done manga adaptation! I felt compelled to seek out the source material because I wanted to see what the original tractor farming scene (episode 4) was drawn like. The fact that it had been interpreted and played out in the anime the way it was... was just brilliant! Probably one of the best meme moments in an anime! And with only a few manga panels to pull from.  The anime really hammered home how ridiculous it was for these types of machines to exist in the anime\'s setting.Every ""main"" character has a... special personality that make them memorable.

I can\'t foresee KamiKatsu delivering a series-ruining final episode, so I\'m satisfied with scoring it a 9. This anime has just been that solid for me.

For every anime it's different, some anime depends on animation, others on the story, every good anime has at least one thing they do really well. For Kamikatsu it's biggest strength is strange out of pocket comedy. Of course the comedy isn't the only good point of this show, the storyline and the characters are pretty well done too, I'm just saying how the comedy is this show's strong point. While some parts of the animation are uh... questionable, it more than makes up for it with the strange shit they throw at you. Despite personally...enjoying the show very much, I can't say it's for everyone. Some parts of the show take a really noticeable dip in quality, specifically the parts with the strange beasts.  Although I was able to look past those, some people might not be able to.Over all Kamikatsu isn't perfect by any means, not even close. despite having flaws this show is still really damn good.8/10 enjoying the show very much, I can't say it's for everyone.

It\'s literally a masterpiece.In my mind, this show will forever be pure wasted potential. Excellent sense of humor, immaculate joke timing, great sound design, perfect voice acting, oddly engaging plot, fascinatingly good characters, nice art-style, and surprisingly good animation when it wants to be. Half-way through though they decide ""Haha we\'re just an isekai ecchi, don\'t take us seriously haha"" DAMN YOU.1. The MC is a mess. Completely torn between being the cool badass sociopathic apathetic maniac, open friendly normal dude, and the distant dependable guy. If he just...picked a side the show would be so much better for it. He talks about regretting manipulating his friends (whatever his motivations were) just to manipulate his \'best friend\' into giving him power he needed to win at that point in time. And like, yeah, the moment is funny. They have the theme music playing and it just stops abruptly with him staring at her, it definitely was funny. And yet, it feels like missed potential, because what even is this MC? Yeah, I\'m not watching this to see good character building, but the show has so many great backstories and does some great character work when it wants to that it feels like a waste to have the MC be this way.2. The anime has a fascination with BDSM and shoves it down your throat literally every episode. It didn\'t bother me in the first episodes cause... Well shit, man, it was fun, plain and simple. The scenes were funny, short, didn\'t overstay their welcome and were surreal as hell. But as the show goes on, they turn more insufferable.3. The first 5 episodes are literal perfection. They encapsulate everything I want in a comedy. I literally have 3 scenes per episode that I deemed some of the funniest shit I\'ve ever watched. I also have scenes like Loki explaining her motivations, MC talking about religion as some of my favorite scenes because they\'re unironically just good. Then, you see cracks starting to form with episodes 6-7, and the show just falling off a cliff in episodes 8-12. CGI monsters the show knows look ridiculous are given really long scenes that try to build tension. Running away in a truck from that snake thing was I guess supposed to be a parody?

We got the standard ""realistic"" cynical hero, the power of friendship, the gratuitous smut (which despite being driven through the story like lead in a pencil it still feels oddly forced most...of the time) and the journey to discover the self and build a community.

The fact is I have never seen such anime with this particular genre. There are lots of animes where gods (most of them are weirdos), demi-gods appears, that\'s nothing new. But This anime has it\'s own uniqueness, where a loli god saves the main character \'Yukito\' from a weirdly unfortunate event. He discover himself in a world where there is no concept of God! But soon he successfuly establishes a religion (most accuratley a \'cult\') where everyone needs to worship the self claimed all-mighty (loli) god \'Mitama\'.One thing which bothered me while watching...the anime was, the character \'Yukito\' has a misconception between religion and cult. He (smartly?) describes that religion is a system where people are controled by other humans, which is not true at all. This is the main concept in cultism, which the writer surprisingly mixed up.Funny thing is, I have lot to say about the animation quality, which I go through points.1) First the animation is like 16min hentai clips, I don\'t know why but all the female characters are designed like a bunch of thirsty hentai characters.2) Bad job animating 3D objects. In the year of 2023, I am astonished to see how the graphics are so trash. The 3D objects like tractors, weird bull monster and in last two episodes the tentacle dragon (or whatever) monster are so werird it\'s like they just designed it in blender and then straight up dropped it in 2D animation. It was bad viewing experience where you see 2D and 3D characters in one single screen.3) While watching anime I was confused and checked unconciously many times that if I was watching this anime in x1.5 speed or not. Becase the animation is fast! I don\'t know what the heck was that, it\'s like all the characters are in a hurry, like they will miss the train or something!Bad animation overall. But in the case of this anime I am scoring it more than more than 6 cuz, it\'s fun and chill. Total comedy!I will recommand this anime to those who are watching action, romance, sports or whatever genre for a long time, rhey need to change pace for a while, nothing to do in life (currently), have so much time that you need to waste it, you can watch anime!

The critical viewer will ask: why would you????Yes, I know, the plot and storytelling are far from being entertaining. Visuals and dialogues are also quite bland. However, the concept is really interesting. This anime incorporates contemporary ideologies, philosophical questions and problematics, for example regarding the creation of artificial intelligence (AI), climate change, religion, science, and the mirage of the perfect world - a utopia. These ideas were used cleverly to build an interesting sci-fi scenario. A really interesting world where religion is absent and science has failed to meet acceptable human morals.Overall, not a great execution of an otherwise...great concept/idea. I am curious to see whether they have a sequel, and whether the sequel can stand up to the high philosophical standards dictated by the skilful building of this futuristic world scenario. great concept/idea.

The presence of rotoscoping in some parts also causes strangeness and tends to be remembered by the audience. Although high-quality animation could change this impression, the impact on the anime would be limited. This choice likely reflects a low budget, considering that the work's proposal does not demand such fluid scenes.It's understandable to have greater tolerance with Japanese works when they address religious issues, given the poetic freedom and secular culture of Japan. However, an anime that centralizes its plot on religion and makes direct and explicit criticisms...differs from works that only use religious elements or make non-generalized, subtle, and intelligent criticisms. This approach is exotic and delicate, sometimes slipping and becoming offensive. The anime portrays religion arrogantly, associating it with sacrifices, commerce, governance, sexual pleasure, musical expression, and an alienated family.The great highlight of this work is the plot twists, capable of surprising and altering established concepts since the premise.

It's the type of anime where you watch it because you don't have anything else to watch at the moment, or don't feel well enough to watch something else and pay attention, because with this anime you should unplug your brain and enjoy the shitshow. This is the case with a lot of animes since it's simply a form of escapism, but this is one of those where unplugging your brain becomes literal and necessary. That might sound like a bad thing, but I don't see it that way because sometimes you need to take...a break. I don't think I cringed watching this so automatically it's not garbage.

Despite its playful and lewd appearance there is a sinister plot brewing behind the scenes which generates the sense of unpredictability; This series does well to keep the consistency in mystery right up until the climax where it feels sub-par in its conclusion. Instead of focusing on the end of the season being a major milestone it becomes prime real estate to continue building its already massive character list with additional side characters. For what purpose does the story focus on the character establishment and development more than the narrative, I’m not able to discern but what I can discern is that there is potential for this story to explore more into the religious and overbearing law and order beyond what we’ve already seen.Character development and establishment is this series strength; It’s hard to disagree when each new character starts off with a high shock introduction whether its lewd, abrupt or blatantly offensive. Characters like Dakini, Bertrand, Roy and even Atar have traits that coincide with the extremes – so much so they can even be considered extremes in the sense of cardinal sins. They each deepen their characters through wacky outbursts and that keeps their relevance to the story especially a character with a concerning amount of slyness like Yukito.

Nothing memorable or significant beyond comprehension.Overall & Enjoyment: 5/10There was a lot of potential for this series; It did a lot of things different to your typical run of the mill fantasy isekai. The follower count was a good addition as well as the wide array of characters not just females, there were different age groups and genders that littered the world. Although it would have been nice without the gender bent Bertrand since that was a little disturbing. The lore was fairly deep behind Gaia, Loki and the archons and would’ve been nice to explore more in depth with the lost society more.

The show spends a lot of its time in dialogue with minimal animation, only to suddenly crank it up a few notches to give us some really messed up sado-masochism...or fantasy combat with some nice animations.Apparently they had a really small budget, in which case I must say I'm impressed, because I've seen shows that have looked 10x worse.There are no explicit sexual scenes, but they get as close as possible.

If not it\'s recommendable to watch that first. It\'s basically about a guy and his relationship with the student counsel president, which started by finding out their parents decided to have them married. Although the main series already lacked some story development/plot, this OVA has even less to add to the main story line. Also this OVA (and main series) contains a high amount of nudity and pervyness. For those who can\'t handle/ dislike it i recommend to skip this series (you have been warned)The story of this OVA is about a side-event with our...main character and his girl. The best description of the plot would be ""light-hearted"". Although the plot is very shallow, even for a 10 min episode, i found it very soothing and enjoyable. Even the awkward moments/problems were relaxing opposed to the stress/agitation some other OVAs give me.

Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/26351/Nagato_Yuki-chan_no_Shoushitsu,"[""As a fan of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, I won't hesitate to watch or read (or at least plan to) anything related to that series. Of course, that includes this spin-off, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. I read a few volumes of the manga and loved it, so when this anime was announced, my excitement was only doubled! However, I admit that I also had my concerns, as Kyoto Animation, the studio that worked on the original anime, didn't work on the spin-off. As it aired, I found that it wasn't received that well, either. However, that doesn't change the fact that I still...really enjoyed The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.Okay, so does anyone remember The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya? This anime takes place in the alternate world from that movie, where everything is normal and there is no aliens, time travelers, or espers whatsoever. Yuki Nagato is a shy girl who is nothing like the Yuki Nagato we all know and love. This Yuki is a member of the Literature Club, along with Ryoko Asakura and Kyon. Yuki also happens to have a crush on Kyon. Basically, the anime follows Yuki as she goes through her everyday life with the Literature Club and her feelings for Kyon develops.As you can see, a majority of the characters have changed. As I've said before, Yuki is now a really shy girl, and Kyon is kinder in comparison to the original. Ryoko Asakura is also different from the original; she acts as more of a motherly or a sisterly figure to Yuki. I wasn't really a fan of her in the original anime, and I'm guessing other Haruhi fans can understand why. However, that's not to say everyone's completely different. Mikuru still retains her character from the original series (which is a good thing, as I LOVED her in the original series), and Haruhi is still as fun of a character as ever. Even so, even the characters whose personalities have changed were still fun to watch, although I can't deny that they're still not the same as the ones we know and love.The story is a good one, with lots of comedy and drama. The story is especially great in episodes 10-13, where the Yuki Nagato we all know and love is shown to us. The animation, I admit, is not as good as in the original series. What do you expect, though? It wasn't Kyoto Animation that did the animation this time; instead, it was Satelight. As a result, the animation is more bright and more cutesy, and it takes a while to get used to. It's not bad animation at all, though; in fact, Satelight did a good job with the animation. The voice actors also did a great job at reprising their roles, as expected. The OP and ED are great, too; I could listen to them on repeat without getting bored!Let's face it, everyone; The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is NOT a Haruhi Season 3. However, it's still a really, really, REALLY enjoyable anime. If anyone liked Yuki Nagato from The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya and want to see more of her, this anime is PERFECT for you. It's given me even the tiniest of hopes that The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will get an actual third season! really enjoyed The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.Okay, so does anyone remember The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya?

It was quirky, upbeat and had a trademark style of doing things that were uniquely its own. By itself, that might not seem like much of an accomplishment, but when placed through a filter with the countless other school slice-of-life titles produced after its inception, it becomes more apparent why it gained its popularity. Despite the anime industry being saturated with these dime-a-dozen titles...every year, the Haruhi franchise still manages to stay relevant by being one of the few to tinker with the formula in inventive ways. And like most things tend to, it had its fair share of detestable moments as well (8 x ∞), but regardless of that, it still had a distinct identity that couldn\'t be found elsewhere. It\'s something you don\'t necessarily have to like, but you can still appreciate it for what it did.Unfortunately, I can\'t offer the same accolades to its spin-off Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu ( The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan). A ""Spin""-off is supposed to take elements of its predecessor and add a new ""spin"" to it. In other words, it\'s supposed to do things differently from the status quo of the original series but still maintain aspects of it that connect it back to the parent story. While it was certainly ""different"" and a departure from the usual hijinks of the SOS Brigade, it had none of the charm or inherent value found in the parent story. In fact, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is the exact opposite of what I saw admirable about the main story in the first place. It\'s a spin-off indistinguishable from the mass produced yearly offerings that I thought Haruhi never fell victim to. It\'s a title that got caught in the trappings of its genre\'s tropes, which automatically makes it a title that many would not speak of or forget altogether in the long run. The premise that it had wasn\'t bad, but the actual product that we were given was far from satisfactory.Swapping the supernatural shenanigans and one-off adventures with a rom-com narrative, the story of Nagato Yuki-chan sees the titular character Nagato try to confess her love to Kyon, only for her attempts to end without fruition, and then they repeat the cycle by the next episode. There you go, that\'s literally it. For the 1st 10-episodes, what we\'re essentially given is your typical ""would they or wouldn\'t they"" scenario where every moment is ruined by the love interest in question or by a side character popping up at the most inconvenient time. In between these moments, they insert a lot of padding and fluff in the form of slice-of-life segments. This includes everything from your cliched bathhouse/hot spring episode, to your group field trips. If you\'ve seen enough school SoL anime titles before, this is just a patch job of all the overused setups, with the only difference being that the characters are from the Haruhi universe. I feel like there isn\'t a need to spell out the obvious here but just in case it isn\'t already clear enough, this is G-E-N-E-R-I-C. But like I said, it was the 1st 10 episodes that followed this monotonous cycle, after that point, the show took an unexpected turn and introduced a plot twist that brought with it much needed character drama, but I\'ll save that information for the spoiler section for those who haven\'t seen the spin-off yet.The story of Nagato Yuki-chan may have had good intentions, but the humdrum way it went about presenting it topped with the overused scenarios made it a tedious watch very quickly. It tossed in an unexpected twist for good measure, but by then, the damage was already done.The art and animation of Nagato Yuki-chan were, for the lack of a better word, basic. This can also mark the 1st real point of contention for fans of the franchise as they altered all the original character designs that helped to distinguish the cast into moe ladened ones that make them appear painfully generic. Change isn\'t a bad thing per say, but when the change is a downgrade from unique character design to xerox copies, that change can be very jarring. Their ""spunk"" was gone. The quality downsizing didn\'t stop there, as there was also a lack of detail placed in any given background. Even the unique shot compositions were no longer present. This may have been the result of another studio handling the show, as Satelight took the reins from Kyoani in its inception; a choice that might have been the first big mistake. With no proper use of lighting, no attempts at unique camera angles, inept understanding of color theory and no real distinguishable atmosphere developed, the switch in studios was one that really put a damper on a show that was already holding on at the end of the proverbial rope. The only credit I can offer is that they were able to capture the right tone for the latter half of the show.As if to add insult to injury, a majority of the cast felt alienated from the prior installments. Not only did they look generic but now even their personality is bleached. They were either rewritten or regressed in dimension, and some were also reduced to being used as nothing more than background decoration. Thankfully, some maintained their personality, like Haruhi and Asahina, but even then, they were all watered down versions of their former self. Nagato and Kyon took the lead roles in the story, and while Kyon still had his sharp whit about him, it was toned down quite a bit. His personality was altered to fit a more optimistic portrayal, which in turn erased the ""person of reason"" that he was always known for into a character that didn\'t quite fit the mold. It\'s okay if they wanted his personality to reflect better the more lighthearted tone the show was going for but his pessimistic outlook is as much of a signature of the franchise as is the yellow ribbons as much of a trademark style of Haruhi. Getting rid of it is like getting rid of a big chunk of what makes the character stand out.Koizumi isn\'t even given any screen time and felt like he was only being placed the show as a carryover and nothing more. Same can be said about Asahina\'s involvement. They were both there to fill in their roles but was never given any time dedicated to them. A majority of the cast was underutilized or not even relevant at all. Perhaps the most significant change is that of Nagato\'s, and quite frank, it\'s the most grating. While the intention was for her to be an alternative story-line version to that of the movie, her personality makes a complete 180 if compared to the original and his grossly exaggerated if compared to the movie version. She\'s no longer the stoic, calculating Nagato but a shy hyperactive moe-blob with a pension for food and video games. It\'s a huge juxtaposition from who she was and one I couldn\'t buy into.The cast as a whole was quite unappealing, and none of them was endearing or fleshed out. They were all husks of their former selves.The soundtrack was forgettable. None of it ever grips you and remained as background noise. I can\'t recall anything special about it, as none of it stood out. The only time there was any visible effort came with the piano ballads towards the latter half, but even that was run-of-the-mill for what it was intended to do. The opening and ending themes were skippable, with the opening being a typical J-pop song and the ending a somber downtempo one. The voice actors were all fine, the only standout that comes to mind was that of Tomokazu Sugita\'s, who played Kyon. His monologs were always a nice touch and through it, provided insight into the situations the characters found themselves in.***Spoiler Section****(skip to the enjoyment and overall section to avoid spoilers)So the big reveal that the show hits you with is that the old stoic Nagato from the main series randomly commandeered the body of the new Nagato of this spin-off, and while it was indeed an interesting twist..., HOW and WHY does this happen?The plot twist had no buildup, no foreshadowing but just came out of nowhere with no explanation and then it went away just as quickly with no proper reasoning behind it.

And if you\'ve been impartial towards the series thus far, then stay clear from this one or prepare yourself for a cringe-inducing experience.', 'Its amazing how slight changes in perspective can cause something that on the surface seemed initially disjointed and disappointing, into an emotional experience that brings a surprising amount of satisfaction.Like most, I went into the series expecting the enjoyably discordant storyline, animation, and voice acting that the original series and movie had. I was consequently confused by Kyon\'s noticeably different appearance and a number of other slight visual changes that I shamefully explained away by learning the original studio hadn\'t worked on it. The first few episodes made it abundantly clear that it was not ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", and finding that out...annoyed me immensely.However, as I continued to watch the series, I began to recollect parts of the ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" in particular Nagato\'s role in it. As part of that recollection, I finally realized, ""Ah... this is Yuki-chan\'s dream reality"" and afterwards everything clicked into place. The visual aberrations weren\'t unintentional, there was meaning behind the almost cliche variants of this series\' characters\' personas, and even the series\' romcom style, and use of aged animations, was used to create a traditionalized perspective reminiscent of Nagato\'s preferences that contrasts really well against the unreal and jolting, or Haruhi-like, characteristics of the previous series. With this new perspective, even apparently superficial references to the previous series begin to question which of the two realities (i.e. Haruhi\'s or Yuki\'s) is the ""truest"" one or had the most merit for existing. This issue could only have been seen from the original Yuki\'s perspective, and was briefly discussed in the movie; bringing it up in this manner in Yuki\'s reality neatly explains the logic of her actions in the movie while allowing Yuki\'s own personal wishes and motivations to remain at the forefront.If you watch this series because you wanted a 3rd season of ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", you\'ll be disappointed. However if you watch this series because you want to know more about why Nagato did what she did in the ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" then I think you\'ll be pleasantly satisfied, and glad that this series made it to air. Personally speaking, the groundhog hell that Nagato went through in the movie still prevents me from watching it again; watching this series softens that angst and brings even more meaning to the series as whole. annoyed me immensely.However, as I continued to watch the series, I began to recollect parts of the ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" in particular Nagato\'s role in it.

Picture it: Here you are with a bunch of fun, memorable characters who each have a purpose but you want to change those around to create something new. If that wasn’t hard enough already, strip away one of the major genres that underpinned the original. Hand someone some paper and a pen and tell them to come up with something new with that added rule. It would certainly leave them scratching their head for a while. I’ve found the anime that shows why that’s not a simple task.Nagato...Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is an attempted creation along that line, a romantic comedy created from the Suzumiya Haruhi series, with studio Satelight putting it to screen. In place of the supernatural we have a focus on romance. In place of Haruhi as the lead we have Yuki. The pieces were all rearranged on the board ready to start the game but then this anime didn’t know how to move them. It’s a show that relies too heavily on referencing the original series as opposed to crafting its own meaningful story. It’s all a big bunch of fanservice and if that’s all you’re after then there’s a few things you might enjoy spotting. But if you wanted to see some more creative spark or interesting developments in the story department you might walk away feel a bit sour.I’ll also end up doing something in this review I normally like to avoid, and that’s compare it to another show. Given the franchise this anime is inspired from into I feel it’s only fair I draw upon Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu as a reference. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu show fails to stand up on its own merits as a spin-off and there’s no better way to show that than by making this comparison. Note that this review contains minor spoilers for the original Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu series.StoryNagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is a story packed with few surprises. Yuki wants to tell Kyon how she feels about him but every time she comes close to doing so she falters in some manner. Rinse, repeat. You get to watch episode after episode of it. The presentation can be fun and light hearted at least. It’s not as if the show is ever terrible, but it’s never memorable. As I watched on I couldn’t help but notice there was a serious imbalance between comedy and drama. It opts for laughs over love on too many occasions, and there’s little to no complication in the romance area. If there’s little external forces to come between our pair then what’s there to keep it interesting? There’s the odd curveball though that saves the show from being a complete flop, which I’ll come to.More than the characters involved, nothing annoying me in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu more than its boring episode structure. It tells you “Here’s your Valentine’s episode”, “Here’s your beach episode”, “Here’s your summer trip” and the list went on. It was sleep-inducing. While there’s a share of Easter eggs to be found in these episodes that pay homage to the original series, sometimes clever and subtle, often that’s all they are: references. They serve little purpose and it’s like the writer was saying “Hey remember this scene guys? This was in the original series!” You have a laugh, nod in agreement, and then go back to watching droll rom-com nonsense.These generic episode set ups were still made to be exciting in the original series because romance was not at the forefront – it was a product of the mysteries and adventures the cast found themselves in. At least when Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu resorted to these stereotypical anime scenarios they came with that added spice of having to appease Haruhi. Even when the SOS Club were thrown into seemingly mundane situations you always had to expect the unexpected. It was a show that knew how to have fun because of that kicker. Here these same situations are used for nothing more than cheap laughs and with little to no romantic progression. When love is the theme, and you strip away the supernatural, things all come crumbling down.By the time that Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu decided to start being serious and start exploring the mind of its lead character I had lost interest.There was a serious imbalance in the way the show built up to its major complication. I was falling asleep. When the psychological drama came around it was like an alarm clock taped to my ear. I really wasn’t ready for it. Talk about a jarring tone shift. As jarring as it was though, I must say it was welcome. Here we are with not only some complication of substance, but also comes with one of the more clever throwbacks to the original series. It was the first sign of meaningful development for Yuki. It also changes up the dynamic between Yuki and Kyon a great deal. Dare I say the show even became somewhat interesting? It saves the anime in its run home but all I kept asking myself was “why didn’t this happen earlier on?” If you’re able to overcome how sudden – and maybe a bit ridiculously – things take a turn then you might get more out of this series than what I did. The ending is charming enough and I actually got a lot more out of it than I expected. While not entirely satisfying or complete, the presentation and references this time around were fun and felt useful.CharactersYuki obviously gets the big turnaround in behaviour when compared to the rest of the cast. Instead of the alien of few words, she is now driven a lot more by emotion. This gave her much more potential to express herself but watching her felt like a chore. How could they have made Yuki more interesting? Putting her character on a greater offensive would have been a great start. Don’t get me wrong, she really wants to make things change. She tries to express herself but you can guess how it always ends. It’s normally something along the lines of… awkward situation, exasperated overreaction then back to square one. You can find that one in the first chapter of “Writing Generic Romantic Comedies 101”. I wouldn’t be mad if Yuki followed the start of those guidelines but then actually took something away from her experiences, and learn to fend for herself. Instead it’s always mother Asakura to the rescue and Yuki herself doesn’t seem to take anything on board. It’s like every episode restores the status quo.Speaking of the devil, that’s all Asakura’s role in this series is. She’s there to pick up the pieces Yuki leaves behind and do everything for her. She’s more of a parent than a friend. I understand that this is another interesting tie-in to the original Haruhi series (in particular the film) given the ‘protective’ nature she had there, but watching it here is tedious. She had the potential here to play a much more active role in this love story but content to hang back to provide annoying comedy (hey look she’s pulling a scary face again) and repetitive relationship advice to Yuki.This may sound a little mean, but Kyon is just too happy and untroubled in this show. His best asset was his frustration as a result of the situations he found himself thrown into with Haruhi. He becomes just another generic anime high school male character this time around when left alone to his own devices. While we get the odd look at the old Kyon we know and love, it sadly isn’t the one taking centre stage. It’s unsurprising that some of my favourite moments in this anime came from his dialogue with Haruhi. It’s not a good sign when your main female lead can’t bring out the same level of engagement. All Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu will do is make you miss Kyon’s non-stop stream of amusing thoughts and inner monologues.Everyone else in the show just feels like they’re there to advance the story and take the group to somewhere new. They don’t feel like active players in character relationships, again just there most of the time to remind everyone what series’ spin-off you’re watching. Haruhi manages to steal the show away from Nagato quite often. I thought she was going to add a bit of conflict this story but I was let down with that idea. Everyone else isn’t even worth touching on.Thank goodness the original cast returned for this and helped to correct that somewhat. Tomozaku Sugita, while limited with his capabilities in this show, still gives Kyon that snarky edge through all his rom-com suffering. Minori Chihara actually gets the chance to put some sentences together as Yuki and does a fair job in a new role as the blubbering, timid female lead. You also don’t need me to tell you that Aya Hirano, as Haruhi, was excellent. I have to say that people have ragged on the character designs a bit too much. I actually like that Satelight tried to distance themselves away from KyoAni’s designs and make something unique on their end. Are they memorable? Not really, but they’re far removed from the worst I’ve seen. It’s fair that you compare the roles of characters between this and the original series, but it’s unfair to do the same for the art style.SummaryHere’s the big problem with a spin-off that changes up the dynamics and personality of its characters: The original series is crafted around the interactions and clashes of those personalities. Changing this up is asking for trouble. Now in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu the roles of these characters have become uninteresting and out of place. All the drama in this show is boring and everyone outside of Kyon, Yuki and Asakura don’t seem to have anything to contribute. I’d struggle to recommend Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu even to a fan of the franchise.If you could sum up the show you could call it “References: The Anime”. All it does is serve as a reminder that you could be watching its more superior reference anime. Granted, Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu never tries to emulate Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. It knows it’s only a spin-off. It goes for a completely different theme in its story but its execution was iffy. Pointless, meandering slice-of-life antics took up too much of the show. When it finally ditched them I’d come too far through the 16-episode count. It tries its hardest to look back of those SoL previous experiences and make them feel significant but it falls flat on its face.Score: 4/10 (Poor) Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is an attempted creation along that line, a romantic comedy created from the Suzumiya Haruhi series, with studio Satelight putting it to screen.

It tries its hardest to look back of those SoL previous experiences and make them feel significant but it falls flat on its face.Score: 4/10 (Poor)', 'It’s like something born out of a fairy tale story. Nagato Yuki-Chan no Shoushitsu (The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan) is no Haruhi Season 3. In fact, it’s more a spinoff taking place in an alternate universe where aliens don’t exist, Kyon seems normal, and Nagato Yuki is almost nothing like what fans remember her from the original series. As far that goes, this spinoff is more or less of a slice of life story that mixes in elements of drama, romance, and some SOS shenanigans.Based on the manga of the same name, the series consists of 16 episodes that depicts the life of Nagato...Yuki. Unlike the stoic girl that many fans remember her as, she is rather timid and shows much more human emotions than her Haruhi counterpart. Make no mistake though, she still retains some characteristics such as her love of reading books.As of the story itself, Nagato Yuki-Chan no Shoushitsu is very straightforward. We meet Nagato Yuki, the titular character of the show as she has an encounter with Kyon. Because Kyon isn’t like the cyclical self that we remember him as, he is able to easily make friends with her. Then enter Haruhi, the girl that made herself famous from the original series. And in this show, she is also shown to be kinder yet still full of energy. The first few episodes easily establishes the primary character cast. They compose of Nagato, Kyon, Haruhi, and joining them includes Mikuru, Itsuki, and Asakura. A good amount of investment comes from the relationship building. In particular, Kyon and Nagato shares some similarities and the two seems to be able to get along quite well. There’s also some very obvious attraction that Nagato shows towards Kyon. While the show isn’t entirely structured as a rom-com, it does highlight such moments from time to time.Drama also does come to play at some pivotal moments in the show. This is shown early on in the series as Haruhi gets into a controversial love angle between her, Nagato, and Kyon. What started as a misunderstanding degenerated into tears and sorrow. Unfortunately, there’s really not much to expand on the story development beyond that. It’s too simple and formalistic with a predictable outcome that anyone could of seen coming. What’s more is that Nagato shows her vulnerability that fans might not be able to adapt with well. After all, she was always supposed to be a stoic girl with almost a lack of human emotions. Here, she shows more human emotions than she ever did. In retrospect, the series isn’t very good at dealing with drama. It fits more as a slice of life series and attempting to craft drama doesn’t make the series distinguishing. On the bright side, the chemistry between Kyon and Nagato can be genuinely heartwarming to watch. It not only brings out the honesty of their characters but also shows how they can co-exist to tackle almost any problem. On the other hand, the show is sometimes overshadowed by Haruhi. She is like a bright and shining energy ball that just never seems to stop glowing. While the main protagonist is Nagato in this spinoff, it’s really hard to ignore Haruhi’s presence when she makes herself stand out above others. The plus side is that she isn’t a jerk that some of us remembers.At some point in this series, it will seem like a chore to watch. I had this sort of feeling early on when comedy on top of comedy is thrown towards the audience. While it seems fun at first, it just seems like dead humor. The jokes quickly become stale while doesn’t really add anything new for the audience to experience with. Characters also shows little change to their personalities until a certain episode. However, if you get to over half the show with patience, then you may be surprised. In one of the later episodes, the story brings out a side of Nagato Yuki that we may be familiar with. The tone of the show changes drastically for several episodes as we see this complex side of herself. Perhaps this will refresh your memory of the original Nagato as well based on her behavior. What’s more is that it also brings out the best from other characters such as Kyon and Asakura. It shows their care for a friend when they need it the most. Furthermore, I have to say that the show adds a bit of suspense that invites anticipation. While the show at that point still retains some comedy with slice of life elements, it’s almost like a 180 degree shift from the first half of the season. Sometimes, a shift like this may seem risky. But for a series that already foreshadowed some of the events, it effectively delivers. In retrospect, the short yet melancholic arc (episodes 10-13) will be an emotional ride.Satelight is the studio in charge to deliver art visuals. And for that reason, don’t expect the artwork or visual quality to be top stellar. In fact, the show’s character designs and setting looks only moderate with generic characteristics. Nagato Yuki also looks different from her original self although still retains similar clothes and her trademark glasses. Then, there’s Kyon. Some fans may barely recognize him at first until he begins speaking on-screen. On the other hand, Haruhi still looks the same while other characters such as Mikuru gives off the Ms. Fan-service vibe. In fact, fan service is no stranger in show. From the curious camera angle shots, bouncing boobs, and classic onsen episode, it’s safe to say that the show really wants to service the fans. And in terms of comedy, the facial expressions of the characters are almost endless. The highlight part of the series is the deeper development such as the symbolism of the rain and OP/ED song adjustments. When carefully examined, it really brings out a meaning for this show’s title.Surprisingly, the soundtrack is an important part of the show along with the voice mannerisms. In order to capture the new refreshing feeling of this spinoff, the characters needs to connect with the audience. In the beginning, it seems that they can do just that. Despite some annoying antics such as Haruhi’s overwhelming personality, the characters are able to carry the show and not bore the audience. Similarly, the soundtrack has a nice balance that changes from the casual and humorous tone in the first half, to a very melancholic and atmospheric feeling in the second. The OP and ED theme songs also reflects a good amount of this change. And in general, the music is something that can easily be enjoyed whether you’re a fan of the story or not.A show like this seems like a blast from the past on first glance. But in the end, it’s not much like so despite some similarities with the original Haruhi series. If you’re a fan of humor, drama, and lots of slice of life, then this show will no doubt be something you can tolerate. While the series does attempt to emphasize the romance context as well, it doesn’t work out right in the end. Let’s face the facts. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu isn’t really a rom-com. While the relationship connections are evident and the chemistry is charming, the drama itself is polarizing. On the other hand, the series does craft melancholy quite well. The shift from a certain mood from one to another of the complete opposite will seem like a surprise and keep you at the edge of your seat. And for a show like this, it’s what’s needed to keep it somewhat interesting. Yuki. Unlike the stoic girl that many fans remember her as, she is rather timid and shows much more human emotions than her Haruhi counterpart.

On the other hand, Haruhi still looks the same while other characters such as Mikuru gives off the Ms. Fan-service vibe. In fact, fan service is no stranger in show. From the curious camera angle shots, bouncing boobs, and classic onsen episode, it’s safe to say that the show really wants to service the fans. And in terms of comedy, the facial expressions of the characters are almost endless. The highlight part of the series is the deeper development such as the symbolism of the rain and OP/ED song adjustments. When carefully examined, it really brings out a meaning for this show’s title.Surprisingly, the soundtrack is an important part of the show along with the voice mannerisms. In order to capture the new refreshing feeling of this spinoff, the characters needs to connect with the audience. In the beginning, it seems that they can do just that. Despite some annoying antics such as Haruhi’s overwhelming personality, the characters are able to carry the show and not bore the audience. Similarly, the soundtrack has a nice balance that changes from the casual and humorous tone in the first half, to a very melancholic and atmospheric feeling in the second. The OP and ED theme songs also reflects a good amount of this change. And in general, the music is something that can easily be enjoyed whether you’re a fan of the story or not.A show like this seems like a blast from the past on first glance. But in the end, it’s not much like so despite some similarities with the original Haruhi series. If you’re a fan of humor, drama, and lots of slice of life, then this show will no doubt be something you can tolerate. While the series does attempt to emphasize the romance context as well, it doesn’t work out right in the end. Let’s face the facts. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu isn’t really a rom-com. While the relationship connections are evident and the chemistry is charming, the drama itself is polarizing. On the other hand, the series does craft melancholy quite well. The shift from a certain mood from one to another of the complete opposite will seem like a surprise and keep you at the edge of your seat. And for a show like this, it’s what’s needed to keep it somewhat interesting.', 'I had some serious mixed feelings about the disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan after re-watching the series, I decided to do yet another review. To begin, for starters and obviously, the show itself was unique. To see the Yuki I knew from the OG series turn into a klutzy, nervous wreck was a bit strange and somewhat amusing. What I did not like about that though is she reminded me too much of Mikuru. This was something I noticed a lot by Nagato\'s action while re-watching. It was like having a second slightly more annoying yet tolerable Mikuru around and it just didn\'t appeal to me....Something else that bothered me a little was that there were too many characters used in this show. It took away some of my focus on Yuki for the most part along with her development as the main character. This opinion of mine changed during the later half of the program though. At first I  didn\'t really think the amount of characters was necessary until I made it to the middle, no close to the end of the series. That\'s when it hit me that Haruhi, Ryouko, Mikuru, etc all have a bigger purpose (Kinda sort of.)Moving on, the story is actually quite simple, However the way things occurred, why things were happening the way they were, and the other events that were explained by Nagato (The real one) were a bit difficult for me to understand. I felt like I wasn\'t left with much of a backstory on why things were happening during the entire time watching Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu. That aside, the pacing of the shows events was great. It was as if they saved the best for last. The show starts off a bit ridiculous however it slowly but surely develops into something greater in time. Honestly, I thought it was much worth the wait. The ending, I must say was a bit cliche. In fact the characters say it a lot about how certain things that are happening in an episode seem like they are straight out of a love or romance manga. So I\'m going to agree on that. But overall The ending didn\'t bother me too much, it was still sweet and enjoyable.The music and soundtrack in Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu where pretty good, I (as I am writing this) cannot remember if they used the same original soundtrack in the Haruhi series but it still sounds great. There where a few tracks that I\'m assuming they added especially towards the end of the series which sounded pretty damn good if I do say so myself. Moving on, the voice actors are still pretty great. I watched the Japanese dub with English subtitles and it was pretty interesting hearing Chihara Minori ""Voice of Yuki Nagato"" change her voice from clumsy and nervous to serious and monotone in a few episodes of the show.Music aside, the artwork and animation done on this series is always great. Some scenes are of course done so well that I could really tell when they were going all out. I believe it\'s in episode 9 where our characters are at a summer festival,  the scenery and animation seemed like it was improved just to enhance the atmosphere. There are lots of moments like this during the series however this moment stood out a bit more.I can\'t say whether or not I would recommend this series to anyone. Personally I think it\'s both a great... no, decent tear-jerker and comedy anime. However in the end, it\'s just a little too out of place for me to actually say whether or it\'s any good or just so bad it\'s good.Overall I gave this show a solid 7 because it was in fact a unique concept with great visuals and audio along  with a decent story however it\'s too out of place in terms of story and timeline even if it\'s supposed to be about another character.

To watch this anime, you must be a fan of the Haruhi Suzumiya universe, but you must also leave any such expectations at the door. When you do that, then, and only then, will you be able to enjoy this anime. Somewhat. Sometimes. Maybe?Nagato Yuki-chan is essentially a “what-if” story. What if, in Disappearance, that world became canon? Or, better to say, what-if the world from The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was the true world?...How would things be different? While the titular Yuki Nagato was more fragile in the movie, the anime draws upon that material (as well as Nagato playing games from The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya) to deliver a character that’s different (for the most part, she's in love with Kyon) but not new. Despite being a different entity altogether (and even being written/drawn by someone else), Nagato fits in with the universe for being silly. Although it never reaches an intelligent level of parody like its mother series, Nagato Yuki-chan can be refreshing in how light-hearted it is.Thankfully the performances of the cast are great. The Haruhi series is famous for having a great sub and dub, and even though the original Japanese version has finished, in this age of simul-dubbing, we get to experience the original dub voices once again. The shoutouts here have to go to Minori Chihara and Michelle Ruff, the voice actresses of Nagato in both languages. Chihara does a great job of making Nagato meek and cute. Ruff takes it in a slightly different direction (since it would be unnatural sounding if she did that much high-pitched cuteness) and she focuses on the shy aspect of Nagato, with equally great results. All the other principal voices return and they perform with the same level of confidence and ability.It’s unfortunately, however, that all of the good aspects of the Nagato Yuki-chan anime can be described as superficial or dependent on the love of the original series, because the spinoff itself doesn’t have enough strength on its own.Easily, the weakest part of the presentation aspect of the show is its animation. Admittedly, however, it is tough to tell if this is because the animation is actually below average or if it just is worse than previous entries. Taken by itself, the animation done by Satelight isn’t bad. The only thing that jumps out at me is the fact that there seems to be a lot of white used, and all the scenes look brighter to an uncomfortable degree. Any other complaint, however, comes from a comparison to Kyoto Animation, the typical animator of the Haruhi series. This season, for whatever reason (probably because this is a relatively unimportant spinoff of the main series, or the cynical reason that KyoAni has no reason to promote Haruhi anymore), KyoAni decided not to animate this entry in the Haruhi universe. And while Satelight generally tries their hardest, KyoAni and their animation of the original series is often too hard to live up to. Anything good that Satelight does feels merely serviceable looking at KyoAni, and this is augmented by the sheer whiteness everywhere and the fact Kyon looks like a goddamn middle schooler.Character-wise, Nagato Yuki-chan is generally alright, but the implementation of Haruhi can get dicey at times. You can’t have the series without Haruhi, that’s practically a given. But Nagato Yuki-chan struggles to find the right balance of Haruhi in the show. Haruhi is the same person she’s practically always been: obsessed with the supernatural, eccentric as hell, and bossy to a fault. If she didn’t take charge, it would be strange. Often, however, the show puts the spotlight on Haruhi and her antics, when they need to take a definitive backseat. This isn’t the show for Haruhi to do weird things; that’s literally all the other Haruhi series (well, except for Nyoron Churuya-san). The show shines when Haruhi does something weird and it’s left in the background or used as an impetus for the principal characters (Nagato, Kyon, and Asakura) to do something; on the other hand, if there’s even a little more Haruhi antics, the show feels like a discount version of the main series. Even at the end of the day, Haruhi is just a hyperactive person, without many of the nuances that made her interesting in the original series.With the exception of Nagato and Asakura, who are rather interesting in their own right, all of the other characters are very watered down versions of themselves. Since Koizumi, Mikuru, and Tsuruya don't play as much of a central role in the plot, it's not a huge deal, but Kyon plays a strangely odd role on the sidelines, reduced to an occasional straight man gag. In fact, Kyon, the romantic interest, is thoroughly uninteresting in this incarnation of the series, which is a huge drawback.At the end of the day, despite it being Haruhi characters you know and love, despite the voice actors coming back, and despite the cuteness of it all, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an extremely generic, and often boring, slice of life anime. In fact, outside of love for the original cast of characters and voice actors, there is no reason to partake in it for the actual plot. Episode after episode is a slow cliché slice of life borefest that just makes you want a third season of Haruhi adapting Rampage. Beach? Check. How about a trip to Kyoto? Check. Tanabata episode? Sure, let’s forget the original series and give that a check. To this end, Nagato Yuki-chan becomes a discount Haruhi Suzumiya, often filled with annoying nods to the parent series without any of the edge, and even those who do their best to ignore this find it progressively harder to do so as the series continues.As a result, the smiles from the cuteness of the show just can’t outweigh the fact that the series is boring, generic, and derivative. The fact that these are well-established characters only goes so far, and ultimately, this would have worked better as a short OVA or ONA series rather than a 1.5 cour deal. Nagato being super cute, while extremely pleasing, isn’t enough.Story - 3 (Cliche, boring, generic Slice of Life and discount Haruhi)Art - 6 (Bias for KyoAni may exist, but still only adequate)Sound - 8 (Good voice acting but only Nagato is amazing; this is because of the blandness of the characters)Character - 4 (Nagato is cute, Asakura is elder sister like.

After the last episode aired, I watched the whole anime over the course of the weekend - After initially having somewhat mixed feelings, especially because of the art, I ended up enjoying the series as a whole. Please note that this is my first review, so it will most likely be far from perfect.Story:Satelight took the first five volumes of this spinoff-manga (which is set in the alternate universe established in ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"") as work material. It is basically...about ""how would everything look like if Kyon chose differently"" - Which is a world without any aliens, time travelers, ESPs and the SOS Brigade. The story mainly revolves around Yuki and follows her through her life as a shy girl who fell in love. Nothing overly special, but still enjoyable. As consequence, you won\'t find anything supernatural in this series and there won\'t be any crazy happenings like you\'ve got to see them in the main series. However, long-time fans who read the novels/watched the original anime series will notice a lot of nods towards it, among them the notorious ""Kyon-kun, denwa!"" which will probably strike terror into everyone who has seen Season 2. Those small nods were something I really appreciated, but still nothing to get extremely excited for.Art:The art is arguably the weakest point of this adaption. They switched the art style (which probably was to be expected, given a different studio was working on it) and the whole thing feels like a downgrade from the main series. Especially Kyon often looks way younger than he should and faces, especially Kyon\'s, look slightly weird at times. Once you get used to it it\'s not as bad anymore, but regardless of that, they could\'ve put more effort into it; Though the different style does suit the spinoff well.Sound:The original cast has taken over their roles, as it should be. The result of this is some superb voice acting with the VAs doing their best to make the characters sound convincing, which more often than not succeeds. Emotions are carried across well and it rarely feels out of place or badly acted. Especially Minori Chihara did a great job playing the shy, clumsy Yuki Nagato which is a 180° turn from the main series Yuki.The OP song ""Fure Fure Mirai"" (which is a play on ""Hare Hare Yukai"", the ending of the 1st season of the main series) is a typical J-Pop song, rather fast-paced, happy-go-lucky style. Enjoyable, but nothing special.The ED ""Arigatou, Daisuki"" on the other hand sounded great, being a slow paced song sung by Minori Chihara. I found myself listening to it every time due to how well it was made.Characters:The characters are very distinct, each of them having their own, vastly different personalities. The character development is mainly focused on Yuki and Kyon, however Ryoko and Haruhi also ""expand"" a bit over time. The other side characters are pretty much stagnant; that being said, there isn\'t all too much development over the course of the series, but it does exist.The characters themselves are quite enjoyable as it still feels like they have personality and aren\'t just bland.Overall:Despite lacking some more depth, the mediocre art and other flaws, this is still an enjoyable series with a lot of funny & cute moments. If you are a fan of the main series however, you need to make sure to realize that this is merely a spinoff and you won\'t find more of the ""classic"" Haruhi here. No aliens, no supernatural happenings, no sci-fi. Once you can accept this and start watching this with an open mind, it will be much easier for you to enjoy. If you don\'t, you\'re most likely going to dislike it. On the same side, people who want an overly convoluted love story with a lot of twists and extremely deep character development, this might not be for you either. Everyone else can give this a shot and will most likely get at least some enjoyment out of it. about ""how would everything look like if Kyon chose differently"" - Which is a world without any aliens, time travelers, ESPs and the SOS Brigade.

After all practically everyone loved Nagato in the original, almost as much as they hated Haruhi (aka a lot). There are just 2 major problems. 1)The audience came to sympathise with the tortured lonely Nagato of Haruhi\'s universe, remaking her into a girl whose only characteristic is being clumsy was stupid to begin with. 2)Haruhi didn\'t have a ""just bad"" response from the audiences, she practically got kicked out of her own show and the movie...had no relation to her other than the name. So tell me dear animators, WHY does the b£$%&  with Lucy\'s voice need to come back?! I thought it was clear by now, we HATE her. And of course unlike Nagato who got a total personality liftover Haruhi remains the same annoying overenergetic little f$%& that desperately tries to grab attention but ends up pissing everyone off. Actually make that 3 problems: 3) What the hell is wrong with the blue-hair\'s eyebrows?!Anyway as usual the (unbelievably boring) Kyon joins the literature club, with Nagato as a president and her friend Eyebrows as the second member. They practically do nothing all day and it\'s just Nagato playing games, while slowly (very very slowly) developing a romance... Which is about as interesting as reading the Terms of Agreement in non-EA games, considering Ky-on has zero personality and Nagato is unbearable while Eyebrows is just the onee-chan character. It was tollerable though! Without the b$%^h everything felt much more relaxed than the original and despite this Nagato not being the one we loved it was still watchable... And then of course the b£$%h arrived and everything returned to the original level of s%£t that we were this close to forgetting.About halfway through, the anime did manage to catch our interest. Haruhi was mysteriously gone for mysterious reasons shrouded in mystery that I suspect were described by ""ratings plummeting to the ground"" and Nagato returned temporarily to the personality we all loved from the original. Granted Kyon was still as interesting as watching a cabbage grow, and ms Eyebrows was still taking too much screentime for her own good, but the anime became enjoyable at least. The emotionless loli is back biatches! Of course that couldn\'t last forever and eventually we returned to our beloved swamp of stupid.Oh and before I forget: 4)What point is there to Asahina\'s existence? I mean, seriously, it was more common for the characters to mention that ""she has work to do"" than actually talking to her. 5)Kyon\'s voice acting... Plain awful, Asahina\'s voice acting... Unbearable (having to hear her in Wakaba girl is a challenge), Haruhis voice acting... You don\'t deserve to be Lucy you b£$%h! 6)Graphics were mediocre at best. had no relation to her other than the name.

The use of outlandish and bizarre science-fiction characters to create what an ultimately rather mundane high school comedy has a rather cunning, almost satirical bent to it which has allowed the series to endure far longer than most other work in the genre. But more than just being funny, the set-up also provides the opportunity to explore more philosophical matters from time to time.In Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu, or ""The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato"" in English the balance between the mundane and the philosophical is tipped slightly in...the former\'s favour. That\'s not to say the science fiction elements are absent completely, but it\'s far more like a traditional high school harem series than the original was: far more time is spent on typical activities than before. That\'s not all: some of the cast members have had their personalities tweaked slightly for this series.Yuki Nagato herself has a similar composure to the character from earlier series, being quiet and reserved, but now more closely resembles the behaviour of a real person. Her tendency to be quiet is no longer the result of a robotic mind but of shyness. She\'s also now a bit clumsy, no doubt in order to better cater to a certain kind of individual. Another character who has been changed is Ryouko Asakura, the murderous class representative of the first series. Her confident and slightly intimidating personality is retained, but is now concentrated on looking after Nagato. Her role is much larger than before too, in fact after Yuki and Kyon, she is the most important character in the series.Tsuruya, the green haired ball of energy is also more important this time around, while Mikuru, Koizumi and Haruhi have been relegated to the sidelines. This shift has changed the direction of the series dramatically and even though these characters have not been altered their limited presence has had an effect on the series which is even greater than the more conventional approach. If you feel sentimental about the original series then there is a good chance you won\'t find this series as appealing as the others. The same goes for those who dislike the cutesy, mixed signals kind of romance that you find in other high school anime. This is a recurring theme, particularly in the earlier episodes.But do not think that the series has become completely saccharine. On the contrary, this series raises far deeper philosophical questions than either the first or the second series do. Events conspire such that one character may be killed inadvertently to save another, a moral dilemma similar to the famous problem about an out of control trolley running down a hill. Though the set-up which prompted this dilemma are fictional, the ramifications of them are significant. The presentation of it is rather stirring too, and you may find yourself feeling rather melancholic about the whole affair when it\'s through.Speaking of presentation, you may have noticed that the art style is radically different from the series which were produced by Kyoto Animation, and more closely resemble the artwork in the original light novels. The change is slightly distracting at first but the relative simplicity of it is ultimately rather charming. Though the colouring could be better: embarrassment is signalled with a change of skin tone rather than facial expression, and it feels lazy.Mercifully, the original voice actors have been retained for this series, so no-one need worry about adjusting to a new Haruhi unless you watched the original series dubbed. The background music is pretty catchy too, but if you were expecting themes capable of rivalling the Hare Hare Yukai or Bouken Desho Desho you are going to be very disappointed, as both the OP and ED for this series are dreadful low-tier pop songs that have none of the excitement or fun that the original series themes did.But music isn\'t everything, and unless you are the kind of person that can\'t stand the idea of your favourite characters being meddled with, then overall this series does rather well. And fortunately for us, those two legacies actually can co-exist with one another simultaneously. the former\'s favour.

It was a disappointment in every regard.I\'m not going to pretend like the original series was a masterpiece, because it isn\'t. But it was entertaining and charming (exept for Haruhi being a bully sometimes)Everything that made the original series fun is missing here.I find Nagato the most interesting in the original series. She\'s so mysterious and kicks ass when it needs to be kicked. Her usual self and the version in the alternatetimeline of the movie are both endearing. So when i heard that a Spin-off with Nagato as...the central character was coming up, I was soooo hyped. Exept for the movie, Nagato didn\'t get much screentime which i found particularly unfourtunate.When i heard it was going to be a romance, taking place in the alternative timeline and saw the new characterdesigns I was less hyped but still excited. I am completly open to the idea of making a lovestory with that version of Nagato.It\'s just that the character called Nagato in this series isn\'t Nagato, it is a hollow shell of a character. The Nagato from the movie isn\'t that fleshed out, but she was depicted as a really shy, bookish, unsocial and lonley person. Instead we get a gluttonous, lazy, airheaded idiot we\'re supposed to find cute.The problem is that the romantic elements are handeld so poorly that I wonder why they even bothered. So the rest of the show is just SoL, Great! The original series was just SoL with some supernatural elements mixed in so this should be fun aswell right? No, this is the most boring, generic and unimaginative SoL I have seen yet, on the level of bad fanfiction. It\'s like they where checking things of a checklist, in order to include every chlichéd scenario.But if that wasn\'t enough it just doesn\'t make sense in context of the original Series. This wouldn\'t be really a problem if it didn\'t try to connect the two with forced, stupid references we\'re supposed to look at and yell:""Hey! I rembember that from the series""Plus the animation and soundtrack is ten times worse.There is absolutly no reason for anyone to watch this series. If SoL is the sand on the metaphysical anime Beach, then this show is a turd someone used to rip off a sandcastle. the central character was coming up, I was soooo hyped.

Why? Well, it has everything that would define something like it: ruined love confessions (check), misunderstandings (check), fluffy scenes between the main characters (check), an ending that doesn\'t round up anything thanks to some freaking fireworks (check).I expected a good resolution from this, something that would only be read or seen in fanfictions, something that would make my ""dreams come true"", but the series took the easy...way, wasting 13 episodes with absolutely nothing and 3 amazing ones to end with a ""you didn\'t hear what I said because of the fireworks, right?"" For an ending like that, I would prefer Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.With my hope at 100%, I started loving the series because it gave me what I wanted: more from the world of Haruhi and a genuine love story between Nagato and Kyon. I didn\'t even care for those 13 episodes of nothing because I thought that at least at the end, the series would give me a kiss  or a solid confession or something that would make me spend 50 dollars for the release. Hell, I was so wrong.At least, these series gave me one of my favorite songs im Japanese (i.e. Arigatou, daisuki, the ED song beautifully sung by Minori Chihara), more from the original dub cast, and 3 interesting episodes (with some little touches of Serial Experimes Lain) where we could see the Nagato from the original series.Yes, these series was a real disappointment. There are few things to save from this adaption. It was good at the beginning, interesting development at final part of the series, an amazing ending song. It even reunited the old cast from the original series. But no, I won\'t waste my money on something that ended in such a mediocre point. As I said before, I prefer Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun because it at least have some of the best comedy out there that would make me rewatch it again and again, without any care of the final.As far as I know, the manga isn\'t finished yet, so it might give me that ending that I expected since the moment I discover this spinoff.

So, with Satelight taking over the Haruhi franchise by producing us this spin-off, what are we as the audience to expect?Story (6.22/10): The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki, contrary to the rest of the Haruhi series, is very...different in its setting.  Taking place in the Disappearance world of the Haruhi universe, where Haruhi and Koizumi go to a different school, Asakura isn\'t a homicidal alien, and Nagato is a moe creature rather than a cool kuudere, the story follows our main protagonist Kyon as he basically...does what he did in the original Haruhi series, which is spending time with the title girl in the series.In terms of differences to the original Haruhi series, this Spin-off bears only some resemblance to the flow and plot points.  For the most part, the series focuses mainly on Kyon and the rest of the Haruhi cast in their disappearance roles, getting into various wacky situations without all of the supernatural business that goes on.  The thing that irks me though is the fact that the show plays out like a generic rom-com with many cliche romcom scenes that don\'t really provoke much feeling.  It\'s so reliant on this way of storytelling, that it really doesn\'t make the story all too entertaining and rather bland.  One of the reasons for this perception is because this show is connected to the Haruhi series, where that show is known for being out there in terms of...well basically everything.  Contrasting that with a platonic romantic comedy just sort of clashed.The actual content of the show has a couple ups and downs.  Because Nagato is now a shy, moe creature, the show uses that to create a lot of moe moments that admittedly are cute, but are used quite often and overturn the flow of the story.  But my biggest complaint about this show is towards the end where they create the ""disappearance"".  I\'ll be honest, that didn\'t really make a whole lot of sense.  The issue is the fact that they just throw it right in front of you and expect things to fall into place without really a proper explanation as to why what happened was happening.  When introduced, it was just kind of confusing, and when it ended, things just didn\'t make any sense, and when plot points don\'t really make any sense, that\'s considered a flaw in my book.There is still the upside of this show being part of the Haruhi series.  Throughout the show, the show references the original Haruhi in a vast amount of ways, even creating several plot points that have parallel settings; so if you\'re a hardcore Haruhi fan, you\'ll appreciate what they throw at you there.  (That goddamn endless 8 reference at the end...)Overall, Nagato Yuki had its ups and downs in terms of story.  Without any ties to the Haruhi series, I don\'t think it would\'ve done as well as it could\'ve just on the simple fact that it was a rom-com story that had no resolution.  (Seriously though, don\'t expect any ships to sail here.  They all sunk.)  It was a bit of boring because it just simply didn\'t try and go beyond what it was and it never attempted to create a resolution to the story.Overview:+ Haruhi references-  Platonic Rom-com story-  No proper resolution-  Some confusing plot pointsCharacters (7.01/10): Because this is a Haruhi series, the characters in Yuki Nagato are basically the same people that you see in the original show, just made to be slightly different.Up first, our main protagonist, Kyon.  (Cause apparently, no one knows his actual name and resorts to calling this guy by a nickname.)  Contrary to his original counterpart, Kyon isn\'t the fish-eyed bored person that he was back in the original series.  Rather, he\'s a bit more cheerful, a little more willing to have some fun with people rather than be reluctant as all hell on whatever heinous thing they\'re doing.  (He still keeps his wit, so that\'s a plus.)  While the show is based around his perspective with Kyon doing the narrative and all, his development appears only later on in the series when it takes a different turn, which is ok, but even with it, the show just sort of returns back to the status quo that it had at the beginning of the series, which didn\'t bode well for it.Then there\'s Yuki Nagato, the title character of the series.  As I have mentioned before, this spin-off takes place in the disappearance world, meaning that Yuki is no longer the cool kuudere who sits in the corner of the room reading books, but rather is a little moe creature who drools at the word Turkey, and appreciates vita games more than books.  Throughout the series, the show focuses on Yuki and her relationship with Kyon, as virtually almost every character knows about her ""little crush"" with Yuki failing (unsurprisingly) to take a step in the right direction to make her love a reality.  The thing about Yuki that I find interesting is what happens towards the end of the series where the show takes a dramatic tone change.  There, we have a plot point that makes sense in a Haruhi setting, but the show just doesn\'t pull through with it, leading up to the aforementioned half-assed conclusion.  It\'s not as if this development of her character is bad, because it put interest back into the series for me, it\'s just that it doesn\'t explore it deep enough to get a proper explanation, resulting in some plot holes.And finally, since I\'ve been saying her name an awful lot, we have Haruhi, who, because she is no longer the title character, is now part of the supporting role.  Compared to her other world self, Haruhi doesn\'t bear any difference in character, as she is still the hyperactive UMA searching, Kyon enslaving girl who just now has longer hair.  While the show doesn\'t specifically focus on her as much, she still plays a very vital role in the series, as she is the one who once again, drags everyone into her schemes and forces everyone to follow what she does.  For Haruhi, this is fine for her character.  What I didn\'t like was how they attempted to shove in a love triangle aspect to the series, making some very obvious implications that Haruhi sees Kyon as more than a manservant.  It\'s bad because there really is nothing else that the series did for that plot point aside from a few silent moments form her, so it made me question the point of it since they never went through with it.Likewise, most of the other Haruhi characters make appearances in this story.  Those characters most prominently being Koizumi, Mikuru, Tsuruya, and Asakura, who, like I mentioned before, is no longer a homicidal alien, but rather more like a ""mother"" towards Nagato, cooking her food, taking care of her, and the occasional scolding.  In terms of development or importance, everyone apart from Asakura doesn\'t get ample screentime.  They for the most part stay with what you would expect from these characters\' personalities, minus the supernatural stuff that Haruhi imparted onto them.  Because they\'re virtually the same, there\'s not really much to talk about since Mikuru is still Mikuru, Koizumi is still Koizumi, and Tsuruya is still Tsuruya.Overview:+ Decent Main characters+ Side characters are the same (basically)+ Haruhi is still Haruhi-  Some unnecessary characteristics associated with unfinished plot pointsArt and Sound (7.00/10): The art for Nagato Yuki was not created by KyoAni like the rest of the Haruhi series, but rather by Satelight, who created an all new style of animation that makes the majority of the characters (noticeably Kyon), a hell of a lot different looking than their original look.  The animation itself doesn\'t really stand out all too much, since it\'s just standard fare, but it\'s the characters themselves that have such a big impact since we, the anime community, are familiar with seeing these characters a certain way.Whether or not you\'re a fan of this style of animation is up to you, so I can\'t say anything else beyond the fact that there\'s ups and downs with the new look of them all.  All I can say is, get used to seeing life in Kyon\'s eyes.In terms of sound, the show has an OP that bears in some resemblance to the style of music that the original Haruhi series had.  With a bright and wacky song to compliment its mother series, it\'s a decent listen, but it to me, it doesn\'t resonate with me all that well and I don\'t find it to be as enjoyable as other people may do.  (Thats my personal opinion.)  On the other hand, the ED is a more melancholy sound.  (Ah...)  Contrary to the more bubbly songs of the mother series, there is no signature dance, there is no happy go lucky song, but rather a track that pertains to what happens on in the second half of the series.  Personally, I felt like it didn\'t really fit with the series considering that the majority of the show was a very slice-of-life/rom-com style of story, and it sort of clashed that feeling with the ED.Side Note: The original cast of the Haruhi series voice all of their respective characters, so you don\'t have to worry about anyone sounding weird or anything.  Except maybe Nagato, because Minori Chihara uses the moe voice of Nagato over the kuudere version in this series.Overview:+ Art is standard fare+/- Different animation (positive or negative depending on whether you\'re a fan of the new designs.)+/- Decent tracks, but not memorable for mePersonal Enjoyment (5.44/10): While I am personally a fan of the Haruhi series, Yuki Nagato never truly gave me that sense of entertainment when watching this.  I had expected the show to be different, seeing as how Haruhi wasn\'t the title character of the series, but I never expected the show to be so bland and in some scenes, uninteresting.  As a result, the score itself is quite low.Did I enjoy this show?While I do have many problems with this spin-off, it wasn\'t always completely bad.  There were the moments where the show at times was rather entertaining.  The only issue is the fact that those moments only appeared when Haruhi was around to cause havoc.  When she wasn\'t in the frame in some sense or another, the show didn\'t really have much to stand on beyond being a boring rom-com plot.  A bit of this is partly due to the fact that I\'m more of a Haruhi fan than a Nagato fan, but even then, there should be moments in the show that should be able to stand on its own two legs.What didn\'t I like the show?Apart form the obvious generic plotline, the ending really gritted my teeth because there simply wasn\'t any resolution to the series.  It went back to the status quo, which basically got rid of almost every bit of progress this show tried to make when progressing episode to episode.  In addition, they put in the whole love triangle thing which really didn\'t do anything for the series because it was never used and wasn\'t just implied, it was heavily implied with several scenes devoted to imply it even further.Would I recommend this show?If you\'ve seen any part of the Haruhi series, most importantly, The ""Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" movie, then I would say you have enough background to understand what is going on in this series.  (I recommend that because you will be lost otherwise.)  Also, if you\'re a Nagato fan, you may enjoy this as well.  While I may not have personally enjoyed the direction that it went, it\'s not completely terrible, as there are some aspects that I did actually find enjoyable.  However, because it plays out like a rom-com, expect it to be a rom-com because that\'s the main plot point of the show, and the direction that it goes.Overall Score: 6.48/10 different in its setting.  Taking place in the Disappearance world of the Haruhi universe, where Haruhi and Koizumi go to a different school, Asakura isn\'t a homicidal alien, and Nagato is a moe creature rather than a cool kuudere, the story follows our main protagonist Kyon as he basically...does what he did in the original Haruhi series, which is spending time with the title girl in the series.In terms of differences to the original Haruhi series, this Spin-off bears only some resemblance to the flow and plot points.

The animation itself doesn\'t really stand out all too much, since it\'s just standard fare, but it\'s the characters themselves that have such a big impact since we, the anime community, are familiar with seeing these characters a certain way.Whether or not you\'re a fan of this style of animation is up to you, so I can\'t say anything else beyond the fact that there\'s ups and downs with the new look of them all.  All I can say is, get used to seeing life in Kyon\'s eyes.In terms of sound, the show has an OP that bears in some resemblance to the style of music that the original Haruhi series had.  With a bright and wacky song to compliment its mother series, it\'s a decent listen, but it to me, it doesn\'t resonate with me all that well and I don\'t find it to be as enjoyable as other people may do.  (Thats my personal opinion.)  On the other hand, the ED is a more melancholy sound.  (Ah...)  Contrary to the more bubbly songs of the mother series, there is no signature dance, there is no happy go lucky song, but rather a track that pertains to what happens on in the second half of the series.  Personally, I felt like it didn\'t really fit with the series considering that the majority of the show was a very slice-of-life/rom-com style of story, and it sort of clashed that feeling with the ED.Side Note: The original cast of the Haruhi series voice all of their respective characters, so you don\'t have to worry about anyone sounding weird or anything.  Except maybe Nagato, because Minori Chihara uses the moe voice of Nagato over the kuudere version in this series.Overview:+ Art is standard fare+/- Different animation (positive or negative depending on whether you\'re a fan of the new designs.)+/- Decent tracks, but not memorable for mePersonal Enjoyment (5.44/10): While I am personally a fan of the Haruhi series, Yuki Nagato never truly gave me that sense of entertainment when watching this.  I had expected the show to be different, seeing as how Haruhi wasn\'t the title character of the series, but I never expected the show to be so bland and in some scenes, uninteresting.  As a result, the score itself is quite low.Did I enjoy this show?While I do have many problems with this spin-off, it wasn\'t always completely bad.  There were the moments where the show at times was rather entertaining.  The only issue is the fact that those moments only appeared when Haruhi was around to cause havoc.  When she wasn\'t in the frame in some sense or another, the show didn\'t really have much to stand on beyond being a boring rom-com plot.  A bit of this is partly due to the fact that I\'m more of a Haruhi fan than a Nagato fan, but even then, there should be moments in the show that should be able to stand on its own two legs.What didn\'t I like the show?Apart form the obvious generic plotline, the ending really gritted my teeth because there simply wasn\'t any resolution to the series.  It went back to the status quo, which basically got rid of almost every bit of progress this show tried to make when progressing episode to episode.  In addition, they put in the whole love triangle thing which really didn\'t do anything for the series because it was never used and wasn\'t just implied, it was heavily implied with several scenes devoted to imply it even further.Would I recommend this show?If you\'ve seen any part of the Haruhi series, most importantly, The ""Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" movie, then I would say you have enough background to understand what is going on in this series.  (I recommend that because you will be lost otherwise.)  Also, if you\'re a Nagato fan, you may enjoy this as well.  While I may not have personally enjoyed the direction that it went, it\'s not completely terrible, as there are some aspects that I did actually find enjoyable.  However, because it plays out like a rom-com, expect it to be a rom-com because that\'s the main plot point of the show, and the direction that it goes.Overall Score: 6.48/10', 'This anime is the perfect example of ""don\'t watch or drop an anime based on the review""I don\'t usually write a review (especially an anime from 2015). But there\'s too many people that seems to misunderstood this anime. This is NOT a haruhi season 3 (and there will be  probably none)Sure the first episode feels like a really generic moeblob romcom.But there\'s a 3 certain episode that really good that it should be on the main series. Also the change in the ending on those 3 episode is really a jpb welldone.Overall, this is the type of anime that i don\'t even expect...to gave me any feels, but it does.but hey, people have difference taste though. to gave me any feels, but it does.but hey, people have difference taste though.', 'The spring 2015 anime Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu also known as the disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan this is the 2nd just not appealing boring anime ive seen in the spring season next to triage x but at least triage had the fan service going for it.Story- You can read the synopsis on it but to sum it up anime wise a shy girl named Nagato Yuki is the president of a club consisting of 3 members herself and a male and female who basically do club activities and stuff along those lines and also the love story that is on going throughout the series of...Nagato having a crush on the male member of her club before the expansion of more members. the name doesn\'t fit the series until about episode 10 or 11 when the dramatic scene actually happens the ""disappearance"" part but to be honest the story was bland and boring the characters didn\'t help the story much either but its not mediocre but its not good at all.

If you haven\'t watched it, stop reading this, there are spoilers in this, or go ahead, I don\'t care!Many people will tell you what their fanficton-material stories would be, and somewhere you\'ll find someone asking, ""What if Haruhi wasn\'t a god, and what if nobody had their powers?"" And while I could just take that one scene from the Disappearance movie, and type out a thesis on Kyon\'s amazing monologue, I\'ll just throw this in your face: The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan...It is...a spin-off series that perfectly answers the above question. But before you jump off of your seat and start looking for the anime on the Internet, (yes, I\'m talking to you, avid fans of the franchise!) keep in mind that this IS NOT A SEQUEL TO THE MOVIE. Instead, what we have, is a pleasant slice-of-life romance, involving the main duo, Yuki and Kyon. Yes, I know that those of you who despise that genre will be sickened by this, but as a big fan of the original franchise, I think that this is a good thing to put in. I mean, if we ignore all the fanfictions and doujinshi material, we can see that in the original anime, there was never any romance between any of the characters. Well okay, you could include Episode 6 from the ""first season"" as something between Kyon and Haruhi, but that wouldn\'t end up anywhere.STORYFrom what I\'ve said already, there isn\'t much to add. The slice of life genre may be a turn-off to some people, but if you sit through it you\'ll get used to it soon enough...CHARACTERSLet\'s be honest, the characters are the main reason why anybody would watch this show... From all of the characters, the only one to change is Yuki. In the original series she was an emotionless robot who hardly spoke, in the movie, she was extremely shy, and hardly spoke, and in this anime, she is also quite shy, but talks more. She also prefers to play video games rather than read books as we are used to.The other characters haven\'t seen much change in terms of their personalities. Haruhi is still loud and energetic, Koizumi is still her theoretical assistant, Asakura is the mother-like figure, Mikuru is still the same klutz as she was, and Kyon is just as much of a sarcastic joker as he was in the original...luckily. Honestly, he\'s in my top 10 anime characters for a reason!ANIMATION & SOUNDIf you weren\'t turned off by the fact that this is a slice of life anime, you\'ll get turned off by the animation. Maybe.The anime was made in April 2015, by Satelight Inc., (Log Horizon, AKB0048) and to be honest, it\'s not that great. Yeah, it isn\'t the same animation style from Kyoto Animation that we\'re used to, but even so, the animation is quite average for the most part. The characters are still recognisable, the only difference being Mikuru having dyed her hair slightly, and Kyon looking like he\'s twelve years old. The best parts of when the animation kicks into overdrive, are later on in the show, when the story becomes......interesting...My favourite part of the whole anime is the dub. Why? They got the old cast back!!! Yes yes yes, more Crispin Freeman, more Michelle Ruff, and more hilarity from the cast that has made one of the best English dubs in existence. The fact that the show has the entire old cast of voice actors back gives it an almost nostalgic feeling, like you can spend more time with these amazing characters... And although it is true that the first episode is a bit ""unstable"" in terms of the dub, it gets better very quickly.The soundtrack, is OK. It mainly consists of soft piano music, but there are a few tracks that stand out... The opening and ending themes aren\'t bad, depending on your tastes....FINAL EVALUATIONLong story short, you\'ll most likely enjoy this show if you enjoyed the original for the characters and comedy. What will also greatly add to your enjoyment of it are references to the original series, those that will make you smile when you see them, although they are not that easy to spot. And also, for those of you who watched the original for the sci-fi, or for the dark and slow moments from the movie, there is one story arc in this show for you, which is absolutely brilliant, and it feels like it should belong in the original too.8/10It\'s not season three, as I have already said, but it\'s a good spin-off series, that just gives us an excuse to spend more time watching our favourite characters...

However is you are approaching this series because you are indeed a fan of the parent series then what you get is just a little bit more from the characters that you have likely come to love. Both are particularly good reasons to give the show a chance, even if this...particular spin-off can be somewhat misleading with what the parent series actually provides. I present this review of Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan) so you can decide if this show is for you.First off, the story of Yuki-chan is hard to hate seeing how it is written by the same beloved author of the show\'s parent series even if it resembles more of a stereotypical romantic comedy anime, but even so some of that eccentricity that a loyal viewer of Haruhi can relate to. As the story of Yuki Nagato-chan progresses this eccentricity that I speak of pulls this spin-off away from what is truly just a generic series, and provides a lovely perspective of \'Kyon\'s\' life should a certain Haruhi have never existed. The art, surprisingly, is also worth mentioning seeing how a different studio has taken up the series after so many Haruhi-less years. The new art, although relatively close to that of the parent series, provides a much needed uniqueness to the show that reminds new and old fans alike that this series is not dead and we will hopefully see more of it in the future. A per usual of most high production anime the story and art are the better part of the pie and thus I reward an 8 and a 9 to them respectively.In the sound department we see the return of every voice actress and actor that the parent series was completed with and it is hopeful that any English dub (none when written) will also provide the same English dub and actors as both dubs in the Parent series have proven spectacular and this series is no different. Yuki Nagato-chan is great successor to what many would call an excellent series and should find a permanent place to any fan\'s collection. I reward an 8 out of ten.Character wise the show has some limits however, this is a spin-off series and as result our main protagonist is a shy emotionally filled Yuki Nagato that was first introduced to old fans in the fourth book of the light novel series or in the franchise movie, ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya."" This is a character that is worth loving but at the same time has some issues keeping up as the protagonist of her own show, as a result it seemed the author and studio reintroduced some initially not introduced characters. Otherwise this show would have lost a lot of watching value as the character of Yuki Nagato requires a lot of supporting roles in order to keep an average or casual audience interested. This of course probably wouldn\'t have been a problem assuming that the only ones that would\'ve been watching this series were dedicated fans of the parent series and such a thing should not be assumed in the world of show production. With a lot of strong supporting roles Yuki Nagato gets a C on her test of being a good protagonist and thus is rewarded a generous 7 put of ten. Without prior knowledge of who the main protagonist is from the parent series (Yuki Nagato), then a casual viewer would not see anything particularly interesting about this Yuki which is just a shy girl with a crush.Personally I could only call my enjoyment of this show as fair, being a loyal fan of the Haruhi series it seemed as thought this was just a little bit more of the characters I have come to love with no actual story progression of what we have already seen. Of course this is a spin-off and I knew this before jumping into the manga and show and so I can only speak personally when saying these things, but as an added note I do find it to be a well deserved addition to the Haruhi series and would recommend it to anyone that has seen the parent series and would recommend any newcomers to Haruhi to watch the parent series first. So for my enjoyment of the series I reward a 6 and give this spin-off the overall score of 7. This is generic romantic comedy, but it is an average anime with many reasons to dislike and just as many to reasons to like it. particular spin-off can be somewhat misleading with what the parent series actually provides.

The ""Godly"" Haruhi Suzumiya? The espers, the time travelers and Yuki the alien? Well, you get this... A pile of horsesh*t. To be honest though, I did enjoy the show quite a bit but not as much as the Haruhi series.[Story]: (4/10)Yuki Nagato, the shy president of the literature club, has never been very sure of herself around other people. But around Kyon, the only boy in the tiny, three-person club, Yuki finds herself faltering even more than usual. For Kyon, and for her precious club, Yuki must find her confidence...and let her true personality shine!When I found out there was a spin off to the Haruhi series called ""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan""..Man, was I hyped. I mean, the movie came out 5 years ago with no sight of the 3rd Season for the Haruhi series. A spin-off was pretty much good enough for me, as long as I can see Haruhi, Kyon and the gang again. Welp, my hyped quickly died down after seeing the first 3 episodes. Why? Because it didn\'t have the same feeling or vibe as the Haruhi series. Kyon was right, without the espers, the time travelers and the aliens, life is boring. The show just demonstrated that. The episodes are just your typical slice-of-life with no mysteries whatsoever. That\'s what made me love the Haruhi series in the first place. A slice-of-life with mysteries. Taking out the mystery part is like taking out the strawberry in your strawberry cake. It\'s just no fun.The first 2 episodes re-introduced the characters but not so much because they already assumed that you have seen the Haruhi series and you know these characters very well.The first 10 episodes are just your typical slice-of-life/rom-com moments. In other words, eating, fooling around, main girl doing everything to catch the male\'s attention..that kind of stuff.Episodes 11-13 is where it gets good...or so I thought. Ep. 11-13 is ""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan"" arc. At this point, I thought the show was going to get better but instead, it became even more boring. She didn\'t really disappear like how Haruhi disappeared in the movie. Only her personality disappeared and it got replaced by her ""old/alien"" personality. Only temporarily though. I was very disappointed at this arc. Was I expected to cry when Yuki\'s old/alien personality was about to go? Because it\'s not even that sad. I was just too bored and I wanted the arc to be over with.The last 3 episodes is again, your typical slice-of-life with no mystery plus some rom-com moments. In other words, it\'s the same as the first 10 episodes.Some people thought the ending was a disappointment but I didn\'t find it disappointing. I actually thought it was a decent ending. It felt somewhat similar to the ""Endless Eight"" arc but very different.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (8/10)Noo!! What happened with the animation?! If you compare this to the 2006 version of ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", it looks like the main series\' had a younger brother (which is this show) and he somehow had a birth defect. Yea, I was disappointed when I first saw the animations and I was also disappointed that the show is not made by Kyoto Animation this time around. The show is animated by Satelight so there\'s a reason why the animation is different than the 2006 version. To be honest though, if you look at this show without looking at the main series then the show\'s animation looks pretty good. The character designs also bugged the hell out of me when I first saw them because KyoAni\'s character designs looks a lot better but I got used to the show\'s character design in about 2 episodes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (7/10)Is it just me or does the soundtrack feel similar to the Haruhi series?....Nah, I\'m not alone on this one. The soundtrack IS the exact same as the soundtracks played in the Haruhi series. There is some new ones but I\'m glad most of them returned because I absolutely love the theme that plays during Haruhi\'s crazy missions in the Haruhi series. In here, it\'s used in a similar way.The OP theme song is ""Fure Fure Mirai"" by Kitakou Bungei-bu Joshikai and the ED theme song is ""Arigatou, Daisuki"" by Minori Chihara..In my opinion, I was disappointed at the OP and ED theme song. I admit, the OP is catchy but it\'s a shitty OP theme song at the same time. The ED theme song is just downright annoying because the singer\'s voice didn\'t really fit with the sad and dramatic tone that the ED theme song is trying to play.I watched the show in English Dub so I\'ll be reviewing the English VAs. They all reprise their roles and they all did a great job with their characters. Yuki\'s English VA managed to have that ""cute, innocent, shy and moe"" voice.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Character]: (7/10)All the characters you know and love from the Haruhi series has been re-introduced in this show and this time, they have no special powers..How boring...Kyon is the same as always and thank god nothing changed about him because I love his monologues and his funny ass sarcasms. Yuki Nagato\'s personality has completely changed. She went from an alien with no personality to a normal somewhat-shy teenage girl who plays her PS Vita all day. Reading books is boring anyways right? Ms. Asahina is still the same old moe but doesn\'t cosplay anymore. My beloved Mikuru..wearing her maid outfit..gone.. Itsuki is still the same old cocky transfer student but this time, he has a crush on Haruhi. Lastly, Haruhi is not the god anymore. Meaning the world will not turn ""upside down"" if she gets bored. She\'s still the same old over-cheery girl though so if you found her annoying (I don\'t find her annoying) in the main series then expect Haruhi to be more annoying in this show.2 characters that didn\'t really get a lot of screentime in the Haruhi series finally gets more screentime in this show. That\'s Asakura and Tsuruya. In the main series, Asakura tried to kill Kyon and if I remember correctly, she too was an alien. Well, here..She\'s a normal girl who helps Yuki most of the time and she\'s part of the Literary Club with Yuki and Kyon. She doesn\'t have any intentions of killing Kyon and we are shown that when she gets on her ""angry"" side, she tends to be scary. Very scary.. Tsuruya is still the same old annoying rich girl.Do I like these characters? In a way, yes..They\'re pretty decent but they\'re definitely inferior when compared to their selves with special powers.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (7/10)I\'d be lying if I said that I didn\'t enjoy this anime because I did enjoy it. Except for the ""Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan"" arc which felt really boring. The comedy is still there but not as great as the Haruhi series.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[OVERALL]: (7/10)""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan"" didn\'t really live up to the hype like the Melancholy and the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya did. It just doesn\'t feel the same as those 2 series. It felt like a generic rom-com with slice of life moments. It\'s still a quite enjoyable series to watch but don\'t expect it to feel almost the same as the 2 main series. However, if you look at the show on its own then you might enjoy it even more.Pros:+Animation looks pretty good+Most of the soundtracks in the main series returned here, with some new ones.+Nice change in the characters+Yuki\'s personality is better than her old personality+Show retained Kyon\'s monologues and funny sarcasmsCons:-Flat Story-Show doesn\'t feel the same when compared to the Haruhi series-Generic Rom-Com/Slice of Life moments-Inconclusive Ending and let her true personality shine!When I found out there was a spin off to the Haruhi series called ""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan""..Man, was I hyped. I mean, the movie came out 5 years ago with no sight of the 3rd Season for the Haruhi series. A spin-off was pretty much good enough for me, as long as I can see Haruhi, Kyon and the gang again. Welp, my hyped quickly died down after seeing the first 3 episodes. Why? Because it didn\'t have the same feeling or vibe as the Haruhi series. Kyon was right, without the espers, the time travelers and the aliens, life is boring. The show just demonstrated that. The episodes are just your typical slice-of-life with no mysteries whatsoever. That\'s what made me love the Haruhi series in the first place. A slice-of-life with mysteries. Taking out the mystery part is like taking out the strawberry in your strawberry cake. It\'s just no fun.The first 2 episodes re-introduced the characters but not so much because they already assumed that you have seen the Haruhi series and you know these characters very well.The first 10 episodes are just your typical slice-of-life/rom-com moments. In other words, eating, fooling around, main girl doing everything to catch the male\'s attention..that kind of stuff.Episodes 11-13 is where it gets good...or so I thought. Ep. 11-13 is ""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan"" arc. At this point, I thought the show was going to get better but instead, it became even more boring. She didn\'t really disappear like how Haruhi disappeared in the movie. Only her personality disappeared and it got replaced by her ""old/alien"" personality. Only temporarily though. I was very disappointed at this arc. Was I expected to cry when Yuki\'s old/alien personality was about to go? Because it\'s not even that sad. I was just too bored and I wanted the arc to be over with.The last 3 episodes is again, your typical slice-of-life with no mystery plus some rom-com moments. In other words, it\'s the same as the first 10 episodes.Some people thought the ending was a disappointment but I didn\'t find it disappointing. I actually thought it was a decent ending. It felt somewhat similar to the ""Endless Eight"" arc but very different.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (8/10)Noo!! What happened with the animation?! If you compare this to the 2006 version of ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"", it looks like the main series\' had a younger brother (which is this show) and he somehow had a birth defect. Yea, I was disappointed when I first saw the animations and I was also disappointed that the show is not made by Kyoto Animation this time around. The show is animated by Satelight so there\'s a reason why the animation is different than the 2006 version. To be honest though, if you look at this show without looking at the main series then the show\'s animation looks pretty good. The character designs also bugged the hell out of me when I first saw them because KyoAni\'s character designs looks a lot better but I got used to the show\'s character design in about 2 episodes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (7/10)Is it just me or does the soundtrack feel similar to the Haruhi series?....Nah, I\'m not alone on this one. The soundtrack IS the exact same as the soundtracks played in the Haruhi series. There is some new ones but I\'m glad most of them returned because I absolutely love the theme that plays during Haruhi\'s crazy missions in the Haruhi series. In here, it\'s used in a similar way.The OP theme song is ""Fure Fure Mirai"" by Kitakou Bungei-bu Joshikai and the ED theme song is ""Arigatou, Daisuki"" by Minori Chihara..In my opinion, I was disappointed at the OP and ED theme song. I admit, the OP is catchy but it\'s a shitty OP theme song at the same time. The ED theme song is just downright annoying because the singer\'s voice didn\'t really fit with the sad and dramatic tone that the ED theme song is trying to play.I watched the show in English Dub so I\'ll be reviewing the English VAs. They all reprise their roles and they all did a great job with their characters. Yuki\'s English VA managed to have that ""cute, innocent, shy and moe"" voice.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Character]: (7/10)All the characters you know and love from the Haruhi series has been re-introduced in this show and this time, they have no special powers..How boring...Kyon is the same as always and thank god nothing changed about him because I love his monologues and his funny ass sarcasms. Yuki Nagato\'s personality has completely changed. She went from an alien with no personality to a normal somewhat-shy teenage girl who plays her PS Vita all day. Reading books is boring anyways right? Ms. Asahina is still the same old moe but doesn\'t cosplay anymore. My beloved Mikuru..wearing her maid outfit..gone.. Itsuki is still the same old cocky transfer student but this time, he has a crush on Haruhi. Lastly, Haruhi is not the god anymore. Meaning the world will not turn ""upside down"" if she gets bored. She\'s still the same old over-cheery girl though so if you found her annoying (I don\'t find her annoying) in the main series then expect Haruhi to be more annoying in this show.2 characters that didn\'t really get a lot of screentime in the Haruhi series finally gets more screentime in this show.

Spoilers ahead!)In the school of thought, there are two areas that are often compared and contrasted: the conscious and the subconscious. The former is what we are aware of, the actions we take that we knowingly carry out, whereas the latter is what happens “without our knowledge,” the actions we take that we unknowingly carry out. We often say that “I subconsciously did this” in response to doing something that we are unable to explain. But what is interesting is that we accept this “hidden” part of ourselves. That is, despite having a main and understood self,...we still believe there is a second, similar self within us. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is connected to this notion of two selves, generating an anime that somewhat subconsciously loses itself along the way.STORYSomething that not everyone learns is the notion of perspective. Having the ability to displace one’s self, move outside of one’s current view and look at a particular situation from a different vantage point, is valuable not only for the one shifting his or her perspective – since it reveals previously unknown ideas – but also for those being looked at differently – complete bias gives way to further understanding. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan targets this same theme with mixed results.The anime’s sign that its overall perspective is about perspective is in the way that it structures its narrative, and more specifically who is doing the narrating. Essentially, the plot shifts its perspective between three separate characters throughout the season: the regular Nagato, the “new” Nagato, and finally Kyon. The majority of the anime follows regular Nagato (about the first ten episodes or so), with her segment more slice-of-life and romantic-comedy in nature. One moment she is sharing a drink with her crush while the next has her on vacation with all of her friends to enjoy life’s small offerings. During her events, the anime is generally fun, upbeat, and lighthearted, as a simple foray into the Haruhi Suzumiya world that this spinoff comes from. Feelings of this kind are felt because the audience is viewing the anime from Nagato’s perspective which coincidentally has these same emotions. Therefore the viewer comes to understand Nagato’s thoughts directly from her, laying down the foundation for how the remainder of the season proceeds.However, the emotions subsequently change when the perspective does, most notably when the show moves from regular Nagato’s point of view to new Nagato’s. No longer are the feelings related to elation but instead loneliness, depression, and sadness because that is how new Nagato perceives the environment around her. As a result, the anime also goes from being slice-of-life oriented to being dramatic in its presentation. Gone are the small talk and romps, replaced instead with trips to quiet libraries and nighttime park benches that encapsulate the plot’s new focus. Haruhi’s exclusion during this arc makes the switch even more apparent – the biggest ball of energy is purposefully missing to keep the show’s current tone bogged down. Such a tonal shift contrasts harshly with the beginning, giving it higher impact on the viewer and therefore higher power since the effects are both immediate and palpable. But even more powerful is how the change in perspective allows for the audience, for the first time, to see regular Nagato from a new angle. Before it had always been through her eyes, through her own introspection. Now, she is seen from a point that is paradoxically inside and outside of herself due to new Nagato’s special status. Consequently, the narrative showcases regular Nagato’s thoughts and feelings through new Nagato, providing (coincidentally) a new angle to view the characters in question and thus the relationships involved.For its final angle, the anime changes its perspective to Kyon, the character who has been the target of the girls’ affections the entire time. Like new Nagato, the change in perspective can be seen in the reassembly of the anime’s elements: Kyon’s little sister is around more than ever, evident references to “Endless Eight” are included, and his previous connection to Haruhi is elaborated on. Perhaps obviously, the trend of morphing feelings continues, with this last iteration mirroring Kyon’s awkwardness and unsureness. Again, these emotions are present not only because of the conflicting personalities and actions between the regular and new Nagato but also because the narrative is now from his point of view. This results in a similar investigation of the characters and relationships; the audience is now able to see both Nagatos from a perspective that is completely separate from them. Kyon wrestles with himself on what to do, he interacts with the characters in more meaningful ways – less joking and more personal – and his ultimate decision reflects the sort of middle ground that was necessary to succinctly conclude the problem at hand. The anime certainly could have flipped its perspective back to the regular Nagato but that would have reduced Kyon’s plight and would not have meshed well with the newfound mood since regular Nagato was always about having a happy time.But no matter how elated or melancholy the narrative gets, that does not immediately reveal what this perspective-shifting creates. In the case of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan there is good news and bad news.The good news is that the constant shifts in perspective allow the anime to escape from self-imposed narrow-mindedness. The situation between Nagato and Kyon is not relayed through a singular outlet but many outlets, altogether crafting a dynamic, rounded, and interesting tale that is open and explored since the multitude of perspectives prevents the anime from restricting its mindset. Since each main player’s direction is elaborated on, the narrative is empowered because it is no longer streamlined and instead given the opportunity to reach the same destination – a satisfying resolution between the three characters – but from multiple paths at once.Unfortunately the bad news is hefty and almost ruins the narrative entirely. In essence and inherently, the tactic of shifting perspectives has a major problem: losing itself along the way. Initially the anime is about regular Nagato’s feelings toward Kyon but by the end it is about Kyon’s feelings toward new Nagato. In other words, the show’s original goals are never accomplished because the change in perspective brings with it a change in the conclusion. Using the multiple paths analogy once more, while the destination is reached, the anime chose to not look back or at least place markers along the roads it took. The implication, then, is that when the finale is over and it does see where it came from, it has no idea how it got to where it is at because there are too many paths to choose from without any sort of indication for which were taken when. Putting it differently, the conclusion makes it clear just how lost the anime is.When done right – which happens here – shifting the perspective illuminates new ways in which to view the narrative. When done wrong – which happens here – shifting the perspective conceals how the narrative got from start to finish. Collectively, the mixed concoction is neither wanted nor discarded but simply tolerated.ANIMATIONThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan chooses to employ a soft art style. Both the backgrounds and the character designs adopt this look as a means to make the anime more inviting; like a kind person, a show that is shown to be “caring” is easier to approach. Along these same lines, the locations visited are familiar to both newcomers and veterans of the series. The clubroom, the school grounds, the library, Nagato’s apartment, and the various areas within the city are visited, giving the anime a new yet nostalgic feel that further adds to the invitingness. Simultaneously, the show often makes use of a “chibi” art style, where characters and their faces become squatter and more exaggerated than normal to emphasize the comedy of the situation.It is also worth highlighting the anime’s expert representation of new Nagato’s perspective. Where regular Nagato and Kyon have bright lighting and colors, new Nagato’s arc is mired in darkness, with low lighting and more somber hues – mainly purples, blacks, and blues – that work together to make her perspective that much more sad.The characters’ designs are actually rather plain, mostly as a result of the soft art style. Besides Haruhi’s yellow ribbons and long, brown hair, the remainder of the designs all sort of blend together. The boring school uniforms, the weird hair colors, and the lack of extra detail (accessories or similar additions) keep the characters grounded in realism at the expense of interesting or memorable designs. Granted, the characters do fit their roles: Asahina’s peach hair coincides with her girly behavior, Asakura’s long blue hair and mature face matches her motherly instincts, and Yuki’s short, purple hair and round glasses fit her shy attitude, to name a few examples. Meaning, the character designs, while uninspired, manage to be purposeful within the context of the anime.Actual animation tends to sit somewhere in the average area due to the laidback dealings of the anime. In general, the show is never flashy or dull, instead showcasing the everyday dealings of high school teenagers. Characters interact with each other using typical body and facial movements, with a lot of the downtime regulated to them standing or sitting around having a conversation about themselves, each other, or the occurrence at hand.CHARACTERSThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan’s approach to its characters is two-fold in more ways than one.On the surface, the characters embody a smorgasbord of personalities. Nagato is the clumsy girl, Kyon is the wisecracker, Asakura is the competitor, Haruhi is the hyperactive one, Koizumi is the quiet sage, and so on. The anime portrays them as such because that is who they are; of course, how could they be anybody else? Interestingly, besides Nagato’s increased reactions and Asakura’s more prominent role, the characters act much like they have been known to behave. That is to say, the traits that have defined them in the past – within the original series – have carried over into their present manifestations, providing the same sense of nostalgia that the art did. Indeed, people experience development over the course of their life but who they are and how they act is something that is persistent. Someone who is a partier remains a partier, someone who is a nerd remains a nerd. So, the cast of the show are the same: Nagato usually fumbles with common happenings, Kyon has a witty comment or two to share, and Haruhi is the one that designs the ridiculous activities. Characterizations like these are not just readily perceivable but also immediately attributable based on what the viewer learns and possibly has learned.It is not that the partier cannot become the nerd and vice versa, but that people who portray themselves one way rarely lose that side of himself or herself. Geometrically, features are lines that connect a definition to the person in question. When someone is described as funny, that word strings the ideas of funniness with the one being described – he or she tells jokes, makes weird faces, uses overzealous motions, and so on. The same train of thought applies to the cast; calling Kyon sarcastic or Haruhi rambunctious causes the brain to start making connections.But people are not one line, but many. Continuing to think with geometry, people are shapes, complex structures that weave and loop in intricate patterns. People are made up of a large amount of lines at once that, collectively, make someone who they are. In other words, people do not have just one side but several; people are multiple “persons” at once. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan showcases this mathematical premise with each of its characters. Kyon’s wittiness and outward smartness sits alongside the worrywart and kind person that he is. Asakura might be a competitor at heart, but she is extremely motherly, treating Nagato like her own child. Haruhi is selfish and slightly crazy but she can be envious and sane when she wants to be. Even Koizumi, in all his infinite wisdom, would much rather flow like water, be a follower instead of the leader he seems destined for. Now, the majority of these are contradictions, where each person’s “second person” goes against their regular self, but this pronounces the type of shapeshifting people experience. People can, and often are, polar opposites of themselves, both because they are allowed to be and because it is simply another side to the shape.A potential problem arises when the most important character, Nagato Yuki, is used in conjunction with this line of thinking. As is shown, the anime depicts the regular and the new Nagato as different people entirely. Not the same person with two distinct halves but rather two distinct people. That is, it appears as if the Nagatos do not follow this train of thought since the anime goes out of its way to say, “This is one Nagato and this is another,” that it is not one Nagato with multiple sides but instead two separate women. But they do. Regular Nagato is surely shy but hidden beneath her hiding exterior is a girl looking for and wanting love. New Nagato is a bit more reserved yet sure of herself. While she was not looking for love, it found her, with the understanding she had of her person encouraging her to press on where the other Nagato never could.The Nagatos being two separate people, with their own set of traits, features, and quirks that make them composed of several “people,” is ultimately the anime’s message: a person is composed of a mishmash of shapes that make him or her a completely unique one. In a way, the show is alluding to the original series, with its characters having identities separate of their “normal” selves that made them special individuals. Kyon’s final talk goes down the way it does because he understands this notion, how people are made up of multiple facets that make them who they are, make them stand-out from everyone else. He sees that it was not the regular Nagato he started to have feelings for but the new Nagato, with her books, quietness, and confidence that allured him. It was new Nagato’s shape, not regular Nagato’s, that seemed so appealing. Kyon’s words do not have romance flourish between any of the couplings, but it highlights the importance of differentiation. Differentiating not only between people but also between ourselves.As it stands, the entire cast lacks major development despite the drama instilled, which would seem to hamper their execution. However, due the characters’ theme on multiplicity being as involved as it is, their purpose is not entirely folded into nothingness.SOUNDThe opening theme is very ecstatic, which is strange since this is an anime about Nagato and not an anime about Haruhi. Regardless, the upbeat nature of the piece comes from the quickness, multiple vocalists, and weird instrumental effects that make the track itself pretty crazy. A little too crazy, given the content of the anime during the latter portions of the series. It can be fun to listen to at times but is mostly forgettable. The ending theme is the opposite, in tempo, emotion, and memorability. The vocalist gives a strong performance, the sentimental tone is serene, and the backup choir supports the main singer well. It is a track filled with loneliness, longing, and love, each of which can be easily felt when listening to it both when and when not watching the anime.The remainder of the soundtrack is two-fold like the characters. Since half of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is a comedy, many of the tracks are similarly fun, with beach-like tunes, acoustic sounds, and faster beats to fit the occasion. The other half is dramatic, with accompanying flutes, pianos, and violins taking up much of the music. The dramatic pieces are better than the comedic ones mainly as a result of the passion they exude when compared to their silly brethren. Overall, the OST is a nice group of songs that are neither strong nor weak, used when needed but lacking power.Voice acting for the show is somewhere above average. Many of the voice actors and actresses reprise their roles, such as Minori Chihara as Nagato, Tomokazu Sugita as Kyon, and Aya Hirano as Haruhi. Minori Chihara in particular gave a wonderful performance, providing a voice that is awkward, quiet, and straining, portraying Nagato as the pitiable yet hopeful lead. Alongside Tomokazu Sugita’s sarcastic and overly-manly voice for Kyon, Aya Hirano’s peppiness for Haruhi, and the remainder of the men and women giving nice performances, the cast as a whole gave the show some much-needed life.ENJOYMENTI would not consider myself a fanatic (aka, a fan) when it comes to the Haruhi series. I think it is well-done – and yes that does include the second season that seems to literally define repetition – but I never find myself talking about the series to someone else or even suggesting it. Again, not that I hate the series or find it missing in execution, which are both untrue, it is simply always sitting somewhere slightly outside of my mind. The movie which, coincidentally enough, shares nearly the exact same name as this series, is a whole different beast that should be viewed by everyone.That being said, as I was watching this one, I found myself liking it. It was because of the romance aspect; watching Nagato squirm, stutter, and smile her way towards the love she wanted was cute to watch, as was all of the blushing and courage she sporadically had. The references to the original were cool throwbacks, too. They were used sparingly and appropriately: not too much so that it became indistinguishable from the original series and not too little so that it forgot its origins. Comedy-wise, the show also had a foothold, with reaction faces, character interactions, and skits that would usually get a laugh out of me now and again.But as the anime began switching its perspective, so did I. I started to find the show less and less entertaining the further along it progressed. New Nagato’s segment is arguably the strongest part of the anime, but it was a section that was honestly quite boring. I wanted Nagato to continue fighting for Kyon’s attention. I wanted Kyon and Haruhi’s personalities to still be around. I wanted Asakura’s overprotection. I wanted the fun, the romance, back. But I did not get what I wanted. What I got was a show that was not what it was before, making me, like Nagato, longing for that which I could not have.For a final note, I want to say that, despite Minori Chihara’s amazing performance, I hated Nagato’s voice. Nagato acted cute but spoke in a way that was unfavorable. It was not deafening or unbearable, but it was grating and annoying. Each time she started to speak, I was wondering when she would stop because it sounded like she was struggling, drowning in a sea of her own vocal chords. To be fair, that is sort of the point – she is a super-shy girl that has difficulty socializing with others – but that did not prevent me from disliking her each time she opened her mouth.The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an anime that has surprisingly strong themes on perspective and variability of the self, with mediocrity within its remaining parts unfortunately covering them. The story gets lost in some woods, the characters’ development gets misplaced in a cabin, and the music gets abandoned on a mountainside, each with zero chance of recovery since the show never attempts to find them. At the minimum, the anime, like its lost items, will continue to exist in the subconscious of those that have seen it: always there but not quite remembered.SUMMARYStory: Fine, the narrative’s tendency to shift its perspective gives it new angles but simultaneously causes it to lose itself along the wayAnimation: Fine, nice art style, adequate character designs, about average actual animationCharacters: Fine, while missing a lot of development, the cast demonstrates the idea of multiplicity in ourselvesSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, fun and comedic in the beginning, reducing in entertainment the further along it proceeds, with Nagato’s grating voice persistent from start to finishFinal Score: 4/10 we still believe there is a second, similar self within us.

Putting it differently, the conclusion makes it clear just how lost the anime is.When done right – which happens here – shifting the perspective illuminates new ways in which to view the narrative. When done wrong – which happens here – shifting the perspective conceals how the narrative got from start to finish. Collectively, the mixed concoction is neither wanted nor discarded but simply tolerated.ANIMATIONThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan chooses to employ a soft art style. Both the backgrounds and the character designs adopt this look as a means to make the anime more inviting; like a kind person, a show that is shown to be “caring” is easier to approach. Along these same lines, the locations visited are familiar to both newcomers and veterans of the series. The clubroom, the school grounds, the library, Nagato’s apartment, and the various areas within the city are visited, giving the anime a new yet nostalgic feel that further adds to the invitingness. Simultaneously, the show often makes use of a “chibi” art style, where characters and their faces become squatter and more exaggerated than normal to emphasize the comedy of the situation.It is also worth highlighting the anime’s expert representation of new Nagato’s perspective. Where regular Nagato and Kyon have bright lighting and colors, new Nagato’s arc is mired in darkness, with low lighting and more somber hues – mainly purples, blacks, and blues – that work together to make her perspective that much more sad.The characters’ designs are actually rather plain, mostly as a result of the soft art style. Besides Haruhi’s yellow ribbons and long, brown hair, the remainder of the designs all sort of blend together. The boring school uniforms, the weird hair colors, and the lack of extra detail (accessories or similar additions) keep the characters grounded in realism at the expense of interesting or memorable designs. Granted, the characters do fit their roles: Asahina’s peach hair coincides with her girly behavior, Asakura’s long blue hair and mature face matches her motherly instincts, and Yuki’s short, purple hair and round glasses fit her shy attitude, to name a few examples. Meaning, the character designs, while uninspired, manage to be purposeful within the context of the anime.Actual animation tends to sit somewhere in the average area due to the laidback dealings of the anime. In general, the show is never flashy or dull, instead showcasing the everyday dealings of high school teenagers. Characters interact with each other using typical body and facial movements, with a lot of the downtime regulated to them standing or sitting around having a conversation about themselves, each other, or the occurrence at hand.CHARACTERSThe Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan’s approach to its characters is two-fold in more ways than one.On the surface, the characters embody a smorgasbord of personalities. Nagato is the clumsy girl, Kyon is the wisecracker, Asakura is the competitor, Haruhi is the hyperactive one, Koizumi is the quiet sage, and so on. The anime portrays them as such because that is who they are; of course, how could they be anybody else? Interestingly, besides Nagato’s increased reactions and Asakura’s more prominent role, the characters act much like they have been known to behave. That is to say, the traits that have defined them in the past – within the original series – have carried over into their present manifestations, providing the same sense of nostalgia that the art did. Indeed, people experience development over the course of their life but who they are and how they act is something that is persistent. Someone who is a partier remains a partier, someone who is a nerd remains a nerd. So, the cast of the show are the same: Nagato usually fumbles with common happenings, Kyon has a witty comment or two to share, and Haruhi is the one that designs the ridiculous activities. Characterizations like these are not just readily perceivable but also immediately attributable based on what the viewer learns and possibly has learned.It is not that the partier cannot become the nerd and vice versa, but that people who portray themselves one way rarely lose that side of himself or herself. Geometrically, features are lines that connect a definition to the person in question. When someone is described as funny, that word strings the ideas of funniness with the one being described – he or she tells jokes, makes weird faces, uses overzealous motions, and so on. The same train of thought applies to the cast; calling Kyon sarcastic or Haruhi rambunctious causes the brain to start making connections.But people are not one line, but many. Continuing to think with geometry, people are shapes, complex structures that weave and loop in intricate patterns. People are made up of a large amount of lines at once that, collectively, make someone who they are. In other words, people do not have just one side but several; people are multiple “persons” at once. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan showcases this mathematical premise with each of its characters. Kyon’s wittiness and outward smartness sits alongside the worrywart and kind person that he is. Asakura might be a competitor at heart, but she is extremely motherly, treating Nagato like her own child. Haruhi is selfish and slightly crazy but she can be envious and sane when she wants to be. Even Koizumi, in all his infinite wisdom, would much rather flow like water, be a follower instead of the leader he seems destined for. Now, the majority of these are contradictions, where each person’s “second person” goes against their regular self, but this pronounces the type of shapeshifting people experience. People can, and often are, polar opposites of themselves, both because they are allowed to be and because it is simply another side to the shape.A potential problem arises when the most important character, Nagato Yuki, is used in conjunction with this line of thinking. As is shown, the anime depicts the regular and the new Nagato as different people entirely. Not the same person with two distinct halves but rather two distinct people. That is, it appears as if the Nagatos do not follow this train of thought since the anime goes out of its way to say, “This is one Nagato and this is another,” that it is not one Nagato with multiple sides but instead two separate women. But they do. Regular Nagato is surely shy but hidden beneath her hiding exterior is a girl looking for and wanting love. New Nagato is a bit more reserved yet sure of herself. While she was not looking for love, it found her, with the understanding she had of her person encouraging her to press on where the other Nagato never could.The Nagatos being two separate people, with their own set of traits, features, and quirks that make them composed of several “people,” is ultimately the anime’s message: a person is composed of a mishmash of shapes that make him or her a completely unique one. In a way, the show is alluding to the original series, with its characters having identities separate of their “normal” selves that made them special individuals. Kyon’s final talk goes down the way it does because he understands this notion, how people are made up of multiple facets that make them who they are, make them stand-out from everyone else. He sees that it was not the regular Nagato he started to have feelings for but the new Nagato, with her books, quietness, and confidence that allured him. It was new Nagato’s shape, not regular Nagato’s, that seemed so appealing. Kyon’s words do not have romance flourish between any of the couplings, but it highlights the importance of differentiation. Differentiating not only between people but also between ourselves.As it stands, the entire cast lacks major development despite the drama instilled, which would seem to hamper their execution. However, due the characters’ theme on multiplicity being as involved as it is, their purpose is not entirely folded into nothingness.SOUNDThe opening theme is very ecstatic, which is strange since this is an anime about Nagato and not an anime about Haruhi. Regardless, the upbeat nature of the piece comes from the quickness, multiple vocalists, and weird instrumental effects that make the track itself pretty crazy. A little too crazy, given the content of the anime during the latter portions of the series. It can be fun to listen to at times but is mostly forgettable. The ending theme is the opposite, in tempo, emotion, and memorability. The vocalist gives a strong performance, the sentimental tone is serene, and the backup choir supports the main singer well. It is a track filled with loneliness, longing, and love, each of which can be easily felt when listening to it both when and when not watching the anime.The remainder of the soundtrack is two-fold like the characters. Since half of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is a comedy, many of the tracks are similarly fun, with beach-like tunes, acoustic sounds, and faster beats to fit the occasion. The other half is dramatic, with accompanying flutes, pianos, and violins taking up much of the music. The dramatic pieces are better than the comedic ones mainly as a result of the passion they exude when compared to their silly brethren. Overall, the OST is a nice group of songs that are neither strong nor weak, used when needed but lacking power.Voice acting for the show is somewhere above average. Many of the voice actors and actresses reprise their roles, such as Minori Chihara as Nagato, Tomokazu Sugita as Kyon, and Aya Hirano as Haruhi. Minori Chihara in particular gave a wonderful performance, providing a voice that is awkward, quiet, and straining, portraying Nagato as the pitiable yet hopeful lead. Alongside Tomokazu Sugita’s sarcastic and overly-manly voice for Kyon, Aya Hirano’s peppiness for Haruhi, and the remainder of the men and women giving nice performances, the cast as a whole gave the show some much-needed life.ENJOYMENTI would not consider myself a fanatic (aka, a fan) when it comes to the Haruhi series. I think it is well-done – and yes that does include the second season that seems to literally define repetition – but I never find myself talking about the series to someone else or even suggesting it. Again, not that I hate the series or find it missing in execution, which are both untrue, it is simply always sitting somewhere slightly outside of my mind. The movie which, coincidentally enough, shares nearly the exact same name as this series, is a whole different beast that should be viewed by everyone.That being said, as I was watching this one, I found myself liking it. It was because of the romance aspect; watching Nagato squirm, stutter, and smile her way towards the love she wanted was cute to watch, as was all of the blushing and courage she sporadically had. The references to the original were cool throwbacks, too. They were used sparingly and appropriately: not too much so that it became indistinguishable from the original series and not too little so that it forgot its origins. Comedy-wise, the show also had a foothold, with reaction faces, character interactions, and skits that would usually get a laugh out of me now and again.But as the anime began switching its perspective, so did I. I started to find the show less and less entertaining the further along it progressed. New Nagato’s segment is arguably the strongest part of the anime, but it was a section that was honestly quite boring. I wanted Nagato to continue fighting for Kyon’s attention. I wanted Kyon and Haruhi’s personalities to still be around. I wanted Asakura’s overprotection. I wanted the fun, the romance, back. But I did not get what I wanted. What I got was a show that was not what it was before, making me, like Nagato, longing for that which I could not have.For a final note, I want to say that, despite Minori Chihara’s amazing performance, I hated Nagato’s voice. Nagato acted cute but spoke in a way that was unfavorable. It was not deafening or unbearable, but it was grating and annoying. Each time she started to speak, I was wondering when she would stop because it sounded like she was struggling, drowning in a sea of her own vocal chords. To be fair, that is sort of the point – she is a super-shy girl that has difficulty socializing with others – but that did not prevent me from disliking her each time she opened her mouth.The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is an anime that has surprisingly strong themes on perspective and variability of the self, with mediocrity within its remaining parts unfortunately covering them. The story gets lost in some woods, the characters’ development gets misplaced in a cabin, and the music gets abandoned on a mountainside, each with zero chance of recovery since the show never attempts to find them. At the minimum, the anime, like its lost items, will continue to exist in the subconscious of those that have seen it: always there but not quite remembered.SUMMARYStory: Fine, the narrative’s tendency to shift its perspective gives it new angles but simultaneously causes it to lose itself along the wayAnimation: Fine, nice art style, adequate character designs, about average actual animationCharacters: Fine, while missing a lot of development, the cast demonstrates the idea of multiplicity in ourselvesSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, fun and comedic in the beginning, reducing in entertainment the further along it proceeds, with Nagato’s grating voice persistent from start to finishFinal Score: 4/10', 'This is not a ""what if Kyon stayed in the other world"" scenario. This is a ""what if the genre and narrative changed"" scenario.I have watched the original series and movie and am a huge fan of it, but that being said, one should go into this show with an open mind and realize that this isn\'t the same show. If you hold onto your belief that the old characters will come back and do SOS Brigade shenanigans, then you shouldn\'t watch as the entire premise is different. There is no bigger picture or universal scale events, just an eccentric girl crushing on a...guy that helped her at the library.P.S. - I just finished writing this review and re-read the synopsis. Don\'t trust that, it\'s wrong. At no point is the literature club in danger. I don\'t find Asakura to be perky, that makes it sound like she\'s energetic which is wrong; she\'s closer to a doting onee-san. And what\'s this ""court her crush"" thing? It should be ""wanting to get closer to the person you admire"" type of thing. Not outright seeking romance, but to further develop their relationship. Why are Tsuruya and Mikuru described like that? They\'re literally just friends that like to visit; the synopsis makes them sound like annoying antagonists when they really only get like 4 appearances. MAL descriptions can be weird sometimes.Story (8/10):So, that being said, it\'s not like it\'s a special story. Girl meets boy, they go to the same school, same club, and try to get closer. While there is progress there by the end of the series, the story is primarily character driven where we can see the changes that occur within characters over the course of the series. Unlike many other shows of this nature, the beginning and ending of the series show clear developments have been made.Art (8/10):Haha, I\'ve seen that a lot of people are put off by the change in art style. If such a small thing bothers you then okay, don\'t bother watching. It should be obvious to not expect a KyoAni art style and to instead expect a style that fits a school, slice of life, romance, comedy. I for one think the art style suits the narrative well. Bubbly and light like Nagato\'s new easy-going personality.Sound (8/10):As a slice of life, the selection of music leans towards the light, relaxing side. In terms of direction, I find it to be used well in general. No spots where it seemed out of place and listening to Chihara Minori sing is always a pleasure.Character (9/10):To address the elephant in the room, yes, Nagato\'s character has changed significantly from the original. Is this a bad thing? No of course not, I gave it a 9. Imagine if alien Nagato starred in this show; it\'d be ultra boring. Alien Nagato works well in the original because we know she\'s an alien with orders to not stand out but is over time more affected by emotions that she didn\'t realize she had. To expect the SAME THING from a different show despite using the same characters is nonsense. Her background, personality, mission/goals, and growth are COMPLETELY different, thus the change in character to one that fits better and is frankly more entertaining in this setting.Aside from the elephant, the other characters are actually pretty faithful to their original personalities with some minor changes: Haruhi is not as lacking in empathy, Asakura is not unsettling, Asahina is not a baby nor does she suffer any great pains or abuse at the hands of Haruhi, and Kyon isn\'t as sarcastic. The dynamic that worked well in the original apply to here as well with the addition of Asakura who fills the void of voice of reason. Likable people all around.Enjoyment (9/10):The only reason this isn\'t 10 is because it was sorta slow sometimes. Enough that it was noticeable, but not enough to takeaway immersion. Seeing the dorky actions of Nagato was endearing and seeing relationships beyond mere club members was nice. The prominent arc later in the series (Disappearance) especially takes the experience to another level. To achieve a drastic change in tone and narrative without disturbing the flow or suspension of disbelief is incredible and deserves praise. Direction is taken up a few notches and the new character introduced is quickly likable despite the differences from the main cast.Overall (9/10):Don\'t expect SOS Brigade shenanigans here. As its own standalone, this show stands up well. A slightly different yet familiar setting makes this an easy watch to enjoy. By all means, think of it as an alternate world, but that means to... think of it as an alternate world. They may not be the same as you knew them, but deep down, they\'re still the dorks we love. guy that helped her at the library.P.S. - I just finished writing this review and re-read the synopsis.

The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki -Chan evaded me for awhile so I was really curious as to what it was about. From what I saw it did not meet with rave reviews, but I still wanted to see it anyway, just in case Haruhi was not in it.I have always enjoyed Yuki as a character, she was always overshadowed by Haruhi and at times seemed to blend into the background noise, and the Yuki in...this show was very similar. A small timid, if somewhat clumsy girl who tries to find love amidst the usual high school rom-com atmosphere that seems to typify a lot of anime of this genre. Not a lot goes on during the first 10 episodes, in fact you could probably condense it into a third of that length because we have really seen it all before. Unfortunately Haruhi raises her head and that was where my hackles rose because that was the last thing I needed to see. I am not a fan of Haruhi as a character, but early in this series he does not seem to be that overbearing irritating main character that she was in everything else.Artwork is simple, soft lighting and simple designs, and at times I really liked it, but I did find the overly white faces a bit jarring; what were they trying to convey? I also felt that there was a lot of skipping over detail, and rehashing of scenes. At times the story is boring, but I did like the Yuki I was seeing here, she was shy and soft and just that little bit vulnerable, missing the efficient, machinelike Yuki from the original series. Kyon was like he always was. A likable guy who seems to spend the time trying to appease and get along with the girls who he is surrounded by, and being used as a handy punchbag/scapegoat/skivvy by everybody except Yuki and Miss Asahina. Oh yes, she is there, and her character is pretty similar to what we are used to, although she just makes a token appearance when required to. I was pleased that Kyon's sister also makes an appearance too, she was always good for a surprise moment.ED is wonderful, although I did not really notice the OP.And then there is episode 11-13: and these three episodes were really what it was about, everything else was just filler. I especially liked the poignant moments in 13. I think you could probably get away with watching 10-13 without missing any of the earlier episodes. Everything after 13 seems like a rehash of something we have seen before.The big question is: Why? Why did they make this in the first place? It really does not lend anything to the franchise and frankly it pales in significance to the original Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and is nowhere as good as The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. My guess it is to cash in on the popularity of the former and latter (and trying to deflect criticism of the woeful Endless Eight).I rated it a 7 because I did enjoy it and I was feeling generous, but that was because I am a Yuki fan, but other than that? it was OK. Not great, just OK. There is a lot better out there, and I am afraid that any follow up will probably slip past my radar with nary a glimpse. this show was very similar. A small timid, if somewhat clumsy girl who tries to find love amidst the usual high school rom-com atmosphere that seems to typify a lot of anime of this genre. Not a lot goes on during the first 10 episodes, in fact you could probably condense it into a third of that length because we have really seen it all before. Unfortunately Haruhi raises her head and that was where my hackles rose because that was the last thing I needed to see.

Well, Actually 10 episodes of Hell, after which we got what we came for.Thing is, you will only watch this Anime if you are a Haruhi watcher, which is fine enough, but the problem was that we were expecting a lot different than what we got.First was the animation change, I mean ofc we will not get excellent quality like KyoAni, but the animation really stuck with me in a bad way, the voice artists were same so it was ok, but Kyon's face was butchered by making...it plain. Yuki looked different (will talk about it later) and only Koizumi, Haruhi and Mikuru had same look.But apart from animation, main problem was the story, I have read the Manga too, and the story seriously sucks a lot in the first arc. I get that the writer is literally not a Romance type guy as the romance grandly sucks in comparison to the master piece of the weirdness that follows in 2nd arc.Talking about Yuki herself, they destroyed her with making her meek and awkward, if they followed and made Yuki more like the Yuki we know, it would be best. I mean I undy they made the new one meek and silent, but the silent Yuki in Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was far better than this one. Another thing is the Perspective change from Kyon's to Yuki/Free one, we don't get Kyon's or Yuki's inner monologue and that's why most of the time it feels empty.Biggest problem is the romance of this Anime, the current Yuki is so boring that ultimately we ship Haruhi and Kyon unilaterally as well, their chemistry still hits at next level. Yuki's relationship is forced upon us and Kyon, best example is Valentine's pre-day episode and valentine's episode. Then when the shit happens, then the relationship is far, way far better than Haruhi X Kyon, I mean we all fantasied Yuki and Kyon's relationship. The rating increased from 4-5 to 8 for me after the actual Disappearance of Nagato Yuki.... Why they waited so long?If they had Yuki's character unchanged and then used Kyon to change her; or if they had total 12 episodes with turning point in ep 7, then this Anime would be cult classic and got 10/10 instead of 6/10.... Again, it's more like story's fault but at the end, an average watcher will not love this, we wanted Yuki Nagato soft, cold version, not Onodera Kosaki light version....At the end, I would ask you to watch first 2 episodes, then from episode 11 till the end, it plain.

It\'s also a giant middle finger to everyone who wanted a 3rd ""real"" season of Haruhi.[POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS FOR THE HARUHI SERIES, BUT NOT THIS SHOW (though I can\'t imagine why you\'d even be here if you haven\'t seen the original)]Where to begin? Let\'s star with our main charater, Yuki Nagato. I\'ll do my best to refrain from making this whole review just a comparison to the original, but the stark contrast in characterization between this show and the original in the character of Yuki Nagato is...just astounding. Originally, Yuki was a direct homage/shout-out to Neon Genesis Evangelion\'s Rei Ayanami, being a very quiet, passive bookworm emotionless-girl character. She did occasionally display hints of emotion however (much like Rei), which is what made her interesting. However, the main character of this show (whom I\'ll be referring to as Yuki-chan) is a completely different character. Yuki-chan is some kind of hopeless romantic who has barely any depth and doesn\'t even read books (preferring video games instead). Let me repeat that, SHE DOESN\'T EVEN READ BOOKS.Let me back up a bit. Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu (or NYcnS) is loosely based on an alternate universe which was a major plot point in the Disappearance arc of Haruhi canon. In it, everyone is ""normal."" A notable feature of it is that Yuki is no longer ""emotionless"" but rather acts more like a human being should, and the rest of her personality (being an extremely quiet and reclusive bookworm) is left in tact. She still reads books! NYcnS more or less uses this universe as its setting, with the main difference being that the main character Kyon doesn\'t realize anything is wrong (and is also no longer the main character... more on him later).But the thing is, NYcnS\'s version of Yuki doesn\'t even use the canon Disappearance-arc AU Yuki. As I said, she doesn\'t even read books. Instead, she\'s more of just a generic moé blob who has an obvious crush on a classmate, and happens to share Yuki\'s general appearance. All subtlety and depth to her character are gone. Her defining character traits are gone. Actually, why was she even in the literature club in the first place? I don\'t recall the show ever explaining this.But enough about Yuki-chan, there\'s plenty more wrong with this show.I won\'t pretend that the original series was perfect, or that its characters were especially well developed, but NYcnS somehow makes them all even more bland and forgettable than before. This is reflected rather well in the equally generic and bland art style. Art-wise, ex-main character Kyon might be the biggest victim, looking almost nothing like he did and instead looking like a bland anime boy (more so than normal). Where before, Kyon was the viewpoint-character of the series, whose deadpan-snarker personality and inner-monologue quips added a lot of humor to the show and made him a fun audience surrogate character that stands out from most. But now, with him being merely a supporting character, whose thoughts we can\'t hear, he\'s become pretty pointless, generic, and bland. Kyon\'s only function in the story now is to be the object of Yuki-chan\'s desires. I know I\'ve been using words like ""bland"" and ""generic"" a lot, but those words pretty much sum up this whole show.Throughout the show, there are numerous references and shout-outs to the original series, but the problem is that they all just make me wish I was watching that instead. The most egregious example is when someone says something like ""someone I know threw a murder-mystery event last year as a joke."" (referencing a mini-arc from the original) Wow, that sounds fun! Much more fun than whatever we\'re doing right now. Gee, I wish we could be watching that instead.Another big glaring problem with this show is how much it relies on bad anime tropes and cliches. The original at least had the ""well, Haruhi wishes it to be that way"" justification hand-wave, but this show has no excuse. I know I\'ve been comparing it to the original a lot, but I would like to stress that I do not think this show works on its own either. The comedy is weak and the story is so forgettable I barely even remember there being one.The thing is, I really don\'t have a problem with this *type* of show, in that a light-hearted rom-com set in high school can be, and sometimes is, a lot of fun, even without much depth. The problem is that there just isn\'t anything interesting here. Really, what\'s the point of this show existing? Who sat down and said ""lets make a more boring version of Haruhi"" ? There are plenty more canon Haruhi light novels that haven\'t been adapted, why did they instead go with this? Imagine if there was an X-Files spinoff, where Mulder and Scully weren\'t FBI agents and nothing supernatural ever happened, and also Scully had a vastly different personality and Mulder didn\'t care about supernatural stuff at all. You\'d say ""but wait, why are the characters even called Mulder and Skully? There\'s nothing X-Files about this."" That\'s basically this show.All in all, not worth you time, whether you\'re a fan of the Haruhi series or not. I\'ve seen worse, but there are so many better shows in this genre.

That show has basically become my life as a whole. I love the show, the movie, and the Haruhi chan spinoff. I figured I would love the Disappearance of Nagato Yuki chan just as much, as I love all the characters, and couldn't wait to see all my children in action again. Long story short, I was thoroughly disappointed.First off, THERE IS NO WAY TO SUCCESSFULLY MAKE A HARUHI SUZUMIYA SERIES WITHOUT SCI FI STUFF! The sci fi stuff is the thing I love most about the series, which kinda turned me...off about the series. For another thing, making the series a cheesy romance was NOT ok. I get some people enjoy romance, and as much as romance is not my favorite genre, the romance isn't what I hate. Haruhi Suzumiya was not meant to be a romance. That's what I hate.Next, the characters. I love the characters in Haruhi Suzumiya. Now, I haven't finished the series yet, and probably won't, but from where I am, the characters seem totally different, and not the same children I adopted. Tsuruya and Haruhi basically just rape Mikuru all the time, which I get Haruhi kinda did in Melancholy, but Tsuruya didn't do that. Mikuru is too weak, and is just there to be raped and add sex appeal, which is NOT her role in the Melancholy. Yuki shows FAR too much emotion, which I get she's capable of that here, but she shouldn't show that much of it. Minor emotion, people. Give her some, but not too much. Small bits of it. Kyon is too oblivious to emotions, more so than in the Melancholy, and Itsuki's too much of a pushover. Only Asakura feels right.The animation of the series on its own isn't that bad. Not my favorite animation in a show, but not terrible. However, it's too different from the animation in the Melancholy, and just feels wrong. Its not like the drawings are bad, the characters just don't look right.The music actually isn't all bad, unlike the rest of the series. I mean, the ending song was kinda REALLY bad. Too slow, and didn't fit with the rest of the show. However, the opening was GREAT. Everything someone could want in an opening theme. Between the super upbeat music and the flashy pictures, someone can completely forget how much they feel like gouging their eyes out while watching and enjoy the music. The opening was the ONLY thing in the series that I actually enjoyed.Long story short: I you're a fan of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and hate cheesy romance stuff, DON'T watch this series.

You'll regret it, and waste your life."", ""Ahh the Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan; the latest literary warfare of the S.S. Yuki X Kyon. And let me tell you, it throws quite a punch. Much has been said about this series. Just go to its MAL page and the score says a lot. But why is that? Well, let’s try to break down where does this series stand, shall we?This is a SPIN-OFF (I’ll be using caps ‘cause I can’t use underlines) of an existing story that was last updated by its author 4 years ago since the release of this anime adaptation. Spin-offs are usually an author playing with a what-if scenario...from a story (in this case, Yuki X Kyon shipment) and trying to write a cohesive narrative out of it. And while true, the Haruhism community is still alive and kicking, basing from the people I’ve talked to, they are a minority (at least, outside Japan). So basically this is a story that is pandering to only a specific people from an already miniscule community. And oh yeah, it has 16 episodes. This went on in my mind prior to the release, thinking “it must be a pretty good story to be given this kind of luxury.” But like Haruhi, the guys in the production have no idea about the term “moderation”.Riding on the impression that this adaptation will carry the same spirit of the original series, I was greeted with a snore fest at the start more intense than a math teacher giving lectures in a monotone voice. The setting, as it is, is boring. But the thing about it is it’s supposed to be boring. The setting was taken from the alternate universe in the Disappearance arc of the original series and the reason that it works so well on the original story was because of an X Factor: Kyon. Kyon was the reason living in such a peaceful world feels ironically uneasy. He was the reason that being in that place was a distress. This in turn gave a unique predicament and, of course, an interesting story. But this spin-off seemed to capitalize on the dependent variable of that setup (i.e. boring world) and tried to make it work. Our man (or in this case, maiden) of the hour is one Yuki Nagato: the super shy, game-playing version. The story revolves around her confessing her love for Kyon and 164 other shoujo romance clichés.Thankfully though, the story does pick up… by a mere TEN EPISODES LATER (good grief, that’s worse than endless eight). And when it does pick up, the series can actually tell a good story. But now the question is: “Why did it take 10 episodes for the story to get interesting?” because trust me, if those 10 episodes were at least entertaining, I wouldn’t be asking that, and I'm a pretty lenient person. There was an introduction of characters who we’ve already known and retelling of the adventures of the S.O.S. Brigade told, of course, differently ─But the changes they’ve made weren’t anything substantial or intriguing.With how the story played out, we could’ve immediately jumped from episode 4 to episode 10. Ignoring the obvious reason of cha-ching, the only defense I can say about the 10-episode thing is nostalgia. But it’s hard to appreciate the gesture when it’s not the same studio who did it (it’s Studio Satelight who did this one). And as we all know, for legal reasons, they cannot use the original looks on KyoAni’s adaptation. And don’t give me the “It’s to bring in a new crowd” bullcrap because again, it’s a SPIN-OFF and not one that represents the original series too well.(Edited:) AND SPEAKING ABOUT ORIGINAL LOOKS, art. Right, I forgot about this one. This is one factor that should also be an interesting subject. As said before, due to the series being handed to a different studio, the art of the characters have to be changed. And this metamorphosis was the brainchild of Ito Ikuko. So whether or not you liked her work, the responsibility of receiving your sentiment belongs to her. In my experience, the art did take some time to get used to, but it seems that Kyon's face was on hard mode as it was the one that took me the longest to, for lack of a better word, accept (actually if you look at it, there was a gradual elongation of Kyon's face throughout the series as the studio's response to the problem). But to Ms. Ito's credit, her rendition of the characters resembled closer to the one on the spin-off manga (this is based from the manga's cover that I've seen). Moving on, the overall art style had the saturation taken up a notch (as opposed to the original adaptation) as most of the scenes in the series are done with pop and bright colors fitting of a standard slice-of-life anime with the exception for some of the scenes in the disappearance arc in order to match the tone.(Not edited anymore, sorry about that:) Despite the many elements that makes this a bad successor on one of the most popular series in the late 2000’s, let’s give credit where credit’s due. At least there was a tiny effort to make those 10 episodes worth enduring. I say tiny because unless you’ve read the many iterations of the series and are super analytic about it, you’ll never notice it, or be glad that you noticed it. There’s also the effort of making the voice actors and actresses (even of the English dub) reprise their roles that was super cool. Add to that, some of the soundtracks from KyoAni’s adaptation got to be played here (so KyoAni DOES care). Actually, when you have little-to-no care about the narrative of the story, you start to notice its technicalities and that brought about my appreciation of this series’ OST which was a huge help on me finishing this. And lastly, the sequencing and direction on the “Disappearance of Yuki-chan” arc. There was a scene (which I’m not gonna put effort to find which specific episode) where there’s just sequences of imagery. You hear no dialogue, just the soundtrack but you can understand everything that’s happening. Like I said, they’ve made the effort of making it interesting and it’s rare you see that in any visual medium, not excluding anime.So it all comes down to my final verdict. Is it worth your time? That is a definite NO ─ with exceptions. If it wasn’t clear already, this is for the fans of the YukiXKyon ship so if you’re all aboard on that then you’ll probably like this one. If not, then it would take a lot of your fandom energy to find this interesting. Probably the best way to enjoy this is watching up to episode 4 then skip to 10 onward like I said. from a story (in this case, Yuki X Kyon shipment) and trying to write a cohesive narrative out of it. And while true, the Haruhism community is still alive and kicking, basing from the people I’ve talked to, they are a minority (at least, outside Japan). So basically this is a story that is pandering to only a specific people from an already miniscule community. And oh yeah, it has 16 episodes. This went on in my mind prior to the release, thinking “it must be a pretty good story to be given this kind of luxury.” But like Haruhi, the guys in the production have no idea about the term “moderation”.Riding on the impression that this adaptation will carry the same spirit of the original series, I was greeted with a snore fest at the start more intense than a math teacher giving lectures in a monotone voice. The setting, as it is, is boring. But the thing about it is it’s supposed to be boring. The setting was taken from the alternate universe in the Disappearance arc of the original series and the reason that it works so well on the original story was because of an X Factor: Kyon. Kyon was the reason living in such a peaceful world feels ironically uneasy. He was the reason that being in that place was a distress. This in turn gave a unique predicament and, of course, an interesting story. But this spin-off seemed to capitalize on the dependent variable of that setup (i.e. boring world) and tried to make it work. Our man (or in this case, maiden) of the hour is one Yuki Nagato: the super shy, game-playing version. The story revolves around her confessing her love for Kyon and 164 other shoujo romance clichés.Thankfully though, the story does pick up… by a mere TEN EPISODES LATER (good grief, that’s worse than endless eight). And when it does pick up, the series can actually tell a good story. But now the question is: “Why did it take 10 episodes for the story to get interesting?” because trust me, if those 10 episodes were at least entertaining, I wouldn’t be asking that, and I'm a pretty lenient person. There was an introduction of characters who we’ve already known and retelling of the adventures of the S.O.S. Brigade told, of course, differently ─But the changes they’ve made weren’t anything substantial or intriguing.With how the story played out, we could’ve immediately jumped from episode 4 to episode 10. Ignoring the obvious reason of cha-ching, the only defense I can say about the 10-episode thing is nostalgia. But it’s hard to appreciate the gesture when it’s not the same studio who did it (it’s Studio Satelight who did this one). And as we all know, for legal reasons, they cannot use the original looks on KyoAni’s adaptation. And don’t give me the “It’s to bring in a new crowd” bullcrap because again, it’s a SPIN-OFF and not one that represents the original series too well.(Edited:) AND SPEAKING ABOUT ORIGINAL LOOKS, art. Right, I forgot about this one. This is one factor that should also be an interesting subject. As said before, due to the series being handed to a different studio, the art of the characters have to be changed. And this metamorphosis was the brainchild of Ito Ikuko. So whether or not you liked her work, the responsibility of receiving your sentiment belongs to her. In my experience, the art did take some time to get used to, but it seems that Kyon's face was on hard mode as it was the one that took me the longest to, for lack of a better word, accept (actually if you look at it, there was a gradual elongation of Kyon's face throughout the series as the studio's response to the problem). But to Ms. Ito's credit, her rendition of the characters resembled closer to the one on the spin-off manga (this is based from the manga's cover that I've seen). Moving on, the overall art style had the saturation taken up a notch (as opposed to the original adaptation) as most of the scenes in the series are done with pop and bright colors fitting of a standard slice-of-life anime with the exception for some of the scenes in the disappearance arc in order to match the tone.(Not edited anymore, sorry about that:) Despite the many elements that makes this a bad successor on one of the most popular series in the late 2000’s, let’s give credit where credit’s due. At least there was a tiny effort to make those 10 episodes worth enduring. I say tiny because unless you’ve read the many iterations of the series and are super analytic about it, you’ll never notice it, or be glad that you noticed it. There’s also the effort of making the voice actors and actresses (even of the English dub) reprise their roles that was super cool. Add to that, some of the soundtracks from KyoAni’s adaptation got to be played here (so KyoAni DOES care). Actually, when you have little-to-no care about the narrative of the story, you start to notice its technicalities and that brought about my appreciation of this series’ OST which was a huge help on me finishing this. And lastly, the sequencing and direction on the “Disappearance of Yuki-chan” arc. There was a scene (which I’m not gonna put effort to find which specific episode) where there’s just sequences of imagery. You hear no dialogue, just the soundtrack but you can understand everything that’s happening.

It takes the premise of the movie - using an alternate dimension where this show's protagonist is a normal girl - and gives her a somewhat normal life. It borrows some great characters, and puts a new, shoujo-ish rom-com spin on the show with a new story.Most of the characters are preserved nicely enough. Haruhi, strangely, translates even better than in the original show, showing a sense of humanity and being something other than a plot device. She's learned empathy. Koizumi is the strange, awkwardly smiling...idiot from before. Mikuru is still a big blog of kawaii, if not even more kawaii with the new studio lending their trademark cutesy animation style (to a mixed reception). Unfortunately, screen time for our old club members is shot and they lose their half-episode monologues, so become firm members of the supporting cast. The various other members of the backline such as Tsuruya are basically the same and aren't worth writing about.The problems come from the leads. Our old protagonist, our new protagonist and Ryouko.Kyon is almost exactly the same. However, whereas before he was simultaneously the catalyst and the cure for the chaos, keeping a level head for the audience, he is now just a chill guy doing normal things with some sarcastic remarks.Ryouko is very good side-lead-character material, and the show does develop her character. Unfortunately, her character is pretty much dominated by the few character-traits that we saw in the original show; her mothering quality and her psychotic qualities, and it ramps these up to annoying. It's nice to see a character so briefly seen given some new screentime, but I wished they were more daring and introduced a new side to her, and actually expanded upon the source material.Because they didn't even do that with our protagonist, Yuki Nagato. If you watched the movie, you'll remember her alternate personality. It's the same, and no where near enough to be the leading persona.She's dainty and wimpy and does nothing of her own accord. She's not very funny. She doesn't inspire change in the show's plotline. It's hard to care about her. The only thing going for her is her crush on Kyon, which is kinda generic for the genre.In fact, as far as the genre goes, it's bland and cliche. Every single club-anime trope makes an appearance, and unlike when the source material did it, no unique spin is added. The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan aims for average and barely lands.The story plods along for 6 or 7 episodes in the exact same territory you've been used to for years. When the old club members and Haruhi come into the show, it becomes a bit more interesting, though nothing above mediocre, decently charming trash.When it finally does something different, it goes the extra mile, taking a leaf out of the original show to write an arc using some of the trippy imagery that Kyon was forced to witness. It's so poorly written and repetitive that it becomes frustrating, and carries barely any interest. It's not like it's even an evolution of the narrative (I had to check I hadn't missed something like a post-credit scene), and relies solely on a random event outside of the character's control to even happen.After a misstep that could have been refreshing, we go back to normal, almost as if nothing's happened, for a generic firework's episode. I'm not sure what else I expected.The thing that made this watchable was the wink-wink nudges. The jokes referencing the 28, solid episodes. The returning musical hooks.

There are.I have been able to gain some smirking and leisure smiling off of it.My opinion in whole is based on the fact that i have finished the show in a streak with the original plus the movie, all in chronological order (as i always do; bingecore-coma-coming!). So i am biased as the emotions are fresh and i am able to see where it fits...nicely and where it is too vague.

This anime is a blatant attempt to milk the viewership of its predecessors, tossing the cast into an utterly mediocre high-school anime and forgetting everything that made the original series good in the first place. Even the characters are changed to fit into this most mundane trope: Kyon is now a typical male love interest, Nagato a shy girl, and Haruhi a forgettable side character. Disposing of these key personalities as well as any supernatural underpinnings, Yuki-chan is a disappointment. I would recommend...avoiding this anime!Just as a note, the series description implies that Yuki-chan takes place in the alternative world seen in the Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi film.

Does this sound familiar? Yuki-chan takes this mediocre trope and works it to death. Only the final plot arc seems to have any forward momentum, but that is obliterated by the empty finale.Pacing [4/10]: Yuki-chan is paced just a tad better than the Endless Eight arc. In fact, you might say that the development of Nagato\'s character proceeds at around the same rate.Art [7/10]: Nothing spectacular, the artwork in Yuki-chan certainly can\'t salvage this series.Sound [6/10]: The soundtrack is standard fare for high school anime.Character [4/10]: Not only are the characters plain and undistinguished, they also overwrite the fun personalities created in Melancholy. The show spends plenty of screen time on the relationship between the two main characters without forming a strong emotional connection between them. In fact, the single rooftop scene in Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi between Kyon and Nagato is more satisfying than the entirety of Yuki-chan.Enjoyment [4/10]: I watched the entirety of Yuki-chan waiting for them to bring back the refreshing elements of Melancholy, to no avail.

Halfway into the series, I couldn\'t grasp the plot of it. One could claim that the plot is about Nagato\'s attempts to overcome her uncertainty and confess her feelings to Kyon. However, this happened to be a tiny part of this mess of a show and could be summed up in the three episodes bearing the name of the series. 3 out of 16. Moreover, the show contains at least one of each cliche episodes in the anime industry, namely a hot springs episode (a couple of them), a beach episode, and a summer festival episode. The series also rehashes some of the original one\'s episodes, which is plain plagiarism and shows a lack or originality. It is in the end of episode 9 when they finally decided to throw in some conflict which, however, was vague as hell and resolved ITSELF in 3 episodes. Pathetic.As for the characters, they are as shallow as the story. As much as I wasn\'t a fan of the original series, I could still find charm in some of the characters, like Kyon and Nagato. This spin off, however, destroys the personalities of the characters and replaces them with cardboard ones (probably to suit the shallowness of the plot). No one in the main cast acts like ""themselves"", especially Kyon, Haruhi and Nagato. I liked Kyon in the original series, but I find him spineless here. And Haruhi was the bane of the original show, while here I don\'t care about her. Even in the episodes where she plays a major role, I still can\'t find her as annoying as I used to in the main series. The most ruined character, unfortunately, is Nagato. I understand that this series is supposed to be a parallel universe existing in the course of The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi movie, but as far as I remember, the human Nagato from the movie wasn\'t the same person as the Nagato from this spin off - the movie Nagato was better. The rest of the cast is even worse, but at least they weren\'t that important in the main series either. Mikuru exists in the story only to swoon and to have her breasts fondled by the rest of the girls. Tsuruya is there to tease Mikuru and to provide an excuse for the characters to visit the beach and a hot springs resort (since her family owns them). Itsuki is reduced to the ""other guy"" with questionable orientation - a common archetype in stories with five main characters where two of them are boys, the one being the protagonist. Ryouko is the only character that had more appeal to me than she did in the main series, but even she was just the overused archetype of the ""onee-san"".As for the art and sound, I\'m gonna sum them up in one paragraph, for I didn\'t find anything in them worthy of an own paragraph. All in all, they were mediocre. The art was plain compared to the original series and the character designs were kind of unsymmetrical. Overused, as well. The animation was cheap with nothing especially well animated. The sound was forgettable, the songs were annoying, especially the OP song. The ED was better, but still mediocre. I liked that they hired the original VAs, but that\'s all. Anyone, who knows what I value the most in an anime, will understand my rating based only on this paragraph.As for my enjoyment, it was nonexistent as the plot. This show is not even some mindless watch. Shounen series with crisp animation and lots of fighting are that (at least to me). Nagato Yuki-chan was plain boring, so much that I have been stalling it for more than a year.Overall, I knew the series was going to be bad and I went into it with low expectations, but it didn\'t help. If you are a fan of the original series, you may find some appeal in it, or you may feel cheated depending on your expectations. However, don\'t expect it to be even an ounce similar to the main series. Nagato Yuki-chan is a boring SoL compared to the mystery and fantasy of the original anime. to be a total disaster of a show. I don\'t usually like Slice of Life shows, except when they are good. Well, Nagato Yuki-chan is definitely not a good SoL. I knew I\'ll be bored watching it, I knew I\'ll stop every 2 episodes to get a snack, and I knew I\'m gonna rate it low.

I get it that there are fans who like Nagato, so she got this spin-off, but THIS Nagato is not even the same character that people like. She doesn't have the same personality. This Nagato is just a boring dandere type that has no charm of the original Nagato.And when Haruhi appears on the show, the dandere Nagato got overshadowed completely.So this spin-off has no value to the fans of Nagato, and also is a waste of time for the fans of the Haruhi series in general.

But even more than that, there\'s almost no twists to the story whatsoever, almost every situation in the show was already exploited in the original story but with a much better execution and especially with better writing.Therefore almost every plot device and character struggle in the show was ripped straight from the original work and given a simple make-over.Characters: 5Another big problem with this anime is the fact there\'s no protagonist. Nagato the main character is very weak in terms of personality so the story balances around various different characters never making a statement of whose story are we actually watching.Even worse, Nagato barely has any character development. From the first episode to the last she is exactly the same person, the very shy girl in the beginning is the exact same very shy girl by the end.But is not just Nagato that suffers from lack of development, despite the diverse and rich cast of characters absolutely no one in the show is developed in any significant way. The cast of characters that were previously so compelling and witty (especially Kyon) are now a poor shadow of their former selves.Sound/Soundtrack: 6No problem in terms in terms of sound effects as everything sounded fine but the soundtrack on the other hand is very unremarkable, although it reuses some tunes from the previous anime to give a sense of familiarity.Art/Animation: 6The art is different than the previous installments and for the worse in my opinion.

I read a volume of the manga a few years ago and loved it, so when I found out it was an anime I excitedly decided to watch it. I can with full confidence say that the manga is infinitely better than this garbage.This anime is legitimately insulting to the viewer\'s intelligence. 90% of scenes just devolve into Yuki being all cute and shy and flustered in a ""cute"", simplistic art style. I usually find these sorts of scenes cringy anyway, but it\'s...so much worse in this anime. The attempts at comedy and cuteness are so pathetic that I stopped watching due to this alone. Not to mention the fact that all of the characters are completely insufferable.If you are reading this and considering watching: PLEASE read the manga instead of subjecting yourself to this torture. so much worse in this anime. The attempts at comedy and cuteness are so pathetic that I stopped watching due to this alone. Not to mention the fact that all of the characters are completely insufferable.If you are reading this and considering watching: PLEASE read the manga instead of subjecting yourself to this torture.', 'First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Before specific comment I\'ll say how to think of this spin-off as in comparison to original Haruhi series. In a sense this is a pseudo alternate universe prequel of Yuki story. (but it isn\'t). It\'s a cute moeblob anime with blander art style of modern day anime. So think of it as reskined Haruhi anime into modern moeblob with nostalgia of Haruhi. Moving on now onto anime specific comments.StoryHonestly, I was\'t too fond of it at the start, first 3 episodes or so felt like some really...mediocre moeblob Anime. But then I somehow grew onto it and at certain point it had quite dramatic ""arc"", that also gave nostalgia feel of old Haruhi series. So anyhow, it\'s mostly the usual thing. Cute girl and bunch of sidekicks doing their daily activities, club activities and so on. Then we get a piece of romance and drama.  I would say romance was quite the average part in here, but the dramatic part that came on really made me bump up the score. (moeblob part of the anime was between 5 and 6, while dramatic I loved, that would been 8. Thus the average of 7) Anyhow, story was enjoyable and satisfying enough finale.ArtArt is something hate or love. Old Haruhi series had really nice art and on top of that movie was superb. Whilst this Anime is ""modern bland moeblob"". It just felt odd seeing Haruhi in such manner. Wasn\'t that fond of it, but the comedic value reactions and expressions made up for it.Sound2 parts here to mention. Voice acting and soundtrack/music. Voice acting is something that felt odd. First sentences that Kyon uttered made me instantly think ""Gintoki what are you doing here"" so I though ""maybe voice acting cast has changed"". And for my own surprise cast remained same as in the old Haruhi, which really confused me as I couldn\'t recognize any of the characters. Well it\'s been years since I watched Haruhi so maybe their voices changed, microphones somewhat affected voice and so on.. But yeah, voice acting was great for most part.OST/music, was actually quite okay and good. Did really love the piano tracks though.CharacterI think most personalities remained pretty similar to old Haruhi, with only difference of Nagato being shy moeblob here. With a bit nostalgia trip later on. Haruhi is obnoxious as always in somewhat satisfying/enjoyable way. Kyon with usual ""slapstick straight man act"" and rest of characters weren\'t really to complain either about. Point being, characters were enjoyable.So to sum up, it was a more of odd enjoyment, that at start felt mediocre, but in the end was enjoyable experience. Did still love the odd humor in this show plus lot of great expressions and reactions. Did like old Haruhi more, but they aren\'t really the same thing. So for its part what it was.

I mean that in the best way possible with all of the positives and negatives that come with it.Viewing this show as a continuation or extension of the Haruhi Suzumiya is a recipe for disappointment. The Disappearance of Yuki-chan is honestly in a separate genre with a different objective and promise. It is a show that can be best described as being adjacent to Haruhi Suzumiya instead of what a traditional spin-off would imply. The promise of this show is that it explores a ""normal"" version of the cast of the Haruhi Suzumiya series...which most of all changes the tone. Most of the show is from the perspective of Yuki as opposed to Kyon. Changing from a sarcastic and at times scathing narrator to a more reserved perspective is the clearest difference. Instead of a zany light science fiction show we have a more traditional school romance-comedy.The attraction then comes form the characters who preserve much of their dynamic from the main series. While Kyon\'s more caustic traits are toned down and Yuki has lost her stoic distance, it is easy to think of these alterations as being the result of Haruhi\'s lesser influence on them as people. (And of course the fact that she is no longer God) It is ultimately necessary for the show to make these changes since they have changed both premise and genre. This character dynamic is of course slightly different; most notable in Kyon and Yuki\'s interaction, as well as other characters being more willing to check Haruhi. If one were watching this as an independent show, it would be at best above-average. However, the main appeal probably lies in seeing familiar characters interact in a new setting. The show captures this incredibly well, no doubt due to the return of the original cast which give a consistent and familiar performance in their roles.Ultimately, this show is meant for people who are fans of the series who are willing to see the same characters with a different premise. Accordingly, it also means willingness to accept a change in tone because of that. With that understanding, the Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is a fun watch but nothing really superb. It does not break new ground or try anything different. What it does attempt is executed competently and retains that character charm, though diluted because of the changes.If you are not a fan or unwilling to have a tonal change from the main Haruhi series then I would advise you to skip this or be prepared for a show that is a 5.5 or at best a 6 out of 10. If you are interested or willing to accept Yuki-chan\'s different promise then I can say it is worth the watch. Depending on how interested you are in the characters it can range from a weak to a strong 7 out of 10. which most of all changes the tone.

On the other side of that coin, it also works well as just a pleasant romance drama with none of the overly complicated religious tones, philosophy, pseudo-science and quantum string theory that were part of the majesty of the original series. So it’s a good introduction...to the characters that’s more accessible to the casual viewer.While Nagato is a vast departure from the monotone android from the original series, Kyon feels and plays exactly the same: a cynical teenager who can always find something to complain about, but deep down has a heart of gold. Asakura plays the warm, motherly figure she was portrayed as at the beginning of the first series, and it’s refreshing to see her character fleshed out, as opposed to the original where she . . . moved to Canada, by episode 3.Once all the familiar faces are re-introduced, the show plays like a basic high school romantic comedy. It doesn\'t take a lot of chances in that regard, but because the series this is based off encompasses so very much, this is a welcome departure to something that plays a little easier on the psyche. Of course many of the other side characters return, as well as fan favorites and a few Easter eggs for those who have read the other spin-offs of this franchise. But at the same time, someone who\'s never seen the original could watch this show and fall in love with it without knowing it\'s based on something else. I said to myself that it reads like ""what if"" fanfiction, but in the best possible way. It allows fans to see what these people would be like in a more real-world scenario instead of getting caught up in complicated time travel paradoxes. Instead of discussing what Haruhi is, how important she is, or what she means, you’ll see them have a Christmas party, go to the hot springs, or even just work up the courage to tell someone that they care. Here they’re just people being teenagers and growing up. So if you loved the original, or just want something easy-going to watch, I recommend ""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan."" to the characters that’s more accessible to the casual viewer.While Nagato is a vast departure from the monotone android from the original series, Kyon feels and plays exactly the same: a cynical teenager who can always find something to complain about, but deep down has a heart of gold.

Well to put it to short Kyon would’ve never met Haruhi, but instead gets closer to Nagato. The plot of the whole show is about the relationship between Nagato and Kyon, with the question during the series, can Nagato get Kyon to fall for her, and so for fourth they go and perform a huge range of normal...activities building their relationship. Pretty much everyone knows Nagato has a crush on Kyon, except Kyon himself, and everyone is playing wingman hoping to get the two together. Unfortunately for the story, nothing really happens, they go on do a various range of normal activities you find in a slice of life genre. The story does get interesting at episode 10 with the sudden shift in tone, turning it from a comedy to a drama. However this is short lived.So unfortunately the story is nothing special, it’s a simple romance story of can the girl get the guy. And the whole shot is like this for the majority of the time. Only at one part the story, it gets really interesting. At episode 10, things change up, because we get so used to this new world of Haruhi and get used the characters, but what happens when you take that away just for a bit. The show’s pace and tone changes drastically from a silly slice of life comedy to a supernatural drama. And unfortunately it is just for a bit, as the show changes back to its generic slice of life format. The show does have a slow start and doesn’t really get interesting until Haruhi arrives at episode 3, but it also has a rather underwhelming, unsatisfying ending. But seriously if it wasn’t for the fact that these were Haruhi characters, there’s not a lot going for this show.Characters - 6/10Yuki Nagato is the main character this time around in this universe. Unlike her character in Haruhi, she is more awkward and shy this time around. She gets nervous a lot when she gets close to Kyon. And she is also a gluttoness gamer girl that has the personality traits of a little girl, and that is kind of annoying as she can’t really do anything on her own. As the series progress, she gains more confidence in herself and she starts to become more opened to the people around her. Eventually wishing everything stays the same as it is, that is until episode 10, when she completely does a 180. For episode 10 to 13, Nagato personality changes to a more familiar appearance, resembling that of the mute, emotionless Nagato from Haruhi. And I love that the did this change to the plot up a bit, as we have gotten so use to the Nagato in this world, so it was very surprising to see her completely different suddenly.Kyon is Nagato’s primary love interest. And from a far we can tell, he is pretty much the same as he was in Haruhi, although he’s probably has a more laid back attitude. But pushing him from the main character to the plot device was kind of a detrimental to him. His interactions with Nagato felt rather force, and it seems as if the relationship was going nowhere. However he does get some good development towards the series end, especially during the Disappearance Arc and the last couple of episodes, where he felt like the main character. But other than that, nothing really changes.As far as supporting characters go, pretty much everyone from the original Haruhi are a part of it, with the addition of some others. Such as Ryouko Asakura who plays the role of a big sister and overbearing friend to Nagato. Maybe too supportive of Nagato, she doesn’t really do anything for herself as she is just trying to make Nagato happy. Haruhi Suzumiya makes a return as supporting character this time around. Although I love her interactions with Kyon because it shows reminisce from the original and it’s pretty comedic to watch, but it doesn’t really add too much to the storyline, because it’s seen from a different perspective, as we see her more of an annoyance. She’s still the energetic eccentric girl we know from the original though. Asahina and Koizumi return as well, but they get very little screen time this time around and have no development in the story whatsoever.Animation and Sound - 5/10, 7/10Seeing the characters that I’ve known to love was kind of hard at first, I did get used to the art style eventually but I don’t think the designs were that good to look at. The show was trying to be a very moe show, so the characters had a very cute design added towards them. Not that I mind them, but it was very distracting sometimes, especially during the disappearance arc. And Kyon’s design really distracted from his personality, as I don’t think it really fitted at all. The animation is rather standard it’s nothing special, but it’s not bad it runs smoothly, but at times the frame rates aren’t right. It spots a very moe art style, but the colours and designs are rather basic, there is not a lot of attention to detail in the art, especially when most of the scenes contain a lot of white or either bright.As for the soundtrack, it is neither memorable or forgettable as it does its job. There’s a great variety of music to be heard which really compliments the more light hearted comedic scenes. And the soundtrack gets better between episodes 10 and 13 because of the shift in tone. The opening theme is not that great, it fits the light hearted moe theme, but during those 4 episodes of the disappearance arc, it didn’t really belong. However the ending theme, although it didn’t really fit the general show, it was perfect for the disappearance arc. One thing I did love that Satelite did was the casting, they got the original cast from the original Haruhi series to do the voices for their characters, which I love because we’ve grown accustom to these characters and voices.Enjoyment - 6/10When I look back at what was the most enjoyable part of this show it all comes back to the Disappearance Arc, episodes 10 to 13. The best parts of the show was 10 to 13, because of the sudden change in pace and tone. However if it weren’t for the build-up pre episode 10, I didn’t think I would be as surprise as how it turned out. Yes it does take a while to get interesting as it’s really a generic romance slice of life to begin with, but those episodes, between 10 and 13 were the most heart-warming, intense and interesting  moments of the show. But that’s all there is, it’s a long build up and can get kind of boring with nothing happening at all for the most part. And the ending was kind of underwhelming as it kind of just ended. But if it wasn’t for the Haruhi characters I probably wouldn’t have had any interest in this show, simply I enjoyed this show because it contained Haruhi characters, that is it.Verdict - 6/10For the story I give it a 6, only because of the Disappearance Arc and how it completely surprised me, made was really interesting. But for the most part it plays a safe generic slice of life romance story. It does take a while to build up, but those 4 episodes were worth it. However the ending after it is underwhelming.For the animation and sound they get a 5 and a 7 from me. The art style is fine for the genre, but felt very unfitting to some of the characters, especially Kyon, and when the tone changed in the Disappearance Arc it was kind of hard to take everything to seriously. Also the fact the animation is nothing special, it is rather simple. The sound however did a good job fitting with the different scenarios. And it peaked during the Disappearance Arc. However the Opening the and Ending themes fitted only to a portion of the anime and they weren’t really all that memorable.The characters get 6 from me because like everything else seeing Nagato and Kyon in the disappearance arc really made things interesting and the show really needed it. And I love the interactions between Kyon and Haruhi. However nothing really happened for the rest of the characters of show, even the interaction between Nagato and Kyon felt like it was going nowhere.For my enjoyment of the show, I give it a 6. This would’ve been a 4 or lower if it didn’t have Haruhi characters and if it didn’t have the Disappearance Arc. Everything before the disappearance arc is fun to watch  for a bit, but it gets kind of repetitive. And honestly I just watched this show for the Haruhi characters, but I didn’t find the show as enjoyable as I could’ve had.So after rounding the scores up I give The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-Chan a 6/10. If weren’t for episodes 10 to 13, the show would’ve been a generic slice of life romance show with Haruhi characters. The story even though, it starts off slow, the surprise factor of the disappearance arc made things really interesting and I was really hooked on to it. I recommend this show to fans of the slice of life genre and romance genre for a simple basic anime with a surprise factor. However if you’ve never really enjoyed Haruhi, this would not change your opinion at all, so this is a fine skip able anime as well. And it was probably my most disappointing anime of Spring 2015, because I really wanted to enjoy Haruhi characters again. activities building their relationship. Pretty much everyone knows Nagato has a crush on Kyon, except Kyon himself, and everyone is playing wingman hoping to get the two together. Unfortunately for the story, nothing really happens, they go on do a various range of normal activities you find in a slice of life genre. The story does get interesting at episode 10 with the sudden shift in tone, turning it from a comedy to a drama. However this is short lived.So unfortunately the story is nothing special, it’s a simple romance story of can the girl get the guy. And the whole shot is like this for the majority of the time. Only at one part the story, it gets really interesting. At episode 10, things change up, because we get so used to this new world of Haruhi and get used the characters, but what happens when you take that away just for a bit. The show’s pace and tone changes drastically from a silly slice of life comedy to a supernatural drama. And unfortunately it is just for a bit, as the show changes back to its generic slice of life format. The show does have a slow start and doesn’t really get interesting until Haruhi arrives at episode 3, but it also has a rather underwhelming, unsatisfying ending. But seriously if it wasn’t for the fact that these were Haruhi characters, there’s not a lot going for this show.Characters - 6/10Yuki Nagato is the main character this time around in this universe. Unlike her character in Haruhi, she is more awkward and shy this time around. She gets nervous a lot when she gets close to Kyon. And she is also a gluttoness gamer girl that has the personality traits of a little girl, and that is kind of annoying as she can’t really do anything on her own. As the series progress, she gains more confidence in herself and she starts to become more opened to the people around her. Eventually wishing everything stays the same as it is, that is until episode 10, when she completely does a 180. For episode 10 to 13, Nagato personality changes to a more familiar appearance, resembling that of the mute, emotionless Nagato from Haruhi. And I love that the did this change to the plot up a bit, as we have gotten so use to the Nagato in this world, so it was very surprising to see her completely different suddenly.Kyon is Nagato’s primary love interest. And from a far we can tell, he is pretty much the same as he was in Haruhi, although he’s probably has a more laid back attitude. But pushing him from the main character to the plot device was kind of a detrimental to him. His interactions with Nagato felt rather force, and it seems as if the relationship was going nowhere. However he does get some good development towards the series end, especially during the Disappearance Arc and the last couple of episodes, where he felt like the main character. But other than that, nothing really changes.As far as supporting characters go, pretty much everyone from the original Haruhi are a part of it, with the addition of some others. Such as Ryouko Asakura who plays the role of a big sister and overbearing friend to Nagato. Maybe too supportive of Nagato, she doesn’t really do anything for herself as she is just trying to make Nagato happy. Haruhi Suzumiya makes a return as supporting character this time around. Although I love her interactions with Kyon because it shows reminisce from the original and it’s pretty comedic to watch, but it doesn’t really add too much to the storyline, because it’s seen from a different perspective, as we see her more of an annoyance. She’s still the energetic eccentric girl we know from the original though. Asahina and Koizumi return as well, but they get very little screen time this time around and have no development in the story whatsoever.Animation and Sound - 5/10, 7/10Seeing the characters that I’ve known to love was kind of hard at first, I did get used to the art style eventually but I don’t think the designs were that good to look at. The show was trying to be a very moe show, so the characters had a very cute design added towards them. Not that I mind them, but it was very distracting sometimes, especially during the disappearance arc. And Kyon’s design really distracted from his personality, as I don’t think it really fitted at all. The animation is rather standard it’s nothing special, but it’s not bad it runs smoothly, but at times the frame rates aren’t right. It spots a very moe art style, but the colours and designs are rather basic, there is not a lot of attention to detail in the art, especially when most of the scenes contain a lot of white or either bright.As for the soundtrack, it is neither memorable or forgettable as it does its job.

They\'ve taken the characters, rewritten it without any supernatural, took away the main draw (Haruhi) from most of the show, then created a superficial, horribly written character in Yukki Nagato.  The only respite that the story had was for a few episodes when Yukki went to the book-reading and confident girl that was somewhat reminiscent of the girl in the original series.And then the worst part?  They walked all over the original story and turned it into a derivative anime.  Standalone, it\'s decent.  But knowing what the...characters were in the previous show, this was disgusting to watch as the characters just threw away all of their individuality, leaving Kyon as the only respectable character in the end.  Even Haruhi was marginalized.Lastly, they tore down the most beautiful relationship that existed between Haruhi and Yukki.  They hinted at it but never took it anywhere, treating her as a side character that can be disposed of.  One of the most famous and wonderfully-written characters cast aside as trash.Just tragic.  If you have any respect for the original show, don\'t watch this.  I wanted more ""Haruhi"" but what I got ... I\'d rather forget.  It\'s a damn shame. characters were in the previous show, this was disgusting to watch as the characters just threw away all of their individuality, leaving Kyon as the only respectable character in the end.

It\'s a damn shame.', ""I didn't write a review for TMHS, but I felt like writing a review for this because it illustrates a problem that I have with spin-off type things pretty well. I'll try to keep the review in sections but they will undoubtedly overlap. It will contain some SPOILERS of both Yuki & Haruhi Series.Art 4/10: For fans of TMHS, it's hard to see how the art wouldn't be a disappointment. Clearly they were trying to go for something tonally different with the new show, but the bright, pastille like sheen that washes over everything only seems to have the effect of rendering the images completely...neutral. You might even say they lack tone altogether. There's really not much more to say about the art.Sound 7/10: The score was actually one of the shows' successes. I'll admit that I like my classical music, which helps a lot for this because it's clear that whoever did the score does too. Some of the uses of music at certain times in the show were really powerful and helped build scenes quite often. What's also clear at times is that the musical director was trying to say something with the music choices. This works against the show, particularly later on as I often felt the music trying too hard, if that makes any sense. Some of the later scenes lost impact because of an overbearing score and it was really unfortunate because the soundtrack was otherwise brilliant.Character 3/10: For me, this is where the show really falls apart. Whilst i try to view each work as it's own, it's always impossible not to compare this show with TMHS. In fact, in this case I think it's necessary. The main problem is that the yuki we know and love is gone and replaced with someone who's for all intents and purposes completely different. I must admit that when I read about the show first I was sceptical that a character like the original Yuki was interesting enough to hold a show as a main character. It seems the show runners had the same idea as Yuki's character is completely watered down and ironically, made much less interesting. They also included kyon as what is effectively a secondary main character, but this Kyon has been transformed into a generic, likeable romantic plot lead with nowhere near the comedy or cynicism of his predecessor. Asahina (Who was one of the funniest characters i've ever seen in TMHS) is reduced to being a pointless addition. Koizumi isn't funny anymore and doesn't provide exposition, so he's now also useless. The movement of minor characters the main light does little to improve interest and strangely enough the only character that retains some of her former class is Haruhi herself. Truth be told her new rendition is less overbearing than the original which actually makes her more appealing in a romantic setting. All of this resulted in a complete disconnect from my end, the only aspect i was invested in was the possibility of a shock Haruhi x Kyon coupling, which we all knew was unlikely from the start.Story (4/10) : I remember when I watched the disappearance of Haruhi, Whilst watching Kyon in the alternate world I quickly found myself attached to the alternate characters, especially Yuki. So much so that i even thought I might like to watch a show just about Kyon and Yuki and their romance in the other world. You can imagine I was quite pleased to find out that this show existed. Unfortunately the story leaves much to be desired as it seems to be content in cashing in off the previous franchise without doing anything interesting. The plot of this show was so by the book it was painful, the only time something interesting was done it was far too late for me to start caring about anything that was going on. All of the standard cliches have been thrown in with the notable exception of an all round happy kiss conclusion. This is arguable the cliche MOST worth putting in, especially if the show sucks.Enjoyment 4/10: Whilst it's difficult to say anything in this show was done desperately poorly, it was all so uninspired that it felt impossible to get any real enjoyment out of it. By halfway through it felt like i was watching just to finish.Overall 4/10: I am not predisposed against spin-off shows, but this is a great example of how NOT to do it. By all means show me a spin off that does something interesting with an existing plot or existing characters in a different context. The problem with this show is that when the parent show is TMHS, it's impossible for it not to be compared with it. This begs the question of why it's worth even making it as a spin off in the first place. Surely any fame it gets from name recognition is regained as infamy due to the fact it sits quietly in the shadow of something that is in every respect its superior. I think it's quite likely i would have enjoyed this show more had it had absolutely nothing to do with TMHS and been a new show with new characters etc. I certainly would have been more forgiving of it.There's a chance you might get something out of this if you liked TMHS, but in my honest opinion instead of watching something that messes with something you know you should watch something that tries to interest you in something you don't.

I got in a good mood by seeing it.Sound: 8I have nothing to say. It is in a good quality.Character: 4I\'m sorry but it was to stereo and not really nice. I also don\'t like the voice of Yuki. There are soo typical that it\'s really boring after a while.Enjoyment: 5In the end I saw it really fast till the end, so also it was for me to stereotype it wasn\'t so bad either.

I\'m going to make a lot of references to the manga as well.The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki\'s adaptation was a good attempt at trying to bring any symbolic  form of Haruhi Suzumiya back to audiences that want more but I feel the run of the show hit all the bad parts of the manga without touching upon anything that makes it a fun story. A predictable mess from start...to finish that takes the huge buildup that the manga begins and just keeps building, and building, and building and oh...it ended. The story is built in such a way that an adaptation would need to be much longer than a typical seasonal run, mind you 16 episodes is off the norm, but only leaves you either disappointed or wanting more, but not craving more, it\'s more of an empty feeling that you need closure but you\'re not excited for it. I was dumbfounded when I saw the way they decided to end the story off, think of the most disappointing ending to a slice of life romance ever and its that. The art direction keeps with the style in the manga almost to a t. A faux-watercolor style makes the art warm and vibrant, a good style to keep with the happy-go-lucky style of the story direction.The characters deviate enough from the original KyoAni style enough where Kyon in no way looks like the original, where every other character retains their original round faced, wide eyed fashion. I guess the original sharp chinned rough eyed Kyon stood out too much in a story about Yuki so they sanded him down and widened his eyes and actually made him smile this time around, I know crazy.Overall I would recommend the story itself, but stay away from the anime. The manga hits when it really gets going but I hate to make that sort of a recommendation. I don\'t like being that guy that says ""Oh well it gets better around episode 29,"" or in this case ""It gets better around chapter 50, trust me."" If you\'re looking for another slice of life rom-com then go right ahead, watch the anime, if you liked the alternate dimension the movie brought up and want that, go ahead read the manga, skip the anime. This isn\'t an anime geared towards fans of the original series, nothing happens that makes any sort of reference to Haruhi Suzumiya.Think of this as a new beginning for people who haven\'t watched any other form of the series and aren\'t in to supernatural mysterious comedies, but like a romance where both characters like each other but for god\'s sake won\'t say anything until the end.  It\'s a fun little story that while I can recommend it, I know a lot of people wouldn\'t enjoy it the way I do. In conclusion, watch the original series, then if you want something else in the multiverse that is Haruhi Suzumiya then give this a shot, but maybe pick up the manga instead, everything ties together and it\'s cure, I promise. to finish that takes the huge buildup that the manga begins and just keeps building, and building, and building and oh...it ended.

Of course, the whole premise, as anyone watching this show likely knows, is a deeper exploration of the “normal high school anime world” drawn up by Yuki Nagato in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, so it makes perfect sense that The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan really feels like a tangent more than an actual series, but a show consciously supplicating itself to tropes does not necessitate its being mediocre.  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya occasionally made a point of being “ordinary” and managed to twist the concept into something original; The Disappearance of Nagato...Yuki-chan makes a point of being “ordinary,” and that’s the joke.The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is the Rogue One of Haruhi; it’s Toast Rei Bizarro World; it’s Haruhi Suzumiya: The Movie: The Alternate Universe: The Show.  It was a funny but resonant venture that worked very well in its intended circumstances, but it gets old faster than a chain-smoking bomb disposal technician once it gets stretched into an actual series.  Getting to see the SOS Brigade as a group of relatively innocuous, average teens was one of the best parts of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and Nagato’s 180 into a self-conscious shy girl pining after Kyon was itself the most entertaining component of the scenario.  Yet removed from the all-important context of the film, warped into new character designs, robbed of Kyoto Animation’s distinctive touch, and transformed into something much more generic and unremarkable than what we were originally promised by the film’s definition of “normal life,” this concept isn’t half as appealing as it used to be.Eh.  It’s a Mikuru Miracle that Yuki doesn’t have an ahoge or get groped accidentally by Kyon.  Oh, except for when both of those things happen.  Given how silent and disinterested she is at all times in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, it might be easy to forget or misconstrue how much personality Nagato actually has until you see her here with *really* no personality.  This wannabe-moe-blob protagonist is absolutely not Shy Yuki from the movie; this blob is the kind of faceless stand-in who thinks about food all the time, stays up all night playing video games, trips over herself, gets scolded by her onee-san (the bowdlerized Ryoko Asakura), and then has to learn to believe in herself by the end of the episode or else something bad [read: nothing of any consequence] will happen.  Haruhi herself (who, for reasons that can be found underneath Jimmy Hoffa’s bones, somehow manages to shoehorn herself into this show repeatedly) remains Haruhi, thankfully, although seeing as Haruhi Suzumiya is the poster child for strong personality, it would be a greater challenge to recreate her unsuccessfully.  Kyon doesn’t fare as well.  Instead of the sardonic, lightning-fast cynic who dispiritedly narrated the misadventures of the SOS Brigade with his wonderful monologues, Kyon is just…  some guy.  He has no face, his hair is different, half his screen time is devoted to smiling sheepishly, and I’m pretty sure he even got shorter.  He never has anything remotely interesting to add, which might be a consequence of his abandoning the position of narrator (to no one in particular, though sometimes it’s Asakura).  I think it’s Kyon who did the most disappearing, not Yuki.At least the cast is the same, but Minori Chihara approaches her performance in such a drastically different fashion that once more the novelty of Yuki Nagato being in this situation evaporates.  Many factors slowly chip away at the conceit that this is actually Yuki Nagato; her character design is quite dissimilar, her voice has been altered, her demeanor and personality have undergone a serious shift, and the very situation in which she exists is one irreconcilable with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (which is why the movie ended the way it did).  You could argue that this is not Yuki Nagato at all, rather a completely different character who just happens to have the same name and seiyuu.  Of course, it’s pointless to get indignant or make any sort of grand philosophical argument on this basis, because this entire show is clearly meant to be some half-assed wish fulfillment for everyone who wanted more of shy Yuki-chan from the movie.  I’m certainly not put out by this show in any way, especially since I have to admit to being one of those people, but it’s important to recognize that, regardless of the extent of my enjoyment, this show doesn’t need to exist and is a pale imitation at best of proper Haruhi canon.I’m not sure where else to fit this in, but the OP bears a striking similarity to “Hare Hare Yukai.”  Needless to say, it doesn’t quite achieve the same effect (there’s no dance or anything), and sometimes the obvious points of comparison can become grating, but it’s catchy and all right.  While I’m mentioning miscellaneous information, I wouldn’t call this a proper spoiler, but it IS something that happens, so anyone preferring not to learn any more useless but perplexing information for the time being ought to skip to the next paragraph.  There is an episodes-long arc in which Yuki almost gets hit by a car (“almost” as in “doesn’t really get hit by a car, so…  ?”) and as a result her personality changes.  The show tries to push the idea that this traumatic (read: non-traumatic) event has transformed “Disappeared” Yuki Nagato into the original Yuki Nagato of the Haruhi Suzumiya series, which would be a questionable move in the best possible case because that Yuki Nagato, as wonderful and beloved a character as she is, would have a very hard time being a protagonist.  Her thought process is known barely to Kyon and not at all to anyone else in the world, and her nonexistent emotional range and cryptic worldview cripple any chance the audience would have at identifying with her, even as a mere viewpoint.  Moreover, since this latest version of Yuki Nagato has the same character design as Disappeared Yuki and is still surrounded by bland shadows of real characters, all this questionable narrative shift does is throw this show into even sharper contrast with the Haruhi Suzumiya canon.  Now we have Original Yuki, Disappearance Yuki, Disappeared Yuki, and Disappeared Original Yuki, all of whom are very distinct from each other, and the baffling plot device that could have at best made for a single-episode gag turns into one-fourth of the show’s total run and elicits some kind of existential crisis.  The show really begins putting on airs around this point in time, and the conceit that this Yuki Nagato, even as a mute, emotionless automaton, is comparable to the original Yuki Nagato only drives the whole enterprise further into the ground.  By then, we’re just watching a failed attempt to half-recreate an entirely different show, which we could very easily watch instead of this.  Instead of Haruhi Suzumiya: The Movie: The Alternate Universe: The Show, it’s Haruhi Suzumiya: The Movie: The Alternate Universe: The Show: The Original Universe: The Alternate Version: The Mini-Arc.  STOP.  The so-called finale of this show is only made more inconceivably stupid by the runaway plot that preceded it, and while I can’t say I didn’t see it coming, I did burst out laughing and recount aloud how much of a waste of time this whole thing had been.I’ve probably wasted too many words spelling out what would be obvious to most people from a glance, but I can’t say I have any real “critique” to offer because serving up real quality seems to be outside the goals of this show.  It knows that it’s a vehicle for mediocre fan service and exists to put a Yuki Nagato-like figure in the most generic situations possible; this show doesn’t aspire to be anything more, and I’m pretty okay with that, although its practically surreal tangents do occasionally make it frustrating, and its repeated stabs at the ordinary fail even to hit that mark and simply remind me of how much better of a show Haruhi was.  It’s not awful or offensive; it’s worth spelling out just what this show entails, as I have above, purely to alleviate any misconceptions, but it would be silly to levy any serious criticism against it.  If you can learn to treat The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan as something less than a regular TV anime, something more akin to a series of sketches or a simple cartoon, and if you don’t mind the widening gulf between this show’s protagonist and the normal Yuki presented in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and if you can find it in yourself to enjoy a show that is essentially a parody of generic high school anime that doesn’t seem to realize it’s a parody (and a pretty lame one at that), then you might be able to enjoy this show.  The best thing I can say about The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is that it pushed me to rewatch The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, which is admittedly a pretty strong plus, except for the fact that the best parts of this show are the memories of another show.Don’t waste your time.  Rewatching the Endless Eight a few times would be a more rewarding experience.

Rewatching the Endless Eight a few times would be a more rewarding experience.', 'After hearing only middling-to-negative takes on The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan, I went into this series with a considerable amount of hesitancy. But once I had finished the first episode, I sat back and thought ""Wow, that was actually pretty fun!"" And that opinion, for me, is indicative of the series as a whole: underrated and misunderstood.(Minor Spoilers for The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya below.)Within the context of the Haruhi franchise, Nagato Yuki-chan is a black sheep. Taking away most (yes, most) of the supernatural & sci-fi elements that helped give the Haruhi franchise it\'s own unique charm, some might be led to think...""what\'s the point?""The point is Yuki Nagato\'s dream. It may not be immediately evident, but this series is more tightly tied to The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya than one may be led to believe. In a sense, Nagato Yuki-chan can be taken as a what-if scenario: What if Yuki Nagato\'s dream world from The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya was allowed to come to fruition? (There are some contradictions within Yuki Nagato-chan that allows this to be 100% consistent with the details from that film.)And this lens, for me, enhances everything about The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. It only makes the melancholy of Yuki\'s existence sink in even more, and continues to develop an already great character.But of course, outside of this lens, does the series hold up at all?I do think so. Of course, a lot of this will come down to personal preference and how much one can handle Rom-Com cliches. (There are a lot of them here.) But even taken on its own as a romantic comedy, I think a lot of what is on offer here works. The humor, more often than not, landed for me. The softer, cozier moments of intimacy and relationship development also served their purpose in selling me on Kyon & Yuki as a couple-to-be. The supporting cast was handled MOSTLY well, with the exception of a couple of key characters from the original series that are given less-than-favorable amounts of screentime or development.So many are quick to disregard this odd entry in the Haruhi franchise, but if you go into it with an open mind (and with the added context of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) than I think there\'s a lot to love about the Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.

When the initial anime adaptation came out back in \'06, the anime community either hailed it or loathed it. Then came a 3 year hiatus until the second season was finally released. Now this time just about everyone hated Haruhi, mostly because Kyoani thought it smart to adapt the endless eight short story from the light novels (this story being one of MANY in a rather small book, just bare that in mind) into an eight episode monstrosity of an arc, where the same thing happens in every episode with extremely minuscule changes in dialogue....Naturally, people dropped the show outright. Only the wonderkin that was the movie adaptation of the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya managed to keep the idea of a Haruhi season a somewhat realistic possibility. However, we have yet to see a proper continuation of the series, and so we have The Disappearence of Nagato Yuki-Chan, an adaptation of a spin-off manga where the rather enjoyable sci-fi aspects of the series are cast aside for the traditionally trope school life romance anime. The only thing really keeping the show fresh and interesting is the combination of my own nostalgia for the series and a decent ""twist"" arc that manages to incorporate some aspects of the old Haruhi franchise. But in all reality, the show is overall a weak offering.Story wise, Yuki-Chan doesn\'t really manage to pick-up to around midseason. We start off with our protagonist Yuki Nagato, a shy video game playing introvert who shares none of the original Nagato\'s traits or mannerisms. She\'s in the literature club, and thanks to the recent additions of Kyon and Ryoko Asakura, the club is finally safe from being shut down. Now she\'s free to never read a book in the club room ever again. Woot. Anyways, the show\'s story leads along an extremely trodden path. Its all your standard fare slice of life show, with just enough blushing and stammering to slap a romance tag on as well. The only reason I found it enjoyable was only due to its virtue as a Haruhi spin-off. I love Haruhi and its characters, and seeing them interact in this way was pretty much only enjoyable on a fan-service level. So pretty much, unless you\'re a Haruhi fan, you\'re like not to enjoy this. The best part of the story is still only enjoyable if you\'re familiar and fond with the OG show. So in short, story is cliche but its fun if you wanna see Haruhi and Kyon have a basic ass romantic moment together and then see it go nowhere.Every single character in this show is the OG show\'s basic vanilla ass counterpart. Kyon isn\'t nearly as snarky or funny as he usually is. Itsuki is not mysterious and two-faced, he\'s just overly kind and rigid. Haruhi is a little less of a bitch, but she\'s still manic, pushy, and overly energetic (still bae). Mikuru is exactly the same, but she can\'t say ""That\'s classified"" anymore so that kinda sucks. Yuki is no longer quiet because she just doesn\'t talk much, she\'s quiet because she\'s the shy, mousy girl now. We already have one of those already (the m in mousy is for Mikuru), but hey, party on guys. Their interactions are fun to watch, if only for the reason I stated above. So yeah solid enough, if cliche as heck.Art/Sound wise the show is different from the original in some major ways. Due to the production house swap, artistically Nagato Yuki-Chan differs greatly from its elder show. Its a much more cutesy style, in a way, emphasizing less the ""cute"" aspects of the situation and characters for a more calm and soft feeling. The show looks and feels like a warm blanket. I like it. Animation is low budget, unfortunately, being just good enough to be satisfactory.The voice actors tapped for Yuki-Chan are, praise be, the original cast in both Japanese and English. This is one show I (emphasis on I) love dubbed. Crispin Freeman, Michelle Ruff, Wendee Lee, Johnny Yong Bosch, the gangs all here kids. Japanese dub is good too, I just use english for nostalgia reasons. So still dope. Finally, the soundtrack unfortunately pales in comparison to the OG show, and fails in its own right. It just lacks any memorable tracks. The OP and ED are nothing of note either. Really here its just poor to average.All around, Nagato Yuki-Chan kind of sucks. Its not bad, but standing as its own show rather than a fanservice-y spin-off of Haruhi causes everything to fall apart. So end judgement; Nagato Yuki-Chan is a somewhat below average slice of life romance offering that only offers nostalgia value. It\'s really just-6/10 Fair Naturally, people dropped the show outright.

So yeah solid enough, if cliche as heck.Art/Sound wise the show is different from the original in some major ways. Due to the production house swap, artistically Nagato Yuki-Chan differs greatly from its elder show. Its a much more cutesy style, in a way, emphasizing less the ""cute"" aspects of the situation and characters for a more calm and soft feeling. The show looks and feels like a warm blanket. I like it. Animation is low budget, unfortunately, being just good enough to be satisfactory.The voice actors tapped for Yuki-Chan are, praise be, the original cast in both Japanese and English. This is one show I (emphasis on I) love dubbed. Crispin Freeman, Michelle Ruff, Wendee Lee, Johnny Yong Bosch, the gangs all here kids. Japanese dub is good too, I just use english for nostalgia reasons. So still dope. Finally, the soundtrack unfortunately pales in comparison to the OG show, and fails in its own right. It just lacks any memorable tracks. The OP and ED are nothing of note either. Really here its just poor to average.All around, Nagato Yuki-Chan kind of sucks. Its not bad, but standing as its own show rather than a fanservice-y spin-off of Haruhi causes everything to fall apart. So end judgement; Nagato Yuki-Chan is a somewhat below average slice of life romance offering that only offers nostalgia value. It\'s really just-6/10 Fair', 'Out of 100 Nobles watching…78 were impressed12 were bored with the do-nothing plot10 didn’t care for the direction of the last 3rd of the seasonThis will be in an offload of a few catchup reviews so it likely won’t be as detailed as my usual thoughts. I liked The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki a hefty margin more than both the seasons of Haruhi. Whether that’s saying much given my opinion of the original I don’t know, but I do feel this spinoff was left a tad forgotten.Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is a series loosely based on the alternate reality established in Suzumiya Haruhi no...Shoushitsu where Haruhi has no supernatural powers and the entire cast lives mundane lives. Nagato Yuki in this series is not an alien thought entity but rather a regular bookworm. The series was made by Satelite which in my past experience is a studio that produces very bland if not serviceable and well animated entertainment.To my surprise they really outdid themselves and in my opinion this series outshines both seasons of KyoAni’s Haruhi. KyoAni is of course an absolute powerhouse and the animation in the original seasons of Haruhi look incredible. Nagato Yuki being a more light hearted spinoff was more stylized and raw visuals will be my main concession to KyoAni. The plot, pacing, and characters overall I found more enjoyable in Nagato Yuki. There are some deep statements to be made about how removing the supernatural elements from Haruhi and just making it a bland slice of life show makes it better, but it’s been over a month since I finished it so I don’t have the will to drag those points back up.The hardest part of watching Nagato Yuki was adjusting to what the show was. The characters are essentially all new. The Nagato Yuki of this series is a completely different Nagato Yuki than the one from Haruhi Suzumiya, she’s still obviously best girl, but she is %100 a different girl. Most of the other characters are generally the same with another noticeably different character being Asakura Ryouko who was previously just a psycho killer now serves as a loving friend. Previous precedents leave the viewer spending most of the series wondering when something is going to happen, but something only comes very briefly the last few episodes and even then, it does not upset the pleasant alternate world we are given in any meaningful way.Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu is an acceptable show that was an overall better viewing experience than the previous seasons if only for the fact that it was a slice of life show made to formula. It’s an excellent example that you can make something by the books and have it result in a product of acceptable quality. Would I have ever willingly watched this show if it wasn’t as spinoff though?

Probably not.', ""I am fairly newly back into anime after about a 10 year hiatus, and Haruhi Suzumiya (melancholy and disappearance) were one of the first on my watch list. It was after watching those and finishing on the movie did I want more from the characters, and especially more about the 'normal' Yuki shown in the film — so this seemed like a logical step.I preface the rest of the review with the statement that I really enjoyed it, but that I don't think it really was a good/great anime, and I do not think I would have watched it if not for the personal interest...generated by my enjoyment of the Haruhi Suzumiya series and movie. To outline some of the reasons for both my enjoyment and my consideration of it as a mediocre anime in general:Enjoyment:— If you have watched the movie before watching this (a must in my opinion), there are questions left surrounding Yuki character, especially considering the scene after the credits. It is very enjoyable to have another series exploring that situation with 'normal' Yuki in a 'normal' world. She is a very likeable character in that she is cute looking (youthfully doe eyed and child-like), shy, clumsy, good natured, and child-like in her actions. I found myself wanting her to succeed in her plans to have a relationship with Kyon (one of the big plot points of the series); if you disagree with this opinion then this may not be the anime for you as it depends a lot on this for you to have the patience to make it through. What should be noted is that her character here (and predicament) is quite different to the one found in the movie, it is more stereotypically high school romance-esque in my opinion.— There are quite a few comedic moments that play on the characters of the Suzumiya series, as well as knowing references to it too. This series can act as a good opportunity to spend more time with these characters and see them within new situations. They are much the same but without any kind of supernatural sub plot, and I actually enjoyed their company a bit more as the bullying Haruhi is toned down a lot, and she seems more caring and personable in this series.— The music is great in this series, it includes quite a few pieces of impressionist European music (Ravel, Satie-esque, etc.) that add to the passing of time and allowing feelings and bonds to grow.— The animation can be really pretty at times with more colour than the original series and the movie, the characters are more cute as well (although also more generic) and it is genuinely quite nice to be in their company doing a lot of the mundane things that are portrayed in the movie (up to a point).— Dub is really good, with the original English voice cast back again.The mediocrity:— The plot really is very basic and the whole series is based around the hope of things happening between the two characters, but the problem really comes down to how nothing really gets in the way of it (this is true up until about episode 11). The pacing can be really slow sometimes with scenes and scenarios being repeated and drawn out to fill time it seems, it would feel like all the interesting events would be put at the start and ends of each episode to facilitate viewers to return.Probably the most disappointing thing to happen to the plot comes in the lack of any kind of resolution to the many plot-lines of the series. I understand this is done to allow future material to be added, but some kind of balance could have been struck better. As alluded to above, around episode 11 (more than half way through) something interesting happens to Yuki's character (relating to the title), and this brings up some very interesting questions of identity and the self. This is handled very well with her relationships with others being an interesting stimulus for Yuki's character, and gave me hope for the rest of the series, but after around 3 episodes everything is pretty much back in tone to the first 10 episodes and the only implications come between Kyon and Yuki, giving them more excuses to put off their relationship, this is the point where it went from wanting of the relationship to boredom. It takes so much dependence on the stereotype of the aloof character not being to admit their feelings, but it would have been so much better if he explained something at least something to her! The end is frustrating and feels like its only intent is to allow for more material in the future.— The animation, even though I said I enjoyed some aspects of it, is quite bland. Even though the characters are quite cute now, they look similar to a lot of modern series. The animation is also lazy at times, focusing on static objects to save money, and also being inconsistent sometimes with the characters (there is a point where Kyon moves his head and it looks like is face is about to fall off).— The varying tone: other then the plot this is my biggest problem with this series, it seems to change in tone and intent all the time! For example the first few episodes are very tense with various silly romantic moments happening by chance to clumsy Yuki (they knowingly refer to these in the hopes to make it better), making me think its more Shojo in tone with Yuki as the main character trying to make her feelings for Kyon known, but at the same time battling her shyness. Later the show plays more to a guy demographic with T&A all over, now focusing more on Kyon being around all these anime babes, these same anime babes that we were meant to be enjoying for their personality not their bodies (or so I thought). It moves between the two before launching into another type of plot (episode 11 point) where it moves to big themes of sense of identity, self and what constitutes a person, where many of the characters conveniently disappear for a while, which then goes in depth into Yuki and Kyon and this time they spend together and their heart warming relationship. Then, it goes back to being a beach episode with anime babes in swimsuits! It left me confused about what the series was trying to do and also annoyed me as I signed up for the character focused romance part with a bit of comedy, not boring fan service-y parts.Conclusion:The series is too varied in tone and plot for me to recommend it to anyone who doesn't like the original series and movie, and even then I am unsure if it would appeal to all as it focuses a lot on the characters and not on a supernatural plot. The thing is that the characters outside of Yuki, and partly Kyon, are just played as they are in the original series and are put into normal situations with quite a lot of boring conclusions.In my mind the reasons to watch this are if you are particularly fond of the 'normal' version of Yuki from the movie, and would like to see a more high school romance stereotypical version of her in romantic situations with a less snarky Kyon and going on more normal adventures with Haruhi, then it's good enough to make it through enjoying a number of sequences.

There was nothing even remotely interesting about this series. Like being promised cake but getting some old candy instead.The art wasn\'t the best but that can be forgive, what I can\'t forgive is the lack of creativity!The spark that the charters had...was gone in place of boring clichés.The charters where average, the music was average, everything was just average..there was nothing spectacular about this series. Just another slice of life with nothing really goes on.Overall I guess my disappointment stems from expecting something different than a generic ""slice of life"". Or at least expecting more with all the materials and story lines that could have been used, especially from the writers. Yes I know it\'s suppose to be taken place in an ""alternate dimension"" where everyone is normal but...I just feel like an opportunity was missed.

Whether a viewer will like it or not depends largely on this. If you expect a Haruhi S3 OR you like how the characters are written in S1 and S2, you will be disappointed. If you want to explore a certain path branch not taken in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya movie, you will like (or at least appreciate) this one.Before I proceed, let\'s tackle the show\'s weak points first.One: The KyoAni visual finish is not present, simply because the studio animating it is not KyoAni. To Satelight\'s credit, they did...not seek to imitate the KyoAni style and do their own thing. That sort of worked in the show\'s favor by painting the show as being in alt-Nagato\'s perspective.Two: The show\'s latter episodes feel indecisive and appears to finish in a cliffhanger, which is a shame. Being a spin-off, it was quite unlikely to get a season two to begin with. This is the decisive factor on giving this show a ""Mixed Feelings"" as far as recommending it to other viewers is concerned. That being said, whether *you\'ll* like this or not is a ""see for yourself"" affair. For me, I enjoyed it even with its flaws.Going to its good points...Exploring this world shows a completely new side of the cast that we\'re familiar with, stripped of supernatural occurrences (aside from *nudge* *nudge* *wink* *wink* references to Haruhi fans, which I like very much). If you\'re among those who find Haruhi overbearing in the canon show, you\'ll like that it was toned down a lot here. I prefer this version of Haruhi over the original. The character balance between the cast is much better here (and also was hinted in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya).The buildup and fluff involving Nagato and Kyon\'s relationship in the slice-of-life segments is nicely paced on its own and presents the viewer a very understandable picture of what\'s going on in Nagato\'s head and heart, even in the more serious episodes.To me, the highlight of this show is the soundtrack. It really elevated the show to be a compelling watch along the way with nary a miss. It manages to capture the cutesy and the introspective scenes when it\'s needed. Its ED is one of those that became an instant ""can\'t skip"" for me, and if you liked Violet Evergarden, that might intrigue you. I\'ll let you find out why.Overall, I very much enjoyed this show. I only acknowledge that The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan is not for everyone, primarily because of what one might expect. But I can at least recommend you to try the first few episodes and make your own judgments on whether to continue or not. not seek to imitate the KyoAni style and do their own thing.

(Also this is my first review so go easy on me >_<). This also contains spoilers!!- Beginning -Sooo... this show isn't so similar to that of the main series... this is more so its own thing and doesn't have any mystery at all, it's like having a traditional love story but with Haruhi characters. You may think this is just something you could...gloss over, like it doesn't mean anything if you already watched the previous shows, and you are sort of right... but here is why I'd recommend you at least give it a try.- The Alternate World -If you've seen The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (Which I highly suggest you do after the two seasons), then you will know about the parallel world introduced in it where things are a little different. The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki Chan follows up with that world keeping the character traits and roles introduced for it, like Haruhi being a little more Mature and Ryoko... well y'know.And while it does tone down on the mystery aspect by a lot, that's kinda what makes it different from the main world we know and love, the lack of mystery and instead opting in for a SOL type show where we get to see these characters live out their school lives and even partake in various tasks like we saw before.- The Slice Of Life Aspect -So as I said before the SOL aspect, while in the main series, is much more apparent here. We see characters do things you would expect to see in traditional SOL anime, such as go to festivals, celebrate various holidays, have romance and many different things that is a nice reliever to see after all the stuff that goes down in the main series.Seeing everyone finally live their lives after all the stuff Haruhi did is a nice reliever, seeing as we have two seasons of that and even more in the light novel. As a spin-off, it does its job very well and has just the right amount of pacing, so things don't get too boring.- Nagato Yuki -So one of the biggest aspects of this show is how Yuki has changed. I said before that characters like Haruhi and Ryoko had some changes, but Yuki by far has the most. As we know from the show, she is an alien that is very intelligent and doesn't show much emotion, but you could always see that she still had emotions within her.However, in this universe, she's much more of a shy, clumsy but very nice girl who enjoys reading and playing video games just like how we saw in the main show. She shows much more emotion in this compared to the main show, and overall makes for a cute romance between her and Kyon.- Overall -If you haven't seen this show yet, I highly recommend it if you enjoyed Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and especially if you love Yuki like I do. It's a great relief from the drama that goes down from the main show and is very warm and enjoyable! gloss over, like it doesn't mean anything if you already watched the previous shows, and you are sort of right... but here is why I'd recommend you at least give it a try.- The Alternate World -If you've seen The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (Which I highly suggest you do after the two seasons), then you will know about the parallel world introduced in it where things are a little different.

If you are in the same boat, you will have grand expectations and this series will either meet these and bask in the same holy light as your favourite series, or it will be judged with the sharpest scrutiny and perhaps earn undeserved hatred - depending entirely on what you liked/ disliked about the original series.This spinoff is based on the work of art film 'The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya', what made this film so...beautiful was Kyon's awareness of the Haruhi world and his determination to find her and rectify the absurdity. This series features an ignorant Kyon; and every treasured character from the original franchise is similarly morphed into mediocre, uninteresting, slice of life-genre characters. I did not know it was possible to make the most dynamic, multifaceted, and charismatic character in anime ever, boring, but The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato certainly achieves this - Haruhi does not shine. Kyon also morphs from being a philosophical existentialist to a boring high school boy. I found it devastating that these two particular characters who I identified with, related to, were gone (or poorly reimagined, or there - but not there, or should the series be renamed to the disappearance of everything good about your favourite characters... but I digress).The original series features fan service alongside an incredible storyline. The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato Chan is basically pure fan service. If you enjoyed the fan service elements of the original series, you are in for a treat! But if you do not care for this, you will find the series painfully boring. Particularly the spa retreat episode. Which had no purpose other than heavy fan service. I do not doubt that this sole feature contributed to polarized reviews.Now, were the characters likeable? They are likeable in that they were likeable in the original series. I am not convinced that they are likeable or memorable enough if this series were a stand-alone series. Disappearance Yuki is endearing because she is contrasted with the unfeeling and emotionally disconnected Melancholy Yuki. I did not like the new art style. It was attractive enough, but made the characters look chipmunk-like; also Mikuru having ombre pink hair felt off-brand for her. The oversaturation of moe on my dearly loved and cherished favourite characters was cringe-inducing for me.The series was difficult to finish, I did not find myself excited to watch the next episode except for the anchor where Disappearance Yuki reverts back to Melancholy Yuki and I was momentarily excited that the new series would make a brilliant transition back to original series and the genre would flip. But alas, no joy.I consider myself a fair person and I can distinguish that my personal feelings are not reality and that my perspective will never be unbiased for this series. If I had watched this series with completely new characters it might not have been disappointing. For that reason I can't definitively say that this is a bad series, so my final review is a 5/10, the ghost of the original series echoed through this spin-off breathes enough life into it to make it an on par viewing experience to a complete watch through of the Endless Eight episodes.My advice is if you enjoyed the supernatural/ philosophical elements to the original series, steer clear of this one. If you did not enjoy the supernatural/ philosophical elements of the original series, you may enjoy this. If you sought fan service in this original series, you will likely enjoy this (however the art style is inferior). beautiful was Kyon's awareness of the Haruhi world and his determination to find her and rectify the absurdity.

I like the characters the romantic subtext and your generic high school romcom. That is what this show is so if you’re looking into that then great you’re in luck.Also, the producers Christopher Sabat And I believe Justin Cook Were the producers on this and this is the first Show  I’ve watched of As producers So pretty good Having voice actors being producers But now we have to go into the one negative I have about this...showThe disappearance Isn’t really a disappearance But it also is Without saying much, it doesn’t happen until I believe episode 10 There isn’t much of a Theme of the  Whole series It was the most impactful episodes It is kind of misleading in the fact that the whole show isn’t about the disappearance It’s the remaining six that included disappearance and Nagato Yuki is AfterwardsI did like it. It was the same as my generic high school romcom animations so if you did want something like this, it is good. It’s not as good as your. Toradora etc But it was good, so I’m happy that I watched it and I recommend itOverall 7 out of 10 showThe disappearance Isn’t really a disappearance But it also is Without saying much, it doesn’t happen until I believe episode 10 There isn’t much of a Theme of the  Whole series It was the most impactful episodes It is kind of misleading in the fact that the whole show isn’t about the disappearance It’s the remaining six that included disappearance and Nagato Yuki is AfterwardsI did like it.

Toradora etc But it was good, so I’m happy that I watched it and I recommend itOverall 7 out of 10', 'The Haruhi Suzumiya series was a very meta series that took many of the commonalities of high school manga and anime and took them literally. Taking the idea of the main girl of those types of series being treated as someone more divine than the others and making it a reality was the basis of the entire series. The entire show felt like it catered to the every whim of said god-like figure because they did. It\'s their world and we\'re watching it. That\'s what makes Haruhi Suzumiya so special as a series.So what happens when you take all the meta away and make it...into a typical high school show? You get Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu.Many tropes you\'d normally see in these types of shows are there and they don\'t call any thinking of the viewer into question. It\'s tiring to see shows that revolve around a club doing anything that doesn\'t involve their club\'s activities, a forced relationship that goes nowhere, and fanservice scenes. That\'s not to say Haruhi didn\'t do these things, but most of the time, they were either subverted or not brought to the table at all.It\'s very clear that Kyon and Haruhi are the OTP in the main timeline, but the problem is Kyon isn\'t in love with Haruhi, which is what leads to them not being a couple. In this universe, however, Kyon loves Nagato but is unsure of himself for a near 3 episodes before actually doing something. And of course it culminates at a fireworks festival, because it\'s a high school anime.What makes this show difficult to invest in is about 3 episodes in when Haruhi takes over the literature club. It becomes very apparent in the next few episodes that Kyon and Haruhi have much better chemistry than Kyon and Nagato, yet the show insists on forcing the idea. Kyon even admits he\'s attracted to Haruhi\'s figure towards the end of this series while Haruhi admits she\'s grateful for Kyon\'s role in her life, making a relationship seem very healthy. When Kyon confesses at the end, Haruhi has her back turned as though she\'s unhappy with his decision. It\'s very tough to sell a show that wants to force a romance that isn\'t even the best possible romance.We get a brief tease of the Nagato we all know and love around the middle of the show when Nagato gets hit by car-kun, because of course. In that, it\'s so obvious how much more likable this Nagato is. She isn\'t reliant on Ryoko or Kyon for anything and is very independent. She\'s not a good protagonist to follow, but it was so nice to see her for as brief the time was. Of course, this show had to bring the otaku Nagato back. I have nothing against otakus since I am one myself (if you want to call it that), but this character was painful to watch compared to, say, Illya from the Prismaverse as opposed to the Stay Night universe.I don\'t know if I\'ve ever seen a show so keen on telling us this is a different story from what we know and love than this show. It\'s in the OP\'s lyrics. I also see a lot of scenes and dialogue exchanges in this show and the question ""Haven\'t I heard this before?"" immediately comes to mind. However, I will say I had my happy ending when the last episode repeated as it started. I can\'t say too much but let\'s just say it is a bad end for fans of the series. The unfortunate side of this is that this show is actively spitting in the face of fans of a certain character. This is not a good thing, even though I got a massive kick out of it.Overall, this was not a good show.

Honestly, every character except the two main characters, Kyon and Yuki, are in character. you know the anime is bad when the most interesting episodes are the ones where the main character had a concussion/schizophrenia. They could have at least kept Yuki\'s ""kuudere"" aspect, but they went with the basic shy girl. Overall, this spinoff is an embarrassment to the original series and would still be bad even as a stand-alone series. It\'s understandable if some...people like it, but I don\'t know what in the world was going on in the writer\'s head when coming up with this. people like it, but I don\'t know what in the world was going on in the writer\'s head when coming up with this.', ""If you're a fan of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and also a fan of the movie The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, then I say give this a chance. I won't compared this to the other two, because in my personal opinion, I think the movie was AMAZING! I enjoyed the original work too but that was done by a different studio. So if you watch this, the artwork will be completely different from what you expect.The plot is pretty decent, it really carries us along mainly by depending on the cast. Since it's a cast we're familiar with, one that you probably only...watched because we're all waiting for that third season that may or may never come. Anyways, the characters are mainly the same, except Yuki, which she is portray a little bit different. I had mix feeling about her personally. I didn't love her character in here as much as I did in the movie, where it's her more shy reserved side that's very adorable. I love her in the original too, her cold robot side.I will say one character who stood out a lot, Ryouko. This is a spoiler kinda, not really... because we all know her in the original as a crazy psychopath who basically tried to kill Kyon. While in the movie... she's the exact same thing lol... but we let our guard down thinking she might be a good person until she stabbed us in the back... like kinda literally lol so I had my guard up thinking on boy... she's about to go crazy Yandere style on us.. but turns out she was actually one of the best character in this anime and I really like her. I was happy to see a new light to her, one where I actually finally can trust her. The others were themselves, as Haruhi is still herself and still awesome as always!I say, give it a chance, it's not as great as the original, but it's not so terrible as some people have reviewed it to be. It's kinda of a disappointing ending but a good nod to the original though. Endless Night...If you have nothing else to watch as I did, that's why I picked this up, but if you do... then save this for a rainy day. I won't put it on my top oh you must watch, because I think that belongs to the movie!

However the series did have a great premise, music, animation, and characters. Now what if I told you there was a spinoff series that feels like a watered down adapation of the original series? That sounds like a wonderful concrpt for a 16 episode series. There is not much of a story since this is a slice of life series, however the biggest letdown is the characters in this show feel like watered down versions of the same characters in the original series. The biggest exception being Nagato,...who is almost the polar opposite of who she was in the original. There are no supernatural elements in this series, so it feels more grounded in reality which I feel is one of the biggest detriments to this series. Instead of being an outlandfish sci fi esque slice of life, it is instead a generic rom com slice of life with dull characters.ArtIts okay, not nearly as good as Kyoto Animation. The art style makes them look more like chibi versions of themselves.SoundNothing too memorableCharacterThe biggest letdown of the series. I appreciated Nagato in the original series, she was a great foil to the other members of the SOS brigade, but I found her more of a side character than a main one. In this series, she is a generic moe girl and it gets old really quickly. In fact all characters feel like watered down versions of themselves. Haruhi is still energetic, but she is not nearly as selfish or bratty. Her insane antics in the original were the most entertaining part of the original. Kyon is not nearly as snarky or pessimistic as he is in the original. For a majority of the story, there is no SOS brigade to speak of since Haruhi and Koizumi are from a different school than a majority of the main cast.EnjoymentI thought I would appreciate the series a bit, but I was letdown. It just feels so watered down. Sometimes it was original but at the same time boring. There are watered down retreads from the original as well. If I wanted to see those, I could just watch clips from the original series. There were a lot of moments that were completely inconsequntial and directionless. Nagato is boring and the rom com that plays between here and Kyon was boring. It feels so tacked on just to have something of semblance to drama.OverallI did not enjoy this series and I feel like I wasted my time.

What I ended up getting was a show that was definitely not confident enough in itself to be a 100% shoujo romance, despite the fact that the two main love interests, Yuki and Kyon, have amazing chemistry -- but rather, one that loses its nerves partway through and feels the need to call back to some of the more sci-fi elements of its source material, Haruhi Suzumiya, and the...Nagato from the other universe that we\'ve known before. I was *really* disappointed in the actual ""Disappearance of Yuki Nagato"" arc of episodes in this anime. Hell, I just finished watching all of the original Haruhi Suzumiya show, and now I wanted the cute Nagato of this universe to shine on her own in all her sweet, earnest, ditzy glory.

Oz no Mahoutsukai (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/2826/Oz_no_Mahoutsukai_TV,"[""This little anime series/cartoon comes on THIS network and when I saw it was on my Comcast channel in the early morning, I thought it was the filming of the original Black&White Wizard of Oz. But when I saw it was an animated series based on the books, I definitely decided to go watch it. I always be sad every time I miss it from going to sleep or doing something different so I try to keep in time and set the alarm clock to when the Wizard of Oz comes on and then i go to the channel and watch it. This series was...really impressive. The voices sound like the original 1939 one, even though they sound a little higher, the characters were from the book except some of them like Princess Lulu or any of the strange guys. And I was addicted! This cartoon is astonishing! Only 52 episodes and from start to finish it was amazing. I had to buy the DVD off of Amazon but don't buy the Complete Set DVD. When I bought it, I was disappointed that most of the episodes were missing scenes. It really had better quality than THIS Network, but the most disappointing fact is that the series is trying to come together by cutting off scenes and make it incomprehensible. So I'd like to watch it on T.V. now. Watch it on television instead. You'll be impressed by this little adaptation. really impressive.

Only afterward did I get to find out it was based on a book series0 (which I have never read) and see the Judy Garland version plus the 'Return to Oz' movie released by Disney in the 1980s.Needless to say my memory is a bit sketchy, however I can remember enjoying this one immensely (my local TV station ran it twice - restarting it as soon...as its first run finished). One thing 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' has over some of the other versions is its length - it was able to be spread out over many episodes and not have to be crammed into a 2hr movie or something similar.From my own experience I considered the story as being divided into 3 parts (I've since found out that it was officially considered 4 parts). The first part concerned to most memorable part of the Oz saga - Dorothy getting sucked up by the tornado only to land in Oz, where she meets up with the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion. They all join together in a variety of adventures as she attempts to get to the Emerald City to meet the famous Wizard who supposedly has the power to return her home. The Wizard instead sends them off to kill the Wicked Witch of the West (which they do) but upon returning it is discovered the Wizard is in fact just a normal man who arrived in Oz via a balloon. When Dorothy misses out on returning home with the Wizard she and her friends end up going to meet Glinda the Good Witch of the South (not the North interestingly) where Dorothy learns that she only needs to click her magic slippers to return home.The second part involved characters such as the witch Mombi, the usurper-of-the-throne Queen Jinjur (the throne had previously been held by Scarecrow after the leaving of the Wizard) as well as the memorable Jack Pumpkinhead and his master/guardian Tip. This part ended with true heir to the throne, Princess Ozma, being revealed and taking her place on the throne of Oz. I have to admit I'm a little hazy on what happened during this part with the exception of Jinjur making herself Queen after Dorothy and co escape on a wooden horse (brought to life by Tip with the same magic powder that created Jack Pumpkinhead) as well as the end where Ozma is revealed and crowned.The third part struck me as the strangest (and somewhat boring) part involving Dorothy visiting the land of Ev and meeting characters such as Tick Tock and the Nome King. This part ended with Dorothy ending up back in Oz and the Nome King launching an invasion of the Emerald City. One of the most memorable parts from this one was the ornament room where the correct ornament had to be chosen lest the person themselves be turned into an ornament ('Return to Oz' used this part too). At the time this part of the story struck me as the weirdest as I never really understood how Ev existed alongside Oz (I've since learnt that it was a neighbouring nation-state). I was also bored by it a bit as most of the storyline took place in Ev (which is more or less a desert). Fortunately the later sequences in Oz were more enjoyable, especially with the constant girl-fighting between Dorothy and Ozma (who had turned into a bit of a spoiled brat between this part and the last part).(as mentioned previously, officially the series is divided into 4 parts - the final 2 sections (Part 3 in the land of Ev, Part 4 back in Oz with the Nome King invading) making up what I considered the third part above.  Despite this knowledge I prefer to count it as one single entity as that was how I saw it as a kid)All up it was an enjoyable series for me and I have plenty of fond memories of it. At the time I didn't know how close it resembled the original novels (from what I've heard the first part is fairly close; the second part is close as well but the novel didn't feature Dorothy; the third and fourth parts deviate the most by taking a number of liberties with the storyline from the books) but compared to some of the other attempts at bringing the Oz story to the screen (big and small) this one is good for taking the time to develop a nice, long story with characters who flesh out and grow as the series moves along.Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys the Oz universe. as its first run finished).

At the time this part of the story struck me as the weirdest as I never really understood how Ev existed alongside Oz (I've since learnt that it was a neighbouring nation-state). I was also bored by it a bit as most of the storyline took place in Ev (which is more or less a desert). Fortunately the later sequences in Oz were more enjoyable, especially with the constant girl-fighting between Dorothy and Ozma (who had turned into a bit of a spoiled brat between this part and the last part).(as mentioned previously, officially the series is divided into 4 parts - the final 2 sections (Part 3 in the land of Ev, Part 4 back in Oz with the Nome King invading) making up what I considered the third part above.  Despite this knowledge I prefer to count it as one single entity as that was how I saw it as a kid)All up it was an enjoyable series for me and I have plenty of fond memories of it. At the time I didn't know how close it resembled the original novels (from what I've heard the first part is fairly close; the second part is close as well but the novel didn't feature Dorothy; the third and fourth parts deviate the most by taking a number of liberties with the storyline from the books) but compared to some of the other attempts at bringing the Oz story to the screen (big and small) this one is good for taking the time to develop a nice, long story with characters who flesh out and grow as the series moves along.Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys the Oz universe."", ""I have to say that I'm watching this anime out of pure and utter nostalgia... I know that I saw it on TV in the 80's cause much of the art of this anime is firmly printed in head as one of the oldest memories I can recall...This surely caused a big big impression in my 3-4-year-old brain... so much that when I caught a glimpse of some footage of it and was able to recognize it I knew I had to watch it!!! I felt the urge to see those images again...So.... for the actual review...The animation is as old as it gets... borderline...being black and white.... but its ok as long as you set your mind to watch a 34 yrs old anime.The art is AWESOME... especially the background art!! some of those sceneries could very well be on a canvas in a museum hall.I have to say that the 3rth arc is the one that fascinates me the most. The land of Ev is filled with incredible surrealistic landscapes... dried out oceans, ancient crumbling ruins, sandy graveyards littered with rock-giant corpses..... Ev could be the setting for an incredible RPG campaign.The soundtrack is incredible too... with a jazzy vibe that feels kind of over the top for such a simplistic animation.... but nonetheless is very enjoyable.As a final remark... I have to say that chapter 35 is the one that struck me the most... the whole rock-giant fight and escape scene is the one that was more deeply engraved in my memory and I felt and incredible fascinations watching it 30 year later for a second time.... and I have to say is one of the few chapters that I feel any grown-up could watch and not realize it's from a show aimed at kids. being black and white.... but its ok as long as you set your mind to watch a 34 yrs old anime.The art is AWESOME... especially the background art!! some of those sceneries could very well be on a canvas in a museum hall.I have to say that the 3rth arc is the one that fascinates me the most.

I wanted to watch more. it has a good sense of romance, it also has its love for makeup out characters are also very good looking and cute. And I am into romances and princes. Amazingly this anime has both the romance and the prince. It is just soo.... good. For me at least but I would recommend others to watch it I mean you never know when you might like it because at first, I thought that this anime was not meant for me. and...now look at me I am madly in love with it. now look at me I am madly in love with it.', ""Story (5/10): If you are looking for a detailed and in-depth plot, you aren't going to find it here. While the premise is interesting a few episodes in, the quality of the plot decreases near the end of the season. Within the last few episodes, they managed to add multiple plot twists and and plot holes that do not make much sense. The ending is strung together so poorly that I was extremely dissatisfied by both the romance plot and main story plot. Aside from the descending plot line, the main focus is on makeup (teaching about different types, brands, and ways to use makeup...to the viewers), so if you have no interest in makeup, you might not be interested in this story.Art (5/10): While this is not the ugliest or greatest animation style I've seen, it is decent and does not detract from watching the show. Most character designs are actually pretty good in my opinion.Sound (5/10): The opening and ending songs are quite nice to listen to. However, the sound effects are one of the most annoying aspects of the show. I was distracted by the sound effects many times while watching certain scenes.Character (5/10): The characters are not good. Many are one dimensional or seemingly change personalities or feelings quickly, without reason. Some even act in ways that do not make any sense, but you would have to watch the show to understand this. Some characters are introduced, only to never be mentioned again, while some characters are randomly interjected into the story and play significant parts. (Also, the male leads fall in love with the character based on her makeup applying skills, which ultimately leads to not very interesting character development). The only character with some type of interesting development is Jack, so I partly continued watching to see his outcome.Enjoyment (7/10): I enjoyed most of the episodes. I liked certain characters and mini plots in some episodes over other episodes. I thought the makeup aspect was also interesting. However, problems with plot, character development/personalities, and the unresolved ending decreased my enjoyment by a lot in the end.Overall (6/10): If you have free time and don't want to watch a really intense show, I recommend watching SSZN.

If rushing the ending wasn\'t enough, they also made the ""virtual"" characters go back to the real world with some technology that they didn\'t fully explain in the story.

Shy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53237/Shy,"['It really breaks my heart that Shy flew so under the radar. Cute, socially awkward girl who has to overcome adversity and become a superhero while balancing her normal life? Sign me up. While it may lack the flair of bigger shonen titles, it makes up for it with a great cast and interesting world. I had a blast watching this one and will miss it on Mondays.Being a teenager is hard. Being a teenaged superhero is even harder. What makes Shy so good to me is how it handles Shy’s struggles of being a young super hero with the country’s hopes and dreams riding...on her, and her personal development as Teru. At the beginning of the show, we’re introduced to a really timid girl who struggles to connect with other people at school. When she puts the mask on and becomes Shy, she’s much more confident and assertive. It’s as if that physical mask shields her from the judgement of the world and allows her to temporarily forget the awkward little girl inside of her.Over the course of the show, we see those two sides of her gradually merge into one thanks to the friends she makes in her line of work. Whether it’s the hot drunk Russian Onee-san who guides her in her super hero activities or her friend at school, she’s pushed forward by people who want to see her grow and evolve. It’s a really sweet and personal story as opposed to the flashy lights and bright beams of usual battle shonen.That’s not to say there isn’t any action. There’s an overarching plot involving a villain who is quite mysterious and interesting. Also, the second half of the show has quite a few really well done fight scenes that were actually surprising considering how character driven the first half is. Particularly episodes 9 and 10 which serve as the emotional climax of the season.But the series’ general lack of action isn’t a detriment to me. Instead, I enjoyed the focus on a hero’s growth and journey rather than generic action scenes and power ups. When watching Shy, I’m often reminded of the late great Stan Lee’s quote about Spider-Man. “Anyone can wear the mask”. While we might not all have superpowers. We can all be heroes in our day to day lives. Aspiring for greater heights and pushing ourselves to be better. The impact that Shy has as both a superhero and regular girl on those around her just really resonated with me and made me fall in love with this story. Is it going to be great for those looking for a lot of action? No. It’s definitely aimed at people who are ok with character drama, emotional string pulling and some good old coming of age issues, and it excels at that.Shy is a really fun show that I think is one of the best superhero stories in the medium and I am very glad I got to watch this one.

Take that as you will.Cons:1> The Story really doesn't draw attention in. I could compare this to Berserk of Gluttony that released this season (I know its a different theme) which has a really well paced episodic...function where there really isn't too much dialogue and corny characters, and more importantly it has good antagonists which really show the strong points, and hide the not as good grievances people would have.

It has an almost opposite approach to the point where it feels more like a magical girl show than a traditional superhero series, and that\'s where it shines.Having a lead character with a unique background and personality adds depth to the show.

It deviates from the typical narrative of striving to become the best hero or pursuing heroism for the sake of enjoyment.Instead, it revolves around more grounded themes and what they mean for the protagonist.

Although Shy has yet to achieve a mainstream level of stardom, it has a premise attached that reflect on that recent trend. Most people would point fingers at My Hero Academia for setting the standard in recent years. When we look at Shy, we need to ask ourselves if this is really just another copy-paste superhero show or one that truly made an identity of itself.Before we even jump into the main story and characters, it\'s noticable that the season consists of just 12 episodes. With the manga running...at over 100+ chapters, it raised a question mark how the anime can stay faithful. And indeed, Shy\'s adaptation does skip over some material although stays honest with the majority of its premise. This is also the first and only adaptation by the original creator, so it really put them on the map. I\'m not going to resummarize the synopsis because it speaks for itself. What we should know about is Shy, the title character. Yes, you can guess it without a bat of an eye. She is nicknamed ""Shy"" because of how shy and timid she is. Representing Japan as a superhero, the show follows her adventures in a futuristic dystopia that managed to evade World War III.Shy\'s real name is Teru Momijiyama but her nickname stands out more due to the role she\'s in.  Representing Japan is a huge responsibility and given her kind hearted nature, she does what\'s possible to help the helpless. I\'m not going to sugarcoat it but some of her early missions and feats are rather underwhelming. It seems other superheroes clearly overshadows her role such as Russia\'s Spirit or Switzerland\'s Lady Black. Why? It\'s because they are much more confident in their abilities.

While I do praise the author\'s way of showing the vulnerabilities of her character, it will take much more to convince an audience how much she needs to improve.Despite Shy being the main focus of the show, this season also establishes Pepesha/Spirit as a breakout star. Journeying into the colder climates of Russia, we learn much more about her past and connection to the mysterious character Tzveta. Although expanding only a few episodes, her character arc is one if not the most emotional part of the season. It\'s here we discover Pepesha\'s origins including where she came from and the tough environment she grew up in. Pepesha\'s story also draws the line that the lives of the superheroes we know in the present may be filled with pride and fame, it also has its darker secrets. Unfortunately, this season only scratches the surface and we don\'t get to learn about the majority of the superheroes. With just 12 episodes, this really shouldn\'t come as a surprise either.Studio 8bit has an rather interesting track record to say the least. By interesting, I mean that they have a variety of shows produced over the years with various genres. Shy represents a mixture of action, drama, and superhero elements so the studio did have some experience with similar genres. They adapt the manga in a style that stays consistent throughout the show although didn\'t put much effort beyond that. Really, the real standout parts are perhaps the character expressions. They didn\'t put extra effort into the action chereography and some of the animation looked like as if it\'s on auto-pilot. Similarly, the voice acting and music can be said to be rather average. Shy\'s personality does remain honest throughout the show that matches her character personality, while the theme songs has a somewhat catchy superhero tone.I don\'t think it\'s an open secret that creative minds in the anime and manga industry have attempted superhero themes into their work these recent years. While it didn\'t explode into the industry in a similar pattern as isekai, it definitely marked a spot that didn\'t go unnoticed. For Shy, it didnt exactly hit the sweet spot even with some of its more emotional tones. Truth is, this show could\'ve extended much more than what see see on the television screen. Luckily, this show did get a season 2 announcement. However, the manga is where you can get real juicy details. at over 100+ chapters, it raised a question mark how the anime can stay faithful. And indeed, Shy\'s adaptation does skip over some material although stays honest with the majority of its premise. This is also the first and only adaptation by the original creator, so it really put them on the map. I\'m not going to resummarize the synopsis because it speaks for itself. What we should know about is Shy, the title character. Yes, you can guess it without a bat of an eye. She is nicknamed ""Shy"" because of how shy and timid she is. Representing Japan as a superhero, the show follows her adventures in a futuristic dystopia that managed to evade World War III.Shy\'s real name is Teru Momijiyama but her nickname stands out more due to the role she\'s in.  Representing Japan is a huge responsibility and given her kind hearted nature, she does what\'s possible to help the helpless. I\'m not going to sugarcoat it but some of her early missions and feats are rather underwhelming. It seems other superheroes clearly overshadows her role such as Russia\'s Spirit or Switzerland\'s Lady Black. Why? It\'s because they are much more confident in their abilities. Shy\'s biggest flaw is herself and although the season attempts to change that, it doesn\'t fare too well.

This show instantly had me hooked since it takes a somewhat different approach to the superhero genre of entertainment and actually focuses on how the struggles of the heroes directly impact the lives of those around them, especially the ones they’re trying to save. The main theme surrounding this anime is focused on one’s heart: how one either closes it off, opens their heart to others in order to form a connection, or how it is exploited by others. The devices that the superheroes use harness their hearts in order to transform into their alter egos as well as use their super...powers. The villains’ main goal is to reveal the deepest and darkest of each person’s heart and exploit them to create a more “fun” world. The ideas and thematic ideas in Shy are very interesting and somewhat vibrant in an oversaturated superhero sub-genre, especially in 2023 when we have millions of superhero content. The characters have quite a bit of depth to them, mainly Teru, aka Shy, and Pepesha, aka Spirits. The relationships that these characters have are not only fully fleshed out, but also further add to the main narratives of the season. I kinda prefer this form of storytelling in stories like these, since characters like Teru and Pepesha in other movies and shows only show them being badasses without building who they really are and why they fight to protect and save innocent people. This show is definitely focused more on characterization over action, which is both a good thing, but it comes with its downsides. First off, the animation straight up sucks. The fight scenes are very lazy and have a hard time keeping me engaged in the more intense moments in the anime. Secondly, there are some scenes, and even episodes in general, that don’t really add much to either the story, characters, or setting. There are moments where either the heroes or villains are just dicking around and these scenes add nothing to the overall show. Don’t get me wrong, I like some slice of life in my stories, but they need to contribute to something. Although there are a lot of great ideas in this show, I feel like the overall execution could have been just a little bit better. powers.

Of course, you have the closest semblance to it, being of Kohei Horikoshi\'s Boku no Hero Academia a.k.a My Hero Academia, and while that is a juggernaut of a series under Shueisha\'s Weekly Shonen Jump, the former being published under Akita Shoten\'s Weekly Shonen Champion, with the LN now still ongoing with 22 volumes strong since August 2019, it may be one of the many HeroAca rip-offs (which mentioning this feels ingenious at best), but...I think that Shy has much more potential than we have giving it the benefit of the doubt, apart from being just an inspirational superhero imitation that deserves its own special attention.As mentioned, you can compare Shy to HeroAca, but only in the slightest of terms, as the mangaka himself opted for a rather down-to-earth story (as compared to HeroAca\'s rather frenetic and fast-paced setting), penning about the likely circumstances if he was the hero in the story while taking cues from similar films from both Marvel and DC Comics. That story won Akita Shoten\'s Next Champion Grand Prize award in 2016, which was then serialised 2 years later, and tells of a rather meek and shy hero, whom of which shares the likes of a superhero-esque world with HeroAca and its main protagonist of Midoriya Izuku\'s early stages. But that\'s where the similarities end.The main premise of Shy being of heroes protecting and restoring peace in the world from preventing a possible fictional World War 3, its heroes may be done with their own heroic duties, but that doesn\'t excuse them from being ordinary citizens and watching over the people around them. By the order of their gathering HQ in Space, led by their leader Unilord, each hero is assigned to the country or nation that they have to attend to, to look after the common folk and solve its domestic issues, dealing with the issues of the ""heart"", either protected by the heroes or manipulated by the villains. Every hero is equipped with a pair of Heart-Shift Bracelets that allow them to not just transform their appearances, but also sync their heart with the bracelets, becoming the source of power and abilities by storing ""Heart Power"" for use when seen fit. The stronger one\'s conviction and determination is, the more powerful one can become.This then brings us to the young eponymous hero, 14-year-old Teru Momijiyama, of the hero name ""Shy"" and the hero representative for Japan. Rather than going for what HeroAca is known for with its world of naturally born people with superpowers, Shy does this by only bestowing powers to the selected few as a sort of superpowered figurehead, which is what lands Teru as a hero in the first place. Think of it as more of the Hetalia: Axis Power inspiration than HeroAca, that as much as the typical high school student that Teru is, it has less to do with her hero activities than it does with her everyday life. But make no mistake that Teru is still a hero in her second form, and other than being aided by her ""Shrimpy"" robot figurehead, N. Villo, she is still regarded as her country\'s hero, despite not being outgoing. However, that Shy name moniker of hers gets rocked by linked events: First, the typical rescue mission of high schoolers getting stuck upside down on a roller coaster, which can give away anytime, makes for a much more disastrous matter, in which Teru\'s own ineptitude as a hero, caused to some extent by her bashful disposition, leads to a tangible loss of human life as one girl nearly died in a comatose state, and her recovery is almost a God-given miracle at hindsight. Secondly, the same exact once-bedridden girl, whom Teru is then simultaneously blamed for the mishap, is then invited by an evil entity benefiting from the rouse of the matter by diving deep into the deepest depths of their hearts and combining with his, making for one powerful anti-hero resistance through the corruption of her heart by wearing a special type of ring that is connected back to their leader as a result of the rings being made from parts of his heart. Teru manages to save her from harm, and apart from having saved her brother before her, she appreciates everything that she does by transferring to her school and becoming her confidante alongside the heroes that Teru would meet in the series. That girl is the same-aged Iko Koishikawa.Having known about the evil entity, which the heroes dubbed ""Stigma,"" he looks like a young boy who is rather abstract and childish to the point of refusing to mature, wanting to create an adult-free world, one of only children. He is the evil entity\'s group leader, named Amarariruku, who corrupts people\'s hearts with the rings given to ordinary but selected people close to the heroes\' hearts. As OTAQUEST\'s Jacob Parker-Dalton quotes it, ""Stigma is decidedly darker as they prey upon the darkest parts of the human heart, converting victims into the kind of corrupted monsters that you\'d see on a Saturday morning episode of Sailor Moon."" and also ""decisively more sinister as their identity and motives remain shrouded in mystery."" Like the example of the hero with whom Teru spends the most time: Pepesha Andreanova. The Russian hero who likes vodka (as do many Russians), her upbringing is but a bed of roses with the close semblance to the real-life former Soviet Union colony with only her and her late mother Lenya, which Stigma imbues another child looking like her, looking to break the bond between the single mother and daughter from their harsh growing-up days spent in an orphanage and having the same fondness for alcohol. Pepesha stands out the most, aside from other heroes seen in this show (at least for this first season), due to her overprotectiveness towards the shyly meek and kind-hearted hero herself. And if you\'re thinking that this is all Shy has to offer, you\'re dead wrong, as many other countries\' heroes get a cameo for now, and they too will be expanded in Season 2 coming soon.Despite the anime having been worked on at studio 8bit, which has churned out rather impressive shows as of late like Blue Lock, the director\'s position given to studio Lerche director Masaomi Ando, I think, is a near-perfect match. Masaomi Ando is quite diverse in his directorial craft, despite having a staff team of a mix of 8bit, Lerche, and freelance stuff who can accommodate the show\'s production to angles and views that look as good as they are, even if the show does feel a bit undercooked at best.The music, I think, fits the show quite surprisingly well. From the OP, MindaRyn\'s ""Shiny Girl"" has got the right amount of energy for a superhero anime, and apart from suiting someone like Teru, it has got the most mid-2000s Seishun (youthful) Disney-ish coming-of-age anthem; to the ED of both Teru and Pepesha\'s VAs Shino Shimoji and Nao Touyama, which despite being a rather simplistic song, I quite like its easygoing groove that\'s easy to get a bop out of.As Steven Blackburn of Screen Rant pits the series, calling it an ""underrated"" manga and complimenting how the story ""expertly delves into the insecurities of both the hero and civilian in original ways that other publishers, including DC and Marvel, have yet to accomplish,"" I would like to think of the same values regarding Shy, but as it stands, it\'s still the ""Journey of Beginnings"" for Teru, and I am more eager to see her improvement as a capable hero in the long term.A rather subtle start for now, but as minority as the praise that it gets from me and not the community in general, I\'ll stick to my ground to say that this show, like its manga counterpart, is very underrated. The 3-episode rule is as much a recommendation that I\'ll give if you want something rather different than the similarities of HeroAca. I think that Shy has much more potential than we have giving it the benefit of the doubt, apart from being just an inspirational superhero imitation that deserves its own special attention.As mentioned, you can compare Shy to HeroAca, but only in the slightest of terms, as the mangaka himself opted for a rather down-to-earth story (as compared to HeroAca\'s rather frenetic and fast-paced setting), penning about the likely circumstances if he was the hero in the story while taking cues from similar films from both Marvel and DC Comics.

This was one of the few new anime that aired in Fall that I actually seen videos hyping it up, however the show itself is just meh.Let's go over the plot briefly, after world war 3 the whole world somehow unites in peace, and now there's heroes all across the globe that represent their countries, and we follow Shy, who is Japan's hero. Real name Teru, Shy is a middle school girl who's socially awkward but is still a good hero despite that.We get introduced to I think 6 heroes all together across the season. Japan's hero obviously,...Russia's hero, Switzerland's hero, Britain's hero, China's hero, and briefly shows German's hero. However, really only 2 of them matter, or get focus put on them I should say. Japan and Russia's hero. Near the end of the season too it felt like Russia's hero becomes more of an MC than the actual MC, which is probably not a great thing for a show to do.The show itself is also just kind of boring, when it goes into fights and saving people it's good. good art, good animation. However when it's just interactions, it just doesn't feel engaging and just plain boring. Obviously, this is just my opinion so it's different for a lot of other people.All in all, it's a meh show with good art and animation and a fun vibe that sadly doesn't linger. And the biggest offense this show has done is give Switzerland's hero guns. Like, that's an American thing, why is Switzerland the one with the guns? outrageous!

And I don\'t care what people say, this is a great anime. It has the main protagonist have some kind of PDSD thing that she can\'t turn into a superhero. That, in itself, is great. My Hero Academia hasn\'t got that I don\'t think! It is so good.The art and animation are great.The characters are great. Some NEED some backstories.

HIGHLY recommend.', ""Title: Shy: A Thoughtful Blend of Shounen and Shoujo, Focused on Heartfelt DramaShy is a unique anime that skillfully treads the line between shounen and shoujo, offering viewers a refreshing and engaging experience. With a reluctant but determined hero at its center, the series combines good animation with a narrative that leans towards drama rather than action, creating a distinctive and emotionally resonant story.The animation quality in Shy is commendable, providing a visually appealing backdrop to the unfolding drama. While not necessarily groundbreaking, the animation serves the story well, capturing the essence of both shounen and shoujo elements without compromising on quality.What sets Shy apart...is its focus on a female hero without delving into ecchi territory. The decision to keep the narrative in the lighter girls' love edge, especially with the majority of the cast being female, adds a unique flavor to the story. It explores relationships and emotions with a tenderness that avoids the pitfalls of unnecessary fan service, allowing the characters and their connections to take center stage.The reluctant hero is a familiar trope, but Shy manages to breathe new life into it by infusing the character with depth and nuance. The protagonist's journey becomes a captivating exploration of self-discovery and growth, keeping viewers invested in her personal and emotional struggles. The balance between the hero's reluctance and determination adds layers to the character dynamics, contributing to the overall richness of the narrative.While the series does have action sequences, the majority of Shy revolves around drama. This deliberate choice elevates the emotional stakes, allowing the characters to grapple with complex situations and relationships.

A story about heroes, flawed heroes, fighing to save humanity...Truthfully, the series will hit people differently as the heroes and villains have all gone through different tough life events.  The series does have some rather good character development and story depth, but surpisingly, the best and most dramatic parts were given to the ""villains"".  Because of this, one finds themselves siding with them and being annoyed and betrayed by the storytelling in the series as it uses silly gimics and the assption that you side with the heroes throughout the series.  And that there sadly is a definition of...bad writing. bad writing.', ""I think it’s safe to say that as time has passed, anime has gotten much, much more advanced, becoming more capable in all aspects than ever before. We’re getting some serious level-ups here in visual effects, in music, in animation handling quality, in everything you can think of. I mean, look at the Monogatari series. Sure, it’s quite old at this point (the first anime, Bakemonogatari, aired in 2009), but you can really see that studio Shaft killed it with displaying Akiyuki Shinbou’s creativity in the visual effects, worked a stellar job on the animation handling using clever techniques, and the music was, well, certainly...not the norm. It’s VERY ahead of its time, at least in my eyes. This season’s SHY has some pretty unique visual effects too.And that’s about it for the notable stuff in it.Think of a Krispy-Kreme donut, about to be finished and put on sale. The bagel’s fresh out of the oven and all that’s left is for the glazing to be put on. But wait, the bagel was actually half-baked, and someone dropped it on the floor by accident. On the way to the baker-thingy-whatever, someone somehow rapid-fire sneezed in every corner of the room possible, and all that stuff landed on the unbaked bagel. After being half-baked, the delicious, appetizing glazing is put on, making the bagel a finished donut, and giving it a pretty touch-up. That donut is SHY. If you didn’t catch on to anything I said, basically what SHY is, is a poorly-conveyed, poorly-directed anime with a horribly overpompous attempt at being meaningful, and flashy, over-the-top visual effects to draw people in and make the dummies think that the anime is actually good by that quality alone.I was extremely disappointed that, when I opened Crunchyroll, searched up SHY, and clicked on the title and its first episode, I was greeted with an overused excuse of a weak, insecure and socially inept MC, because I actually expected this to be something new, refreshing and different after the high and almighty visuals that came before. Instead, after upping your expectations, you’re smacked with that MC, and later presented with the most generic plotline in the world. Not just generic, but predictable as fuck too. It’s about these magical girls—ahem, superheroes—that each represent a country and together have to fight off some similarly one-dimensional villains threatening… the world? (I swear, they’re there just for the superheroes to find them and go all gung-ho on them). And all the while you are watching, it bombards you with super COOL and SLICK and MODERN visual effects and camerawork, all for you to lick up off the dirty floor. I shouldn’t have listened to the one person on an unreliable part of the internet cheering SHY on, claiming it’d be the anime of the season, because holy shit, it is not.A lot of the time there are underlying messages in anime, hidden under the surface of its main attraction. A perfect case for this kind of anime is Cossette no Shouzou, a three-episode OVA with a similar score to SHY on MAL, filled to the brim with clever and appealing visual effects, accompanied with masterful animation handling and a similarly masterful soundtrack. Its main plot is drenched in the ‘donut glazing,’ so much so that it becomes hard to understand what actually is happening anymore. SHY does the exact same thing, only it wouldn’t have been so unnecessarily bad without its 'glazing'. Cossette no Shouzou needed its fanciness to portray the rest of its story and so the viewer wouldn’t be turned away due to the weird plot behind it, but SHY on the other hand just throws it all at you with a completely normal, completely fine-on-its-own message of ‘even if you’re a socially weak mess that looks like your textbook American nerd, if you believe in yourself and gain enough courage, you can be a normal woman’. It puts all its good qualities to waste and makes everything ten times more dramatic and serious than it needed to be, and it often becomes laughable. At least it was laughable, though.You know, my expectations might have been a bit biased, as I’d seen someone praying that SHY’d be the anime of the season, and I’d also watched the PV that really, REALLY gaslighted me into thinking it’d be a unique anime. But I wasn’t expecting at all, even with my lowest expectations, that there’d be fillers. I thought we were past that era, I thought we’d learned from that. But no, no! Our author really wanted to stretch their story on and on! If these fillers were meant as a break from all the mess, they should’ve just toned the mess down, not strip the anime of its last bit of meaningful sense and reduce it to a dull and drab slice of life with no relation or necessity to the plot.It's a shame that the animation handling was actually somewhat well-worked compared to the rest of this anime. Wasted budget and effort went into animating this godawful experience, and I can’t help but feel a strange pity for the animators that worked so hard to actually make this some good eye candy and not some poorly-worked garbage of abject misery. But I’m going to beat the dead horse here and say the animation handling isn’t anything amazing. I may have praised it, but that’s just because it’s not absolute rubbish like most of everything else in this anime. There are clear flaws strewn throughout (like Pepesha literally popping into frame out of nowhere) and some questionable usages of CGI, namely with Ebio-san. More on the directorial side of things, the animation handling can sometimes, out of nowhere, get overly flashy for no reason whatsoever, especially when random trivial scenes play out as opposed to where it’s really needed: the action scenes.I love spending my time on YouTube, and I’m sure many others reading this do too. It’s an unavoidable part of the internet that’s just about held captive over two billion souls. And a big chunk of those two billion souls know the horrors of the cringy intros and outros that were prolific in every YouTube video back in the late 2010s. And now this year we had to relive that horror again, this time in the form of an anime. Not only is the OP a horrific vomit-inducing vertiginous mess of overused transitions with nauseating camerawork and overdecorative everything, but the visual effects ejaculated everywhere throughout the anime’s runtime doesn’t make it any better. That’s right, I’m bashing the visual effects even more. Oh, we’re going over a tragic event? Let’s add thirty spinning camera transitions and a snow filter so the viewer can’t see shit! Are we explaining some unnecessarily ostentatious lore that’ll change these characters’ lives forever? Let’s put on a film grain filter and make twenty-two triangles and eighteen squares ease into the screen, all starting at a thirty-four-degree angle and ending at a ninety-two-degree angle using keyframing! There might not actually be that stuff, but that’s the kind of stupidity you’ll want to expect. There’s a reason the manga is rated higher: It probably didn’t try to win a fucking Nobel Prize with dizzying visual effects like the anime did. The Nobel Prize for the most detriment to human eyes is what the anime is winning.For how outwards they went with making the visual effects look like unicorn barf, the artstyle is probably the most non-infuriating, plain and normal thing in SHY. It’s like a ‘wake the fuck up, motherfucker’ call that snaps you out of the trance the visual effects threw you into. It reminds you that you’re not always experiencing Satou Yoshiteru-style directing and xXStickyHotdogGamingXx YouTube intros. It reminds you that at least this travesty can at least be mediocre and not all crapola. What I wrote just before might be the tiny little praise I’ll give to the artstyle in light of the rest of the garbage, but I can’t find anything to criticize, which shows just how bland it is. It’s almost the same as every artstyle you see mangaka use nowadays when they’re too tired or devoid of creativity, or the artstyle big companies use when they have zero budget left to spend on the character designers. Oopsie-daisy, I just criticized it, didn’t I?Seems like we’re taking a break from all the rubbish, because now we’re talking about SHY’s music. It’s far from great, but it’s at least one look away from this eyesore of an anime. The music director knew what they were doing, appropriately picking when to play and what to play. You might be watching that one filler part of an episode I talked about, and you’d be hearing pretty carefree, light music, and a few minutes later you might be watching an action scene, a battle between superheroes and villains, and you could be hearing intense or tension-building music, or that weird piano piece that plays two chords each three times exactly… (shut up i’m not good at defining music genres ok) The music itself, though, while fitting, is reaaally uninspired and average. Okay, maybe theres a track or two that are actually a bit surprising, but that’s really it. Are ya proud of me? I don't dislike TWO things from SHY now. Go me!...Oh, back to the dumpster, are we? Let's see... so, what about the one-dimensional characters? We’ve already gone over Teru as a basic bitch in the ‘I hadn’t gone outside before this anime started’ world. The author just slapped the mundane introvert personality onto her, and there ya have it, that’s Japan’s superhero. The other superheroes surrounding her also have stereotypical and sometimes discriminatory personality traits too, like Pepesha, the superhero representing Russia, who we see as drunk more often than necessary. There’s also the useless, burdensome plot device of the anime, Koishikawa Iko, who is around more than half the time as nothing more than a superfan stalker of Teru, even after Teru failed to save her from getting injured from a disaster. As for the supervillains, they’re akin to cardboard in terms of writing. They exist for the sole reason of making this anime work, and nothing more. There is no depth to them; nothing telling us who they really are, save for a single backstory that’s so generic it hurts, and why they’re so goddamn mentally sick, but this anime just has to be some pretentious pile of garbage or else the author wouldn’t survive. It’s clear from the moment they’re introduced into the anime that they were attempted to be given a deeper, more extensive meaning, but it just doesn’t work when the characters don’t have any meaning in the first place.That was a bunch to cover, but that was my view on this season's SHY to the best my tired brain can type out. To shorten my statements, SHY is a pretentious work about superheroes fighting against evil that smacks nothing but drivel into your face by its sad attempts at giving itself meaning with backstories, wacky, over-the-top visual effects that when watching are like being sick on a rollercoaster, and its paper-thin, depthless characters. The only good stuff you’ll experience watching this is the pretty decent animation handling that was given at least some care, the average at best artstyle, and the nice but flawed music. If you’re wanting to watch something with meaning and sense in what it’s trying to achieve, SHY isn’t that. If you’re looking for dumb, sometimes agitating stuff to turn your brain off to and pay almost no mind to, SHY might be up your alley.You’re probably going to grow dumber if you try to actually pay attention to this thing anyway. Don’t end up like me.Thank you for reading my review. not the norm. It’s VERY ahead of its time, at least in my eyes.

They don't have to be perfect, but it seems like every hero in here is far from being suited to be a hero.There is only one hero that I somewhat cared about, unfortunately, she's a side character with a supporting role.

Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21845/Ushinawareta_Mirai_wo_Motomete,"['I honestly don\'t know why this show has such a low score. Perhaps too many people didn\'t adhere to the old adage ""don\'t judge a book by its cover"".Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete has a very interesting story indeed. Without spoiling anything for the potential viewers, the story is at its core a mystery. Until a certain episode, we are kept in the dark as to what the purpose is for the numbers on screen, and the relationship of the main story to the first scene in the first episode. Needless to say, when everything is revealed, it all makes sense. With the ending though,...some viewers may not be satisfied. I, for one, believe that an ending is paramount to the conclusion of a series. I applaud Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete\'s writers and staff for not pulling an ending out of their ass. The ending fits perfectly with the series, yet it leaves me wanting more.Now, the artwork. Having looked over quite a few of the screens from the visual novel, I\'m surprised at the huge decrease in production quality. Now granted, this is Studio FEEL we\'re talking about here, not necessarily your highest budget studio like ufotable or Madhouse, but I found the artwork ""different"" from other shows. While the visual novel is beautifully drawn and painted, giving each still a watercolor effect, complete with excellent and beautifully selected colors, the anime is flat, plain, and for some, an eyesore. I don\'t know what Studio FEEL was trying to achieve, whether it be just a budget cut or a new style of animation, but it leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth after watching 12 episodes worth of it.The sound isn\'t too memorable. Aside from the OP (which I thought was really catchy), nothing else caught my attention. Frankly, I don\'t even know if they played many OSTs.I think we need to stop judging anime so critically.All it comes down to is this: Was it enjoyable? Definitely.I loved watching this show. Although, if looked at critically, it is full of flaws, I ignored these flaws and watched a show that I felt was a fresh breath of air from the other harems/fanservice/romcom shows out there and ended up really enjoying this.I\'d recommend this show to anyone who wants a change of pace from your traditional shows. But please, if you decide to watch this, don\'t follow the ""4 episode rule"". Trust me, it gets much better in the last few episodes. some viewers may not be satisfied.

Now granted, this is Studio FEEL we\'re talking about here, not necessarily your highest budget studio like ufotable or Madhouse, but I found the artwork ""different"" from other shows. While the visual novel is beautifully drawn and painted, giving each still a watercolor effect, complete with excellent and beautifully selected colors, the anime is flat, plain, and for some, an eyesore. I don\'t know what Studio FEEL was trying to achieve, whether it be just a budget cut or a new style of animation, but it leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth after watching 12 episodes worth of it.The sound isn\'t too memorable. Aside from the OP (which I thought was really catchy), nothing else caught my attention. Frankly, I don\'t even know if they played many OSTs.I think we need to stop judging anime so critically.All it comes down to is this: Was it enjoyable? Definitely.I loved watching this show. Although, if looked at critically, it is full of flaws, I ignored these flaws and watched a show that I felt was a fresh breath of air from the other harems/fanservice/romcom shows out there and ended up really enjoying this.I\'d recommend this show to anyone who wants a change of pace from your traditional shows. But please, if you decide to watch this, don\'t follow the ""4 episode rule"". Trust me, it gets much better in the last few episodes.', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)In our lifetime, we have seen manned missions to the moon, robots on Mars, and probes that are able to land on a meteor floating within our solar system. Incredible feats that may have seemed impossible to the people of the past. A hot topic in science fiction that deals with such reality and currently physical impossibilities is the idea of time travel. Can we head back in time to fix the past? Do such actions somehow affect the future? Does there seem to be an unbreakable chain of fate that time travel, no matter how much we...want to, cannot erode? Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete attempts to explain the answers to these questions, but it\'s little more than a jumbled mess.STORYUshinawareta stars Sou and Kaori, childhood friends who attend both high school and the Astronomy Club with their fellow close friends Nagisa, Airi, and Kenny. One day, a fatal accident occurs, causing a rather strange series of events.As my little preview points out, and as becomes somewhat apparent early on, the plot revolves around the notion of time travel. Already this sets a cautionary flag. Time travel stories, more so than any other type of tale, require that any loose ends or connections are properly explained. It\'s paramount that no loopholes are established and the ""rules"" in place make sense. And for the most part, Ushinawareta accomplishes these tasks. While the time travel elements are not as intricate as other anime, it at the minimum makes sense within context. Some of the plot devices used are more ""higher level"" to thwart off potential investigation of the issues involved (that is, to make the process itself sound intelligent) which tends to take away from the ideas it is attempting to establish. The aforementioned rules are also fair, and give a sense of urgency that is unique. Even the final resolution provides a satisfying ending that doesn\'t attempt to cheat the system, closing off lines that may have broken off from the pact.A major flaw, however, is getting to this point.The climax occurs very early on. What follows afterwards is wasted build-up with little payoff, since we already know what is going to happen. A huge chunk of the season is dedicated to showcasing the futility of the actions performed by the characters, despite all their attempts at rectifying the outcome. That is to say, it starts out being a slice-of-life anime with allusions to time travel sprinkled throughout. It is not until the final few episodes that the crux and importance of the anime kicks in, but by this point, there does not exist any attachment to what is happening, since the finale has already occurred. The intended effects of what time travel entails are lost simply because one is forced to wade through unneeded events that ultimately serve zero purpose.There is nothing more hidden behind this tale of romance and science. It doesn\'t explore the greater implications behind time travel, it is thematically lacking, and the disjointed storytelling gives it a lack of direction.ANIMATIONUshinawareta is plagued in both the art style and animation departments.Starting off, the art style is entirely boring to look at. The venues provided stick mostly to the school and its grounds, with little in the way of detail. The characters also suffer the same fate, being forced to maintain rather dreary outfits with little in the way of originality. In fact, nearly all of the characters in terms of design are sadly forgettable in the long run. On top of all this, there are many times when the characters themselves look quite sloppy, as if the studio was fine with making small mistakes on a per episode basis.The actual animation for Ushinawareta is no different. Even if the show contains nearly zero action, the character movements on screen are usually limited to mouths only. Often times, there is only one character moving, even when more than one is appearing within a given scene. It\'s generally unappealing to look at because it seems as if no attention was given.CHARACTERSUshinawareta contains a weak amalgamation of characters that see absolutely zero depth, let alone characterization, save for one. Even then, it is barely enough to justify how one-dimensional the rest of the cast is.As the main love interest, Kaori is an extremely caring young woman. And that\'s the extent of her characterization throughout the anime. This is no joke; beyond just being nice to everyone around her, she constantly employs the same tired tactic of being defensive whenever she is questioned about her true feelings. There do exist attempts at making her more of a well-rounded character, but she only ever responds with kindness for any given conflict.Sou is the main character of the anime, but follows an even worse route than Kaori. He is known for his affinity for the stars but is otherwise passive in all other matters. He goes along for the ride for the entire season, and his passion only kicks in when he realizes what he\'s wanted all along. This passion leads to despair, and what should be a sense of character development. But once again, it never comes to fruition. He maintains the same passive behavior that defined him from the beginning, making him one of the worst leads I\'ve had to experience in quite a while.The only notable character within the anime is Yui, the girl with a mysterious past and unknown future. While her relevance is masked, she becomes the key to solving the crisis that affects Sou and the others over the course of the show. Her experiences define her character: elegant, confused, at times pushy, loyal, and determined beyond belief. She does everything in her power to reach the conclusion wanted by those dear to her, even when she knows what such an outcome means. Her stalwart actions demonstrate her love for the friends and family she holds dear, making her the highlight of the anime.The rest of the cast, namely Kenny, Airi, and Nagisa, are just as lacking in characterization as Kaori is. The funny man, the losing love interest, and the wise upperclassmen. Nagisa at the least is explored for a certain amount of time, but reiterating myself once more, it means nothing to her character because nothing ever emerges from the situation. There are just too many characters within Ushinawareta that mean nothing from beginning to end.SOUNDThe first OP is okay. The vocals and arrangement make it sound grand in nature, which somewhat opposes the contents of the anime itself. The trumpets and violins attempt to add flair to the piece, giving it an overall orchestral feel.The ED is not that good. The slow singing, plain piano playing, and generic beat make it boring to hear, both inside and outside of the anime. The best part is not in the sound but in the visuals; they are actually pretty ""artsy,"" especially when compared to what the anime has to offer.The soundtrack contains nothing amazing. The only tune worth mentioning is the track that contains an interesting fading effect that was usually played when the characters were thinking about something interesting. It isn\'t meant to be a standalone track, meaning it only has a purpose at certain moments during the show. Other pieces exist that fit fun or dramatic scenes when needed, but these are pretty unmemorable.Voice acting-wise, Kappei Yamaguchi performed above average in his role as Kenny, but everyone else provided at the most average performances.ENJOYMENTTime travel is always an interesting topic. Both philosophy and science usually look at in a serious light, wondering what such a phenomenon could bring to the table should it exist at some point in the future. These specific elements don\'t exist within this one, with the show instead focusing on how the time travel works in context. So it was disappointing, to say the least, when the time travel portions were pushed to the backseat in favor of the rather boring slice-of-life aspects.Being a romance buff myself, I went into this one expecting to see anything of the sort. Unfortunately, it mostly consists of Kaori\'s previously stated defense, Sou\'s inability to articulate words correctly, and Airi\'s constantly losing battle. The deviation from this, like the rest of what potentially happens, doesn\'t pop up until much later into the anime. So the already lame slice-of-life elements, compounded by the lack of any significant romance developments, makes it difficult to watch as the episodes progress.Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete had the pieces to work with, but instead of laying them down neatly, they are thrown together haphazardly, making it quite clear just how directionless and stale it really is. It\'s an okay time travel story brought down by an incredibly weak cast of characters. The only thing left to do is to go back in time and prevent this one from being made in the first place.SUMMARYStory: Bad, okay time travel story with unnecessary slice-of-life moments and lack of themesAnimation: Terrible, art style is boring and contains minimal detail, character designs are boring and lame, actual animation is missingCharacters: Terrible, Kaori, Sou, Nagisa, Kenny, and Airi are awful, Yui is good but she is not enoughSound: Fine, okay OP, bad ED, fine soundtrack, okay VA workEnjoyment: Bad, focus isn\'t on the important elements, namely time travel and romanceFinal Score: 2/10 want to, cannot erode?

In fact, it´s so not mysterious that about fourty percent of all anime related web pages, including MAL, prefer to just list it as a regular school romance.Undoubtedly, this show gets off to a flying (and indeed somewhat enigmatic) start and culminates in the last three episodes, presenting us with a satisfying solution to it´s “mystery”. This would make WareMete a magnificent anime…if it weren´t for all the episodes that lie in between.Because for those eps,...Writer Rie Kawamata for some reason decides to throw his own plot completely out of the window and unexplainably depicts an ordinary school romance drama I couldn´t have cared less for instead, making this show a frustrating watching experience to some extent . Whilst I never got into the middle part of the story nor into the characters, I also never considered to drop the show either. I never entirely  forgot about the first episode, and I was just too curious how the makers would conclude it, and when they finally did (which happened just before I started throwing tomatoes at my screen), it was awesome!So can I or can I not recommend In Search of the Lost Future? Well…yeah, kinda…if you are searching for something you can marathon, you should probably look elsewhere, but if you watch this just one episode per day to avoid getting bored in the middle part of the show, you will eventually get some enjoyment out of this.Oh, and one last thing: watch this in English if you can, because otherwise a certain character named Kenny will make you angry…this guy with his stupid English catchphrases is annoying as f***.Therefore, I give this a 5.5…5 for the Japanese version, 6 for the English dub. It´s just way too inconsistent for more, but also not very bad for an adaption of an eroge visual novel.

So, it was the possible Sou X Kaori arc that got me into this anime, so........here\'s my rating for this  episode anime:Story: Fair 6.The plot where Yui is a girl from the future who was send to the past to prevent an impending accident to Kaori was pretty much a run of the mill, where the one of the concept was taken from a 2002 movie ""The Time Machine,"" but, since it does present a certain mystery as...to how Yui came to be and how her repeated attempts has affected the past really does make story likable, but not much.Art: Poor 3.Now the general illustration of the art was pretty much retro that such hue was not very good, it was just too old, also, there isn\'t enough fanservice in it, the only fanservice I see was with Airi.Sound: Fair 6.I simply don\'t like both the op and ed, also though Kaori, Airi and Nagisa\'s voice were alright, the problem was that their voices didn\'t have a mature tone on the fast forward scene where they were adults. Also, Kenny\'s voice obviously looks like that it was done by a 5 year old seiyuu, but then again his tone did add to some degree of humor to the character.Character: Poor 3.Sou Akiyama, being the usual harem guy who is just too stupid to notice the love around him is one reason why I gave this category a low score. On the lighter note, I like that he realizes how much he actually loves Koari after she got into an accident, FLASH BACK, I really hate the dude when he rejected Koari and went for Yui.Yui Furukawa, the problem with her character was that there isn\'t much about detail about her, all we know that she was send to the past and where every-time she fails, she falls into a continuous time loop. Now, I\'m no physicist, but when Sou fall in love with her, therefore saving Kaori from an impending accident, that\'s the part where she succeeded, now since the time line has been altered and she disappeared , wouldn\'t the time line start from the part when Sou rejects Kaori, I don\'t know about you guys out there but the part where Sou was almost killed is a violation of Einstein\'s Theory of relativity , another reason for the low score.Nagisa Hanamiya, how the fuck can a rich brat like her weld such infulence around school, also, we the audience were left wondering as to how she gain possession of a mysterious cube. In fact she alone is one big mystery.Sasaki Kaori, I really do love her character, and pretty much I\'ve expected a Sou X Kaori arc, also, here is another thing, with Yui\'s success in preventing her impending accident at the cause of her love for Sou, she shouldn\'t be seen in a hospital bed, she should have been seen being married to someone if Sou really is serious about seeing her as a childhood friend.Airi Hasekura, at first I\'m attracted to her fanservice, I guess if this anime has an ecchi element, then she would be it, FAST FORWARD, since she does have some degree of feelings for Sou, but having Yui able to save Koari, then she and Sou should be in a relationship.Eitarou ""Kenny"" Osafune, ok ,so he is the class clown in this anime, too bad that he wasn\'t given his share of the harem pie, he would have been paired off with either Nagisa or Kaori, one more reason for the low score.Enjoyment: Good 7.Being able to see a Sou X Kaori arc happening in the FAST FORWARD scene, thought briefly, was the enjoyable part, also the mystery itself was something else, where at one point we thought that Kaori is dead, also the mystery of Yui and how she came to be and understanding how she functions really did bought my curiosity, which is why I gave it its score.Overall: Decent 4 .Well, the anime as a whole is ok, but just barely, it\'s just that I can\'t forgive studio, Feel and FUNanimtaion Entertainment for violating Einstein\'s theory of relativity-if I can call it that- I\'m not a physicist, you know, but hey, if you like this anime for the eye candy then you like it, and that\'s that. to how Yui came to be and how her repeated attempts has affected the past really does make story likable, but not much.Art: Poor 3.Now the general illustration of the art was pretty much retro that such hue was not very good, it was just too old, also, there isn\'t enough fanservice in it, the only fanservice I see was with Airi.Sound: Fair 6.I simply don\'t like both the op and ed, also though Kaori, Airi and Nagisa\'s voice were alright, the problem was that their voices didn\'t have a mature tone on the fast forward scene where they were adults.

Upon seeing that it had one below 7, I was going to think twice about watching it, but I steeled myself and went ahead anyway. After the first few minutes, I thought of dropping it, \'cause there did not seem to be anything significant hooking me. However, I am now currently a pretty satisfied viewer of Waremete. I\'m sure I would\'ve regretted not watching, and would now be mocking the \'me\' in another timeline for not doing it. (Yes, the reference xD)[STORY: 8/10]Let\'s just...be honest. Any story which includes physics-related stuff and time travelling does confuse things. But confusion is good sometimes and this was one of em, in my opinion.Waremete features a story about this Astronomy Club which contain members who are barely interested in the subject, apart from one... no, two! Ahh... but who was the second one again...? Anyway, tragedy strikes early on and then suddenly a naked girl falls from nowhere and... wait, are we even talking about the same world? Or same universe? Well, you\'ll have to watch to find out!This just isn\'t your typical school romance. It does give some reminders of Glasslip (which wasn\'t very welcomed), but it definitely has an edge over that because it has a plot![ART: 7/10]When I first watched it, I felt there was something off with the art. Like something weird, which I just can\'t put into words correctly.  It felt SHAFT-y, yet it wasn\'t. But apart from that the overall art is rather well done. Not to mention that there are pretty girls in the mix. I mean, which dude doesn\'t want bishoujo in a romance genre series?[SOUND: 7/10]""I\'m confident we can change..."", but I\'m not confident if I can give this section a good score. I\'ve never played the visual novel, but the background music had the VN feel to it. It\'s good, but ain\'t the best I\'ve heard. Apart from that the OP and ED were pretty catchy in some sense![CHARACTER: 7/10]From what I\'ve read, this is pretty much the debatable component, and I\'d have to agree with some. Side characters, despite what they are called, shouldn\'t be fit into a series just for decoration. There is a slight tinge of that in this series, though. The dude Kenny just beautifies (okay, maybe not) the series with his American (?) accent. That Airi, whom I thought at first would play an important role, did not do anything significant through the series. I was, however, happy that Hanamiya got a decent feature episode.Now on to the main ones. Wait, can that even be plural? It\'s up to you to watch and decide, but in my honest opinion I felt there was only one main character in this series, who expressed her inner feelings well and had great development (*ahem* through many timelines *ahem*). Apart from that, the other two characters seem to just be what I\'d like to call \'supporting main characters\'.[ENJOYMENT: 8/10]There is tragedy, so no way there could be any comedy in this series, and that in itself is a minus point. But the feels towards the end tremendously make up for it. I was intrigued in trying to figure out the explanations, and even went to Google certain terms mentioned. I came out none the wiser but hey, at least it captured my attention for 11.5 episodes, and that\'s fantastic.The ending did not go they way I had hoped for it to be. It was an ambiguous ending, but I certainly think that that was the way to end it off. To let people think for themselves what possible timelines and events could occur, and for the visual novel players to rue some possible missed scenes.[OVERALL: 8/10]Cut Waremete some slack. It wasn\'t anticipated that much, but they did give it a commendable effort. And this effort got to me. Whether it will to you, please watch to find out. Because a \'you\' in another timeline may have already done so and is currently crying tears of joy. be honest. Any story which includes physics-related stuff and time travelling does confuse things.

Apart from that the OP and ED were pretty catchy in some sense![CHARACTER: 7/10]From what I\'ve read, this is pretty much the debatable component, and I\'d have to agree with some. Side characters, despite what they are called, shouldn\'t be fit into a series just for decoration. There is a slight tinge of that in this series, though. The dude Kenny just beautifies (okay, maybe not) the series with his American (?) accent. That Airi, whom I thought at first would play an important role, did not do anything significant through the series. I was, however, happy that Hanamiya got a decent feature episode.Now on to the main ones. Wait, can that even be plural? It\'s up to you to watch and decide, but in my honest opinion I felt there was only one main character in this series, who expressed her inner feelings well and had great development (*ahem* through many timelines *ahem*). Apart from that, the other two characters seem to just be what I\'d like to call \'supporting main characters\'.[ENJOYMENT: 8/10]There is tragedy, so no way there could be any comedy in this series, and that in itself is a minus point. But the feels towards the end tremendously make up for it. I was intrigued in trying to figure out the explanations, and even went to Google certain terms mentioned. I came out none the wiser but hey, at least it captured my attention for 11.5 episodes, and that\'s fantastic.The ending did not go they way I had hoped for it to be. It was an ambiguous ending, but I certainly think that that was the way to end it off. To let people think for themselves what possible timelines and events could occur, and for the visual novel players to rue some possible missed scenes.[OVERALL: 8/10]Cut Waremete some slack. It wasn\'t anticipated that much, but they did give it a commendable effort. And this effort got to me. Whether it will to you, please watch to find out. Because a \'you\' in another timeline may have already done so and is currently crying tears of joy.', 'For the sake of full-disclosure, I watched this anime as part of /r/anime\'s ""Nerves of Steel"" contest, where users were assigned various ""bad"" anime and forced to sit through them.Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete (from hereon referred to as Waremete), honestly surprised me. My expectations were rock-bottom, since the only reason I had even heard of this anime, let alone watched it, was because it was deemed trash. Looking at the rating, it seemed that was true.Waremete is a school romantic sci-fi mystery, centered around time travel. What a mouthful. An interesting mystery is set up in episode one. Sadly, the vast majority of the mystery...in the show is made ridiculously blatant by the second episode. Then, for awhile, the show turns into a mediocre school romance anime. For the first two-thirds of the anime, I was at least happy to learn that the show wasn\'t bad at all. It was just overwhelmingly mediocre. What kept me going (other than the contest requiring me to finish it) was the potential of the time travel plot that was ignored for the majority of the show.I can honestly say that Waremete, in all of it\'s long-winded generic existence, has a thoroughly satisfying payoff. And that\'s exactly why I bumped the show up to an 8 from a 5 or 6. I really cannot stress the long-windedness of the generic slice-of-life segments enough, but they didn\'t exactly surprise me. Waremete was adapted from a visual novel and anyone who has played a few knows that many of them are extremely long with little to no actual depth. That perfectly describes the first two-thirds of Waremete. Furthermore, some of the main characters were never fully developed, with their plot-lines being abandoned halfway through. One character, Kenny, was even more of a running gag/plot device than an actual character. My guess would be that the character issues were due to the fact that they only had around 4 hours (12 episodes) to tell a 10-30 hour story (according to VNDB.)The animation quality wasn\'t particularly amazing or unique, but if you\'ve seen Oregairu Zoku, then you know that feel\'s (the studio who made both Waremete and the aforementioned) greatest strength is facial expression. That definitely shows in Waremete. I was impressed by the variety of expressions. They were often extremely subtle, yet packed with character. Anime has been having a lot of trouble with expression as of late, so that was nice to see. I also enjoyed the music a lot. The op in particular set the mood of the (late) show really well.Now, getting back to the most important point: why should you watch this? Before I trailed off, I mentioned that Waremete has a great payoff. After all of the mediocre slice-of-life ends, we finally get a gripping time travel story full of interesting ideas and concepts. Look, I may be just be a sucker of time travel. Steins;Gate and A Certain Magical Girl Anime are two of my favorites. Regardless, the ideas and emotions portrayed in the final act of Waremete are not ones I will soon forget. If you have any interest in the time travel genre at all, take a look at Waremete if you can stomach the first two-thirds. My love for time travel might be making me overpraise Waremete, but I can at least promise you that this school romantic sci-fi mystery comes to a close in a tight, satisfying way. in the show is made ridiculously blatant by the second episode.

It then become a standard high school anime, of the casual caliber. Girl loves guy, guy is dense and girl wants to tell him her feelings. Standard... until strange events started to happen.Honestly, the anime had NO FREAKING SENSE to me until episode 9. After I watched that episode, I had a feeling of rewinding the movie and going ""Oooooooooooooooh so that\'s why"".I never thought that the anime was going for the reverse storytelling style. Usually animes progress as the story unfolds. But this one had...me with a jack in a box. The story makes no sense until you watch the one episode where everything is revealed. It feels like the real anime plot started from there, but you cannot say that anymore because you understand all the episodes you watched until then. I feel both confusion and appreciation that they did the story this way.Okay, now for the anime itself. Its story is good, though it hides it in the casual closet, then it becomes a sci-fi time travel quantum mechanics. They go deep, with multi-string theory, time travel EVEN Schrodinger\'s cat. Such science.Art is amazing. I loved the art, everything is well drawn and special effects are awesome.The sound is standard.I recommend it. It will take you for a spin! me with a jack in a box.

It will take you for a spin!', 'The past can change the future.As I have mentioned in my quote. Now, for the anime ""In Search of the lost Future"" or in Japanese pronunciation Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete.STORY (6):The story takes place in Uchihama Academy where Akiyama So is part of the Astronomy Club along with other people. This reminds me of Gokukoku no Brynhildr which I didn\'t enjoy that much. One day, a girl named Yui Furkuawa transfers into the school where she meets Sou and the gears of fate slowly begin to move.This concept sounds interesting. I did like the way how they show us how the past and change...the future. However, they could at least explore more about how the machines that transport a person from the future into the past works.ART (4):Now I have to talk about the animation. The animation at parts are very inconsistent. Some parts have extremely bold lines while some don\'t. The animation quality feels like an animation quality in the 2000s. I won\'t deduct points for the animation.SOUND (5):I liked the opening song. The ending song wasn\'t memorable. So far, from the resume of the voice actors who sung the ending song, so far they haven\'t done much roles.CHARACTER (6):Ok. Here we go.Airi is a badass. She is the type of person you shouldn\'t mess with otherwise she will kick your ass.Nagisa is an interesting character. I liked how they handle her backstory. The voice actress from Little Busters ""Rin"", Tomoe Tamiyasu, voiced her. I wished she had more interesting room for her development.Sou...... Well I have not much to say about him. He is a generic character who cares for the girls. Yeah. Right! Stop making me say that.Kaori....... She is a nice person, however her voice was annoying, like nails on chalkboard. If you notice the voice actress Hatsumi Takada who also sung on the ending song, she voiced characters in some hentai ""KanojoxKanojoxKanojo"". I don\'t understand what happened but her voice was the most annoying out of the bunch. I\'m so sorry that I have to say that.I did like Kenny, however he didn\'t have much material to work with. I just wish that Kenny would at least try to have some character development with the astronomy club members.Yui didn\'t have much material to work with. She never had any emotion or charisma just like the girl from Amnesia. If Yui had more material to work with then she becomes a better character.I liked their bonding moments with the group. I just wished some characters have enough development.My favourite character: Nagisa & AiriMy least favourite character: KaoriI\'m so sorry, people. I hope you don\'t get offended.CONCLUSION (6):I did enjoy this anime however, I wish this anime could at least make some characters flesh out or stand out from the crowd. Some voice actors were good while some were not. I think maybe some were trying their best to bring in emotion into characters.For the animation, if they could at least put in more budget within the animation, it could have been better.I just feel that the voice actors could at least put more emotion into voicing the characters.For what it\'s worth, I give this anime a 6 out of 10. the future.

It has tragedy time travel and romance.The first episodes will confuse you what the heck is happening then as you continue watching, the story goes like nothing happened. It all made sense later on and the anime ended with a conclusion which I guess is good.Pros:- unexpected genre shift- characters are likable- the drama is alright- no bullshit like fanservice, fillers or other nonsense- it has a conclusion...Cons:- everything in this anime is nothing new, as you've already saw in other anime's- visuals looks outdated, like the early 2000's animation- slice of life element may bore you- execution of the story is not done well- you may find the MC's goal trivialOverall it's a worth to watch. Not the best in the time travel genre as you can find better out there but it's still good.Final Verdict: 7/10 Cons:- everything in this anime is nothing new, as you've already saw in other anime's- visuals looks outdated, like the early 2000's animation- slice of life element may bore you- execution of the story is not done well- you may find the MC's goal trivialOverall it's a worth to watch.

It was nothing but an advertisement of the source material and the ending for the anime did not complete the route it decided to go down, which is the True End, and instead, decides to hang to leave people wondering to explore the source material. Only problem with that is, overseas audiences have no access to the source material. The whole advertisement for source material concept is flawed for overseas audiences considering we have no access to the source material, therefore leaving the...story for us incomplete for a long time. Now to the anime review:For an anime about parallel timelines, it setup the narrative really well and leaves details we don't understand in the beginning thats dismissed as something else becomes tomorrows understanding. It paced itself really well and left each episode interesting and excited to watch the next one. Though it loses its pacing due to original content the anime added that tried to feel like the VN, but failed to entice me into believe it was a storyline from the VN considering at how poorly executed it was. The animation was pretty subpar and it was apparent that quality checks weren't done. The ending to the anime left me raging at the fact that for 15 minutes, nothing was accompished whatsoever, and when it came down to the last couple of minutes when he realizes the truth, the anime ends right before the True End route completes, leaving the story unfinished. If it had a 13th episode, I could see that it would wrap the route up, but since its 12, not so much.

It showed remarkable promise and sported a seemingly convoluted story line by the end of its pilot episode. Everything you could...possibly want out of a pilot was displayed right then and there, making it a contender for the more major productions of the season. Love, tragedy, an unconscious and naked silver-haired girl, comedy, etc. It was all right there. But as Robert Frost said once, ""Nothing Gold Can Stay.""Ushinawareta is the newest piece from director Naoto Hosoda (Mirai Nikki/Shuffle!), and from what I\'ve gathered, it is also the worst. It follows protagonist, Sou Akiyama, as he tries to (SPOILER ALERT) essentially turn back time and prevent his childhood friend from meeting her inevitable death. And of course the best course of action in doing this is to create another human being in a lab somewhere that is somehow capable of time traveling back to when Sou was in high school and hanging out with him and his friends in the Astronomy Club and basically telling inevitable-death-girl not to die.As I mentioned previously, the pilot for this show sets you up for what looks like is going to be a trip down a tragic and twisted pathway on the way to heartbreak and despair. But everything you will receive after that first episode will either put you to sleep or make you question why you even bother watching anime anymore. BUT, if you\'re cool with watching a show composed of nothing but filler and exposition that isn\'t even relevant to the story, go ahead and watch the rest of the season. And without giving anything away, I\'ll try to separate this review into a few key components to better illustrate my disappointment.Music: 7/10The music for Ushinawareta really wasn\'t terrible (Apart from the opening which was borderline horrendous). The soundtrack, though not extremely varied, fits the overall tone of the show and is equal parts despair and mystery. This can easily be credited to one of my personal favorite sound-directors, Satoshi Motoyama. Considering the show an adaptation of a pre-existing visual novel, it is obviously going to sound at least somewhat decent and hold on to some of the music that readers have grown accustomed to.Characters: 7/10The cast of this show wasn\'t that bad either, to be honest. All of the characters were at least slightly original and not directly copy/pasted out of other anime. The thing is though, none of them matter. Only three out of six main characters are actually linked to the main story line of Ushinawareta, and the rest are essentially there to extend each episode to 22 minutes. And I still don\'t get what Hosoda was thinking dedicating an entire episode and a half to a girl that, once again, made absolutely no impact on the story as a whole. And even though I liked that character more than all of the others, I was still angry that I had to watch her and be pulled away from what was supposed to be a tale of alternate universes and unrequited love.Art: 4/10Studio Feel isn\'t exactly known for their art, which is fair because it really isn\'t all that good to begin with. More care was put into the characters than the environment, but it isn\'t even that evident because they all look mediocre anyway. Animations were slow and lacked fluidity, and more times than not, it will appear that some of the objects were kind of just scribbled in rather than drawn with passion. Great art needs to focus on every aspect in order to be received well, and Ushinawareta falls short in this department.Story: 5/10Starting right at the end of the first episode, viewers are filled with suspense and shock. But immediately afterward, the story screeches to a halt and makes no progress until the second to last episode, where everything is essentially resolved. Ushinawareta is a prime example of how bad pacing can ruin a story that could otherwise be great. There was so much promise in this show, but it felt like it just gave up after delivering one good episode. I had basically given up any desire to watch the show three episodes in, but I still kept coming back in hopes that it would start to pick up. It just never does, and instead it feels more like one of my good friends betrayed me and severed our friendship.Long story short, this show isn\'t really worth watching. And unless you are a fan of the visual novel, I can\'t imagine you having a good time. There are so many other shows out there that do what this one tried to, but properly and with good pacing.

Before that, just play along as the dense protagonist fails to take a hint and pass their daily school lives. After the 8th episode, it gets a little interesting but still it's nothing new. It's a total copy of Steins; Gate. And the romance, there...is very little.

Maybe you might like it, who knows."", 'this anime is going to be on my top 10 romance anime list i like the story,the charachters ,the art is pretty decent, i enjoyed the anime its really goodi rate this anime 8/10 i love the ending and i like how there is like a little comedy for it this actually almost made me cry really really good animethis anime is supossed to be rated 7 but some people has their own opinioni hope this anime get known by a lot  of people in the future  andi personally recomended it for people who enjoys romance anime ', ""It's a slow anime with a plot that is very predictible, but enjoyable though. It starts with a huge event that may make u think its a thriller/mistery anime, but as the story develops, the plot loses it and the story is just about friends that gather together and spend some time at the school club. Its not until EP 9 that things start again the same way we were introduced in the 1st episode. I would recommend it for someone that doesn't kwow what to watch since it only has 12 episodes, so they would finish it in a week and it wouldn't take...much of their time. But i was into it enough to finish it and i wouldnt say it is a bad anime at all. The characters are funny, cute and i think this is the strongest point of the anime. Overall, i think its a nice anime with some good moments. 7/10 much of their time. But i was into it enough to finish it and i wouldnt say it is a bad anime at all.

Overall, i think its a nice anime with some good moments. 7/10"", 'This show is really underrated, like REALLY underrated. I\'ve got to agree that it is not close to being the best mystery/romance series but it deserves concideration.Story:    7The story is really unique, it\'s rare to see time traveling anime because thet need to be done correctly or they will fall flat and be forgotten fast. Sadly, ""In Search Of A Lost Future"" kinda fall in this category. The story is paced really weirdly and some useless Slice of Life elements really did slow the anime pace. But at least, near the end everything makes sense and everything is explained.Art:...6I did not hate the art of this show but I did not like it at the same time. Because there were a lot of derps in the facial art and mostly in the first episodes. The animation style looked great  and fluid. The colors were beautiful when they needed to.Sound:   7This opening is great, I never skipped it because it really follows the mood of the anime. It was a cute song but at the same time it could be sad. The original soundtracks was very good, but there was not much memorable soundtracks. The endings were great too. For the sound effect, I did not find anything incorrect so I would say it was impeccable.Characters:   6The main cast is really interesting and intriguing but somehow the directing for the charaters wasn\'t done correctly. Yui, Kaori and Sou did get good characterisation because they were important fir the story to progress. Airi and Nagisa were somehow useful im the last few episodes but never really shined before. Except for Nagisa who got a date arc of maybe 3 episodes but was forgotten after since it was just to see a bit of her personnality. Finall, Eitarou is the last member of the club, he is almost invisible, he got no personnality, no developement and almost no screen time, he\'s only there to be another male character.Enjoyement:   7I did enjoy this series. However, it could have been a better ride. They tried to pack so much in 12 and somehow failed to, it went on a mess where useless arc that we couldn\'t care less stopped us from seing what\'s happening next. I would have prefered it to be faster paste and show a better personalisation of the characters instead of doing arcs for them that are easily forgotten.Overall:  7In the end, I did not expect it to be any good. I started this show thinking that I would drop it after 3 episodes but no. If you like harem series with a touch of mystery you will like it. Also, it has some similarities with steins gate so if you are a fan of time traveling you have to watch this show. 6I did not hate the art of this show but I did not like it at the same time.

The anime was not bad at all, but there are a lot of flaws that may steer viewers away from this anime easily. I watched it through and I'd say it's not as bad as what people say.If you look at the recommendations to this anime, Steins;Gate is among that list. I believe that this anime shares very similar themes, but this anime doesn't execute those themes anywhere as effectively as Steins;Gate.STORY: 5. One thing about this anime is that time travel is...a huge theme in this anime. There are many questions about time travel. For example, if I do something in one time frame when doing time travel, what happens to people in another time frame? This anime is very iffy about addressing this.Also, the numbers that appear on the screen confused me. I didn't know what they meant until around ep. 3/4. This is likely to confuse many viewers for sure.My last issue is that I believe there are some pointless episodes as well that pertain to nothing to the plot. You will see some background stories of the main characters, but they serve no purpose to steering the plot.Otherwise, there is a story, and there is a direction. I can tell you that much. Because time travel is a big thing, you will see a bunch of scenes over and over in different ways, which is executed pretty well.ART/SOUND: 7, 8, respectively. I feel that some of the art was a bit iffy at times when it came to the animation. Otherwise, no complaints here, but nothing that stands out.Character: 8. The characters are very likable. They are different, and they aren't heavy stereotypes. Not much else to say other than characters are done well.Enjoyment: 6. Time travel is a huge mystery. We're not sure what the effects will be physically and mentally. I believe that the anime really missed on the psychological effect of time travel for the person that does the traveling. Otherwise, I felt that the episodes were okay and enjoyable.Overall: 6. The anime is not bad. 6 to me is not bad at all. I enjoyed it, but at the same time, I found many flaws that bothered me with this anime. Most, if not all of the flaws, are really directed at the story. At times, the story is very confusing until later. I'd give this anime a shot, but you need to commit more than a few episodes to get the grasp of the story. a huge theme in this anime.

The synopsis is written above so I will skip it .What I liked about the about this anime that it had and still has the Steins;Gate vibe in it, I won't go in detail about this but you should...watch that one to . Time travel is the main word if you want to describe this show, but the bad part about it that this isn't to well explained and because of that some holes in the story were born , of course you can let them slide and enjoy the anime as it is .About the characters, here is the main problem, they weren't fleshed out and because of that the drama in this show plummeted toward earth at lighting speed and the result was a 3rd rate melodrama. If this had 24, 25, 26 episodes the end result could've been a lot better.The soundtrack, what can I say here, nothing I guess, didn't find it really good or bad, generic is the right word for it, my bad is that I rarely care about the OST in a series that doesn't take itself to seriosly as in this case.The art/animation, another weak point, I don't demand something like Unlimited Blade Works for every anime out there, I know it's impossible, but it looked kinda outdated, something from 2008/2009 in 2016 is not a good selling point. As a side note, the first episode was the worst of the batch, it felt and looked really awkward, still frames, poor drawing and such .I have this thing, if I don't enjoy an anime even a little I won't finish it, so yeah I enjoyed it for the story and for the ending, that he made the right choice about the girl.For the closing words, or the conclusion, however you want to call it, the story was good, could've been better, the characters felt like they had no life in them, the soundtrack was nothing special, the art was a little ' plain ' for.my taste, and outdated, overall it had potential, but it didn't go as planed I guess. watch that one to .

If you\'re lazy to read this, go rock bottom.--Sooo, here we are, Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete. Just in case, THIS IS a VN adaptation so, yeah, don\'t expect much.Let\'s just begin:-------Pros:+PlotSeriously, this is one damn of underrated anime, you know why? Because people who \'underated\' this is 12yo kid who like to watch some whinylilpussy low-end anime that has no story depth....Dun\' worry, tho, cause, really, it\'s only the plot that give me enough point to watch this thing.The story is there, it is, you may get confused at beginning about the timeline due to bad headstart but the late episode will explain to you what is the shit, so sit down.Uhmmm, maybe, I should skip explaining like what the story truly is? Well, go read some synopsis if you haven\'t know the story.IT IS good, it has a depth, a depth of what is what, why is why, and well not so really ""how is how""-ish how is how (I mean, sure it doesn\'t explain it\'s \'intended\' creation of \'newfound\' technology as depth as Steins;Gate, but, well, e/e except that is at least explained). Every person has a reason, a \'development\', a story, and, something to analyze, and well, yeah, the plot barely consist of anything else beside the character trolling so, yeah.The plot itself is, as I\'ve said, not intended for ""whiny shonen enjoyer"", instead, it\'s intended to people who take it deep, and analysis the story fully, until they understand what is what. Even though you don\'t, you will, certainly, ""at the very least"" understand what\'s going on if you finish it cause it will all be explained anyway in the late episodes. That\'s why, a lot of people drop it off before they finish or barely just watching it, because, well, they did sent you flyin on mysterious \'not connected at all\' headstart, so people tend to mark it as ""An Anime that doesn\'t make sense"" before they even see the end, with open eyes, that is. That\'s why, be patient.AND, after you finish and understand what the heck is the connection of every episode, you even WOULD, and, STILL, brush it off as \'bad\', due to odd, and certainly bad enjoyment in the episodes before. Don\'t worry, me too, I hate the way they do things. The start and the late episodes was good, but in the middle where they scramble it all up, it isn\'t (Yeah, for god sake it\'s like the writer is out of idea). So, why don\'t you \'try\' to re-watch by flipping the episodes? The first beginning world (The Future one and first ep), and then lop it all off after that? Trust me, it feels, well, at least, a little different, and certainly, going to give off the feeling of generic anime. That way, you will feel more at \'ease\'. And also marathon-ing this one is kind of bad, cause it will leave you with a feeling that it could be wrapped in 4/5 episode or so, due to middle fillers, so, well, take it slow for this one. I guess.Its a \'monogatari\' that tells about (after time-leap/ep 2) a boy who suddenly found naked girls that doesn\'t seem to have memory. Yeah, \'Mainstream\' I\'d say. Unless, this one did \'Have\' a \'natural\' connected dots to each and everyshit that\'s happening, unlike most of the same concept that only have some, kinda, \'Forced\' connection to each and everybull. The writer successfully pull his ass out of the safe zone, gives off a kind of a dick story, and choose the \'ending\' of the route that suit the plot as a whole, also left people craving for better end (duh, y\'know nakige?). And I\'d say the fillers in the middle are some kind of relationship-exploration-wannabe, but, well, it doesn\'t end up as good, I guess. So I\'d say it\'s a kind of success on the Plot side. (Don\'t worry me, I\'m currently affected by the VN)---+CharacterNot so good, but not bad. For me, I\'d say, everyone else except MC, is great, they are generic normal char, but, they do have, like I\'ve said, a reason. And it\'s not your ridiculous ""I want to protect you because I love you/You are my friend, blablabla"" and ""I love you at first sight, cause you are blablabla"". They do, tho, have similar reasoning, with a slight difference. Sadly tho, that slight difference already make their reasoning seems \'valid\' and \'logic\' and certainly realistic and (kinda) complex. Look at Airi, why is she doing what? You\'ll understand if you try. AND certainly not just there to fall in dokidoki with MC (although they do), they are (almost) all plot critical and not just there to color MC up with harem. I\'ll leave the rest to yourself.MC is, well, your normal whiny kid (except he did, became a smart scientist), only with a slight difference. Not much to say here, I\'m sure you know better yourself.---+ArtDunno what to say. It\'s smooth, alright, it sure is not clunky. And, uhh, it\'s my style? More like personal opinion here. But, well, w/e.---+SoundPersonally, the OST is nice. But really, people tend to have different taste ain\'t they? (Fuccggaa..I dunno what to say)-------Cons:-PresentingReally, really, bad, and that should also affect the plot in overall, but, well, w/e. And I\'ve already explained most point of this part up there, so yeah, w/e, really.-Ehh, what should I call this? The middle of the show.I guess, is that right? Well, in short (like, real short), some (not all) of the thing in between is some kind of ""fillers"", that makes it, well, looks like it could be wrapped in just 4/5 episode. Although, some (1/2?) really add a great depth to the character (watching star, etc.) the others are well, as I\'ve said, fillers.-I dunno, that\'s all there is?Oh, right, IMO, it should\'ve picked Airi~ route instead :p Let the girl die.. like, all of them...-------Bottom line, (TL;DR, dude)It\'s good, as long as you take it slow.

Don\'t expect Aimer-EGOIST class here.Art is, well, mediocre good.In short, if you hunger for some plot-heavy anime, the one that doesn\'t really have a big shot on other point then, well, you might try this one up.The End.Maybe?--All in all, this is my personal opinion, agree or not, it\'s your freedom.--Thanks for \'at least\' reading this--Sorry if I mishit any point, typos, or whatever wrong I just did.Note*Reviewed by the viewpoint of mediocre(mid) VN adaptation*And yeah, I love the VN, and definitely recommend the VN.

You need to be able to read Jap tho :P, as of currently, there isn\'t (yet) any en patch.', ""This feels like a show with a bit of an identity crisis.When you start watching the first episode, you settle into what it seems like this is going to be. A high school club show, with a solid enough set up; the Astronomy Club is actually a really fun group, with a strong dynamic, distinct characters, and a good pre-existing rapport; their position in the school is great fun, with the idea of them being known for getting into trouble, and the Student Council even relying on them as informal problem-solvers, being really cool. The first episode pitches this as something along the lines...of Hyouka or Kokoro Connect (admittedly with much poorer visuals), a fun high-school mystery series, perhaps with a bit more of a supernatural, or at least faux-supernatural, side to it.Then, as a twist at the end of episode 1, we realise that there's a lot more going on; a horrible accident, a time-loop, a mysterious girl. Think a high-school, lower-effort version of that middle section of Steins;Gate. Again, I don't think this is a bad idea. We get bits of explanation trickled through, so by the time we officially learn everything, it feels like the show has given us enough of that information to get most of the way there without feeling like it's been overly predictable. There's a decent enough sense of urgency about it, each loop feels like enough changes that it never feels repetitive, and it also doesn't force itself to show us more loops than necessary, so from that point of view it never falls into that trap so many time-loop stories stumble into.Either one of these shows could have worked well. The problem is that they tend to get in the way of each other. Because it has to keep focused on the time-loop story, which is clearly intended as the main plot, the Astronomy Club hijinks tend to fall by the wayside, with those mystery aspects that drew me into the first episode so much never really getting a chance to happen. We see the club getting ready for the school festival, and one specific incident we see a few variations of, but not much else. Given the club felt so unique at the start, and the dynamic between the characters felt so fun, it's a shame that it falls so much by the wayside.But, conversely, because it still has those characteristics of a club show, the time-loop plot also feels a little underbaked. While the sense of urgency is still there, there actually isn't that much that happens. There's not a whole lot of proactive character decisions made, just a lot of knee-jerk reactions to specific situations; it's a very reactive story. This also adds a secondary issue, being that, because the time-loop story feels so underwhelming, it makes the feeling that the show has wasted the Astronomy Club dynamic even stronger; I really feel like this would have been better cutting the time-loop entirely, and just having it be that high school mystery show the first episode hinted at.It comes together to make a show that doesn't quite know what it wants to be. This isn't the only aspect that feels like this, either. There's a bit of an odd romance dynamic; the obvious pairing the show is clearly hinting at for most of the time never comes into fruition, and where the protagonist's eye ends up shifting to is weird at first, and, once you learn the bigger picture of the story, a little bit creepy. The show's a visual novel adaptation, so that definitely explains this a lot; there's obviously different paths the player can take the romance. Still, it's another way that the show ends up feeling like it doesn't quite know what it wants to do, and in this case it makes that shift in the romance feel a little out of nowhere.Ultimately, this is just a bit unremarkable. The animation follows suit, not awful but fairly stilted and uninteresting (the OP included, although I actually found the ED quite charming), the sound design is fine, nothing awful but nothing to comment on. Overall, it feels like an adaptation of a half-successful visual novel that made enough money to be financially viable, but didn't inspire any real creativity or passion in the people making it, leading to an anime that just feels sort of there.There's definitely something better in here, a more refined version of this story that balanced its two identities well and created something with some real weight to it. It's a good premise, just with lacklustre execution. And sometimes, even though I did mostly enjoy this, that feels even worse than outright disliking something. of Hyouka or Kokoro Connect (admittedly with much poorer visuals), a fun high-school mystery series, perhaps with a bit more of a supernatural, or at least faux-supernatural, side to it.Then, as a twist at the end of episode 1, we realise that there's a lot more going on; a horrible accident, a time-loop, a mysterious girl. Think a high-school, lower-effort version of that middle section of Steins;Gate. Again, I don't think this is a bad idea. We get bits of explanation trickled through, so by the time we officially learn everything, it feels like the show has given us enough of that information to get most of the way there without feeling like it's been overly predictable. There's a decent enough sense of urgency about it, each loop feels like enough changes that it never feels repetitive, and it also doesn't force itself to show us more loops than necessary, so from that point of view it never falls into that trap so many time-loop stories stumble into.Either one of these shows could have worked well. The problem is that they tend to get in the way of each other. Because it has to keep focused on the time-loop story, which is clearly intended as the main plot, the Astronomy Club hijinks tend to fall by the wayside, with those mystery aspects that drew me into the first episode so much never really getting a chance to happen. We see the club getting ready for the school festival, and one specific incident we see a few variations of, but not much else. Given the club felt so unique at the start, and the dynamic between the characters felt so fun, it's a shame that it falls so much by the wayside.But, conversely, because it still has those characteristics of a club show, the time-loop plot also feels a little underbaked. While the sense of urgency is still there, there actually isn't that much that happens. There's not a whole lot of proactive character decisions made, just a lot of knee-jerk reactions to specific situations; it's a very reactive story. This also adds a secondary issue, being that, because the time-loop story feels so underwhelming, it makes the feeling that the show has wasted the Astronomy Club dynamic even stronger; I really feel like this would have been better cutting the time-loop entirely, and just having it be that high school mystery show the first episode hinted at.It comes together to make a show that doesn't quite know what it wants to be. This isn't the only aspect that feels like this, either. There's a bit of an odd romance dynamic; the obvious pairing the show is clearly hinting at for most of the time never comes into fruition, and where the protagonist's eye ends up shifting to is weird at first, and, once you learn the bigger picture of the story, a little bit creepy. The show's a visual novel adaptation, so that definitely explains this a lot; there's obviously different paths the player can take the romance. Still, it's another way that the show ends up feeling like it doesn't quite know what it wants to do, and in this case it makes that shift in the romance feel a little out of nowhere.Ultimately, this is just a bit unremarkable. The animation follows suit, not awful but fairly stilted and uninteresting (the OP included, although I actually found the ED quite charming), the sound design is fine, nothing awful but nothing to comment on. Overall, it feels like an adaptation of a half-successful visual novel that made enough money to be financially viable, but didn't inspire any real creativity or passion in the people making it, leading to an anime that just feels sort of there.There's definitely something better in here, a more refined version of this story that balanced its two identities well and created something with some real weight to it. It's a good premise, just with lacklustre execution. And sometimes, even though I did mostly enjoy this, that feels even worse than outright disliking something."", ""This show, in my opinion, took way too long to kick into gear. Throughout the first half of the show, I spent more time wondering where this show was going than actually focusing on the show. The story takes too long to progress for you to even enjoy the show in the first place. In all honesty, I was somewhat hooked when shit hit the fan. This anime wasn't entirely all that bad.Story - 4I had no sense of what the story even was until things started getting explained. The problem with this show was that hardly anything was explained EVER. The only thing I...got from the first few episodes is that there's this dude who really likes stars and CHIKUSHOOOOO his childhood friend is dead and NANIIIII???? we're suddenly back at the start with a new white-haired girl. Even after the appearance of Yui, I still wasn't understanding what was happening.Art - 4Meh. Nothing special. Pretty boring to look at honestly. It did have a few moments. 10/10 for the freaky black box though.Sound - 2The sound in this show had no effect on me whatsoever. OST wasn't anything special either. I felt nothing from the music. OP was decent.Character - 3I LOVE YUI. She's was great, but she still can't make up for all of what the other character's lack. I HATE KAORI. Her voice actor, imo, was too high-pitched. Also, I just felt that Kaori was nothing but selfish the entire duration of the series. Kenny, funny guy, nothing cool about him though. Nagisa was going SOMEWHERE with the whole arranged marriage thing but then it was totally DROPPED. Airi, poor girl never even had a chance with Sou. Sou-kun, I don't think he was a strong enough lead.Enjoyment - 5First half of the series was bleh, but again, once it got going, I was intrigued. Still, this show was pretty hard to get through.Overall - 4I believe this show COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING GREAT.

There are shows, including some that could be described as masterpieces, that see characters repeating the same events, attempting to achieve the happy ending they\'ve dreamed of, or even just to break the cycle that has them trapped.  Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete (Waremete) is not one of the masterpieces, but in some ways it clearly has learned from them.  The basic story, that you\'ll get in the first episode, involves the first fourteen days of October for the five members of the Astronomy Club, ultimately ending in...tragedy as one of them is struck by a bus.  Then, an early scene repeats, only to be interrupted by the arrival of a new character.From there, most of the running time of the show is a new edition of the events we saw in brief for episode 1, changing steadily as the new additions influence alters outcomes.  It\'s decent slice of life, the meandering pace compensated for by the fact that most of the characters are fairly likeable and have at least two notes to play.  It\'s alright, but at the same time it has nothing to really propel the story forward.  Even the Sword of Damocles that is the fated accident kind of fades from memory as the show is concerned with average school days.Where the show hits both its highest and lowest points is in the final four episodes, which makes it fairly hard to talk about without at least some spoilers.  Difficult or not, though,  I\'ll do my best:  The final episodes give us the meat of the time travel story -- no more puttering around, it\'s time to actually get some time-travel physics and heavy drama.  There are elements, particularly the ones shown in Episode 9, that I\'m absolutely in love with.  In my opinion, the existence of Episode 9 is the one thing that Waremete does better than other time travel shows, to which it invites comparison, that otherwise have it beat.  Then, there are episodes 10 and 11, which have the show\'s greatest weakness: in order to achieve one goal we\'ve wanted to see for the entire story, we have to lose out on the on the other thing we\'ve most wanted to see for the entire story up to this point, and in the place of what was built with so much love and care we get a version that had to be rushed forward.Episode 12, the very ending, tries to gracefully give the viewers what they want, without invalidating having gravitas.  And in that, it does an acceptable job.  We go back and recover what 10-11 tried to steal, but there\'s also a loss of not just the replacement goldfish those episodes provided, but also something really nice from the core of the setup, so the tragedy and hope are not entirely missing.  In that way, we sort of get two endings, both bittersweet in their own way.  One ending grants us the emotions we wanted to see, achieved after bitter work and turmoil, while the other gives us the better chain of events, poisoned by two losses.  While I think the creators wanted the second of those to be the ""True ending"" I found myself resonating better with the first.  I would have been OK if that was the ending we really followed, into which the most the most effort and investment had been poured not just my me as a viewer, but by the production itself.So, in the end, this is a show that has a lot of ""middle of the road"", a stunning high point, and some really bitter low points.  I\'d say it was worth my time, but I do wish we had more of the good stuff and less of the sudden swerve.Story: 6Art: 7Sound: 7Character: 8Enjoyment: 6Overall: 7 tragedy as one of them is struck by a bus.

Also, unlike typical reviews that mention superfluous things like the art, music, etc. this will not, since nothing has particularly changed from the previous episodes.Firstly as OVAs so tend to be, this is largely about the fan-service. Secondly, minor spoiler that's revealed in the first minute, this takes place during summer vacation, which suggests that this timeline Yui was transported to predates the events of the bus accident by several months. However, for Yui's own timeline, it can be concluded that it takes place around the time that the Uchihama...Syndrome became first established. As with OVAs that feature summer vacations, there has to be a spooky portion, which undoubtedly will feature ghosts as this anime has in the past.Now, I wasn't fond of this anime, so my opinion of it provides a slight bias, but at its core, this ova at least answers a question of what-if. What if Yui was sent to the wrong point in time and what would come of that?So was it enjoyable? I guess, but like the rest of the anime it wasn't all too interesting. However, the spooky portion was a nice change from your typical beach fan-service OVA. Syndrome became first established.

Visual Prison,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48567/Visual_Prison,"[""When I looked at Visual Prison, I was skeptical of it at first because I thought it'd be one of those idol type anime where the character fits into a generic trope but as I watched it, it actually took me by surprise and I ended up enjoying it and looking forward to every Friday. The reason why I decided to give it a chance is because of Masuda Toshiki (Dimitri Romanee's VA). As someone who is familiar with the Visual Kei genre and a fan of Masuda-san, this anime sold me right away. The seiyuu lineup is amazing.Starting off with talking about the...story which I rate a 6/10, imagine Eurovision but the vampires are singing for the Scarlet Moon. I feel the story didn't really answer a lot of questions that fans have. With 12 episodes, I think it is possible to answer some of them but they never covered it properly; why does the Scarlet Moon want songs? What is Eclipse's motivation to protect their 'lambs'? I feel like a lot of the character backstories and their motivations are still shrouded in mystery. I feel like we still don't know Beth, Saga, Hyde, Dimitri, and Guil properly. I'm crossing my fingers that the anime will have a second season because I want to know more and more about the characters! Also, there's barely any blood sucking moments in the anime. What's the point having everyone as vampires if we don't see any feeding moments?Art, I give it an 7/10. I mean, the characters are not drawn ugly. They're pretty attractive on and off the stage. Visual Kei is supposed to have the band dressing up and putting make up on. I feel Eclipse (current and past Eclipse) is the only band living up to the appearance of how Visual Kei is supposed to be. They feel more Visual Kei of what it used to be. Lost Eden looks like modern day Visual Kei bands. As much as I like OZ, OZ is still too idolish. OZ looks more like an idol band than Visual Kei band. But enough about the character art, yes, there are CGIs used in the anime but they're only used 3 times but honestly, the CGI in here works better than the CGI in Berserk and the The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat. The CGI for when Eclipse sing their songs are amazing in my opinion. That is CGI done right there.Sound, 10/10. The 10 comes from the songs. Yes, my favorite band is Eclipse but even if you have a band that you like, you still find yourself enjoying the other band's songs. If you like JRock or Visual Kei, you will enjoy this anime for the songs because the seiyuus really do bring life to band songs and their solo songs. I wouldn't say the seiyuu lineup is amazing if it wasn't. If you lean more to Kpop or Jpop, don't expect the music to cater to your taste because if you don't enjoy Jrock, what are you doing watching this anime? You might as well watch Starmyu, Idolish7, or Utapri. This anime is for those who enjoys Jrock after all so expect strong bass, drums and electric guitar sounds. If you ask me whose vocal carried this anime, I think it's a tie between Makoto Furukawa (Guiltia) and Aoi Shouta (Hyde). Masuda Toshiki (Dimitri) gets a bonus mention for using a deeper tone when he speaks. So hot.Character, 7/10. Ange on his own doesn't really carry the anime in the first few episodes. The other characters in this anime have more life and soul than him. When the band get together, you feel a family vibe from each of them. Heck, you immediately find who is the mom and dad of the group XDOZ is a warm group and their character interactions reflect that. Lost Eden is like a warm family in their own way too which really surprised me considering they want to destroy the Scarlet Moon. Eclipse is pretty much a married couple with one another. For me, the most fun character is Dimitri Romanee. It will be spoilers if I reveal why so you're going to have to watch it yourself.Enjoyment: Enjoyment-wise, I'd give it a 9. If an anime can make me look forward to each song/episode for the sake of enjoyment and not just because I want to finish it for the sake of finishing it, I wouldn't give it such a high score. I'm now in a pickle because what will I have to look forward to now that Visual Prison is over? I hope they will give out an OVA or something.Fangirl level: 11/10. I ship Dimitri and Hyde.Overall: I give this anime an overall 8/10. The main guy (Ange) is weak as a character in the beginning episodes but he slowly picks up the pace and ends up growing on you. The rest of the characters are loveable and they're all precious in their own ways. It lost two points because there's not enough Eclipse. While they're trying to focus giving everyone their own solo songs, there's not enough screen time for Eclipse.

It’s all about musical Visual Kei bands battles with ikemens vampires (Visual Kei is a muscial rock-punk-gothic genre really easy to the eyes). Not gonna lie to you, there is a lot of fanservice, but I really was over-enjoying over this Visually and Soundly great title, and here let me explain why :• Story : 7/10 •We mainly follow the debuts of «\xa0OZ\xa0» bands, where our main character, Ange cross path with other Vkei groups Lost Eden and Eclipse during one of their shows in Harajuku. He will then stumble across his favorite singer,...Guiltia, here and so began the debuts of Ange’s wonderful voice which will be able to gather talents around him.\u2028The main goal of these bands are to win\xa0the\xa0favor\xa0of the Scarlet moon and participating in the Visual Prison’s event to gather scarlet tears. If you reunite at least 10 tears, you will be able to make a miracle.Dramas event happening, OZ’s band sure need these tears for them.• Art : 9/10 •Ikumi Katagiri takes charge of the original character designs, and even if you’re not enjoying the story, you can at least see how beautiful the fashion and characters are. \u2028There is unfortunately some CGI used during performance and battles, but aside Visual Prison is visually pleasing.• Characters : 8/10 •The character development is in the center of the story, we get to see the main band but also other bands backstories, and why they’re all fighting for these scarlet tears.\u2028Their relationships and interaction are also evolving through episodes.• Sound : 10/10 •As a Visual kei listener, I really loved all the band’s songs, Elements Garden composed the music for this anime and with a really good Voice Actors selection, we can fully enjoy the music and voices through the opening, stage performance, practices and ending.• Enjoyment : 9/10 •I was waiting for Friday to come quite excitedly, I was thrown back in my old teenage day, fangirling on Vkei bands and looks.\u2028This series is not a BL, there is no explicit gay interactions, but ambiguous and bromance vibe was part of the charm and enjoyment of the series in my side.• In brief : 9/10 •Overall, I know the score will most likely never be high, the male fanservices moment might frighten most of you (if you’re not a fujoshi, that’s it) but at least you can give a try to this visually and soundly pleasing title.\u2028The story with the Scarlet Moon doesn’t make a lot of sense, but if you enjoy Visual Kei songs and beautiful characters, it’s not gonna be that bad.

Take the first episode as an example of it. You'll be left wondering if this is more a debut of a musical album, rather than an anime in itself. While there is a story there, the story isn't it's strongest part, it's strongest part is more it's music numbers, and it's flashy and deep coloured art.It's almost like you've gone to the theater, or a pantomime, to see not only a show, but to see it in a musical form. It's that kind of experience all round when it comes to this show.Like, it...might be the sole reason why Visual Prison has close to a 6 on MAL's rating, and in my review, as it's purely because the sound, the music, is fire. I legit would want to listen to each and every song that has come on through this show from start to finish, and I'd listen to them over and over again. The art too, is so well detailed, if any of the budget for this show went anywhere, it went into these two directions for sure.As for the story itself...It's not too bad, but just feels there in order to push the show along, and won't be what you came to the show for. It explains itself. As Yuki is a lonely boy with no confidence in his singing ability. He moves to Harajuku in search of a musician he idolizes, but during his quest, he gets entangled in one of the many live performance clashes between ECLIPSE and LOST EDEN. Whom now has the chance, to partake in the Visual Prison, which is basically vampires singing, and the winner by the end who is chosen, will be given remarkable power. So heavy stakes all round lol.The characters are a bit hit or miss. Not that they're bad, but more that there is a fair bunch of them, that all fit into different groups, as after all, each musical talent is their own. Which makes sense. So they'd kinda match up to your tastes. But one thing is for sure. Most are quite the determined and mostly just have that aggressive, or 'better than you' attitude to them. Not all of them, but a lot can come off that way.Visual Prison is a stand out of the season for sure. But for very weird reasons. It's hit or miss, depending your tastes, and may be remembered for more of the music, then it's actual content. That, and if you like BL, you may like this a little more.

It's hit or miss, depending your tastes, and may be remembered for more of the music, then it's actual content. That, and if you like BL, you may like this a little more. But it might be worth giving it a watch."", 'I\'m going to be honest, I didn\'t think I would enjoy this anime as much as I am. I thought it would be cringe and boring and I would drop it soon after starting it, but I was pleasantly surprised for the most part. If you find yourself wanting to give it a try, it\'s definitely an acquired taste, but if you go into it without any judgement, you might find it to be entertaining.The best thing you can do to see if this anime is for you is to look up ""Visual Kei"" on youtube and watch a music video of the genre,...because this anime is based off of this kind of music. Also, it has Black Butler gothic vibes so if you really don\'t like that, you probably won\'t like this either.Onto the nitty-gritty:The Story: I have no fucking clue what\'s going on lmao. It\'s not the kind of thing that is easily passable either, because there are just some obvious things that really should be addressed; like why the fuck is Yuki a ""dhampir"" and why did he not know this before Eclipse falls from the sky in the first ep like two angels falling from heaven? It\'s all a bit bizarre, really, but hey, that\'s fine as long as you can make up for it with other things. I will say that character backstories make up for the lack of main ""story"" in a way, but it\'s still quite decent and annoying at times that so many of my questions don\'t get answered, or fly right over my head with how noisy and psychedelic the show can get. Overall, I don\'t mind it too much and find it somewhat humorous at times with the lack of proper explanations.The Art: This would be one of the show\'s best traits if it weren\'t for the 3D models for the performances. Might just be a preference, but I really can\'t stand 3D stuff especially when it\'s thrown around in the middle of an otherwise perfectly drawn-out anime. This is a particularly aesthetic anime but in a very gothic-way, for the most part. There are some very nice backgrounds, also, and the animation is generally smooth. Also, Eve\'s fight animation in episode 4 was really good. You can\'t have an anime called ""Visual Prison"" without it being at least good, visually. It does what it is expected to do in that aspect.Sound: So, I do like Visual Kei as a music genre in general, but I expected it to be kinda cringe in anime, and I was wrong, for most of them except the Lost Eden and Eclipse songs (I did not like), but the others are really strong musically. I find them humorous sometimes watching the 3D models, and touching other times, depending on the song. For example, Eve\'s song was really nice, and less angsty than the others. In general, the songs sound like they could be anime OPs. I also want to give them more credit because I can tell the amount of work put into every song was a lot, so I can appreciate the effort. Overall, I would add their songs to my playlist.Character: This is probably the main reason why people will not want to watch this anime, and frankly, I don\'t know what to tell you. It\'s probably what you\'re thinking, with the homoeroticism, because they\'re all male vampires and vampires are horny, I guess? Anyway, I thought the main characters would be less interesting than I find them to be now. They each have a backstory that explains their motivations and how they got to where they are (in general, except I still don\'t know what the fuck the European vampires are doing in Japan, for one). If you like having stuff told to you and not leave you guessing, it might be frustrating. I want to say there are some references to Final Fantasy VII\'s Vincent Valentine, whose game had a Visual Kei music video by Gackt (visual kei singer), because of Lost Eden\'s (a musical group in the anime) logo is the same/similar as Vincent\'s Dirge of Cerberus logo; one of their songs mentions a one-winged angel (Sephiroth) and also Guiltia reminds me of Cloud Strife in his normal design. As a FF fan, I appreciate this. I also appreciate how most characters are able to show a vast range of emotions, although sometimes it can be overdramatic, like a lot of things in this anime, and Visual Kei itself. It makes sense, so I\'m not complaining. There are well-written characters (Eve), poorly-written characters (Saga) and characters that are just up for public scrutiny at this point (It has only been 5 episodes so far, I\'m not gonna go deeper into it).Enjoyment: I\'m not that into gothic stuff, but probably because I\'m non-judgmental and can find humor in things, I think this anime is enjoyable in a way, even if it\'s making fun of the way some of the characters dress, or some of the weird things they say.Overall, pretty good, I enjoy it for what it is. because this anime is based off of this kind of music.

The kinda Yuri-bait and depressing 22/7 was surprisingly good, the sci-fi action Fujoshi-bait Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle was even better, and this season, yet another Fujoshi-bait show pops up: the supernatural vampire-based Visual Prison. And going back on my review of HypMic and testifying that you should stop watching anime from the lens of seriousness, I\'m sad to say that I\'ve tried the...same for this one, and it just didn\'t click whatsoever.And as someone whom still has HypMic pretty fresh in the mind, the glaring similarities between both shows aren\'t that hard to compare to. The story itself is largely similar, only in Visual Prison\'s case that you switch the genre and themes around to create a Visual Kei sinister setting where vampires rule the world, and that the strongest band/group is reigned supreme. Also, add in the peculiar MC which is an outcast and intertwines with the plot just by being there and receiving unwanted attention, only to then build his ""career"" of being an idol of sorts as a cry out to the cruelties of the world. Pretty typical stuff. The characters all have that classic badass feel of WWE-esque ""No Mercy"" trait symptoms to degrade each other when conflicts arise, even something as simple as the stereotypical staring, it\'s standard business practice of the trade. Music is just as important in this trade of a battle royale showdown, and it largely served as fodder to show off the magnifique voices of VA Bishounens, so female fans you can rest easy because of the banger sound material and thought that\'s went to creating songs of repetitions within a very limited functional subset of an OST. And need I say of the A-1 Pictures *chef\'s kiss* quality when you the viewer, know it best?Shows like these are hit and miss, and for once, I have hit a roadblock with Visual Prison. You can love the J-rock pumpin\' music and the dark ""vampire of the night"" visuals which is the actual content of the show, but everything else is just forgettable. Not so much a trainwreck, but it could be far worse. same for this one, and it just didn\'t click whatsoever.And as someone whom still has HypMic pretty fresh in the mind, the glaring similarities between both shows aren\'t that hard to compare to.

We\'ve had a Russian space race vampire, sexy, french, steam punk vampires, 1923 military vampires, that one interesting character from ""So I\'m a Spider, So What?"" who isn\'t Kumoko vampire, an oni vampire, a demon lord vampire, vampires who die in no time and so on and so forth. Basically, a lot of vampire premises.So how do you screw up a \'vampire J-rock battle of the bands\' premise like Visual Prison does?If you said \'write a stupid script and make the characters unfuckably boring\' then, yes you are correct.If you\'ve ever...watched or been apart of a real battle of the bands in the real world then you\'ll know that they\'re fun, really fun. Visual Prison is not fun. It is a very serious, poe-faced mellow drama abut vampires brooding over things that don\'t matter whilst they sometimes become CGI and do a sing. A-1 pictures is actually quite good at animation when they try and I could\'ve seen these performances being really cool and engaging if the animation was hand drawn. I like that they\'re shot like music videos and the songs are... okay. However the CGI animation just makes them feel flat and boring. It\'s the same problem with Backflip!! Impressive, but ultimately un-engaging.Unlike Backflip, Visual Prison doesn\'t have a cast of charismatic characters to fall back on.Honestly, the cast reminds me of the Twilight series. Ange Yuki is basically Bella but cringer somehow, Guil is Edward and so on.Talking or thinking about Visual Prison is a waste of time so I will leave you with this thought. MHA season 4 has an arc where Deku\'s class puts on a live J-rock performance for the school. It\'s one of the best moments of the anime for many narrative reasons, but also for the way it\'s animated, shot and sounds. That one scene is dynamic, colourful, the song is good, but most importantly (in my opinion) it\'s fun! Visual Prison has none of those qualities in the four episodes I watched. As a vampire show it could\'ve been fine, but as a battle of the bands show its a train wreck.1/10 the Worst watched or been apart of a real battle of the bands in the real world then you\'ll know that they\'re fun, really fun.

This ain't a weird supernatural wonderland written by a masochist (most likely), it actually didn't have romance!!! I honestly wish more shows took the direction this took with a big identity reveal that wraps up a mystery of the main character and impacted ___ amount of other characters due to relation with this answer.All I am saying is it could've went down hill real fast but didn't :) "", '""I watch from above and laugh like ""Gyahahaha!"""" - Sugita Tomokazu, Gintoki\'s VA, on how to enjoy Diabolik Lovers.Comedy.This is pure comedy gold.You won\'t be able to understand it unless you go in in a particular mood to laugh at everything.Like, somewhere mid-episode 1, the girls around our MC suddenly begun to get vaporized into floating lights, and this dude - our MC - is just standing there blushing at the ""cool"" cosplayers that showed up and sang a song. Like, what? X\'D Run already! Then, he swoons and faints into another guy\'s hands later. AhahahaThis show clearly doesn\'t mean to take itself seriously,...and that\'s fine. Visual Kei\'s meant to be light-hearted fun, and it conveys well.The story\'s not good, art\'s mediocre, characters are flimsy as heck, but damn if I don\'t enjoy every song or strange development that has me bending over, slapping my table, laughing in tears.I\'m writing this review after ep 6, where our main group pulls a mic out of their hands like that thunder god in Genshin Impact does from her boobs, then that mic turns into a sword.

They have tried to make it a good thing: they added fanservice, vampires, songs, idols, music and even fight scenes.  But it is a confusing mix that is not understandable. The characters are very poor written, their actions are really unsurprising. The music is not really good and the lyrics are outdated (they look like they're from a 2005 emo band).The only good points the anime has is the character design, and also the voice actors work. The rest, is just a confusing cringe mix that is not very interesting.If you want to watch bad anime...to laugh with your friends this is a good choice. to laugh with your friends this is a good choice."", 'This anime doesn\'t make sense and I\'ll prove it to you very clearly in this review.Starting with all characters and their respective groups:• Band 1 •OZ: Ange, Robin, Eve and Guil. This is the main group formed by Ange, all because he liked to sing but couldn\'t ""could"". Now a brief summary about all of them.Ange: The protagonist who doesn\'t consider himself a vampire, even though he felt the same things as a vampire and still talks in the anime that he didn\'t fit in the human world and that he was happy that he finally found his place... How come he doesn\'t is...a vampire?Robin: The classical music stranger loves his twin even though they can\'t even be called twins anymore considering their external changes.Eve: he put in the anime that he thinks he\'s a monster just because he killed a nun (important), all because he hunted vampires and killed a good guy by mistake, if he had used Santa\'s method, I would never have been so paranoid in the work.Guil: He doesn\'t want to sing because his best friends died, he committed the biggest lunar crimes, biting a woman (they\'ll understand that yet) and on top of that taking away the right to choose a baby in its mother\'s womb yet.• Band 2 •LOST EDEN: Saga, Elizabeth, Mist and Jack. Rival anime group. In brief, they like red and black, speak subjective words of destruction, and everyone has some weird story, or almost.Saga: If you see that Saga is not normal when he realizes that his dream is to make the world a black Friday every day, the only difference is that you wouldn\'t take money, why money in a world where everyone is kings, right? Even better would be to receive a phrase like that from the store attendants ""thanks for your preference, I hope you enjoyed your experience here at the totally free game store"".Elizabeth: Beth is complicated, she doesn\'t have a story and if she does I lose it at some point, so I\'ll just mention the oddities. She uses a string wand to release her powers, Beth sings a song where at the beginning she says that beauty is everything, and then in the anime she says that beauty is not everything, of course that wouldn\'t be a problem, characters change their perspectives all the time, so what\'s the problem here? She just forgot to mention what she has in her life so reveal to change even her highest ideals.Mist: Played on those chart analysis sites and got rich, since he was going to die in thirty days, he decided to donate all his fortune to some big shot with a good cause, then he donates all his money to some weird guy who wants to extinguish the world\'s money basically... Normal. If he realizes that mist doesn\'t quite hit the head when in his moment of not living, he says that the reason he doesn\'t want to become a vampire is that he will only feel pain and suffering for not being able to have what he wants, and then what would it be this thing he would never get? Simple, the love of the guy from the totally free stores, what did I miss for in the end, he\'s saying that he\'s powerful and beautiful and he\'s all loving, it must have been a week since they met on the internet... that\'s it. This is wrong in so many ways that I\'m even questioning if this really happens or is it just the person who is getting emotional too hastily.Jack: He hates his brother just because he sings gospel music better than him, so he reneged on his former self and is now Japanese rock and not questionable at all. He tried to kill the same brother twice for the same reason... Jack was supposed to be the character that puts fear in people\'s heads, but he only achieved this effect with his brother himself, a character so aimless that even Beth was glad she didn\'t have it. A story now.• Band 3 •ECLIPSE: Dimitri and Hyde. A group originally created by Guil, also had Saga after a certain point, it disbanded because of Guil who wanted to sing the songs of his new muse, after that Saga also left and only Hyde and Dimitri were left in the group.Dimitri: He likes to walk naked when he is comfortable with the environment, there is a beetle called Odin, together with Hyde they created one of the primordial rules of the world... did I mention that he likes to walk naked?Hyde: Whenever he has the opportunity to implicate Dimitri, he is Guil\'s vampire father\'s brother, the two call their followers lambs and seek to protect them by creating new rules for the world.• Band 4? •Carmilla: Best character in the anime, didn\'t even need to appear much to stand out.Story: A vampire nun who took care of possibly orphaned children, until one day a heartless human killed her... History is not her strong point.Why is she the best? Simple, sang one of the only good songs in the entire anime, just wants to make new friends while playing some good games with the guys, it\'s not bad animated, it\'s the only female character in the midst of so many men confusing you (this part doesn\'t seem right, see below), even ""weakness"" for mayonnaise she has, if that\'s not the best character, I\'m sure I\'m under the Dunning effect.• The world of Visual Prison •The anime is mostly set in Harajuku in a fictional Japan. In this world, vampires sing to the moon in a ritual called visual prison, whoever sang the most beautiful song would be the winner.From what I\'ve noticed and heard from the characters, the visual prison only happens every new century.The prize for singing the most beautiful song is a red tear, joining 10 of these tears you can make a wish on the blood moon. NOTE: one of the wishes was requested by Dimitri and Hyde.Blood moon is the moon that only vampires can see, if you are the leader of your group you can start the ""visual prisons"", the leader or leaders will be chosen by the moon if she sees potential in you, only the leader can call diamonds members to the group, through a mini blood ritual.• Visual Prison Rules •The rules are enforced by the moon and must be obeyed by all vampires.Breaking the rules will result in punishment, vampires who break the rules more than once will return to the blood moon as punishment (death).The most important rule in the anime and made by Hyde and Dimetri as I wish the moon when gathering 10 bloody tears was that no vampire can feed on the blood of humans.• The Vampires of Visual Prison •You can become a vampire if bitten by one, but doing so will cause the vampire in question to suffer the moon\'s punishment for breaking a human\'s biting/feeding rule.Visual Prison\'s Vampires have few similarities compared to other works with the same vampire theme, such as:Not burning in the sun, having a reflection in the mirror, they don\'t need blood to survive (at no time did they complain about it, so I don\'t think they need it).There are also Dampiros, which are a rare variety of vampires, which occurs when a vampire has a child with a human, in the anime it is said that most of the time this will not result in a dampiro.• Visual Prison\'s music •Some are even listenable, like 5 out of 15 in the anime, but most of the time it\'s just a repeat of Ange singing the opening. In my opinion, this work fails as a musical product.• Things that don\'t make sense in Visual Prison •- There doesn\'t seem to be any other bands in the anime besides the three presented, neither vampires nor humans.- In the anime they use makeup to disguise that they are vampires, this would even work, if they didn\'t all have the same sword-microphones and red eyes with pointy teeth showing.- How can you have a vampire princess if women in this work can\'t become vampires if they are bitten?- Sometimes the songs that a character is singing alone echoes throughout the city and everyone can hear it, even if they don\'t have any capture equipment near them. a vampire?Robin: The classical music stranger loves his twin even though they can\'t even be called twins anymore considering their external changes.Eve: he put in the anime that he thinks he\'s a monster just because he killed a nun (important), all because he hunted vampires and killed a good guy by mistake, if he had used Santa\'s method, I would never have been so paranoid in the work.Guil: He doesn\'t want to sing because his best friends died, he committed the biggest lunar crimes, biting a woman (they\'ll understand that yet) and on top of that taking away the right to choose a baby in its mother\'s womb yet.• Band 2 •LOST EDEN: Saga, Elizabeth, Mist and Jack.

NOTE: one of the wishes was requested by Dimitri and Hyde.Blood moon is the moon that only vampires can see, if you are the leader of your group you can start the ""visual prisons"", the leader or leaders will be chosen by the moon if she sees potential in you, only the leader can call diamonds members to the group, through a mini blood ritual.• Visual Prison Rules •The rules are enforced by the moon and must be obeyed by all vampires.Breaking the rules will result in punishment, vampires who break the rules more than once will return to the blood moon as punishment (death).The most important rule in the anime and made by Hyde and Dimetri as I wish the moon when gathering 10 bloody tears was that no vampire can feed on the blood of humans.• The Vampires of Visual Prison •You can become a vampire if bitten by one, but doing so will cause the vampire in question to suffer the moon\'s punishment for breaking a human\'s biting/feeding rule.Visual Prison\'s Vampires have few similarities compared to other works with the same vampire theme, such as:Not burning in the sun, having a reflection in the mirror, they don\'t need blood to survive (at no time did they complain about it, so I don\'t think they need it).There are also Dampiros, which are a rare variety of vampires, which occurs when a vampire has a child with a human, in the anime it is said that most of the time this will not result in a dampiro.• Visual Prison\'s music •Some are even listenable, like 5 out of 15 in the anime, but most of the time it\'s just a repeat of Ange singing the opening. In my opinion, this work fails as a musical product.• Things that don\'t make sense in Visual Prison •- There doesn\'t seem to be any other bands in the anime besides the three presented, neither vampires nor humans.- In the anime they use makeup to disguise that they are vampires, this would even work, if they didn\'t all have the same sword-microphones and red eyes with pointy teeth showing.- How can you have a vampire princess if women in this work can\'t become vampires if they are bitten?- Sometimes the songs that a character is singing alone echoes throughout the city and everyone can hear it, even if they don\'t have any capture equipment near them.', ""This is truly a hidden gem of an anime! It was too short sadly which caused the pacing to feel too fast for character development and the story suffered from that. I would have liked a longer season so the show's story could have been more polished since parts of it make no sense. When judging this anime I decided not to look at it as a traditional anime since it's more of a Visual Kei musical. The songs are just 10/10 for me and I find myself playing them over and over again because they are sung so well!WARNING! (Read below for triggers)Suicide...is mentioned and depicted so do not watch if this may harm your mental stateThere is a lot of Boys Love fan service so if you don't want that this anime will not be for you.

There is no romance, only hints at it for fans of BL.Blood (This is to be expected since we are dealing with Vampires)"", ""I bumbled into this anime while searching for a vampire anime. What I found instead was simply... funDon't expect a great (or even coherent) story. I still don't understand much of the logic! Plot holes are simply filled with great music, and ambiguous characters are covered in plot armour. Some scenes are spoiled a bit by the occasional use of 3D, which I felt didn't blend well. There is much that one can criticize about this anime... and yet... it's still fun.Visually this anime is eye candy with sexy vampire musicians and homo-erotic subtext. The voice acting and singing is stellar, and characters look great...both on and off stage. It's truly all about the music and ultimately thats all an anime like this needs to be enjoyable. Its great for those times you'd prefer to switch off your brain and let your foot tap to the beat of the music. Even if you are clueless about J-Rock (like wtf is Visual Kei?), it still holds high appeal. The main aim of this anime is to entertain... and damn, it does it well.Overall I enjoyed it for what it offered. 7/10 both on and off stage.
