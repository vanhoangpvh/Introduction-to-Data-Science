Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle - Rhyme Anima +,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54858/Hypnosis_Mic__Division_Rap_Battle_-_Rhyme_Anima__,"[""This season really felt like it was actually Hypmic. The story was done well, and it truly felt like what Hypmic was all about with the tragic story and interesting conflict throughout the anime. It was cool to see how they slowly showed our antagonist in the anime and having all the divisions share the same problem, which leads us to the introduction of Osaka and Nagoya. It was a good way to help new fans learn about these two divisions. Not only that, but it was also a good choice to hint certain points of most of the characters pasts so that new fans...become interested and current fans enjoy seeing the reference. Unlike the first season, where they just easily gave the information away in an awkward sense since it was brought up by Tom rather than Ichiro. That would make more sense to talk about it with one of the boys in their perspective, rather than some stranger or new character bringing it up. The first season can explain the past events of the story, but I'm glad the second hinted it, so new fans can become further interested.  The new characters they added actually made sense to add. Akira and Satoru were actually explained and seemed more important to the events that took place. Kaibyakumon also was a great antagonist to the story, as his past made sense to what led to now. It was a good idea to have him cause so much disaster before dying, since there wasn't anything else to do after the loss of his company and friends. Also, they did great reintroducing us to the boys with the beginning episodes showing the boys we met in the first season then introducing the new characters that are actual characters that got added later in the franchise. Overall, there were no issues from what they showed. Besides, trying to show Secret Aliens again at the end, proving once again that they were not needed. This felt like the Hypmic I know, and it really was what probably some fans expected the anime to be like. It was way more enjoyable to watch compared to the first season as this still had the same slice of life aspect with some fun and jokes like usual. This time, with an interesting story, and way better songs. become interested and current fans enjoy seeing the reference.

It was such a novel concept that this can only be done through HypMic. And 3 years later, we get Rhyme Anima+, which...is essentially Round 2 of the Division Rap Battle, added in with new characters and a new enemy rival that's typical of any original sequel.The newcomers being Dotsuitare Hompo (Nurude Sasara, Rosho Tsutsujimori, and Rei Amayado) and Bad Ass Temple (Kuko Harai, Yushi Aimono, and Hitoya Amaguni), they certainly add more flare to the series, along with the enemies of the mysterious TBH, who want to influence Japan to their bidding after a scuffle with the women-only group Party of Words, which the previous 4 rap groups battled with in Season 1. This storyline isn't bad, but it just screams cliché, almost as if the sequel was pushed thanks to Season 1's popularity in Japan by the producers (Aniplex) themselves. We never asked for one but got one anyway.My TL;DR for Season 2 here, the OP comprising all 6 rap groups, is decent, but nowhere near Season 1's HypMic banger level of greatness. The ED is a good follow-up, though nothing memorable. And as usual, A-1 Pictures can always deliver, even if on the basis of a series that has little to no marketing in the West.With a storyline so typical and a teeny-tiny fraction of followers from the prequel, Rhyme Anima+ a.k.a Season 2 here has none, or at best, the partiality of what made Season 1 so HypMic.

Hakaima Sadamitsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1465/Hakaima_Sadamitsu,"[""this anime anime is really good the action was good, the characters were hilarious there some holes in the anime; but there are always holes so its nothing new. but what really got me is how short it is the plot/story arc the series could have went atleast 25 epi's strong also. but overall good anime if you like action and comedy with a lil romance "", 'Sadamitsu the Destroyer, or ""Hakaima Sadamitsu"" is one of those less known anime you\'ve probably only seen the name of a handful of times, therefore when you go to actually watch it, you probably won\'t know what to expect, if to expect anything at all. However, I think It\'s one of those anime that\'ll give you a pleasant surprise, be it in the form of a few laughs or to the point were you genuinely enjoy the series.Plot wise, Sadamitsu the Destroyer is nothing special. You can look up full synopsis in your own time, but without spoiling anything, basically follows Sadamitsu Tsubaki who...has a chance run in with an alien suit of armour, of course this is all basically revealed in the first episode.The characters in Sadamitsu the Destroyer are rather disappointing in my opinion. You have your few main characters which consist of Sadamitsu himself, Yayoi the ""mysterious"" heroine, Sadamitsu\'s \'partner-in-crime\' of sorts, Junk and the talkative alien motorcycle, Kulon. Other than that, side characters are easily forgettable and don\'t contribute much to the overall story.In terms of art, don\'t be expecting too much of Sadamitsu the Destroyer considering the series started early 2001, so don\'t go comparing it to, for example, the likes of the visually impressive Samurai Champloo and Gundam 00.When it comes to sound, again, don\'t be expecting too much. The opening of the series features a sort of jazzy, almost cowboyish type music that you\'ll hear recycled throughout the series while the ending theme is a, for me personally, forgettable ""power ballad"" of sorts. But hey, I\'m no expert when it comes to music, or Japanese music for that matter.Overall, Sadamitsu the Destroyer is a fairly enjoyable anime. I\'d definitely recommend this series if you\'re looking for something that doesn\'t take itself too seriously and, at 10 episodes long, what do you really have to lose?P.S. This is my first review on this site, and probably my first ever public review, therefore, feedback would be much appreciated.

It's not very good sadly.I was lured into watching this series by the trailer, the series appears action packed with a fun vibe. The actual series is much more bland and boring unfortunately.The story is really barebones and often fragmented. Leaps in plot can occur and as a viewer this can be confusing. The setup of the series is very shallow with little to no buildup. Stuff just starts happening with little explanation, too many characters are accepting of these scenarios. The side characters are pretty annoying and pointless. Couple that with some pretty mediocre animation, ugly even...for period character/monster designs and a lifeless soundtrack and the whole thing is just a shell of what it could have been.There really is a fun idea crammed into this series and it's certainly a shame the series fails to portray it in an interesting way. All that aside the last few episodes while silly and pretty average are at least more engaging and satisfying than the rest so while the payoff is minimal if you can reach the end of this 10 episode journey you should at least somewhat enjoy the destination ... maybe? for period character/monster designs and a lifeless soundtrack and the whole thing is just a shell of what it could have been.There really is a fun idea crammed into this series and it's certainly a shame the series fails to portray it in an interesting way.

I''s Pure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/811/Is_Pure,"[""I’s Pure is a Shounen, Ecchi, Romance about a boy Seto Ichitaka, who has had huge crush on a cute girl in his class, Yoshizuki Iori. This may be the setting for a typical Romantic Comedy but I’s Pure is able to do great things with this plot.The story starts of normally enough with us getting to know the characters, which is easy enough because they have the generic personalities; hot girl, indecisive guy, perverted friend, childhood friend, etc. Even with these typical personalities the characters are pretty amazingly developed in their own way, through so many situations and after the awkward beginning, the romance...begins to develop well throughout the story. Of course there's comedy but it is played down, quite a bit. Like any other Rom/Com, this anime does tend to rely on cliches but the cliches aren't a problem. The real problem is how quickly the story jumps from one situation to another and that is because this really short anime is based on a long manga. But it is pretty easy to overlook that, especially for those who haven’t read the manga, seeing how well the story is illustrated.The quality of animation is great, with so much detail put into the environments and the characters move fluidly. The girls are well designed, which is essential for an ecchi romance but like most of these types of anime, not much detail was put into the guys. The music was pretty good and it definitely suited the anime but most of the time it was barely noticeable, to make any difference to it.Overall this is a typical ecchi, romantic, comedy that manages to push the envelope, due to its not-so-original but captivating story. The characters were surprisingly well developed in such a short amount of time. I’s Pure was so close to getting a higher score but it didn’t because it summed up a 15 Volume manga into 6 regular length OVAs. This means that a lot of major developments and some important characters were left out of the story, which was a big let down. At least the parts of the story it tells, it sometimes does a better job than the manga.So if you haven’t read the manga you wouldn’t be disappointed but you may feel a bit left in the dark about certain situations, which is why I recommend reading the manga. begins to develop well throughout the story.

It drew you in from the first episode, and kept you in lows and highs through to the very end. There's no magic or martial arts.The art was quite good. Overall, it leaves this romantic satisfied.

Simply put, these 6 episodes became, in my mind, the foremost and easiest to distinguish example of the corny, cliched love story. It fell into every single trap I could think of: a rediculous, laugh-out-loud sappy ending, convenient interruptions to confessions, the &quot;childhood friend&quot; who happens to walk in on the main character in her underwear just at the most inconvenient time, the title that really has nothing to do with the story AT ALL, the honorable break-up so the girl can &quot;follow her dream&quot; as an actress, the the coma due...to a weak fight that brings the two fateful lovers together at the last moment.I was laughing for a few minutes straight, because this show was that bad. If you want a good laugh, spend a few hours watching this. You might learn something: like how not to make a short OVA &quot;romance&quot; series.

After a bit of watching you soon notice that they have skipped so many that should have been there. Much of the ecchi scenes totally vanished and were nowhere to be seen. Much of the comedy was dropped as well, same goes for a lot of other scenes. But I wasn't sad at all.[Ecchi: Nakedness you might say.

I bet most of the people who have seen the Anime completely didn't know there was a Manga at all. But they still liked it..?Yes they did, if they didn't, they either hate it's genre or they have no taste at all. The Anime shows love how it's supposed to be. Love is doubt, a lot of doubt.

But if you really don't like an Anime in which they might get a little bit dramatic at times, just to tense/spice things up a little, than this Anime isn't for you.

I love the lightness of it, Chii\'s innocence and purity, and just the overall romantic interactions. I got none of those same feelings from I""s Pure.I""s Pure stars Ichitaka Seto, a very indecisive teenage boy. While indecisive Male Leads is normal for this kind of anime, Ichitaka is almost unbearable in this sense. There were parts where even I was saying ""Just get on with it"", and I\'ve seen a decent amount of this character archetype. I get that...we are supposed to identify with him and maybe ""understand"" his worries, but it just comes off as annoying. In the episode where they were in the karaoke bar and there were those long pauses between what Seto and Iori were saying I honestly started laughing, because I thought the translators had been pranking me. It failed to create any sort of dramatic tension whatsoever.One of the marks of a good romance, or even a good anime in general is getting attached to the characters, and actually caring about their strife. Referring back to Chobits, I got very attached to Chii (Heck, I even named my computer it!) and wanted to see her succeed. In I""s Pure, I did not care for Itsuki OR Iori in the least. None of them had any kind of qualities that made them memorable or made me want to care about them.  I get that Chobits was 26 episodes and I""s Pure only 6 OVAs, but that shouldn\'t stop me from caring about the characters any less. If you\'re going to make a short series, you have to make your characters likeable in a shorter time, which the people here failed to do.I don\'t recall it ever been explained WHY Seto likes Iori in the first place. There\'s no romantic build up, it\'s just ""I like this woman"", and this results in her seeming really kinda boring and bland. Itsuki is a little bit better of a character, but not much is said about her either. I felt like Seto should have just dated Itsuki and ended the OVA in 2 episodes. Sure, the childhood friend thing Itsuki\'s got going on is pretty overdone, but it definitely would have resulted in a better ending.One thing I can say is, I really did like Teratani. He was an AMAZING friend to Ichitaka. The bro-levels were high in this one. I would kill to have a buddy like him.The final episode when Seto is in a come and Iori\'s ""I love you"" waking him up and all of that just fell so unnecessary. Why was this big catalyst needed to get them back together? It just felt so cheesy, like I was reading an over-exaggeration of a shoujo manga.Maybe if this had even been a 13 episode series, they could have planned out the character development a little better, but unfortunately my love of this anime was not to be. I really wanted to find a nice romance series, but this just left a bad taste in my mouth.By the way, what was with that Samejima guy (Marionette King) not recognizing Seto? It had only been like a year since they were done high school. You\'d think he\'d remember him from their interactions in high school (unless he ACTUALLY was doing drugs and his memory is shot, then I\'m just dumb).Sorry to any of you who liked this. I just had to do this for myself. we are supposed to identify with him and maybe ""understand"" his worries, but it just comes off as annoying.

If you\'re going to make a short series, you have to make your characters likeable in a shorter time, which the people here failed to do.I don\'t recall it ever been explained WHY Seto likes Iori in the first place. There\'s no romantic build up, it\'s just ""I like this woman"", and this results in her seeming really kinda boring and bland. Itsuki is a little bit better of a character, but not much is said about her either. I felt like Seto should have just dated Itsuki and ended the OVA in 2 episodes. Sure, the childhood friend thing Itsuki\'s got going on is pretty overdone, but it definitely would have resulted in a better ending.One thing I can say is, I really did like Teratani. He was an AMAZING friend to Ichitaka. The bro-levels were high in this one. I would kill to have a buddy like him.The final episode when Seto is in a come and Iori\'s ""I love you"" waking him up and all of that just fell so unnecessary. Why was this big catalyst needed to get them back together? It just felt so cheesy, like I was reading an over-exaggeration of a shoujo manga.Maybe if this had even been a 13 episode series, they could have planned out the character development a little better, but unfortunately my love of this anime was not to be. I really wanted to find a nice romance series, but this just left a bad taste in my mouth.By the way, what was with that Samejima guy (Marionette King) not recognizing Seto? It had only been like a year since they were done high school. You\'d think he\'d remember him from their interactions in high school (unless he ACTUALLY was doing drugs and his memory is shot, then I\'m just dumb).Sorry to any of you who liked this.

I personally enjoy the shorter romantic love stories because the writers have no choice but to make the characters more open an expressive to better move the story along. Romantic triangles in my opinion offer better story lines and a deeper emotional connection with the character...and they tend to be less erotic which for me can be distracting and often times distasteful.The story offered a not so original plot line but for me it didn't take away from the overall quality. I felt the series moved along at a nice pace and effectively gave a...nice but not so thorough background of each of the main characters.The art was very well done. The character models were well proportioned with eyes that actually fit on their heads. No watermelon sized breasts, and 3 inch waists. Aside from the characters the ambient art didn't blow me away but it did add a touch of elegance to the scenery.The sound was quite good the intro song matched the series perfectly and the background music was also very pleasing reminiscent of the BGM from Chobits.The characters were very well balanced; I typically end up hating at least one of the characters usually the female lead, but I found myself liking everyone. The male protagonist isn't as cowardly as some may think. I only say this because several times during the series he defended his actions and spoke quite candidly. A common trend in similar anime is the male leads always letting the girl go without properly clearing the misunderstanding, but this character did succeed at times. I also like the fact the he often says the opposite of what he feels. This trait made the male character seem more in control. The total opposite would be anime such as Zero no Tsukaima or Love Hina were the male lead gets treated like crap for the entire series and still ends up with female lead in the end.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.

And that is what Aizu pure had to offer.Despite being produced in 2005, the animation and story were on par with current series which we have today. It's your typical shounen romance, but it's also a dramatic experience for us as we see Seto, the main character, do everything he can for the person he loves. Yes, he's indecisive, but his dedication is incomparable to a simple admirer. There are a lot of MCs who claim...that they're ready to die for their loved one, but Seto's one of the few who actually went to near-death for his lover. Iori's pretty dense to not notice his dedication, but she's cute, so I'll let it slide.The execution of the plot was not your usual linear plot. It jumps from one timeline to another in a way that it doesn't look like a filler. Although, there were a lot of blank scenes (like 30 seconds of Seto and Iori just sitting down doing nothing but blink).Overall, this series was romantic.

Anyway, the anime du jour is based on the manga that was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in Japan from 1997 to 1999; the series was collected into 15 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha. There were 2 OVA adaptations, the first From I’s is a 2-episode OVA while I’s Pure is a six-part OVA.The story's main character is 16-year-old high school...student Ichitaka Seto who is in love with his classmate Iori Yoshizuki, but too shy to tell her. Again and again he plans to tell her his true feelings, but each time something (usually a misunderstanding of some kind) gets in the way. Things become even more complicated when Itsuki Akiba returns to Japan; she is a girl Ichitaka was friends with in their childhood before she moved to the United States, and who had a huge crush on him. Now, that part is more from Pure rather than the first outing From, but some of the time, they both have similar plot details with the first OVA being something that actually resembles a plot that’s involves Itsuki meeting Yosuke, another childhood friend & Ichitaka in the woods to fulfill a promise they made ten years ago.I will say that the first OVA, while being the shortest, is possibly the more interesting one to watch but it doesn’t hold up well to the second series in part of story continuity and cohesion and yet, Pure focus more on the romantic aspect with it being played straight although it needs up being generic and typical, especially the most awkward misunderstandings, oblivious characters who really seems more dumb than they appear, and obnoxious editing tricks.For characters, Ichitaka Seto, the main character of the series is the shy teenage boy who has trouble with relationships due to his earlier misfortunes but to me, I get his shyness and where he’s coming from but often he has his foot in his mouth a few too many times, although that is bound to happen to many people. For Iori Yoshizuki, she’s very friendly, gorgeous to look at but honestly, she’s the blandest character in the series. For the first OVA, she definitely showed no purpose there except for her doing her job and in peril. The second series show more purpose with her but is still in peril with the dumbest antagonist who wants revenge for finding out that he spies on girls changing clothes. Next time, buddy, make your cam more unnoticeable. Itsuki Akiba, on the other hand, was actually one of the greater things about the show. She’s playful, characteristic and often shameless and loud but somebody that seems fun to hang out with and of course, there’s the other plotline that she’s a childhood friend and she has real feelings towards Ichi and we all know how that goes along. Then there’s Teratani, Ichitaka’s best friend who think himself as a pro with the females and gives him advice on how not to mess up his relationship but he’s also a jackass when it comes to messing with Ichi a few times.For animation, it was provided by two animation companies; the first being Studio Pierrot, the guys responsible for 2 of the Big Three, Naruto and Bleach; and Studio ARMS, the one animation company that I bitch about for being hacks…….plus they made Master of Marital Hearts and for it, the character designs are very consistent from both OVAs while the first series looks older, which is more understandable considering the years. There is a little amount of gratuitous fan service in the second OVA on the sections of “Ichitaka’s Fantasy Diary”, where he sexually fantasizes about the girls (Iori, Itsuki, etc.) and their intimate moments. The music score is mainly decent although it’s forgettable most of the times, including the openers and ending songs in Pure.Funny thing about the dub is from New Generation Pictures, this is a Viz Media release and NGP is usually associated with Geneon most of the time but this dub was…off. Darrel Guillbeau and Erika Weinstein gives tiresome and stilted performance as the main would-be, kind of couple Ichitaka and Iori, respectively. It could be the direction they were given but I wasn’t feeling their performances. I will say that Carrie Savage did a better run out of all the performances in the show than anybody else.FINAL VERDICT: This is a passable series that doesn’t drag at all but you’ll be bored by some of the characters and irritated by the cliché elements and you’ll wonder why there are even there if they don’t provide anything to the story.

Ged Senki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1829/Ged_Senki,"[""I realize that many people might not agree with what i'm going to say about this film, but please hear me out..first of all.. i think too many people expected it to be like other miyazaki works.. but the worst thing you could do is assume it'll have the magic and light-heartedness of other studio ghibli films.. after all, it was miyazaki's son that directed it.. and for a first film, i don't think it could've been any better.. i suppose it's tough to keep this in mind, as the art style is the same as other ghibli films.. but please try..that being said..Story-i loved...the story.. that might be partially because i really enjoy this genre.. a sort of medieval setting with fantasy elements.. dragons and sorcery.. but none of the fantasy elements are too over-bearing.. the film focuses instead on the lesson it intends to convey.. sounds lame.. but i think it did a perfect job of getting the point across.. i felt like i would burst when the movie ended.. i really felt the impact of what was being said.. to deny death is to deny life.. being afraid of death is being afraid of living.. i know it sounds cliche, but it makes sense and it really hits home.. heh.. for me at least.. it's a very epic telling of the story.. and you need to keep in mind also that this was literature to begin with, and you can tell by the content of the story.. it may seem to move a bit quickly and is at parts confusing.. but that's just the way it goes whenever literature becomes film.. nothing tough to keep up with though.. just a few holes..Animation-the scenery was breathtaking as usual.. you could really feel the tone of the setting.. the art, the music, the story-all truly strike a chord.. the character animations could have been better, that would be my only serious complaint.. since it's a more recent film, i thought they could have done more with the effects-especially in scenes involving the use of magic.. more similar to the animation in spirited away or howl's moving castle.. then again, it might have been intentional.. and i'm not sure i liked the design of the dragons.. but overall.. great stuff.Sound-probably my favorite music in a film ever.. bah.. i love that stuff.. perfectly orchestrated.. gave me chills actually.. heh.. it was dramatic, but it added to the epic feel of the film.. it was never cheesy.. and i especially love when it sounded a bit irish with the flutes and such.. and uh.. the closing song made me break down and bawl like a baby.. it was that beautiful.Character-the characters were totally fitting for this movie.. nothing felt like it was out of place.. the main characters had plenty of depth and were very likable.. one thing i noticed was that one of the leaders of the bad dudes, the guy with the frenchie stupid-lookin mustache, looks exactly like a bad guy in nausicaa valley of the wind.. this also, may have been on purpose.. he acted like him too.. kinda weird.. and the evil sorcerer gave me chills.. that voice.. shudder*.. so yea-the characters were perfect in my opinion.. enough said.Enjoyment-i enjoyed it thoroughly.. yea.. that's all.*please remember to watch this film with an open mind, not expecting the usual miyazaki 'magic' the story.. that might be partially because i really enjoy this genre.. a sort of medieval

also, may have been on purpose.. he acted like him too.. kinda weird.. and the evil sorcerer gave me chills.. that voice.. shudder*.. so yea-the characters were perfect in my opinion.. enough said.Enjoyment-i enjoyed it thoroughly.. yea.. that's all.*please remember to watch this film with an open mind, not expecting the usual miyazaki 'magic'"", 'Even a prolific animation studio like Ghibli can turn out a lesser effort.  Hiroyuki Morita\'s THE CAT RETURNS was my personal least favorite Ghibli movie, but that film, simplistic and shallow as it was, seems to have much more accolades than 2006\'s TALES FROM EARTHSEA, arguably one of the first productions from the studio to split audiences and critics alike.Ironically enough, the controversy actually began prior to the film\'s release.  It has been stated that Hayao Miyazaki had expressed interest in directing a film based on Ursula K. LeGuin\'s famous fantasy novels, but the author, displeased with previous attempts, declined... until the success...of Miyazaki\'s HOWL\'S MOVING CASTLE (arguably one of the director\'s least excellent but still brilliant efforts).  However, it was ultimately decided that the film would be handled by Miyazaki\'s own son, Goro, under the persuasion of producer Toshio Suzuki.  Miyazaki Senior was most displeased by these turn of events and it is said that his relationship with Goro became strained during the production period.  Perhaps Hayao had reason to fear that his son was not ready to tackle such an ambitious story; although TALES FROM EARTHSEA performed well financially, it was attacked by critics and even fans of the books.  In fact, Goro received the ""Worst Director"" Golden Raspberry Award for his first attempt.  All of this sounds like a cruel, undeserved fate for the debut of the son of Japan\'s most respected animator, but even author Ursula K LeGuin has been disappointed with Goro\'s film.  In fact, TALES FROM EARTHSEA would not even see a release in the United States for another five years.The criticisms TALES FROM EARTHSEA has received are not without merit.  Anyone expecting another PRINCESS MONONOKE or CASTLE IN THE SKY will probably be disappointed for, while this film shows moments of brilliance and imagination, it falls short from the upper echelon of those films.  The problems lie in the storyline and characterizations.Fans of LeGuin\'s books will probably be even more let down by this movie.  It is based heavily on the third book, ""The Farthest Shore"", but while most of the situations and characters survive the transition to the screen, Goro attempts to incorporate elements from the other books into the film.  But he does so in a way that only results in a tangled, confusing plot which not only feels rushed, but very incomplete and disorganized.  Sometimes events happen without explanation, and what little explanation we get is unsatisfying; maybe fans of the books will grasp what Goro\'s intentions are, but others will find themselves asking questions which unfortunately, never get answered.The film gets off to a promising start with a stormy sequence in which a ship at sea witnesses a bloody clash between two dragons. It\'s exciting and intense, with a brief flash of gory violence that brings one to mind of the similarly graphic moments from PRINCESS MONONOKE.  TALES FROM EARTHSEA is still on that fine start when we see Arren, a teenage prince, inexplicably murder his father and escapes into a desert.  He is rescued from wolves by Sparrowhawk, a kindly sorcerer with a scar on his face (for reasons that readers of the first book ""Wizard of Earthsea"" will recognize).  Sparrow\'s mission is to restore the balance that has been disrupted in the mystical land of Earthsea.However, when these two adventurers cross paths with other characters such as a moody, introverted “slave” named Therru, a warmhearted farmer, and an evil wizard intent on gaining (predictably) eternal life, it becomes evident that Goro is trying to cram too much story worth of at least four books into a two hour film.  Aside from giving the characters little time to fully develop into fleshed out personalities, the film works in a very confusing and frustratingly murky subplot about a shadowy “clone” of Arren that shows up from time to time to torment the youth.  This is handled very awkwardly, with zero foreshadowing and the whole “explanation” behind the whole thing leaves questions instead of answers.  I was also very unclear about the climactic finale in which a girl transforms into a dragon; again, this is done with no explanation, that it only makes the audience baffled instead of thrilled.Perhaps another big issue with the film is the pacing; as mentioned, the film’s best sequence is the opening dragon fight, but such action moments are rather scanty throughout the rest of the movie, resulting in long, extensive stretches where nothing really happens.  For instance, at the halfway point, there is a long sequence in which the characters end up working on a farm.  Although intended to provide character development, this sequence only slows down the film and feels more like padding than anything else.  Brief moments such as Sparrowhawk and Arren talking about blistered hands after helping to plow the field feel strangely detached from the rest of the plot instead of anything else.  The real areas in which Goro shows strength as an animator are the dream sequences—and there are quite a few in this tale—in which the characters find themselves standing on sunlit landscapes with luscious colors one moment and nearly drowning in an ooze-infested lake the next.  These are actually far more interesting than much of the talkier scenes in the movie.The lack of compelling characters is another major shortcoming with TALES FROM EARTHSEA.  Sparrowhawk, for instance, is nobility personified, and as such, is pretty boring.  Arren could have been a compelling troubled hero —\xa0sort of a darker version of Ashi-taka from MONONOKE, but his character development comes across as rather hazy to be interesting.  The slave girl Therru, despite showing some backbone and the bitterness of San, isn’t much more endearing than her co-stars.  Cob probably ranks as the most disappointing villain in any Ghibli film; oh sure, he’s creepy and acts evil, but he doesn’t have much of a personality, and lacks the charisma of, say, Muska from CASTLE IN THE SKY.  That he doesn’t get much to do in the film is also a letdown.  Cob’s slavetrader captain henchman, Hare, is much more effective as a badguy, and arguably is the only interesting character in the whole movie to display any personality.  He sneers, cackles, rasps threats, and is remorselessly ruthless.  It also helps that he is voiced by Cheech Marin in the Disney-produced English dub... who naturally gives the best performance in the whole film!Speaking of the dub, this is probably my least favorite of the Disney Ghibli dubs, not because it is badly done—Disney has never produced an unlistenable dub as far as I’m concerned; their past dubs have all been fantastic, contrary to what others may say (yes, even the ones with extra dialogue and music).  Perhaps because of the murky nature of this movie, it is difficult for the dub to be as effective, despite the efforts of everyone involved.  Still, the performers and voice director Gary Rydstrom do their best:  As mentioned, Marin plays the part of Hare perfectly and steals the show.  Timothy Dalton does an excellent job as Sparrowhawk, embuing him with wisdom, warmth, and subtlety.  Mariska Hargitay is also very good as the kindly farmer Tenar.  Matt Levin as Arren is a bit of a trickier issue:  he starts out somewhat flatly, but he gradually improves and gets especially good at the end.  On the other hand, Blaire Restaneo’s Therru is the least effective of the voice cast; she shines brilliantly in singing the film’s only song, a melancholy acapella solo originally rendered by Aoi Teshima and does all right in the tense scenes, but I wasn’t so sold on the rest of her scenes.  Willem Dafoe’s Cob works best in the climactic scenes where he rasps his way to the tower, but otherwise spends most of the time talking in a very soft, monotonous voice.  I don’t know if it was supposed to convey darkness or not, but I didn’t find it particularly effective (in fact, I was chuckling upon hearing him speak for the first time) and I’m still not sure if he was the right choice for the character.  Simply put, he’s no match for Mark Hamill’s Muska.  The rest of the voices are fine, although they’re not nearly as memorable as in any of the other Ghibli dubs.  Even purists who insist on watching the film in Japanese will probably be disappointed, as the voice acting, or at least what I’ve heard, isn’t much more effective than that of the dub.Probably the most pleasing aspect of the film is its musical score contributed by Tamiya Terashima.  Ghibli films have excelled with gorgeous soundtracks, and this is no exception.  Using melancholy melodies and a full orchestra and chorus reminiscent of Hans Zimmer, Terashima provides a gorgeous and poundingly dramatic symphony that compliments the mood of the story perfectly.  (As mentioned, Therru’s song midway through the film is a haunting highlight.)  And of course, the animation is as richly detailed and beautiful as any Ghibli film.There are moments where TALES OF EARTHSEA does exude some haunting visuals, but all in all, it’s probably the weakest of the Studio Ghibli movies by far.  Had Goro Miyazaki opted for a less daunting storyline, then maybe he wouldn’t have received so much backlash for his debut feature.  As such, the obvious failings of EARTHSEA shows that he is not yet ready to fill his father’s shoes.  But even with all that said, is this movie still worth watching?  Absolutely, especially if you’re a Ghibli completist.  Even with its faults, TALES FROM EARTHSEA still has its share of high points to make it worth a look.

But don’t expect another instant classic; on that level it falls short.', 'I have not read the Earthsea novels, and have only seen this film once, so I am going by first impressions, and while admitedly this may not be particularly thorough, first impressions do count for a lot.I did not enjoy this movie as much as other Ghibli, or anime films in general.  Most of this was because I felt that many questions I had about the film and the world in which the film was set were left unanswered.  This may have been because I did not read the book, however, I believe an addaptation should be able to stand on...its own without needing to be familiar with the source material.  For example, Gankutsuou still makes sense to those who did not read Alexandre Dumas\' The Count of Monte Christo and can stand alone as it\'s own piece of work.  The Earthsea movie for me left too many questions.  ""Why are there slaves?  Are there only certain people who become slaves or is everyone free game?"" ""Why do people fear witches and wizards if they\'re so useful?  What\'s the basis for this prejudice?"" ""Why did the Prince stab the King?  Why is this problem not addressed?  How can people not notice a missing Prince and stabbed King?""  These are only a few of my questions.Secondly, the magic of the worlds did not seem adequately explained or built up.  \'True Names\' have power, but this is only really brought up halfway into the movie.  Unlike Spirited away, this magic not based on an already well known or established folk lore or canon, so more explanation or build up would have helped to make it more effective.Characters do not seem quite as sympathetic as subsequent Ghibli films.  When reasons are given for characters to be sympathetic, it is simply mentioned in exposition, while showing it through flashback or dream sequence might have been more effective.  Tennar mentions how Sparrowhawk once saved her a couple times during the film, but this and her relationship with Sparrowhawk is mostly left up to exposition which is not nearly as effective as showing it.  Theru is a mysterious abuse victim who hates people who do not value life, why not show the audience why rather than having a character simply mention it?  Why not give the audience more clues about her past to build suspense?  And then there\'s Arran, who is supposedly our main character who seems entierly unsympathetic and uninteresting.  I honestly did not see, throughout the whole film any good qualities what would draw me into his character or psyche.  For a character with a past and backstory like his, I was really expecting more, and what was built up felt like a letdown by the end of the film.  Really, his \'shadow\'/split personality seemed far more complex and interesting (though that was not really explained either).  What really makes it disappointing though is that the cover of the DVD and film posters show a picture of Arran with a Dragon, giving the audience the impression that this will be a film about a boy and a dragon, which, it isn\'t.The sound was excellent though.  Unlike other ghibli movies, it went with a very medieval and Celtic sounding soundtrack with reed instruments and even what sounded like bagpipes in some segments.  It was truly beautiful to listen to and was a refreshing deviation.  It helped drive home that this is a medieval fantasy world.  The art and animation were stunning as usual, with breathtaking scenery.  The film honestly did create its own, beautiful world.My overall problem with the film was that the rules of the world were not properly explained and left too many questions.  I am very aware that certain aspects of the story are lost in medium translation, but the audience should not be left thinking at the end of the film, \'I think I would have understood what that was all about if I had read the book.\'  As for the \'moral of the story\' it feels like the writer is trying to beat it into the audience\'s head rather than let them figure it out.  In past films, it is left up to the audience to be mature and clever enough to figure out the moral, whether it was environmentalism, pacifism, increased urbanisation, or even just being yourself.  In this fim, it was repeated over and over until it honestly became annoying to listen to.  I think after the second or third time, we get it already.This film, unlike other Ghiblis, is certainly not for young children who are easily frightened.  There is blood, hints of drug usage, human trafficing, violence, abuse, and frightening images that can upset young children and those who are easily frightened.Overall though, it was not a terrible film.  The story had potential, and was unafraid to touch on dirty, gritty subject matter.  I would equate it to a well done B-movie, but it was a very far cry from being an A-lister.  For a first film, it was very well done, and hopefully Goro Miyazaki can step up his game and fill the shoes of past directors.  This film and director really do have potential, and I hope to see great things in the future. its own without needing to be familiar with the source material.

I find when I watch their films that I am constantly seeing the same recurring characters.  Not the same TYPE of characters, just the same art.  That greatly bugs me. I saw many of the same archetype characters that i've seen in every Ghibli film in this one as well.Story:  Adapted from Ursula K LeGuins Earthsea series.  I've never read the series myself but from watching the anime I might just pick up a couple.  I want to ask what part of the story inspired Goro Miyazaki...to want to direct this.  There's nothing in here that really justifies creating an anime.  The major problem I find is that all the times they could be doing alot of character scenes the characters are really doing nothing.  This takes way too long and there are entire scenes that don't do anything to contribute.  The action that happens in this anime is very....inconsistent.  There were a few scenes that I thought were really well done and others that left me bewildered, and not in a good way.Art: For a 2006 movie it was desperately mediocre.  The art was very basic and the characters where very Ghibli...men have gigantic beards and women all look the same.  There were a couple marketplace scenes that I paused to take a look at some of the art and it was pretty decent, but for the rest of the scenes I was bored.  If you really want a comparison...watch Totoro or Porco Rosso and then watch this and scene how the art has barely improved.Sound:  I remember being slightly bothered by the music occasionally....but not too much.  There are definitely better soundtracks out there but there are probably worse ones if you searched hard enough.Character: When the art is lacklustre an anime is based completely on the story and the characters. The characters in this anime spend too much time being ambiguous and not enough time bonding with each other.  There's alot of anger swelling in the two younger characters and it comes off mainly as angst instead of anger.Enjoyment: I did not enjoy this anime. Even now I can't really remember anything of it, which is usually a bad sign.  As far as Goro Miyazaki's first film...it isn't great...but it isn't terrible either, he'd work alot better in a different studio. to want to direct this.

LeGuin. It was also Hayao Miyazaki's son, Goro's, directorial feature debut. I'm loathe to call any Studio Ghibli film a half-baked mess but that's exactly what this film is. Miyazaki felt his son lacked the experience to direct a feature length film-- especially one as ambitious as Earthsea-- and it's a shame that he was proven right (and that it damaged the relationship between father and son). While the animation quality is on par with some of the other Ghibli movies, it just fails.The mediums of literature...and film are completely different; adaptation from one to the other is extremely difficult to do, and even harder to accomplish well. Earthsea apparently failed as an adaptation; the author commented that it was an entirely different story being acted out by characters that happened to share names with hers. But even taking the film out of the context of the book series, it fails as a film (I’m using this word a lot...). Despite being one of the highest grossing movies that year in Japan, it was met with mixed reactions. The movie is just incompetent. In addition to mythos spouting and plenty that goes unexplained, there's little time allotted for character development nor any insight into their motives, which is unforgivable considering Earthsea is two hours long and spends so much of its time accomplishing nothing.

This is not only the third exception to that I've found but also the very worst Studio Ghibli film I've seen.Let's start with the story. The balance of a planet is being destroyed, a prince murders his father for unknown reasons and joins up with a traveling wizard. And all of this has virtually no bearing on the plot whatsoever. Yes, these scenes are mentioned later, but nothing gets done with them. Well, except for the...part about the prince joining a traveling wizard.  After several long minutes of walking scenes the pair end up in a town with an active slave trade and an evil wizard. From there you can probably guess the main plot. At first it seems like a pretty standard fantasy story with atrocious pacing, since a lot of time is wasted with padding scenes of farm work, but then you get to the last thirty minutes or so and two massive plot holes drive through what was a mediocre story and make it atrocious. There are also some major moments that are almost unbearably cheesy, Adam West's Batman series was less corny. The ending is especially guilty of this.Overall the characters fill out cliche roles. One problem that comes in with the characterisation is that characters have knowledge that the narrative has given them no way of knowing. Hooray for plot contrivances? An even bigger issue is that most of the characters are very poorly fleshed out and, as a result, don't have any real motivations or they have motivations that are completely unbelievable. There's also some really clunky dialogue for the sake of exposition.The art is spectacular. That, at least, hasn't changed. The only real problem is that the character designs make it so obvious who's a villain just by looking. Subtlety, who needs it?The voice work is capably done. The music is decent, but it gets repetitive really quickly. Probably because they keep playing the same song segments over and over and over again.There is no yuri in this film. I give it a yuri factor of 1/10.I hate to say it, but my final rating for Tales from Earthsea is a 3/10. It's a bad movie. The story suffers from massive plot holes that could take out most of Asia, the characters are dull, plot points are brought up and turn out to be completely superfluous to the plot, and the ending is bollocks.If you're looking for a decent film to watch, pick anything else out of Studio Ghibli's library and let this one rot. part about the prince joining a traveling wizard.

I was so full of hope for this one.At a first look, it looks like what you would expect; the art is very familiar, especially the character design; the detail of the latter Studio Ghibli movies present, with grandiose scenery and breathtaking settings; the music appropriate, ushering us into the right mood; yet... something is missing.This is very serious movie, gone is the usual playfulness and humour; there is a strong lesson being taught throughout, not unlike in Mononoke Hime, warning us about how...we treat the Earth and our lives. However, that plays almost a second fiddle to the characters, saving of the world doesn't seem as important as their own adventure.Oh, I'm so torn. I've always been a big fan of Studio Ghibli and they can do no wrong. Almost.  This time round, I wasn't &quot;wowed&quot;.

I'm disappointed to say the movie did not live to my expectations. You can't really sympathize with any of the characters, and even though the art is outstanding at times it's also plain. I couldn't believe how unimpressed I was with the town, the most colorful part of the movie.The thing that really drags this movie down is the most important part: the story. Things happen with little to none reason (and those reasons are either stereotypical or absurd), the pace is dreadful; drags...and drags you to hastily tie all the knots at the end.

Sadly, the film lacks the magic and sense of wonder of many of its Studio Ghibli predecessors, and fails to deliver much of a story at all in the nearly two hours it spans. Although it starts out strong, featuring an action-packed dragon battle in the skies, a good king trying to determine the source of the strange events in the world, and a shocking murder, it soon becomes slow and uneventful, dedicating nearly an hour...to a handful of minor plot advancements and weak character development. When it finally picks up again with the entrance of the villainous Kumo, the chain of events is painfully cliche. The story’s sole redeeming feature is its philosophical message, which focuses on the relationship between life and death, yet even this is single-dimensional and beaten like a dead horse, reinforcing the film’s image as a cheap imitation of the elder Miyazaki’s work.This is all quite disappointing because one wants nothing but the best from the often-superb Studio Ghibli, and for Miyazaki’s son in his premiere. It is even more unfortunate because the Earthsea series has been well-received for creating a rich and detailed fantasy world along the lines of The Lord of the Rings. Yet rather than dedicating time to exposition, Tales from Earthsea‘s treatment of the underlying world and state of affairs is so superficial that it will only be intelligible to those who have read the books. What the film lacks in story development it attempts to make up in character development, but its efforts add little depth or evolution to the characters, who are far too ordinary (think good wizard versus bad wizard) and static to be of any moment.Despite its story and characters, Tales from Earthsea is still a Studio Ghibli film, and the production values are as you would expect. The animation is gorgeous, and adds to the Ghibli repertoire with its stunning scenic shots of the medieval Earthsea world. The dragons are also impressive, with a realistic design that adds a sense of darkness and primal fear in the few scenes where they make an appearance. The only time the animation falls short is when the effort is lacking: whereas the opening scenes contain some of Ghibli’s best, many of the scenes in the latter half of the film are plain and dark.The soundtrack is very good, with a standout track in “Therru’s Song,” a moving a cappella piece by Aoi Teshima (the voice of Therru, the young girl character) that should be counted among Ghibli’s finest. (Teshima’s “Song of Time” is also quite good). The rest is a collection of orchestral pieces that are truly beautiful, albeit repetitive. The English voice cast is on the whole great, with a memorable role from Willem Dafoe as Kumo.While Tales from Earthsea boasts exceptional production values, they can’t make up for its disappointing story.

I've seen my fair share of his movies and I would agree with that sentiment. Spirited Away is one of my top 5 favorite animated movies of all time, I thought Ponyo definitely should have been seen by more people and My Neighbor Totoro is one of the most enjoyable films you and everyone in your family can watch. Did you know though that before his first film in the Studio Ghibli canon, Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, he was interested in adapting another project? Ursula...K. Le Guin had been asked by many directors to have her Earthsea trilogy adapted into films and she had refused every single one including Miyazaki-san when he first approached her. However when he won an Oscar for Spirited Away she had a change of heart and said that if anybody is allowed to adapt her novels into film it would be Miyazaki-san. He was however occupied with directing Howl's Moving Castle at the time and could not take on the project, however Miyazaki's son Goro Miyazaki expressed interest in directing a feature film and Hayao's producer convinced Goro he should take on the project never realized by his father.Tales from Earthsea looks absolutely gorgeous. The colors are fantastic, I love the character design and the backgrounds look incredible. Studio Ghibli always has the absolute best animation for their films and this is no exception. There are scenes in this movie that are straight up beautiful, unfortunately it seems like they were all in the beginning. It seems like the production budget for this movie was a little less than most Ghibli productions, that really is the only reason I can see why the climatic final battle takes place on a friggin rooftop. Though the aniamtion for that scene is nice you get the feeling that there could have been more done with it and in better locations. It still doesn't detract from the rest of the animation in the movie though which looks fantastic as always. The film itself on the other hand....Most of the time I prefer the English dub over the Japanese vocal track when it comes to anime? That usually is proven for Ghibli movies that are put out by Disney. Since they have the name of the most powerful media corporation on the planet they're able to get voice actors who not only are good for the role but are famous for their on screen persona as well. That's why you get people like Christian Bale, Liam Neeson and Anna Paquin to dub your movies. I'm not saying that voice actors need to be famous in order to be good, lord knows that usually isn't the case but Disney manages to find good actors who just happen to be famous to dub their flicks. Unfortunately it seems that with Tales from Earthsea they managed to make a misstep. The actors they got for the kids sound dull. There doesn't seem to be much emotion to their voices. Even during scenes of really high tension they still speak in a monotone fashion. Especially who they got to play Therru. The adult actors do a decent job especially Willem Dafoe who doe swell in any psychotic role because he's just that damn awesome. I also liked Timothy Dalton as Sparrowhawk and felt it was one of those natural fits Disney got right again. The one person I thought felt out of place though was Cheech Marin. They certainly could've picked a worse voice actor and he's not a stranger to these types of roles as Lion King can prove but he just doesn't seem like he's playing role in this flick. It feels like he's just playing himself and every time I heard him talk it took me right out of the world.Now to my main problem with this movie: the plot. The plot is actually pretty hard to follow. Most Ghibli movies do have imaginative plots yes and they can get a little confusing but this one didn't even have the usual charm that their movies usually carry. Let's take Ponyo for example. Ponyo's story can be a little confusing with questions like where did the magic that Fujimoto uses come from? Or what the hell are these ancient fish doing here? Questions like these are answered though, albeit a little roughly but still answered, throughout the course of the movie. In Tales of Earthsea however there are multiple questions that are not answered. I usually don't demand that a movie spells things out for me directly but when they're this crucial to the plot it kinda bears witness.I'm gonna head into spoiler territory here so be warned. But seriously, why the hell did Therru turn into a dragon at the end? I mean I know at the beginning they said that men and dragon used to be one but dragons chose freedom and men chose possessions so it kinda makes sense that they would make her a dragon since they used to be that way but if it happened to all dragons shouldn't the hybrids not exist anymore? And what does that make Therru? Does she have magic powers, was it after she died she became a dragon or did she not die at all and could've turned into a dragon at anytime but she decided not to? What the hell is keeping Sparrowhawk from  using his magic inside castle walls? Was there a charm placed or something? Why the hell does Cob need slaves? It doesn't seem like there's any vegetation that grows around his castle so why the hell do they need like a hundred maids and butlers? All of these questions didn't have to be summed up through actions on screen either. One or two lines of dialogue here or there would have sufficed. This plot was needlessly confusing and really frustrating to sit through.The other main problem I had with this movie is that nothing really happened. At the end one man was defeated and you found out some girl was a dragon. I guess that's reasonable enough for an ending and it did sorta wrap things up while leaving room for a sequel but seriously it didn't feel that interesting. I didn't care about any of the characters because they were so bland and underdeveloped. The action scenes weren't that well choreographed, the dialogue felt like it was spit out by a computer whose parameters were just make a fantasy story. It's such an inconsequential, forgettable film that it seems like there could've been so much more to it. I'm sure somebody in the studio could've stepped in and made this a worthwhile watch but in the end it ends up being just bland.Tales from Earthsea is far from being an abysmal movie but it's still not very good. This project screams for a bigger budget and better writers. It could've been a welcome addition to the Studio Ghibli canon. Unfortunately it just turns out to be a big misstep in the wrong direction. It's head is in the right place but it's heart is not. I give Tales From Earthsea 2 stars out of five.2/5 K.

Like any Ghibli film, the art is amazing, and the overall quality of the film is good, but as far as the story and characters go, nothing special. I just rewatched it, and yet I can barely remember it. It's very forgettable, and the story is very hard to follow, the characters are bland, and motivation for many of the biggest plotpoints are completely ignored and overlookedOverall, I'd give it a pass, unless you really want to see every Ghibli film. "", 'The movie tries to stay true to the book in ""tone"" and also tries to convey many of the main themes apparent in the books and people who have read the books I think will appreciate that and feel very comfortable with this movie. However for this review I will assume that most of the people who would want to watch it aren\'t familiar with Le\'guin\'s world.You will not understand the majority of the plot here if you haven\'t read the books. There is so much material crammed in here (from 3 books) that you will be left wandering what is going on and why...do the characters do the things they do.However, apart from the almost incoherent story all the other aspects of the movie are great. The art style and soundtrack are superb and albeit some characters not looking faithful to their in-book descriptions (Ged is more dark-skinned and Therru shoud have been far more severely scarred) I was ok with their overall presentation. The landscapes, Hort town and the dragons look especially good and captivating. As for the music score, it conveys the ""feel"" of earthsea quite successfully - the pieces have a folk celtic element which befits earthsea\'s world.As someone who has read the books my enjoyment of this movie was quite high and I would definitely reccomend it to everybody who would like to experience this beautiful world again (as I said, the ""feel"" and ""themes"" of the movie are very close to the books). I wouldn\'t be so quick to reccomend it to viewers who are not familiar with the books because the plot will be very confusing and they will not experience a proper introduction to the characters, since a lot of their actions remain unexplained in the movie and appear unmotivated. It is still a solid audio-visual experience though.

Goro Miyazaki's Tales of Earthsea fails at several of these points. It is flat, not engaging. It felt like a chore to watch.The film starts off with a huge negative action: the main character's balance is already stacked heavily against him. In order for the plot to progress, he must overcome that negative balance and progress to a positive balance. Vices must be overcome with virtues, past actions forgiven, lessons learned, etc.Even as the main character goes on a journey (part of the Hero's Path) the main...character never really progresses. There is no remorse or guilt. There is no character development: he remains as he was at the beginning: wimpy, despondent, and fatalistic. His guide in the journey can only do so much.To those of you who seek a sense of justice, who expect a sense of comeuppance, stay away from this film. There is no retribution. Wrongs happen and no one is there to amend them.

I feel as though this movie would have been wonderful if it were not for a few wasted and unneeded scenes. At some parts, I was holding my breath to wait to see what would happen......and then, minutes later, let it out and laugh a little when I realize that I had been led on.+ The Art+Of course it was great. Particularly when Arren was wandering around in the market by himself....It was absolutely wonderful to see the old stone buildings (some of the run-down houses even looked like Howl\'s castle), the water fountains, the vendor, the flowers, trees up-close. And then, in the very end, when those stones crumble, the ripple effect before they finally fall was pretty amazing.+The Story+Plot holes big enough to fly a dragon through.....it just didn\'t make sense. All that time on the farm should have been used instead to fill the viewers in on the story. Heck, even flashbacks would have been welcomed, even though I haven\'t seen much of those in Ghibli movies. There was so much to work with! A world losing its magic? There are plenty of things to get from that. Isn\'t the point of watching movies to find out what happens at the end?The script was a bit cliche. ""Let me go!"" ""Where are you taking me?"" ""You\'ll never get away with this!"" Not many morals to be found, except for the whole ""live your life"" thing.+The Sound+Music was okay. Reminded me of Lord of the Rings, actually. All Celtic and whatnot.Voice acting was pretty good (but I\'m terrible at judging voice actors). Cob\'s was my personal favorite; it made me laugh with how overdramatic, monotone, and quiet it was. Sparrowhawk (can\'t stand that name) sounded like Gandalf....Arren\'s voice was very pleasant.....did not like Therru\'s voice.+Character+Underdeveloped, flat characters. This is mostly due to the underdeveloped story. It\'s not the characters\' faults. Arren\'s personality was rather confusing, but again, not his fault. Cob....mediocre villain. The artwork of him was magnificent, especially at the very end. I was actually scared of it (and then he spoke).+Overall+You could probably be doing two things at once while watching this. You will not miss much. Do make sure to look up every now and then so you can see the artwork, and be sure to listen to the music. It is worth watching though. Sometimes unfinished stories make for the best inspiration of all.

""You\'ll never get away with this!"" Not many morals to be found, except for the whole ""live your life"" thing.+The Sound+Music was okay. Reminded me of Lord of the Rings, actually. All Celtic and whatnot.Voice acting was pretty good (but I\'m terrible at judging voice actors). Cob\'s was my personal favorite; it made me laugh with how overdramatic, monotone, and quiet it was. Sparrowhawk (can\'t stand that name) sounded like Gandalf....Arren\'s voice was very pleasant.....did not like Therru\'s voice.+Character+Underdeveloped, flat characters. This is mostly due to the underdeveloped story. It\'s not the characters\' faults. Arren\'s personality was rather confusing, but again, not his fault. Cob....mediocre villain. The artwork of him was magnificent, especially at the very end. I was actually scared of it (and then he spoke).+Overall+You could probably be doing two things at once while watching this. You will not miss much. Do make sure to look up every now and then so you can see the artwork, and be sure to listen to the music. It is worth watching though. Sometimes unfinished stories make for the best inspiration of all.', ""This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. Yes, I'm aware that this was directed by Goro Miyazaki and not Hayao Miyazaki so I adjusted my expectations. However, after watching the movie, I now understand why Hayao Miyazaki walked out of his son's film to take a smoke break. Halfway through this film, I wanted to just stop watching altogether but I finished to give it a fair chance.The pacing was bad, the story was bad, the characters were hollow. I could not give a fck about the characters or the story by the second half of the film, and...that's not a good thing to feel as a viewer. Nothing made sense, nothing mattered. The lines the characters delivered were beautifully written however there was no impact behind the words. There's barely any build up and a whole lot of nothing happening for the longest time.The only good thing about this film was the background art. The art of the city and the castle were beautifully drawn.Please just save your time by skipping this film. that's not a good thing to feel as a viewer. Nothing made sense, nothing mattered.

While it is true that I had not yet got to the fourth book (which this is based off of, those who do not know earthsea) of the series, I enjoyed recognizing the characters and the world.Naturally, a few thigns were changed, and another few adapted,...but honestly, I dont think that Goro's father could have done a better job! He was able to capture both the breathtaking atmosphere as well as the bittersweet, and sometimes somewhat terrifying, aspects of Earthsea.I know, you fans of Ghibli, that Goro used many things that you would expect more in the typical anime film--the slight overuse of blood in the dragon battle, the odd look of the lead antagonist--but really, it was needed.And for those earthsea fans, yes, yet again Ged looked a bit too western, and the island culture may have been a little different than one have imagined, but goodniess knows I felt Earthsea!but, even ignoring all of that, the movie was good jsut as a movie! Well acted, well drawn, and coupled with a beautiful fantasy music score.I dont know about the critics and anime fans who rated this movie before me, but I personally thought it quite a wonderful work, and would gladly watch it quite a few more times, and definatly buy it! :)Highly reccomended, jsut keep in minds that things chagne when a book is adapted, and jsut be glad the character's are recognizable and that they idnt pull an Ella Enchanted :P but honestly, I dont think that Goro's father could have done a better job!

However, it is severely lacking. Given that this is Goro Miyazaki's first time out it is somewhat understandable how this turns out. The movie is absolutely beautiful to look at....and thats about it. The movie takes much too long to even get near even beginning the plot that by the time it decides to, the plot has to be mashed together haphazardly and nonsensically. What we're left with is that is full of beautiful scenes that ultimately amount to little or nothing. Nice looking but with a weakly executed story. "", ""Having only just finished watching Gedo Senki: Tales from Earthsea which was done by Miyazaki's son I have a few things to say. I am a Ghibli fan, and I was curious as to how Goro Miyazaki would make his first movie.Since I had already read the accompanying book &quot;The Earthsea Trilogy&quot; by Ursala K. Le Guin I expected to be disappointed, but I was curious as to what would disappoint me.The story takes place some time after certain events in the book, but before the final events. So an audience that's never read the book will never find out why magic is failing,...why the crops and animals are still dying, etc. Which is interesting because this is brought up in the begging, but then the story drifts off to the main plot. There was a lot more violence, dismemberment, and death in this movie that stood out in the film. It was darker and it did shroud it's characters well. I wasn't sure I liked it.The movie does touch on some places that show up in the book, and if you did read the book you find out what happened to some characters that just disappeared after their part in the book.The book's main character, Sparrowhawk, is a supporting character as we follow the boy Arren in the movie. I didn't particularly like this film because it isn't as deep as the other ghibli films I've seen, but the art is really really good.All in all, the story itself, is definitely something different from what papa miyazaki does, and the characters aren't as easy to love, but if you're open to a different take to story telling then this movie might be one you should see. why the crops and animals are still dying, etc. Which is interesting because this is brought up in the begging, but then the story drifts off to the main plot.

The DVD was given to me by a friend and the design for the cover very much intrigued me with the beautiful dragon and background. However, I later found out that the movie had been adapted from a series of books and was directed by Goro Miyazaki, not Hayao. Still, I watched it with an open mind and hope for a good film. Sadly, I was let down.Story: 3/10The plot of Tales from Earthsea really throws the entire movie down. From the beginning to the last 20 minutes of the movie,...I had honestly no understanding of the plot, why things happened, or even what was happening. This may be contributed to the fact that I haven't read the books that the film was adapted from, but even so I still should have had a grasp of the happenings. The pacing was messy and confusing, with parts being unexplained until the climax, where the answers came flying all at once. It vexed me very much when it shouldn't have. I note that the movie was mostly focused on the third book of the saga, but it still should have explained most of the setting from the start.Art: 10/10You can never go wrong with Ghibli art. For a film originally made in 2001, the animation and background effects were as breathtaking as ever. The character design was a bit plain, but their facial expressions, gestures and the like still pleased me. The world of Earthsea looked magical in my eyes, like a true place from a fairytale, as it should be.Sound: 9/10Art and sound go hand in hand when it comes to Ghibli films, so the sounds of Earthsea were almost as good as its art. While the soundtrack didn't pull at my heartstrings enough for me to give it a full 10, the orchestrated music was still amazing. I always love the full sounds of dramatic instruments playing throughout movies to make the scenes more dramatic, and Earthsea does this. The voice acting wasn't too shoddy, though. The actors sounded a little too serious for my tastes, but perhaps it was the personality of the characters that contributed to this.Character: 6/10None of the characters in the movie were I barely able to sympathize with. Arren was interesting at first because of his first scene, but his personality confused and scared me. I couldn't understand him and his development was messy but he was somewhat likable. Therru, I thought, could have been developed more. She has a strong personality but her overall impact on the film wasn't as strong as I wanted it to be. Sparrowhawk, while noble, was boring and I expected more from the titles he had in the movie. The villain freaked me out and I couldn't hate him or like him because I was confused to what his point was until the very end. All other characters were either neutral to my opinion or played very meager roles. I could barely feel emotion for any of them in the end.Enjoyment: 5/10The first three-quarters of the film I was absolutely confused and at times uncomfortable. I really tried to keep a positive mind while watching all the way through and give it a chance, but it didn't happen. The climax gave me a little hope, with the ending leaving me with some satisfaction. Overall enjoyment was average, the same as how I started the movie.Overall: 6/10Tales from Earthsea was conducted rather poorly. Judging broadly from the plot, it had the potential to be an interesting movie, but the way it was paced blew the whole the thing out of proportion. I would recommend watching this film with a very open mind and without high expectations. I had honestly no understanding of the plot, why things happened, or even what was happening.

And for good reason, I mean, he’s amazing in almost every piece of animation he touches. However, in this case, Gedo Senki ,which can be roughly translated to “Tales From Earthsea”, was directed by Hayao’s son: Gorou Miyazaki. For sure, I would say it is as bad as a lot of its viewers make it out but, first of all, I’d like to applaud Gorou’s efforts in his attempt to direct in a way fitting for a Ghibli title. I don’t think he should be put down for not quite reaching his Father’s standard but...should be celebrated as someone who probably did a better job at directing than most veteran directors in his first try. And yes, this was his first official work as director.But as bad as Gedo Senki could be, the one thing I felt was preserved, albeit not really built upon as it should’ve been, was the fictitious world that you can obviously tell has a lot going on yet nothing at all. For whatever reason, Gedo Senki is, conceptually, an anecdotal story inside a world of many happenings. This was the crux that should’ve been the selling factor for this entire series but, oddly enough, it hardly felt like they built upon any sort of history. The one thing we got was that humans and dragons lived in harmony as “one”, whatever that means.I should mention that this was the opening cinematic to the film. Two dragons appear in the middle of the sea; fighting it out and one gets wounded and then the king of Elad gets word that dragons were sighted by a crewship. So, he takes a walk and chats about it with his “Wizard Root”..? Which, I think it is just another way to say “Court Wizard”. We should probably just call him the court wizard. Anyways, that’s the last mention of dragons until, like, almost the very end of the movie. Thankfully or maybe unfortunately, you kind of forget it very quickly because right after this conversation; where they even bring up the fact that the king’s son is missing. His son turns up right behind him and just gives his Daddy a good ol’ shank! They later confirm that the king died from his wound but nobody cares anyways. The son’s name is Arren, except, it isn’t and we’ll get to that.We’re not really given a thorough explanation of why Arren killed his Father. The whole idea is that he has this split personality but it isn’t very clear if it is a split personality. He just kind of gets really angry randomly and super aggressive. For whatever reason, this doesn’t present itself as a huge problem later on. In fact, the uh… “Ghost” of said personality almost finds solace for some odd reason. It doesn’t exactly explain that either. I am guessing because the “real” Arren started to “care about life” thanks to Therru (Teru, in case you’re wondering how it is pronounced). Except, her name isn’t Therru but we’ll get to that.Ged, the bloody archmage; the strongest wizard in all the lands runs right into Cob’s trap and finds himself held captive along with his lover, Tenar. They make it pretty clear they have storied history. To shed more light upon the “Arren finds enlightment through Therru” part, they do this sudden cinematic where they’re standing atop a hill near the house Therru and Tenar lives in and as the waves crash against the rocky shore; a dragon, that we later find out is actually Therru, flies above their heads. This is where you’re supposed to remember that this movie opened with hinting at Dragons being a huge story element of some kind; which left me kind of confused for the rest of the movie. Well, more confused than I already was. Cob chokes Therru to death while Arren is hanging from his sword that got stuck inside stone. Except, she doesn’t get choked to death. This is the scene where she slowly stands up, reveals she has a sharingan and also reveals that she’s a dragon. And that’s really all you need to know about that. Granted, I think this was an effective way of giving Therru’s backstory some leverage. We only had words to define what happened between Therru and her Mother but what we didn’t know was that Therru was the dragon in the start of the film and the dragon she was likely battling against was her Mother.Therru gives Arren a ride back home on her back and completely forgets about Ged and Tenar who end up walking the entire way. Mind you, Tenar had to have Ged lean on her shoulder because Ged was injured. You can probably tell I am super pissed at Therru; the little bitch! Although, somehow, Ged and Tenar get there not long after Therru and Arren do. Which is kind of immersion breaking; I’d imagine a fucking dragon flying is much faster than a middle-aged woman partly carrying a middle-aged man. Yet, they get there almost on par with the speed of a flying dragon. I feel the need to dwell on this more than I should but… eh, fuck it.That’s really it. They wave goodbye as Ged and Arren set out to travel once again. Tenar and Therru continue to work on the farm and they have no real discourse over the fact that Therru’s a FUCKING dragon bro! Not even a sheer mention of how metal that shit is! But that wraps things up. Thanks for your time… Oh the names! Right. So, like, Arren and Therru have “true names”. Arren’s true name is “Lebannen“ and Therru is “Tehanu“. As you can imagine, it isn’t clear why this is even a thing. Apparently Cob needed him to confess his true name to gain immortality bla bla… Actually, I wanna talk about that scene for a moment. Cob, a random stranger who’s probably gay, let’s be honest, stands bedside to Arren; gives him a drink and tells him “don’t worry it’s not poison”. Arren drinks it. What? Bro… What kind of stupid mental fuckwit do you have to be to actually be that stupid.Ah, the names! Ok, so… I thought about it for a little while and I conceived it was some sort of ancient law or unspoken rule that dictates that you need to hide your true name and use a replacement name in your regular day-to-day lives. Then, I realized maybe that’s too much of a stretch. But for the life of me, I do not understand this. Ged’s also called “Sparrowhawk” but I think that’s just a nickname. I don’t wanna assume there’s a Mother ,even in fiction, that would name their son “Sparrowhawk”. It is unthinkable. It seems to me that’s a nickname. So, are these the only two people with “true names”? There’s no indication that other beings we’ve seen have true names.We can safely say that there’s much to be desired in the writing department but it still left me wondering. Right in the corner of my mind; a phrase so devilishly apparent popped in: “I bet it’s better in the manga”. Except, this didn’t feel like anything a Japanese person would make. Gedo Senki had major fantasy western vibes, just by looking at it anyone could tell. I clashed my fingertips against the keys on my keyboard to find that it is a series of American novels written by Ursula K. Le Guin and Gedo Senki was an attempt at adapting parts of the 4 books while, strangely, also including some of The Journey of Shuna, a manga written by Gorou’s Father, Hayao Miyazaki which was published back in 1983. To be clear, it’s mainly mentioning a lot of the story elements, not necessarily a retelling of a story that you might find inside of Le Guin’s series of books. This was to the extent that Ursula felt the need to clarify to Gorou that because the plot is “entirely” different that it is “his” movie and not “her” book. She goes more in-depth in her critique of the film in her blog. An insightful read, might I add. LINK: http://www.ursulakleguin.com/GedoSenkiResponse.htmlAs proud as I am of Gorou Miyazaki’s direction and neat depictions of the creatures and landscape of Earthsea; I would’ve liked to see him do smaller, less challenging films for Studio Ghibli before Hayao let him take this up. The context, of course, was that Hayao was thinking about retirement at the time. But given that Gorou doesn’t seem interested in following in his Father’s footsteps in the animation world, I wonder if this was an attempt by Hayao to motivate his son. should be celebrated as someone who probably did a better job at directing than most veteran directors in his first try.

TALES FROM EARTHSEA marks the debut of Gorō Miyazaki, son of Ghibli\'s legendary co-founder who\'s name requires no mentioning. This fact alone generates a narrative offering some explanatory power as to why EARTHSEA feels like such a dispassionate product even compared to other lesser Ghibli works. A lot has been said of this matter, so for the purpose of this review I will focus on a purely descriptive picture of why EARTHSEA falls short.The story is based on American author Ursula Le Guin\'s beloved fantasy series, particularly the...third book THE FARTHEST SHORE. The pre-title card scenes describe a world crumbling to ruin and malaise. Magic is dying. Livestock are succumbing to an inexplicable disease. Dragons are making appearances in regions beyond their usual haunts. And while a king and his court deliberate on this matter, his teenage son fatally stabs him. This sense of nature out of balance, visualized by way of two dragons fighting to the bloody death, clearly approximates PRINCESS MONONOKE\'s comparable opening involving a mad demon boar and what it portends.The problem is these opening scenes set the stage for a very different movie than the one EARTHSEA turns into. We follow the aforementioned prince, Arren, as he aimlessly wanders the countryside after running away from his home. He encounters Sparrowhawk, a studied and enigmatic mage. They travel to the seedy port city of Hort and its nearby prairies, the primary setting of the movie. Trouble a-brews when they come into conflict with the evil androgynous sorcerer Cob and his minions of slavers.The afflictions ailing the land as described at the beginning are never shown. We see no signs of the plague. Sparrowhawk speaks much of ""the Balance"" and occasionally discusses the decline of magic, but we never get a sense of what this means or what the baseline of magic was before. Dragons are absent of the movie almost entirely despite the emphasis they are given at the beginning. What role do they play in all this? It\'s never made clear whether Cob is the source of these problems the world faces or some greater human transgression. Perhaps these ideas are messy leftovers from an overly ambitious adaptation of the original books, or maybe they exist to keep in line with the running theme of humanity\'s relationship with nature in the works of Miyazaki Sr. Whatever the case, this stuff is never really a part of the story proper, let alone resolved in any way.Instead, TALES FROM EARTHSEA focuses on themes of mortality and embracing life, often in rather clunky ways. Arren\'s reasons for slaying his father are left vague. His inner demons are somewhat lazily externalized in the back half of the movie in ways that are made apparently literal. To be fair, the movie does somewhat prime the idea that Arren has a death wish.

A lack of proper world-building and a dearth of inspiring sights and moments bring it down. The final product is arguably Ghibli\'s weakest movie, although still not without its charms. third book THE FARTHEST SHORE. The pre-title card scenes describe a world crumbling to ruin and malaise. Magic is dying. Livestock are succumbing to an inexplicable disease. Dragons are making appearances in regions beyond their usual haunts. And while a king and his court deliberate on this matter, his teenage son fatally stabs him. This sense of nature out of balance, visualized by way of two dragons fighting to the bloody death, clearly approximates PRINCESS MONONOKE\'s comparable opening involving a mad demon boar and what it portends.The problem is these opening scenes set the stage for a very different movie than the one EARTHSEA turns into. We follow the aforementioned prince, Arren, as he aimlessly wanders the countryside after running away from his home. He encounters Sparrowhawk, a studied and enigmatic mage. They travel to the seedy port city of Hort and its nearby prairies, the primary setting of the movie. Trouble a-brews when they come into conflict with the evil androgynous sorcerer Cob and his minions of slavers.The afflictions ailing the land as described at the beginning are never shown. We see no signs of the plague. Sparrowhawk speaks much of ""the Balance"" and occasionally discusses the decline of magic, but we never get a sense of what this means or what the baseline of magic was before. Dragons are absent of the movie almost entirely despite the emphasis they are given at the beginning. What role do they play in all this? It\'s never made clear whether Cob is the source of these problems the world faces or some greater human transgression. Perhaps these ideas are messy leftovers from an overly ambitious adaptation of the original books, or maybe they exist to keep in line with the running theme of humanity\'s relationship with nature in the works of Miyazaki Sr. Whatever the case, this stuff is never really a part of the story proper, let alone resolved in any way.Instead, TALES FROM EARTHSEA focuses on themes of mortality and embracing life, often in rather clunky ways. Arren\'s reasons for slaying his father are left vague. His inner demons are somewhat lazily externalized in the back half of the movie in ways that are made apparently literal. To be fair, the movie does somewhat prime the idea that Arren has a death wish. Early on he encounters a drug dealer offering escape from sorrow, only for Sparrowhawk to intervene and tell him the drugs will steal his mind and soul. Likewise, Arren repeatedly places himself in situations in need of rescuing, demonstrating an unhealthy recklessness and lack of concern for his own wellbeing.

A lack of proper world-building and a dearth of inspiring sights and moments bring it down. The final product is arguably Ghibli\'s weakest movie, although still not without its charms.', 'Tales from Earthsea has earned a bit of an unfortunate reputation for itself as the Ghibli Film that it’s okay to dislike. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki’s son Goro, the finished product was apparently so underwhelming to Hayao that he would joke in the future that while he was happy Goro had made a film, he would dissuade his son from making another one ever again. But honestly, after actually seeing the movie, I’m gonna have to disagree with the maestro, because I think Tales from Earthsea is a genuinely powerful film. It’s certainly not the best of the Ghibli canon, and it definitely bears the...marks of a first-time director, but it’s an admirable effort coming from a place of genuine passion and empathy, a stirring experience that touched me in profound artistic ways I wasn’t expecting going in. In fact, it feels very much like a purposeful reconstruction of the kinds of ideas and themes that Daddy Miyazaki himself has been exploring since the beginning of his career. A fantasy world in some state of decay, caught between man and nature as humanity struggles with the responsibility to live side by side with the natural world, a combined guy/girl protagonist team tasked with keeping that peace… it’s like a love letter to Castle in the Sky, Naussicaa, and Princess Mononoke, the tripytch of Ghibli films that cemented their director as the biggest champion of radical environmentalism since The Lorax. And with just a little more polish, I would absolutely consider Tales from Earthsea worthy to stand among that pantheon. Give your son another shot, Hayao; he’s got the potential to make something really special.At any rate, where Earthsea differs from the kind of Miyazaki film it apes is that while Laupta, Naussicaa et all are set in world building themselves back up after some long-ago disaster, the world in Earthsea feels like it’s still in the process of falling apart. It’s set in a land with castles and dragons and pastoral landscapes and big bazaars and magic and wizards and all manor of trapping of Tolkien-inspired fantasy worldbuilding. But this is not a bustling world full of life and vigor; from the very first scenes, the air is filled with an atmosphere of impending doom. The regal dragons that populate the skies have started fighting each other, an event that spells ill omens for the future. There is plague and famine sweeping the land, and it’s all the kingdom can do to keep afloat. Over the course of the movie, we visit no shortage of crumbling ruins and grime-flecked streets, remnants of lives and histories in the process of falling apart, being swallowed by pettiness and cruelty and despair and emptiness. We learn that wizards have mostly lost their magic, and the few spells we see cast feel more like ancient druidic rituals born from long-forgotten eldritch power. This atmosphere is the film’s strongest aspect, leeching into your bones over time and filling you with a kind of quiet ache that only grows stronger with every new vista of haunting stillness and gloomy dread. There’s a very Dark Souls feel to the world of Earthsea, like our heroes are traveling around the remnants of a once great civilization now fading into the sands of time. And it’s all supercharged by the color palette and soundtrack, casting the landscape in deep, ponderous shades of hue and groaning, ancient dirges that seem to wail for the majesty of times long since past. It feels like a world you could get lost in, a world that could swallow you whole without leaving a trace that you ever existed.That despair-tinged atmosphere extends to the film’s themes as well, which center on a young man caught at the crossroads of life and death and finding himself unable to move forward. Aaron is the prince of the kingdom, son of a good king, who nevertheless finds himself afflicted by a mysterious rage that drives him to kill his father and run away to the wastes. There, he finds solace with a wandering mage named Sparrowhawk, and lacking any greater purpose or goal, he finds himself listlessly tagging along with the wizard, hoping to escape from his shame and sorrow in the presence of unfamiliar people and locales. But it quickly becomes clear that he’s become embroiled with someone with much bigger plans than simply wandering the wider world, and in time, Sparrowhawk’s ultimate goal forces Aaron to come to terms with his fears and regrets, standing up to a danger that reflects his worst terrors back at him. It’s in his story that Tales from Earthsea finds its meaning, reflecting the protagonist’s own faults and fears in the decrepit state of the world at large as he grows strong enough to change himself- and symbolically, the world as well- for the better. It’s a story about a young boy more afraid of life than death, who would gladly throw himself on the wrong end of a sword if it meant ending the thick fog of misery that hangs over his head. But it’s also a story about the beauty of life he comes to discover, the beauty of the awe and majesty he comes to see in the world around him, of the simple grace of the people he encounters. There’s a particular moment about halfway through the film where Aaron comes across the Ghibli-branded spiritually important leading lady, here a reckless recluse who has never shown Aaron an ounce of trust before, as she’s singing a haunting, yet riveting melody to herself in the middle of a field, her voice echoing across the soft, sweeping plains like a plaintive cry for hope in the face of despair, and by the time it’s over, well, I was almost tearing up right alongside Aaron. It’s the kind of moment that makes me feel like the bag-filming kid from American Beauty, so struck by the beauty of the world that I feel like I can’t take it.It’s unfortunate, then, that the actual plot facilitated by this incredible story isn’t as strong as it could have been, though the extent to which it rises or falls it a bit more of an open question. Another note this movie takes from Dark Souls is that it doesn’t tend to answer a lot of worldbuilding and lore questions for you, telling most of its greater story through implication. As such, it relies on the emotional and thematic resonance of its ideas to make up for the lack of clear explanations. It’s purposefully mythic storytelling prioritizing emotional resonance over strict logical coherence. We’re never given explicit answers for how dragons and humans once started as the same species, but we’re made to understand the thematic importance they serve in the story as the symbolic representation of the kind of pure, honest freedom and hope this world longs for. We’re never told how exactly the wizards’ magic is fading with the rest of the world, but we understand it as a metaphor for the land’s inner life being swallowed by fatalism and despair. We never know the mechanics of how the film’s ultimate villain plans to open to door between life and death, but we understand that his desire serves as a dark reflection of Aaron’s own desire to be free of the uncertainty and pain of life as he knows it. And there are a handful of spoiler-y moments that raise huge questions about how the lore of this world actually works without ever answering them, because the function they serve in the overall thematic narrative is more important that tying together all the specific details of the mechanics of this fictional universe. It’s a movie that relies on your ability to be okay not having your questions answered, to accept the flow of information as it comes and tackle every step forward on its own emotional terms.Thankfully, I happen to be exactly the kind of person who prioritizes emotion over logic in storytelling, so the faults in Earthsea’s overall construction didn’t bother me that much. I was perfectly able to get sucked up in the storytelling, in the majesty of the world and Aaron’s journey, without worrying about not knowing the specifics of how it functioned. In a way, I love that it allows you to ask your own questions, wondering how some of the more out-there lore details would be fully realized with the power of your own imagination. That said, there’s definitely an unevenness in the film’s handling of that open-ended nature that isn’t present in, say, Spirited Away. In a way, I almost with it left things more open to interpretation; there’s a handful of moments where it feels like the movie goes too far in trying to explain what it’s all about when I was having a perfectly fine time following it already. In a way, it’s both too obvious at times and too obscure at times, over-explaining its thematic narrative at certain key moments while leaving the actual mechanics of that narrative’s realization fairly obscure. It’s clear that this was Goro’s first film, as there’s a sense that the storyteller isn’t fully confident in the audience’s ability to grasp such an abstract narrative, so he over-corrects in some areas and under-corrects in others. It ends up jarring your expectations at times, when you’re not certain whether or not the movie has more to reveal about a certain plot point or idea of if it expects you to take what it’s already given you as the full picture. The story is still incredibly strong, it just needed an editor to push all of its pieces more firmly into place, someone with the confidence to leave unanswered what could be left unanswered and explain only as much as needed to be explained at any given time. With that kind of finesse, I would have no qualms calling this film an outright masterpiece.Still, not living up to the work of one of the greatest directors on the face of the earth, especially on your first attempt, is far from the worst criticism to see leveled against you. Tales from Earthsea isn’t a perfect film, and it’s definitely uneven at spots, but it’s got a stunningly powerful core that honors the legacy of the works it draws from while still feeling like its own creation. It’s a stirring fantasy tale of epic adventure and lost worlds coming to life, realized in spectacular fashion with timeless themes and stirring storytelling that more than makes up for the occasionally awkward construction. Don’t be fooled by its reputation, this one’s a real winner. marks of a first-time director, but it’s an admirable effort coming from a place of genuine passion and empathy, a stirring experience that touched me in profound artistic ways I wasn’t expecting going in.

As much as I might want anime\'s biggest studio to give more help to fans of the medium trying to prove that anime is not just for kids, Earthsea is nowhere close to an appropriate exhibit for that argument.', ""Studio Ghibli became the colossus it is thanks to the directing and love of its major founder, Hayao Miyazaki. Most of his works are adored by most anime fans and he is considered to be the best director of anime movies. But sadly nothing can last forever and he is getting too old to create works with as much passion as the one he had three decades ago. Thus Ghibli tries to pass the torch to the new generation, and in this particular case, Hayao’s own son Gorou. This doesn’t mean all of his talent could be magically inherited to the next generation and that...Gorou could pick up the duty with the same style or passion. In fact his first attempt is quite the unimpressive one. It feels dull and hardly shares the excitement of his father’s earlier works.The story is based on Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea novels. I haven’t read them but I have seen the live action movie adaptation of the first novel and know all the basics. And here lies the first major problem of the movie; the fact that it is based on a mix of all the novels, which took their time to establish the terminology to the reader. The movie focuses mostly on showing the plot and not on explaining the internal logic of the Earthsea setting, thus anyone who is not aware of all that will be completely confused. Prior knowledge of the world in the books is necessary in order to understand how magic and control of the elements work. I am not a fan of expotalk but making a 2 hour story out of a world with a unique form of magic is kind of a bad move. Heck, even the straightforward way Middle Earth was running needed a trilogy to properly explain everything. Thus you need to read the books if you want to fully comprehend the technicals of Earthsea.The second problem is that even if you do read the books, the movie will still feel like a loose and dried up version of a world where the balance between yourself and nature is crucial. A great part of the original story is focusing on internal monologues or long narration of the psychology of its characters, and how that in return mirrors the state of the world they are living in. If they have major issues, the land around them loses its balance and havoc spreads. All that can’t be properly translated from paper to screen, since you “see” them acting and not “hear” them thinking. And no, this is not some half-assed shounen where the characters can’t shut up and just mention the slightest thing they do to you. Thus the problem now is that you don’t understand the motivations or the mentality of the characters. If you see someone suddenly getting angry, chances are you won’t understand the reason because something weird just crossed his mind, stated in detail in the original text but completely invisible on screen.The third problem is the storyboard. It is way too simple, even for an otherwise family movie. Very few things happen in each scene and thus lack the rich context of earlier Ghibli films. Many events could very easily be left out without a problem or could have been shown in a far more captivating way. Heck, they could have combined most action scenes to last half as much, just for the sake of being twice as interesting. The battles are boring, the talking is almost emotionless, and the actions each character does are simple and stretched to last for several minutes. This goes back to an earlier problem, where you have a complicating setting full of events that needs to show and explain lots of stuff, yet the director only chooses to state them in a most basic and dried up way. Earthsea is NOT family-oriented material; you can’t just sit with the kids to see humorous action and adventure. There is mostly world-building and psychology than action; both of which are absent on-screen and thus you get this soup of a plot. And to heck with that, how does the wizard plan to save the world by wasting days in plowing a field? Or how will the prince make his own kingdom by running away from the kindom he would inherit one day? Nothing makes sense!It is the same problem Ghibli’s earlier work Howl's Moving Castle had. Way too many things happen in way too little time for the average viewer to grasp and cherish, and thus they get nothing specific to remember about. I understand how they are trying to make it more complicating than just another run-of-the-mil children’s adventure but such things simply take time to be properly presented and the target audience doesn’t care about all that to the most part. If you ask me, both Howl and Earthsea (and their following Borrower Arrietty) should be SERIES and not a teaser movie that scratches only the surface of the whole. They are not stories that can be zipped down to a few hours like in the case of Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke.The fourth problem is the plausibility of the storyboard. Apart from being simple and incomprehensible, it is also full of convenience. It is ok to have a couple of scenes in such movies but if it happens all the time it tends to get annoying fast. Arren keeps bumping on the proper people, in the proper moment, all the time. If there are lotteries in Earthsea, he could have won them all with all that luck of his. And the wizard of the story can simply appear and disappear every time the script calls for it, and it is not because he can teleport or something. Not to mention the silent girl who, oh, so happens to bump on Arren in a one in a billion chance a few days later he saves her from being raped… RAPED? Did I just say something that shouldn’t be part of a family movie? Why the hell are they promoting child rape and child slavery in a movie for kids? See what I meant when I said Earthsea is NOT family-oriented material? This is going to scare children and parents away.The production values are great as usual but definitely lack the mind-blowing visuals of earlier films. Earthsea “looks” rather generic for a fantasy medieval setting and it is its metaphysical unseen aspect that makes it great. Nothing close to Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke and their extremely full in detail sceneries and weird creatures. Furthermore they overdid it with the robes and the cloaks. Everybody wears these monochromatic blunt uniforms most of the time that it feels like they were trying to save money in animation by drawing a few simple triangles with a head on top that slide instead of a full body that walks. It again takes out a lot from what the eye could be kept busy and you are again left to realize how basic and boring it feels.In a rather similar way soundtrack and voice acting are fine for what the movie is all about bout definitely lack passion. Since the world is out of balance most people are very gloomy and sad, so they feel too negative and distant for you to care. Plus since their motivations are blurry and you don’t understand how they think or act, you simply lack a reason to like them. Combined with the simplistic storyboard, you feel like half the time you are just hearing them talk in a cryptic but otherwise emotionless way, and there is little to no BGM to make it sound fancy. So I felt like most of the dialogue was short sentences full of amateurish attempts at building tension (Are you… could it be… it can’t be… perhaps… of course).And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 7/10General Artwork 2/2 (well-made)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (very detailed)Animation 1/2 (too many robes)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 7/10Voice Acting 2/3 (dull but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 3/4 (not great but fitting with the feeling of the series)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 5/10Premise 2/2 (interesting)Pacing 1/2 (dull)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (vague)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 6/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (rather cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 1/2 (generic but it’s there)Catharsis 1/2 (generic but it’s there)VALUE SECTION: 2/10Historical Value 1/3 (none, unless you count the original books’ fame)Rewatchability 0/3 (no way)Memorability 1/4 (the dragons were cool)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 3/10So did I liked it?

Sorry Gorou, you need to get your facts straight if you want us to like you. Your first attempt was a big mess.VERDICT: 5/10"", 'A directorial debut from Miyazaki’s son Goro.Keeping with the Studio Ghibli standard, the animation was beautiful and colorful. The dragons looked mighty and cool.Unfortunately, that’s the only thing that kept up with the standard. This movie was a major disappointment. The characters had little background, leading to them having unclear motivations. Some of the actions were quite baffling, and did not have explanations. Many aspects introduced in the movie were barely touched upon, leaving me feel confused and like I’m missing a lot about the movie’s universe.Most of the background provided by the movie was shown through characters talking, and not actually showing...any of past scenes. This was quite lazy and didn’t provide enough about the universe.Apparently, all these flaws were inevitable because the script attempted to shove 6 novels into one movie. That wasn’t a very good decision.Overall, a disappointing and confusing movie with ambitious themes. 4.5/10 any of past scenes. This was quite lazy and didn’t provide enough about the universe.Apparently, all these flaws were inevitable because the script attempted to shove 6 novels into one movie. That wasn’t a very good decision.Overall, a disappointing and confusing movie with ambitious themes. 4.5/10', 'ATTENTION: HIDDEN SPOILERS!!!Well, Gedo Senki. I\'ve recently watched it (though I had a funny little feeling I\'ve seen it before at least partly, but let\'s pretend it never happened) and was about to add it into my list when suddenly realized the amount and the variety of thoughts are too great for a simple comment. You may kill me at once for the thing I\'m going to tell you now, but I really liked this anime! Oh gosh! It\'s hard to believe, but it is true. There\'s no excuse for me, is it?Actually, I never put a 10 for Ghibli works, and this was not...an exception. But honestly, it nearly got it. I would\'ve put a 10 (I\'m not greedy for good scores) if the story was as clear as day and complete. Because it has no annoying sweet taste that is usual for Ghibli works and pisses me off. But in order to make a full bunch of spoilers let\'s be more precise.Story - 9. The story was a grasp of fresh air! It\'s so unusial, I\'ve never seen anything like that before. There\'s the main potentially good guy, Arren, who cannot decide who he really is and thus he kills his own father and runs away (it later turns out to be the subject of boast he uses to charm the main girl). This guy comes across a sudden helper who wishes to show where the Absolute-and-Single-Truth lies. However, Ged himself has problems, as he is an Archmage and pretty old, but still hasn\'t a long white beard and cannot confess his true feelings to the woman of his life, Tenar. Perhaps, the allmighty Archmage is afraid of getting married, that\'s why he wanders around the world in a cloak that covers his face. But no use. Once he appears at the door of Tenar\'s house in order to bother her with sudden tasks (f.e. to cure somebody), he\'s made to work AT ONCE.Meanwhile, having all good heroes placed together, we also get the main evil character, Cob. He looks like a gay or something and wishes to conquer the world and turn it into gayness. As he is obsessed with power and dreams to rule forever, he also plans to find the medicine of eternal life and get the Nobel prize. However, his servants are so bad that they did not provide him with the nesessary information: the medicine has already been invented by Ged, as Tenar is a living dead. And then the spectators get the thing they all were watching the movie for: tough action, magic and dragons.Characters - 10. Here we have some main characters and a bunch of supporting ones.Arren - perhaps, he was born in June under the zodiak sign of Gemini, as he has two names, two souls, two ways of behaviour and (maybe) two loves of his life. The good soul is straight and loves a girl and the evil one is obviously gayish. Each soul could love a separate person, but one-and-single body turns out to be a problem! Traditionally, the main hero HAS to find the meaning of his life, thus leaving one of his lovers with a broken heart.Therru - she\'s the best match for Arren, as she\'s also a Gemini and has two names and two identities. Soft and homophobic, she actually turns out to be a real beast who wants to get both souls of Arren and turn him into marriage slavery. Additionally, this hottie can see real ghosts and has the key to eternal living by giving birth to someone else.Ged - the Archmage and a convinced bachelor. In order to stay this way he can do anything, even turn his face into an ork\'s one, which is of no use as Tenar loves him anyway. Is able to work, but mostly with his tongue, thus is often seen philosophizing instead of ploughing.Tenar - perhaps, she was an Egyptian mummy later found by Ged in a tomb. Now she\'s a woman glowing with health because of living in a good environment.Cob - the main heterofob of the story who was left by his wife (unfortunately, she forgot to take her make-up kit along) and now wishes to split all happy couples and turn them into into his own disciples. As the story progesses, a skeleton in the wardrobe is revealed, Cob is obsessed with young boys and liquid drugs.Dragons - well, there are not many of them in the story, which is certainly disappointing, so they appear to be unnamed supporting characters.Drug dealer - he\'s surely the main character who provides his goods for the whole cast and supports them in their work. Thus you won\'t find any problems with the art or sound (9 and 10 accordingly).Enjoyment - 9. Yep, the movie delivered greatly (and still continues to deliver despite the fact that several hours passed). If it didn\'t, I wouldn\'t have written the review. You won\'t come across that many objects (and subjects) appearing from nowhere in any other anime. FLCL and Dead Leaves are exceptions. So better go to the nearest library, make a library card and read the book by Ursula Le Guin instead.P.S.

Although it comes from the acclaimed Studio Ghibli, the film doesn’t follow the usual conventional story beats found in Hayao Miyazaki’s works. It’s very linear and serious in pacing and theme. I won’t get into the details of those aspects for two reasons:1. I don’t want to spoil the story.2. I honestly don’t remember anything that happened in the movie.Hear me out for second. I usually have excellent recollection of films and television because I enjoy analyzing as much as I can while watching, even if it’s bad. All of my...mental notes about specific parts of media are stored in my head like a library, so I never have trouble comparing the opinions I have of things I’d seen years apart. This particular instance is an exception. I watched Tales from Earthsea just last year and I’ve completely forgotten the details of both the characters and plot line. It’s like my memory was wiped as soon as the credits faded out. All that remains in the library is a vague silhouette of a decent movie and a hazy sense of fantasy.My theory for this mysterious amnesia is that, while viewing in my typical critical mindset, I got lost in the atmosphere of Tales from Earthsea and basically blocked everything else out. The music and art must have lulled me into a less absorbant state in which I couldn’t process the story or character development. I remember a boy, a girl, and some kind of evil witch. Someone’s dad dies for no reason and a couple of kids get sold to slavery. That’s about everything I know. My clearest memory from the movie is a beautiful melody over a medieval city at sunset, but even that has no context. Despite how bland everything else seemed to taste, I found myself indulging in the simple pleasures of quality animation and musical score. The reviews and general reception to it aren’t very positive compared to others from the same studio, but whatever happened in Tales from Earthsea pleasantly surprised me and left me with happy sentiments. It’s definitely in the bottom tiers of Ghibli’s filmography, but it’s a solid movie by itself. At least, that’s what I would think if I remembered anything.7/10 for how much I enjoyed myself, but overall 6/10 for how much integrity as a critic I lost. mental notes about specific parts of media are stored in my head like a library, so I never have trouble comparing the opinions I have of things I’d seen years apart.

First time watching this movie I was waiting for more exposition to explain what was going on, but never got the answers. It was confusing to just feel that there is a deeper backstory but not be told. I did develop a greater appreciation for the movie once I read the first Earthsea novel, which gave me all the exposition and lore I needed...to understand the world.Other than the narrative problems, this film is visually and musically beautiful. The art and animation was typical of Studio Ghibli: mesmerizing.Anyways, I would recommend this series to those who are fans of both Earthsea and anime. That way they'll understand the narrative and appreciate the beauty of the scenery.I hope you enjoy. to understand the world.Other than the narrative problems, this film is visually and musically beautiful.

When I first found this I stayed up till like 3 AM to finish it and then I rewatched it at least once a day for the next five days. I own a copy. But it has issues.The soundtrack, like most Ghibli films, is quite good. It\'s Tamiya Terashima instead of Joe Hisaishi, but it\'s still great. The animation is also, as far as I can tall, with Ghibli\'s usual standard of great art, filled with lots of little details that make the world come alive. The countryside is empty and full of vanished history. Hort...Town, with all its buildings and colors and full merchant stalls and packed streets, is a pleasure to look at, even if we don\'t explore it all that much. I haven\'t listened to the sub, but the dub is good, like most Ghibli English dubs.The story goes that Hayao Miyazaki originally worked on this project, but left to go work on ""Howl\'s Moving Castle"". It sat in limbo for a bit until his son, Goro Miyazaki, picked it up to finish it. Ursula K. Le Guin, author of ""Tales From Earthsea"", has well-deserved issues with the film, at least as a so-called ""adaptation"" of her books. While this film wasn\'t spectacular for Goro, the guy did go on to do ""From Up On Poppy Hill"", which is all-around much better and worth a watch. People learn.The short of the rest is that the film takes Books 1, 3, 4, and 6 of ""The Earthsea Cycle"" and cherrypicks, rearranges and adds a ton of random things so we end up with what we got. Backstories are mashed together. Characters are erased and turned into other characters, and random scenes are kept in partial form. For example, Arren\'s capture by slavers is about half purely adapted from ""The Farthest Shore"", sans some explanation, although the introduction is rather silly. Arren\'s heroism from ""The Farthest Shore"" is erased in favor of his cowardice (which isn\'t explored as well as it was in the book) and a more generic stereotyped anime ""heroism"" (with a magical sword, random damsel and all). There\'s a lot of needless stupidity in this story. I think the writers were trying to cram too much into too small a space and had to fit an overall narrative to make it work, which resulted in clunky, awkward scenes and weird character development from characters who don\'t make any sense by and large. Not that ""The Earthsea Cycle"" is perfect, but it makes a LOT more sense than the garbled mess that is ""Gedo Senki"". There\'s also a lot of disconnected plot points. Where did the Arren copy come from? Why did he want the sword? What was the opening scene for (it\'s related to a couple plot points in ""The Farthest Shore"" but never explained in the film or resolved in any way)? What do the slaves do that makes them so valuable? Where\'d Therru come from (it\'s explained in ""Tehanu"" and there\'s a lot of great stuff about it). It doesn\'t help that I think a bit too much was lifted from Hayao Miyazaki\'s early manga ""Shuna no Tabi"". I like the manga, but this is supposed to be an adaptation of a different book series, not the animated version of ""Shuna no Tabi"".TLDR; what we end up with is a garbled mess of a what an incredibly charitable person would call a plot that sort of maybe makes sense if you tilt your head sidewise, squint a bit and don\'t think too hard about anything in particular. I enjoy it, but I\'m desperate for a decent adaptation of ""Tales From Earthsea"" and this is LOADS better than the live-action miniseries and there are a few scenes that I like, plus a few other nice things about the film.See it if you\'re a Ghibli or ""Tales From Earthsea"" fan or wanted to see what an animated version of ""Shuna no Tabi"" could have had for a trailer. Then watch ""From Up On Poppy Hill"" if you haven\'t. Town, with all its buildings and colors and full merchant stalls and packed streets, is a pleasure to look at, even if we don\'t explore it all that much. I haven\'t listened to the sub, but the dub is good, like most Ghibli English dubs.The story goes that Hayao Miyazaki originally worked on this project, but left to go work on ""Howl\'s Moving Castle"". It sat in limbo for a bit until his son, Goro Miyazaki, picked it up to finish it. Ursula K. Le Guin, author of ""Tales From Earthsea"", has well-deserved issues with the film, at least as a so-called ""adaptation"" of her books. While this film wasn\'t spectacular for Goro, the guy did go on to do ""From Up On Poppy Hill"", which is all-around much better and worth a watch.

It\'s certianly one of Ghibli\'s darker films.It\'s not really a family film. There\'s violence/gore, one scene of drug use and the effects drugs have on people,people being beat up and forced into slavery, and a constant need to beat into everyone\'s brain that everyone\'s going to die someday  and death is something that can\'t be escaped and just needs to be accepted in order to accept life ironically enough.  The story had alot of action,but often times it left me confused. For example, why were there two Arren\'s exsisting at the...same time? Did Arren have multiply personality disorder or was his alternate persona the cause of some kind of magic or curse? And why did a certain character turn into a dragon randomly at the end of the movie and then turn human again? Or was that dragon a seperate character? If so, where was the said character who I thought was the dragon while all this was happening?  There\'s simply too many questions left unanswered and the movie is rather confusing. I haven\'t read the book so I don\'t know if things are explained better in it or not. That being said, anyone looking to watch this movie for the dragon aspect, steer clear. There is mabye only a minute total of dragon screentime.ArtWhile the story left something to be desired, the art was the quality one would expect from Studio Ghibli. The backgrounds were quite colorful and gorgeous and the  characters(except for the bad guys but it\'s a trend in most movies for the bad guys to look hideously ugly) were quite nice to look at. Arren and his ""horse"" remind me quite a lot of the main boy from ghibli\'s earlier film Princesss  Monoke and his pet elk-thing. That being said, the animals in this movie were rather strange. The wolves that attacked Arren on one occassional had unnaturally short tails and it could be do to mistranslation on the English dub\'s part, but the creature belonging to Arren certainly looked nothing like a horse even though one of the characters refered to it as one at one put in the film.SoundThe dub was nicely done. The voices fit the characters\' personalities well and the music was the right theme-style for the type of film. Other than whether or not the voices fit with the characters though, I don\'t tend to pay attention so much to sound as I do to the art and story.CharacterThe characters were decent,but could have used a little more development. Like for instance, an explanation why Arren occassionally had random violent tendences out of nowhere was much needed. Also, some more history on Theru and why she distrusted strangers would of been nice rather than just a fleeting mention of her parents having abused and abandoned her. Some of Arren\'s past would have helped us sympathize with him more as well. And Sparrowhawke(apparently called Ged in the non-dub version)remains a rather mysterious character throughout the whole movie that you can\'t really relate to much. The bad guy has some kind of beef against Sparrowhawke but even this isn\'t explained in much detail. The character development would have been much better if the film had shown flashbacks of how the characters were invovled with each other rather than just brief,fleeting mentions of the character\'s past meetings/involvements with each other.EnjoymentThe first half of the movie had me bored out of my mind because it seem to just be setting everything up for the real events,but the second half\'s action and drama redeemed it considerably for me. All in all, I have to say, nice art and sound and decent,but sometimes confusing story and characters. same time?

I really wanted to see Ghibli's masterpiece of my favorite Earthsea but Goro Miyazaki made it impossible.The song by Aoi Teshima was great. The lyric of the song was also great. I like it more than the song of Princess Mononoke. However, the lyric with the credit Goro Miyazaki originally came from Sakutaro Hagiwara(1886-1942).Great song, good art, good music, and Ghibli-like animation make me sad.

So I started watching it with an open mind. And I gotta say I was sold at the very beginning of the film. During the opening scenes, I thought ""hey, this actually looks interesting, it even has some Vinland Saga vibes"". But then I was disappointed.The story and world presented during the first...10 minutes or so are completely different from the remaining 90 minutes.

However, this movie adaption failed to capture what makes the Earthsea Cycle so interesting and captivating with its deep lore and rich worldbuilding. It simply didn't match. While the aesthetic upheld traditional Ghibli standards, the experience felt alienated from the original novels. Although the movie shared many characters name and places, the movie was not a true adaptaion of the series, but rather a retelling of the Earthsea Cycle, like how there are many different versions and retellings of classic fairy-tales.For those who are ne wto the Earthsea world,...it may feature a different take fantasy tale.

I will be talking about the worst Ghibli movie to be ever released: Ged Senki: Tales from Earthsea. This movie is Miyazaki Gorou’s first animated film.“Miyazaki? Like Miyazaki Hayao, the frickin’ god of anime movies?” Indeed! But unfortunately, Miyazaki Gorou’s first movie is nowhere as good as the worst of his father’s movies. In fact, the dad left the movie theater after one hour and then said “I felt like I’d been in there for three hours”, that should give you an idea of how boring this movie is!WHAT HAPPENED WITH...THE ANIMATION?Talking only about the first half of the movie, the scenery is really outstanding.I wish I could say that the animation in this movie looks great, but unfortunately that can only be said about the backgrounds and scenery. What’s more, the scenery only looks good in the first half of the movie. After that the only things you get to see are a cliché cottage at the top of a green hill for where the good guys live and a dull dark castle for the bad guys.Then there’s also the fact that the some of the characters’ expressions look ugly as hell – when one of the characters (Arren) activates his “edgy” mode, for example.THE LAZIEST GHIBLI FILMIf you have already watched other Ghibli movies, Ged Senki will give you an impression of déjà-vu. Why? Well, a lot of things in this movie are straight up stolen from better Ghibli films!Most characters have the same type of clothes as in Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa. For Usagi, the bad guy’s henchman, this goes even further. His character design is the same as Kurotowa’s, a secondary character from Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa: he has the exact same grin and the exact same face design. Therru’s personality is pretty much the same as San’s from Mononoke-hime, except from the fact that she has no character development.When character designs aren’t plagiarized from other Ghiblis they’re just extremely lazy and lack detail. The movie also makes an overuse of single-colored clothing, which makes character designs even more dull.Ghibli movies usually have great music, which makes them even more memorable. Sadly, the music in this movie is lazy, too. I wouldn’t say the music is bad, but it is boring and repetitive, on top on not fitting the universe at all – Scottish-sounding music in a Mediterranean-looking country, really?Even the voice-acting and dialogues are lazy: characters seem to lack both energy and emotions. This makes it almost impossible to care about them.Then there’s also a scene that is stolen from Star Wars, with the bad guy “force-choking” his henchman to punish him for his failure. But I guess that’s just a reference, huh!A WEAK VILLAINComing back to the bad guy, Kumo (or Cob), he is a weak villain. Contrary to antagonists in other Ghibli movies, he is pretty Manichean. He does have an objective – to become immortal – but it is pretty obvious that he’s just evil. Granted, you can have good Manichean antagonists, but in that case they must have something else, like charisma – which Kumo doesn’t have.By the way, he is said to be a powerful and evil wizard responsible for a lot of the bad stuff happening in the kingdom, but he has less than ten men on his side? With all the people he abducts and sells as slaves he should have enough money to recruit more mercenaries. But no, slave trading is just how he makes a living, apparently. Economic crisis, perhaps?STORY AND CHARACTERS: UNCLEARThe film opens on dragons fighting, a king dealing with his country’s problems – the spread of a disease – and the murder of said king by his son, Arren. You would expect the bad guy to have something to do with this, since he is an evil wizard, but it is never stated if that’s actually the case. It is never explained if the disease is Kumo’s doing.It is also never explained why Arren killed his father – he himself doesn’t know! This young boy sometimes switch personalities and turns into a strong and edgy-looking dude with an ugly and evil-looking distorted face, which sounds extremely cool, but is never properly explained. Is it linked with his crippling death anxiety or not, nobody knows…From her first encounter with Arren, Therru starts hating him for some unknown reason. And when the plot needs them to get close, they get close and become friends in less than five minutes without any proper justification. It’s not like they didn’t have the time to make their relationship evolve: the movie is two hours long!TWO HOURS OF MOVIE, AND FOR WHAT?With the movie being two hours long you would expect its universe, plot and characters to be properly developed, but that’s not the case. The reason? It wastes its time on useless bullcrap. A big chunk of the movie consists in Arren and Ged traveling across the country. Sure, it’s very nice because you get to admire the landscapes and the city’s stunning architecture, but after half an hour of watching the characters walking, visiting a town and buying stuff at a marketplace, you start wondering if this movie even has an actual story. And when the plot finally starts to progress, it’s with the introduction of a slave trader whose character design is stolen from another story. Ironically, this character was the most enjoyable and most likeable of the movie. After that, instead of actually developing the universe or explaining why Arren has a double personality, the movie wastes more of its time by showing the good guys doing farm work!I won’t talk much about the ending, as it isn’t better than the rest of the movie. It’s actually worse since the beautiful scenery (the only good aspect of the film) isn’t there anymore. Long story short: the bad guys capture two of the good guys, the two other good guys Arren and Therru come to their rescue, some unexplained stuff happens, the bad guys are beaten, happy end.CONCLUSIONThere’s nothing good about Ged Senki: Tales from Earthsea aside from the good backgrounds that appear in the first half of the movie. It plagiarizes other Ghibli films and doesn’t create anything. It is neither entertaining nor enjoyable, as it is slow and uneventful. Watching the whole thing feels like a chore, so my advice would be to not watch it at all.

Their struggles...are definitely more mature and overtly dark than those in other Ghibli films. Arren struggles with depression, dissociation, random outbursts of violent anger, fear of the future, and regret for the past. Therru clearly has PTSD from abuse at the hands of her parents. Their problems are not solved by the end of their adventure, but they are both able to move forward because of their relationship to each other.Kumo/Cobb is very unsettling. I love his character design because he just looks so...wrong. His proportions are all off, and his body just gets more and more deformed and horrifying as time goes on.It's pretty standard adventure fantasy fare. Call to adventure, denial of the call, belly of the whale... all that good John Campbell hero's journey stuff. It's entertaining and often unexpected.And now, the bad things.The dragons are so ugly. It's like someone cut them out of a trashy fantasy paperback cover from the 80s and glued them onto a gorgeous Ghibli backdrop. They don't match the style and it's jarring.(it's possible that they are meant to look like they don't belong, but Ghibli's visual storytelling has always been beautiful and this isn't)The secondary characters are pretty generic. I have a soft spot for Tenar because she's just so cozy and she calls the slavers pigs, but everybody else is kind of...meh. Sparrowhawk doesn't have much of a personality. He's really only good for exposition and saving Arren from dying via stupidity. Even Kumo is kind of a generic villain. He wants eternal life because he's scared of dying. And that's it. We don't even get a real explanation of why or how that is supposed to work.That gets me to another problem. The plot...There are so many holes and loose ends. I won't point them out here because of spoilers, but even the climax lacks real explanation or closure. i honestly wish that the villain had monologued a bit, just so I would know what his plan actually was.The thing that all ghibli films have in common is that they tell the struggles and lessons of growing up by packaging them with magic and adventure. We watch them because they're beautiful and we love them because we identify with them. That's the main problem with this movie, the reason why it doesn't really feel like Ghibli: it doesn't feel that magical and it's hard to identify with the characters.

I had forgotten that this was a second generation Miyazaki film. I forgot that it was an adaptation of something else, something that I have never seen before. I was drawn in by the story summary, and believe me, I think that was enough.Story 10: Gedo Senki happens to have a Lord of the Rings feel to it. It has that kind of epicness you don't find often enough, but then... I think that is what makes it so charming. I understand that it doesn't cover...all of the original, but for the short amount of time alotted for the film, I think that it did well.Art 10: The art work reminded me of the old Lord of the Rings animation, but the major difference is, it was better then the animation done for the movie. This may be due to the fact that this is a much newer production and the other one was in fact made while Tolkien was still alive.Sound 10: I loved the sound for this movie. It was crisp, the sound reflected the mood.Character 7: It is not often that you see strong female characters and truth of the matter is, you get two very strong female characters in this anime. You also have a young prince who is far from perfect, struggling with his own inner psyche. Not to mention other things that added depth. However... some of the minor characters actually lacked the depth that the major characters had.Enjoyment 10: I was at the edge of my seat watching this, spell bound. Again, I haven't seen a film like this since LotR. I am not saying it is as good as the LotR story, or that LotR is as good as this. I am simply saying I enjoyed seeing a story format that I rarely see done and done well.Overall 10: It is quite an enjoyable film. It has a few flaws, but it actually rings good and is something that just simply is rememberable. all of the original, but for the short amount of time alotted for the film, I think that it did well.Art 10: The art work reminded me of the old Lord of the Rings animation, but the major difference is, it was better then the animation done for the movie.

But I don't think this movie deserves all of the hate it's gotten over the years. Ghibli movies are notorious for their art direction and soundtracks, so I'm going to just focus on the plot and how it relates to the books it's based on.This movie gets a lot of it's fame from being Ghibli's worst movie, even Hayao Miyazaki has gone on record to publicly criticize it. The downfall of this movie, among other other things, had even caused the director and Miyazaki's son, Goro Miyazaki, to stop perusing animation for...a time. But Goro Miyazaki had a very dense and complex narrative to work with.If you didn't know, this movie is based off of the book series by Ursula LeGuin, who is an accomplished writer that has helped shape the modern fantasy and sci-fi genres. That being said, her works are nearly impossible to translate to film!(A little bit unrelated, but if you really want my two cents on this, I think Ursula LeGuin's books are okay. Her books aren't bad, they're not great. Just some solid okay books)The two most common things I've heard about this movie is that it is confusing and boring. While Goro was an inexperienced director, I think some of the fault also lies with Ursula LeGuin's writing. Ursula's plots have pacing issues and are littered with chapters upon chapters where seemingly no action takes place. Rather some of the biggest fights are the characters fighting with themselves (ie, Arron having a good an bad side to himself to the point where his biggest fear is himself). Ursula's stories do have magic battles and sword fights, but I feel like this heavily introspective storyline would be difficult for even some of the more experienced directors.An okay book series can only be expected to make an okay movie. But it is unfortunate that this was Goro's first directing position at Ghibli.

Sparrowhawk has set out to discover what has been causing a disturbance in energy across the land of Earthsea. On his journey, he discovers Prince Arren who recently stabbed his father (the king) and ran off with his father’s magic sword. Together the two men set out to find their individual truths.From this point the story gets much more complicated: Arren meets a standoffish witch his age named Therru. Therru lives with a kind farmer, Tenar, who Sparrowhawk and Arren help. There’s also...an evil wizard Cob, who is searching for eternal life. As well as Cob’s main henchman and slave trader, Usagi.As other reviews have stated, Goro Miyazaki just put too much on his plate when making this film.

Furthermore, it seems like all the action was saved for the second-half of the film, which was a major drawback for me. Another aspect I wasn't huge fan of was the insufficient character background. It would have been wonderful if the movie provided us with an insight into Ged, Tenar, and Cob's life (before these event happened). Finally, it's important to mention that there are a few plot holes in this movie. I never managed to figure out why Arren killed his father, the history of the sword and...the significance of the dragons. Of course this could just be me and my limited knowledge of the manga.All in all, this wasn't a bad movie, it just lacked clarity. However, I would like to mention that the 'Teru's song' was just beautiful (I am listening to it now, while writing this mini review 😊). the significance of the dragons.

The story is presented competently, with plot points flowing well from one point to the next. However, there were lots of plot points that were introduced that were never resolved. At the start of the movie, the king is receiving reports of issues throughout the land and dragons fighting. These are basically never brought up again. I understand this movie involves part of the story from a series of books, so my...assumption is that those plot points must be resolved later in the series past where this movie covers. Later in the film light and darkness are brought up and the story begins to lose some of its meaning. It culminates in a battle between the main character, Arren, and an evil wizard, with an ending that is a little unsatisfyingArt: 9/10. Absolutely fantastic. Gorgeous scenery and wonderful character design, especially for the outfits present in the movie.Sound: 8/10. Also very good, great music and very good foley work. Quite nice.Characters: 7/10. The motivations of certain characters are a mystery, as it feels like they don't quite know what they want themselves. It isn't really an issue until the end when some motivations are revealed, but that seem a little lacking. Other characters seemingly have no motivations and are quite cartoonish overall. Not the best, but not the worst either.Overall: 6/10. A fairly enjoyable movie with a disappointing conclusion. I would have liked to see a different final confrontation with the villain, as the one presented was just a big chase scene and then it was over. Still, decently enjoyable. I would recommend you watch if you're interested in worldbuilding and okay with unresolved plot points. assumption is that those plot points must be resolved later in the series past where this movie covers.

It differs from Miyazaki's work due to that it was made by his son Goro Miyazaki. I have read the tales of earthsea by ursla leguin. I enjoyed the books, but they had some flaws that significantly detracted from the plot. For example a important dialogue between the main character and his wife would be 1 page and then there would be 3 pages on an insignificant sea voyage. I don't mind vivid details, but at a point it just gets boring. On the other hand I found that this movie was quite fluid...and moved along well. The art was beautiful with some aspects from other Miyazakis films. Overall I would recomend that you watch this movie. and moved along well.

Just kinda average.A little above average, really.With that said, I do recommend it.The good stuff is enough to make it worth watching, and even if you don't like the plot, there will definitely be something you will really appreciate.

I mean it’s not good but compared to something like Earwig and the Witch, it’s semi-watchable.Now when I first went to watch this movie as an 18 y/o binge watching every Studio Ghibli movie for the first time, I saw that the reviews were not very good. And I was like: ""Huh, that\'s weird. I thought Ghibli only made nothing but bangers. Why are the reviews just...not good for this one?"" And I remember seeing the poster and a little bit of the trailer and I was like: ""Hey, that movie actually looks kinda cool! I like fantasy adventures! And one made by Studio Ghibli? COUNT ME IN!! You know maybe I\'ll see the good in this movie, it can\'t be that bad, right?""But then I watched it, and I became very confused and depressed, saying: ""Oh, now I can see where the bad reviews are coming from."" :(And as of now, I\'ve seen this movie at least three or four times just to see if I was watching this movie correctly. But every time I finished it I kept asking myself: ""Why do I not feel anything while watching this movie? Why do I feel like I get nothing out of it? Why does this movie make me feel so...empty inside?"" And I finally realized after rewatching it again today that I just don\'t care. I don\'t care about this plot. I don\'t care about these characters. I just don\'t care about anything happening in this movie. Maybe it\'s because the movie doesn\'t really give a shit about itself either. And I\'m gonna try to explain why that is and why this movie doesn\'t really work for me and why it makes me...sad.However, to start with the positives, the animation and music are great as usual. Something you would expect from a Studio Ghibli movie except if it\'s Earwig and the Witch. The voice acting for the English dub is pretty solid, you got actors like Timothy Dalton, Mariska Hargitay, and even Willem Dafoe. Although Dafoe kind of mutters and whispers almost every line in this movie, we\'ll get to that later. They’re some decent scenes, I guess. I kinda like the scene where Sparrowhawk stops Arren from killing him and they have a little heart to heart with one another. I think this scene would\'ve been very effective until you realize that you don\'t care about anything happening in this movie. I think the best scene in the movie though, which you probably have seen on the posters and in the trailers, is the moment at the end where Arren goes to hug the dragon while the sun is rising. I mean visually it’s a very powerful moment and it\'s framed very well. And I think the theme of life being the greatest gift of all could\'ve been compelling enough to run the story, but it\'s unfortunately not conveyed in the best possible way but it’s at least...THERE. As for the things I don’t like, we have…basically everything else in the movie.I think one of my biggest issues with this movie is that as painfully generic as this movie might be, I think there was SOMETHING going for it. Some sort of potential that it had cooking up. I think the first half of the movie isn’t all that bad. I think they set the stage in a somewhat engaging way to me. The pieces of the puzzle are there, but they\'re just NEVER put together throughout the course of the movie. Like whatever momentum this movie might have had is completely dissipated by the second act. It’s really one of those movies that only goes downhill the longer it drags on.I did say that the animation and music were great, but that\'s if you just turn your brain off. If you really think about it, the beautiful animation and epic music feels more like it\'s trying to distract you than captivate you. This is very much a style over substance movie and it\'s even worse with the dull as ditchwater story that it\'s attempting to offer. For the first half of this movie, it feels like it\'s setting things up that will come into play later. But the elements that are introduced are never followed through in a satisfying way at all, and thus a lot of potential is wasted.For example, they introduce dragons at the beginning of the movie and you think: “Okay, dragons are gonna play a key part in the story right?” Except the dragons don’t do shit in this movie, in fact, we don’t even see another one until the climax where there\'s one just conveniently available to our heroes, which by then why even have them in the movie? If you cut them out of the film it wouldn’t really change anything at all. Also Arren, the main protagonist, he kinda sucks unfortunately. For the majority of the movie, he’s just like: “Woe is me, I’m depressed, I feel suicidal and sad.” Not to make fun of those kinds of people, but It’s really hard to care about him when he just says that most of the time. His inner conflict could\'ve been interesting and tied into the theme of the movie quite nicely, but it\'s really not. He\'s such a hard character to decipher and the movie doesn\'t seem interested in exploring why he murdered his father or if he has doubts about his decision.It also doesn\'t help that he doesn\'t have any fucking goals or motivations. You\'d think that would be kind of important for your main character, in any story for that matter?! It doesn\'t even have to be complicated. For example, what\'s Chihiro\'s goal in Spirited Away? Well she wants to save her family and turn them back into humans because they got turned into pigs at the beginning of the movie. What\'s Mahito\'s goal in The Boy and the Heron? Well he wants to save his new mother from the other world. Simple as that. What\'s Arren\'s goal in Tales From Earthsea? Uh, he wants to run away from home. Which we see at the beginning of the movie, but where is he running off to exactly? Is he just gonna run away forever? Well I hope you\'re willing to die with these questions in your head, because this movie is not interested in telling you why any of these things are happening!!! Oh yeah and if you aren\'t aware, Arren is gonna be a very passive hero, which means he\'s not gonna be the one to advance the plot by his own personal actions. And to top it off, some of his dialogue to me just sounds like that one emo kid from high school that people couldn’t take seriously, aka it\'s kinda cringy and painful.And the worst part is that his true problem is not even revealed until the third half of the movie. Which first of all isn’t explained in the best way, and secondly by that point I could give less of a fuck. How about explaining what Arren’s problem is in the first half of the movie? That way we as the audience can have a better understanding of who he is and we can easily grow and learn with him throughout his journey. But the story and the way it\'s told is just not as compelling as it could be and the characters are super underdeveloped. I mean the characters are basically generic fantasy archetypes. Which could\'ve been fine, except they don’t give them any traits or aspects that stand out or are unique from the generic features. And this is especially apparent with the main villain, Lord Cob. Oh god, where do I even begin with this guy?I love Willem Dafoe but his character is just-laughable. Like I said before he mutters and whispers almost every line in this movie. And his evil plan is that he wants to live forever or something like that-I don\'t care it’s just so fucking dumb. Another big problem with this movie is that Earthsea, the world itself, isn’t really explored that much. Like this is no Middle Earth that\'s for sure. It’s so boring and uninteresting, which is like the exact opposite of the worlds in previous Ghibli movies.Like they explain that there’s a virus going around the land, but we never see anyone affected by it. I dare you to find someone in this movie who\'s affected by this ""virus,"" you can\'t. There’s this one scene where Arren is offered some drugs by this creepy guy, and after Sparrowhawk, who’s like the Gandalf of this movie, drives him away, he shows Arren the effects of these drugs by showing the people who are fucked up from it. Besides the slaves that we also see earlier in the film, this is the only scene in the movie where we see other people suffering, and it has nothing to do with the virus. So I’m not really sure why there’s a virus in this movie, it’s just there to add tension, I guess?Here’s an idea, how about Arren is the one who has the virus and he’s slowly dying from it. So he kills his father and runs away from home in fear that he might contaminate someone else, and he’s also an ignorant and immature kid. He then meets Lord Cob who tells him he can live forever since he has like a magical potion that can cure the virus, but it turns out that he’s only using it for his own selfish desires and Arren is like a pawn to him or something. And then Therru gives Arren the talk that living is the most important gift of all since Arren is ready to die from the virus. So they defeat Lord Cob, Arren uses some of the cure on himself, and then he plans to bring the cure back to his hometown and to stand trial for his crimes. He also hopes that they can multiply the cure in some way.Yeah that plot is pretty flawed as well, I mean I’m no screenwriter or anything like that and I\'ll admit that my idea is inspired by Princess Mononoke, but I\'ll just be confident and say that my story sounds way more engaging than the plot of this movie. And speaking of plot, this movie is a goddamn chore to get through, especially when the second act kicks in. This movie feels like it\'s constantly wasting its time or feeling bored of itself. It\'s so sluggishly paced, until the climax where it feels like the movie is trying to get itself over with.But then I also feel like there are scenes just missing in this movie. There’s this moment where Arren finds the female protagonist Therru singing this song. Before all this though, there’s this moment where Therru just hates Arren, she literally tells him that she hates people who discard life. A few moments later, Arren catches Therru singing this song which by the way this scene goes on for way too fucking long. So then FINALLY after she’s really done singing she turns around to see Arren, and then it cuts to them on this rock sitting next to each other watching the sunset, and I was like: “Wait what?” How did we get to this point? Maybe it’s just me but shouldn’t there be a scene in between these two moments of them reconciling with one another? Remember Therru hates Arren, they can’t just be cool with each other now, right? Instead, it’s like: “Oh you heard my private song? Okay, we’re friends now!” Although the moment where they are talking about their problems while watching the sunset is an alright scene I guess? But at this point I\'m really fishing for things to like because there\'s just not much to engage me in what\'s happening.Tales from Earthsea is actually based on a book series that came out around the time Lord of the Rings and Narnia were popular, which I didn’t know about. And for this movie, instead of following a certain book, they took ideas from each book and kinda made it its own movie. Which isn’t a bad idea, but it is kind of confusing when they mention events that happened off-screen and we’re supposed to know what that is. Unless you read the books like a fucking nerd.I think this film would really benefit from having an extended version. Like having more scenes of character development, more scenes of world-building, more scenes of literally anything with substance. But despite all this, I still don’t completely despise this movie. But I can\'t say I like it. I mean it\'s far away from being one of the worst animated movies ever made but it\'s just so underwhelming. There\'s too many bland characters, too many underdeveloped ideas, too many forgettable moments and that\'s this movie\'s greatest sin: so much of it is forgettable. There are some decent aspects here if I\'d venture to guess, but they\'re not so great that they make me think of the other Ghibli movies that have come before and after. And they are so few and far between throughout the nearly two hour runtime that it becomes harder and harder to find anything good about it if there even was anything good about it. And that\'s what makes this movie so disappointing to me, because it looks beautiful and sounds amazing but it means absolutely nothing, so the movie fails when I think it could\'ve been so much more. But unlike any other Ghibli movie, this one really fascinates me.Because you have to remember at this point in the studio’s life they were at the top of their game, they were making nothing but classics for the most part. And now they just kind of stumble with this mediocre movie. Maybe it was a bad direction, I mean Hayao Miyazaki’s son, Goro Miyazaki directed this movie and he was probably very inexperienced at the time and wasn’t ready to make this kind of movie. If he was given more guidance and training I think this movie would have come out a lot better. But he would later go on to direct Earwig and the Witch so that happened. Now if I was 12 y/o, I would\'ve loved this movie, I would\'ve had no problems with it, but since I first watched this movie as a grown ass man my eyes can unfortunately see through this movie\'s bullshit. If I try to turn my brain off and look at this movie as a generic and inoffensive fantasy flick, then maybe I\'d accept it a little more, but I still think it does a really bad job world building and developing characters. But to end this review on a high note, the best compliment I will ever give this movie is that it is a masterpiece compared to Earwig and the Witch.ORIGINALLY REVIEWED ON 03/05/2023 not good for this one?""

There\'s too many bland characters, too many underdeveloped ideas, too many forgettable moments and that\'s this movie\'s greatest sin: so much of it is forgettable. There are some decent aspects here if I\'d venture to guess, but they\'re not so great that they make me think of the other Ghibli movies that have come before and after. And they are so few and far between throughout the nearly two hour runtime that it becomes harder and harder to find anything good about it if there even was anything good about it. And that\'s what makes this movie so disappointing to me, because it looks beautiful and sounds amazing but it means absolutely nothing, so the movie fails when I think it could\'ve been so much more. But unlike any other Ghibli movie, this one really fascinates me.Because you have to remember at this point in the studio’s life they were at the top of their game, they were making nothing but classics for the most part. And now they just kind of stumble with this mediocre movie. Maybe it was a bad direction, I mean Hayao Miyazaki’s son, Goro Miyazaki directed this movie and he was probably very inexperienced at the time and wasn’t ready to make this kind of movie. If he was given more guidance and training I think this movie would have come out a lot better. But he would later go on to direct Earwig and the Witch so that happened. Now if I was 12 y/o, I would\'ve loved this movie, I would\'ve had no problems with it, but since I first watched this movie as a grown ass man my eyes can unfortunately see through this movie\'s bullshit. If I try to turn my brain off and look at this movie as a generic and inoffensive fantasy flick, then maybe I\'d accept it a little more, but I still think it does a really bad job world building and developing characters. But to end this review on a high note, the best compliment I will ever give this movie is that it is a masterpiece compared to Earwig and the Witch.ORIGINALLY REVIEWED ON 03/05/2023', ""It was the worst anime I've ever seen, and I watched Bible Black (also not recommended for many reasons, even if you're just horny). At least in BB the creators knew what they wanted to do. Otherwise there was no plan or idea for this movie other than what they already had from the book.Character sucks, story sucks, character's designs most of them sucks, main villain sucks. At least the backgrounds where nice but it's only good things in this movie. Atmosphere sucks. I love fantasy and they ruined it.I do not recommend, even if you had to choose between watching it or watching...the paint dry on the wall the paint dry on the wall""]"
IS: Infinite Stratos Encore - Koi ni Kogareru Rokujuusou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10794/IS__Infinite_Stratos_Encore_-_Koi_ni_Kogareru_Rokujuusou,"[""Story - 8The story takes place after the events of the original series. It's pretty much a slice of life, romance, episode, completely separate from the Academy. Ichika is home alone and his lady friends decide to take this chance to stop by at his house. Just when you think it's over when you hear Super Stream begin to play in the back ground, it picks right back up for a few minutes of Ichika and Houki spending time together at a festival. It wraps up very nicely and the part I hated most was when I realized that I had finished the whole damn...thing already.Art - 8I've said many times before, the art in IS is above average. If there's anything important about a harem anime it's the art, and making sure you are visually attracted by a character before you're even further ensnared by their stereotypical but irresistibly moe qualities.They have done this outstandingly well, which other cheap animes fail to do, besmirching the reputation of good Harem animes everywhere. Everything was up to shape, nothing to complain and plenty to nod in approval at.The female characters, their clothing, movement, bodies, absolutely delicious to say the least.Sound - 8The fact that I have something to say automatically calls for a high rating. I finally got to hear Kana (voice for Char) do that shy, nervous, moe voice I always wanted.That in itself was a treat. Voice acting was faultless.Character - 8Awesome. A harem done right. I've seen it before, but that only makes it better by the fact that I've seen it fail countless times before. I just want Ichika to decide on someone already.Enjoyment - 9The highlight was towards the second part of the OVA when Houki takes a bath and you get to ignore the subs and stare at her nipple for a few heavenly seconds. GODDAMN THAT WAS AWESOME.Overall - 9Obviously I'm someone who knows how to enjoy a well done Harem anime without letting the unoriginality get to me.If you loved or liked the anime, you'll sure as well like or love this OVA. thing already.Art - 8I've said many times before, the art in IS is above average.

There is of course a romance genre added into the mix even though it is the chiquita (referring to Houki) who initiates it and there is also a one off ecchi  for Houki that is. So for the story I\'ll give it a...""Good"" number 7, since I like that the OVA is divided into 2 parts, one part is all about Ichka and his harem\'s never ending competition for his affection and the 2nd part is all about Houki finally having Ichika all to herself, but not without some competition from another party. But, I was kinda hoping that Houki and Ichka should have gone forth with the kiss since in the last episode, the 2 (Ichka and Houki) were about to kiss when other parties intervene. Art, well since it is still the same art being use in creating both the original and the OVA, I\'d say that a ""Mediocre"" number 5 will do and for the sound, I would have given it a 5 but since there is a 2nd ending theme in the OVA I\'d decide that a ""Fair"" number 6 is ok.Characters: Good 7.Well, most of the characters from the previous anime were still there, even though that this OVA is more on Ichika and Houki they still deserve such rating. By the way about Ichka\'s eldest sister Chifuyu, I kinda wonder if she also has some brother complex with Ichka or is she lesbian, eh, who cares?Enjoyment and Overall : Good 7.All, I can say is that this 1 off OVA is ""ALL GOOD,"" whether there will be a season 2 or not, it is nice that Houki was able to have Ichika in the end, by the way I no longer bother to go through the manga, co\'z for me I\'m only interested to see the 2 together even if Ichka is a moron about Houki\'s feelings for him and that\'s the reason for my rating.

All throughout the show we see Ichika's relationship evolve with the girls specifically Houki. At the end of the IS we see Ichika and Houki about to kiss but then they are interrupted by the group. Overall as viewers we are pretty confident that he would choose Houki as is implied. In the OVA IS: encore our hypotheses are backed up by the fact that he gives Houki special attention.Please enjoy the review.--------------Down To the point--------------Story - 7The story takes place after the events of the original...series. It's pretty much a chill slice of life episode taking place just outside the perimeter of the school.Nothing too terrific happens in it tho. Ichika is at home by himself when one by one each of the girls arrive at his place hooping to get a chance to talk to him all alone.He is given a hance to develop his relationship with Houki. My main  criticism for the episode is that it feels as if it ends too quickly.Art - 8As for the art in IS is it is definitely  above average. The art is exactly the same as from the previous IS.It is crisp and clean which in turn leads to visually attractive characters. Their is nothing to really complain about everything is done very well. Specifically movement,dubbing of words, and backrounds ( Trees, mountains, and water) Just to name a few.Sound - 7The music was good but not outstanding. We were finally able to  hear Kana sing which was a treat. Her voice is different than the previous artist that did the op and end of IS.The voice acting was top notch which is to be expected from a fairly high budget anime. But it was still a treat to hear.Character - 7Most of the characters don’t change much with the exception of Houki. She finally was able to overcome her fears of telling Ichika her feelings. Which was definitely a plus. But again the characters did not develop much which is to be expected from a single episode OVA.Enjoyment - 8The enjoyment was definetly their. You are presented a slice of life style episode were the characters lay back and enjoy life. The cooking scenes added burts of excitment into the episde.It was enjoyable to see everyone just living, the girls doing what girls do and Ichika being his usual lively self.Overall - 7All in all I consider this to be a well done harem anime although their are some unoriginal ideas the series took those ideas and refreshed them and made them better. The best part of this series would have to be the art and story. Which are shown here in the OVA. Lastly it was nice and refreshing to see Ichika and the girls chasing him and having a good time competing for Ichika's attention._ _  _ _ _ _  Final Comment _ _ _ _ _ _If you enjoyed the first IS or you are a fan of Houki be sure to toon in to the OVA IS: Infinite Stratos Encore: Koi ni Kogareru Sextet.

Afterwards Cecilia, and then the rest of the girls show up. Some slice of life with a small amount of comedy stirs up in the house with all the girls involved. The second half of this OVA ends up with some happy moments involving Ichika and one particular girl out of the five (watch to find out) at a festival. I highly recommend watching this straight after season 1 and...not skip to season 2. not skip to season 2.', ""After the events of season 1 of Infinite Stratos, we get this fun little detour that delves into the summer vacation of Ichika and his friends. Do they have any fun? Did I have any fun? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?StoryThe adventures of the IS team continue in this fun little OVA that depicts all the girls in Ichika's harem dropping in unannounced in his house for a summer visit; which of course, is just a recipe for romantic comedic hijinx. Aside from that, though, nothing major actually happens here and, aside from a single partial deployment, the titular weapon itself...doesn't even make an appearance. That said, not everything needs to a world-shaking event in a story, so I'm glad we get to see the characters relax, have fun and not having to fight for their lives... for once. (6/10)CharactersThe characters are their usual selves from season 1 and, aside from Houki, they don't experience any major development here. That said, it's fun watching the characters bounce off each other and engage in witty banter because it shows how close they have become. Even though they are rivals for Ichika's attention, they still acknowledge each other as friends, and that's always a positive in stories where you are supposed to care about the characters.The character who does evolve in this OVA is Houki, but to be fair, the development is nothing major. She just thinks about Ichika and how different her life could have been had the IS never been invented and she could stay and live with him. Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing because short stories like this one gives us a window in the characters' minds and allow us to feel for them and the situations they're in. (8/10)ArtSince the titular weapons see virtually no use in this short story, the show can use its budget more conservatively and focus more on the actions of the characters. The actions are more fluid and the close-ups to the characters faces are more detailed. I myself enjoyed Houki's dance near the end of the OVA. (8/10)SoundThe entire cast of season 1 returns to voice the characters present in this OVA, but the standout performances has to be from Monica Rial (Houki), as the OVA allows us to see the more vulnerable and human side of Houki; something that we only saw bits and pieces of in season 1. We also get a nice new ED song by Youko Hikasa, Houki's Japanese VA. (8/10)ConclusionDoes this OVA continue the story of Infinite Stratos in any meaningful way? No. Should you still watch it? Yes! Why? Because of the good character moments and the good development of the relationship between Houki and Ichika. If you ask me, character writing should take priority over narrative progression, even when, in theory, any good story should have a healthy balance between both; but this OVA did the right thing by prioritizing the characters over the story because are the vehicles in which we experience the events of the story. The story itself won't matter if it doesn't have characters we grow to care for and sympathize with. I've said that before and I'm sure I'll say it again. (7/10) doesn't even make an appearance.

LOVE! LOVE! as an event anime, something we rarely see exported out of Japan. Originally screened at select theatres in August 2017, this just barely feature length final episode feels made for being watched in a room full of fellow LOVErs who know the songs, can quote the catch phrases & are probably just a wee bit drunk.But chances are you're not in a packed Japanese theatre, but sat at home, alone; hoping for one final adventure with the Battle Lovers. Does LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! provide this? Yes, but YMMV (oh &...it's definitely not the place to start for newcomers).Because to reach the feature length needed to get theatrical screenings, it's fair to say they cheated a bit. Opening with the Battle Lovers playing hack sack & then chatting in the Kurotama bathhouse, it looks as though their final episode will be spent mostly soaking in the tub while shooting the breeze.Which would be fine, if what they talked about weren't the events of the previous two seasons. As the cast slowly gather at the bath, they reminisce about how they first met, then proceed to sing all (& I mean all) of their character songs one after the other. It is, as En glibly remarks, “that kind of episode,” consisting almost entirely of recycled footage & generally feeling like a glorified recap episode. Some of the new banter is fun, but unless you really like looped animations or were hoping for a karaoke session, it's bit of a tough watch.But just as frustration might be about to boil over, the real episode begins. It's Springtime for Hit...I mean Binan High School, & that means it's graduation day for everyone in the Earth Defence Club but Yumoto. Naturally, things don't go smoothly, as Zundar & Dadacha create one last monster, which the VEPPers, Conquest Club & Earth Defence Club must team up to defeat – though not in the usual way. Then it's on to the goodbyes, as the graduation ceremony finishes & Wombat returns to his home planet – not dying on the way.It's not the best episode of the series, but as a final goodbye to our favourite magical boys it's about as good as one could have expected, the only disappointments coming from PonyCam (who want you to know it's their 50th anniversary) not stumping up for a lavish production & the aforementioned slow, sing-along start.But maybe you do know the songs. Or maybe you have a group of LOVErs who can gather with optional but recommended alcohol to see the boys off with a sing song. If that's the case, you will have a very good time with LOVE! LOVE!

However, this OVA didn't really bring me to the point of tears, which was baffling for me. Usually, anything related to graduation in animes usually makes me cry. I'm one of the stupid people that's cried watching Winnie the Pooh.Regardless of the fact that it didn't even bring me close to tears, this OVA made me sad, and mostly in a good way.The story was pretty good. The nice recap at the beginning was cute, especially with the songs (which I will talk about later). I also really loved the real 'episode' later with...Yumoto's reluctance towards his senpais' graduation and a real powerful monster for once.The art, as always, was pretty, neat, and nice to look at. No complaints there! The illustrations during the end credits were also gorgeous.Now the song-- this is where the songs come in. Each characters has a 'theme song' during which they recount some awesome shots of themselves over the past two seasons with hilarious lyrics to back it up. All the songs were relatable and made me laugh, making the first half of this OVA worth it, even if it did drag on a little bit. En's was hands-down the best one.The characters weren't really developed here, but we got to see more feelings than we usually do with this show, which was pretty nice. We also got a little bit of development for Yumoto, though as the protagonist, the other characters probably needed more than he did.Overall, I enjoyed this way too much.I would recommend this if you: liked either of the first two seasons, like a little closing episode, like gag songsI would NOT recommend this if you: didn't like the first two seasonsHave a great day everyone!

It felt as if I was just watching an ad for the character soundtrack. I felt there were a few areas that still were left open which is never good for anything that has a ""graduation"" in it as a graduation is supposed to leave a note of finality leading to new beginnings. Also knowing the next season doesn\'t have the same protagonists doesn\'t offer much hope on that front. I was so angry by...the obvious clip recap in the beginning and very obvious animation loops that after the 30 min recap clip show was done and we finally get to something I found it rushed. after all there was only 26 mins left. Like I said I did enjoy the humor in the first 2 seasons, and I would recommend those. But this I would only recommend to those who are looking to see AMV\'s made by the series.

After watching the ones before (100 episodes, I dare you to do it), you will understand why these three episodes are essential and just a good wrapup for people who have waited for ages for their Battle Spirits salvation.I would like to note that when watching this series, keep in mind that it is imitating the style FROM 2010, meaning that there will be some things that you should...judge with a 2010 mindset. Honestly, watching it now, I still think this style is already better than most modern creations.Finally, I would like to add a point which I really am sad to say is how I don't think that it manages to give closure, it depends on how you view it as it does put a great end to the whole storyline, but some things aren't exactly cleaned up properly I would say, it really depends on what kind of ending you want, as everyone has different expectations for closure.

I can guarantee that the enjoyment of someone who hasn't seen the 2 prior series would be limited.After having watched Dan and Brave, I heard of Saga Brave, and wondered how they could add to the story. Well, this was a perfect closure for the series. It revisits the most important characters from Dan and Brave, and how they adapted to society after the events of those series.As a series all it's own, it still has it's own plot. It's not very...developped, as expected for 3 episodes of 20 minutes, which revisit prior characters, and include a card game in each. But it serves it's purpose well, and ties everything together nicely. If plot=story, I'd give it a 7.I can't comment much on art or music, but I can say that animation wasn't bad at all, and that the soundtrack didn't stand out much. I'd give 9 for animation and 8 for sound, but anyone could argue that they deserve somewhere between 5 and 8, and I wouldn't disagree.The new characters don't do much, and the older character don't develop much. However, since there's a time skip between Brave and Saga Brave, we see how they changed to live in the new society. If this was to review the characters as established in the previous series, I'd give between 7 and 8. But with what Saga explores, I give a 10.I'm rating a 10 out of enjoyment.

Aishen Qiaokeli-ing...,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32323/Aishen_Qiaokeli-ing,"[""LITERALLY A CHINESE CARTOON!Yet, surprisingly not terrible.  In fact, some of the animation (see the opening) is pretty damn good.  Definitely a different animating style than most anime--if you can even call it that--and you can see the resemblance to other Chinese children's animated series (stuff like RotTK or Journey to the West).Look, it's a harem--if you're coming in expecting anything besides unrealistic love stories and walking tropes, you have only yourself to blame when you leave disappointed.  As far as harems go, this one's above average in my opinion.  The general premise itself would be a mild spoiler for episode...1, so I'd rather not reveal it here.  What you get is a bunch of girls, one guy, and some ecchi fun.  Each episode is only 10-12 minutes long, and the overall storyline is therefore incredibly fast paced.  The Chinese voice acting is pretty decent (with the exception of the main girl... I personally can't stand squeaky female VAs).  The OST is nothing spectacular but definitely works.  Art quality is inconsistent but can sometimes look very good. The animation is on par with what you would expect most romcom harems to have.  Some bits are surprisingly well animated, though the studio isn't particularly adept at hiding the low-budget backgrounds and effects.Regardless, I found the hour or two I spent watching all the available episodes (6 at the time of writing this) to be very enjoyable.  It has good humor, if a little cliche, and a refreshingly fast-paced harem plot.  There's also the other plot that it has a lot of, though that's what we're here for to begin with....right?Solid 7/10 ecchi harem.  You can catch up in an hour or two, and there's some novelty in the fact that it's Chinese-produced. 1, so I'd rather not reveal it here.

But this dull life suits me, since I hate getting into troublesome situations. If I could stay like this forever, that would be the best."" -Jiang HaoOriginally, I did my review on Cupid\'s Chocolates on my old account son714, but I lost the account information.  Whenever somebody asks me ""hey do you watch anime?"" Immediately the thing that comes to mind would be a Japanese style drawing along with Japanese voice actors. This Chinese cartoon definitely caught me by surprise. Without any spoilers I have presented my personal opinion on this series as of right now.Story:...The story is pretty much similar to how all harems and romantic comedies are. Most harems either center around a loner or an average everyday student who does something and suddenly finds himself surrounded by a bunch of pretty girls. In this case it would be the ""average everyday student.""  The plot in this series is very fast paced and extremely hilarious. It had me laughing out loud in a lot of their sequences. The series does a very good job in allowing the audience to understand the story despite being roughly 15 minutes long for an episode.8/10Art: Anime is a Japanese style animation. It is very interesting to see how far anime has gotten throughout the years. In my opinion, the artwork has gotten alot better over the years. For Aishen Qiaokeli-ing or Cupid\'s Chocolates, I would say that the artwork is mirrored to have it feel like an anime type artwork. But I had to say that the artwork in this series is very well done. The colors were on point and it didn\'t feel distracting at all to the very least. It also feels great to know that anime has made an impact worldwide.10/10Sound: As mentioned this is a Chinese cartoon. Initially when I watched this series the voice acting for the characters sounded very strange for me. As I progressed in the series I didn\'t find their voices strange rather I didn\'t come mind it as much. For the opening theme, it is very well done despite being a non lyrical theme. In my opinion, it captures the plot and the mood of the series.  An opening theme without singing without singing was done extremely well.9/10Character: One of the biggest downfalls and complaints of bad animes would be the how the characters fit with the storyline. This would also include their overall personalities throughout the series. In this case however, I actually enjoyed every single character. Despite the main character being the overused loner student in typical harems, the other character were very entertaining. The reason for this being is that after the main character sets in motion the plot, each character in this series has their own desires and backstories. As mentioned before, the episodes are roughly 15 minutes long, so how can they do all of this in such a short time? The series does a fantastic job of clearing their desires and backstories in a non-overwhelming way. Each episode presents the main character tackles each issue in his own way making it very satisfying until the very end.  Not to mention also that the main character isn\'t as dull and ""numb to love"" as other harem characters are.10/10My Opinion: I thoroughly enjoyed this Chinese cartoon. The artwork is great definitely has obvious signs of influence from Japanese anime artwork, the characters are well done, the sound and openings perfectly capture the mood in each episode. All of these points contributed into making this rather overused harem genre into a very satisfying series so far. Also this anime makes it enjoyable for the viewer because it constantly makes us imagine who the main character will eventually fall for. I believe he will fall for the first girl he met, but that is just a speculation at this moment. It also makes me genuinely happy to know that anime is spreading and appreciated worldwide. This cartoon is a great example of that. Just realized I\'m also submitting this review on Valentines day, this cartoon is great for that occasion! Oh and also I\'m rooting for Xia Zitong!Thank you for reading my review, I really appreciate it guys.Final Score: 9/10 The story is pretty much similar to how all harems and romantic comedies are.

It feels like a cheap knock off and the characters voice sounds awkward. The plots pretty bad. I know its harem genre and all but this anime doesn't have any charm to it which leaves you on a cliff hanger making you anxiously wait for the next episode. However, like I said previously the art style is that of a high quality which leaves you a reason to watch it. Overall if you really enjoy harem series with good drawing I'd recommend it to you "", ""There's nothing wrong with shows that are silly or absurd yet have their strong points and somehow manage to keep the audience entertained. I'm a fan of ecchi harems myself and am able to enjoy even really average shows. However, Aishen Qiaokeli-ing, aka Cupid's Chocolates, is hopeless in my eyes.The story revolves around Haoyi and his harem, which consists of girls that, just like him, ate some cursed chocolates. This caused them not only to be in love with a dull and idiotic guy but also made them believe they're married to or even pregnant with him. So Haoyi's job is to help the girls...and fulfill their wishes in order to lift the spell.It didn't have to be this bad. If you look at the recommendations section, you can see people comparing this show to Kami nomi, where the main character also has to help the heroines with their problems and magic is apparent there too. Kami nomi is however a well written, clever and interesting anime that actually makes sense. Cupid's chocolates is a show filled with absurdity, unfunny gags and irrational characters. It's just dumb and offensive.The only good things about this cartoon is its art. The animation is definitely above average and the heroines look simply beautiful. Their character designs are detailed and can be only described as a real eye-candy.I have to say not all the heroines are that bad, I actually liked two of them - the pink rich girl and the crazy yandere. Mei Tata is quite cute as well. Not that they have much of personality - I'm probably just fond of their looks.The soundtrack isn't anything outstanding but it's not bad either.What's worth noticing is the fact that it is literally a chinese cartoon. So the voice acting may sound a bit strange at first but I got used to it quickly and I actually found it refreshing to hear the characters speak Chinese.All in all, Cupid's chocolates is far from being good. It's not even average. It doesn't offer you anything apart from cute heroines and good animation. Even if you tend to like silly harem shows, I recommend you to stay away from this one. Watching Cupid's chocolates only satisfied my eyes and left me with a feeling of having wasted my time, because what I just saw can't be even called mindless fun. No fun at all. and fulfill their wishes in order to lift the spell.It didn't have to be this bad.

It's basically one of those generic harem anime with a LOT OF FAN SERVICE. Personally, I love fan service and I totally love the ecchi genre. (Yay, boobies!)This particular series starts off with a lot of comedic scenes and cliches. While gearing off towards the end, there's an almost steep hill of the story which will immediately come to your attention. It has a great conclusion (not so conclusion because apparently there's a second season) to it in which you'd actually feel satisfied...with watching a generic series. The story is good enough to put a tear or two in your eyes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The characters are very likable, and the development is clearly evident. The music is kind of a letdown considering that they could've put much effort in composing, nonetheless I gave it a 7. (I wish they could've at least put in some vocals in that.) The mob characters are kinda dull for the eyes due to the fact that they were all animated but not so much as colored correctly.Other than these stated, I witnessed no other issues.To sum it all up, I rate it 8 out of 10! It's a good watch, trust me! with watching a generic series.

And the Male Protagonist is not the type of guy who goes nosebleed and shit towards the girls, hes not one of those common Harem Male Protagonist whos clueless and goes nosebleed everytime he gets close to a girl. Main Male knows what hes doing and is not a pussy.Sound was good, but the opening didn't have any vocals but it's pretty much good.Story: The story is fast paced, things happen very fast but thats what makes this anime...not boring and enjoyable. not boring and enjoyable."", '*Well turn of your brain,relax and you will enjoy it!Chinese Voice Actors Sucks tho!*This one will be a small review since there isn\'t many things to write.Basically the story is as simple as  ""1+1=potato"". No need to think of anything more.It has plenty of plot holes and unreasonable things, but seriously what did you expect from an Ecchi/Harem + Com/Rom Production??Further more its filled with cliche moments. So i cannot say there is anything new i saw. Maybe 2~3 gags that were original and really well played.Actually for an ONA show the art is above average and that\'s something one can find praiseworthy. Also...what found really interesting is that the cloths are realistically designed. What do i mean? Well the cloths aren\'t attached to the Characters model and you can see cracks and stuff like that. Considering its nature that a thing one deserve to give Bonus points to the show!!The sounds are plain i guess. Nothing special worth mentioning or shockingly good. The OP is a voiceless track and i consider that a good idea since each viewer can imagine his own lyrics. Its Catchy, not even bad!The Characters is unimaginable plain,cute and likable. Tho the author try to add some shocking background in order to add more plot in his work but imo that counts as ""Had no other way of making something smart"" and in general kinda bad. (not totally bad tho)One could simply call the romance factor over dramatic, vexing and stupid in general,but then again what did you expect from such a show?----------------------Personal Thoughts and Weaknesses----------------------------You will get Laughs and Cringe out of this most of the time. A pretty standard mixture of feelings.This show overuses memes and its unrealistic to the points there is no injuries. It maybe comedy and ridiculous but still when someone is getting beat up, i don\'t expect him to be scratchless in the next 5 seconds or even the next scene.Its your average comedy, with bullshit ecchi romance but in Chinese and that make it quiet better.This show is quiet fast paced. Meaning that it goes from one shit on the other, skips weeks for its plot advance and in general kinda plain if you exclude again the Chinese Language. Last but not least, IT TRIED TO ADD SOME DRAMA! AND IT WAS DESPICABLY AWEFUL! (yea it shocked me so bad, i don\'t want to remember it...)From my point of view, it was as much fun as cringe. That doesn\'t necessarily qualifies it as bad. It was laughable and likable. Its ecchi not so much and comedy good. The translator played an important role and most likely made that show at least 2 times better with the absurd Lenny faces it added and bad puns!Around 3 hours relaxing spent and facepalming a lot.

I feel that this show isn\'t for you if you want pointless ecchi, but the jokes are sometimes pretty funny and it is interesting seeing references to other anime, as well as the chinese take on the medium. If you liked the premise of the world god only knows, then this show is probably for you. The comedy is good, the romance is good and the...plot behind it is good as well. Also, I want to point out, this show wizzes past - where in a typical TV series may take 3 or 4 20 minute episodes to cover each girl\'s arc, this show manages it in 3 10 minute episodes, and manages not to feel rushed. This show, is surprisingly, at least for me, on my watchlist for this season.TL;DRThis show is surprisingly good. If you\'ve ever liked a romance comedy before just watch it. If it doesn\'t work out, then oh well. plot behind it is good as well.

Personally I thought that it was still a bit bland, but it wasn't as bad as others.Art- I liked the character designs and how colorful the show was. But it lacked in a unique style and any mob personalization. Good overall.sound- It was interesting to hear Chinese in anime as opposed to Japanese, but the use of music and voice actors were all really mediocre.Character- pretty interesting character idea's. It felt like it was kind of shallow, but eh. It wasn't horrible.Enjoyment-...This was my first Chinese anime so I took some extra enjoyment from that.

But don\'t let that make or break your decision to watch this anime.  However, as for me, it definitely made my decision because I could tell someone honestly that I was just ""watching some of my chinese aneemay"".  However, it\'s really not as bad as it sounds because chinese are known for low-quality stuff or knock-offs and to be honest this is a legitimate show in its own right.The story is a...lot like The World God Only Knows.  The approach is different, but still, a love diety (in this case, a cupid of sorts) watches and aids the MC in his endeavors with the many girls that fall in love with him.  Each time he resolves the situation, they lose the memories of their romance.  However, the memories they lose aren\'t the memories made with the MC, as those are real.  The thing is that after they all share a cake with Haoyi, memories become implanted in their minds that leads to them feeling deep love for him rather than just being infatuated.  Its THESE memories which are problematic because Haoyi has no idea what they\'re talking about and they bring it up in front of people.  So, to correct that, he cures their curses by locking in the romance, and then the fake memories go away though they still may be left with love for him.The art is phenomenal, I must say.  It\'s really smooth, bright, and so very cute and emotive.  I love that about this series.  Animation is seamless and well-done.The characters are somewhat typical.  You have your very sweet, considerate deredere who would probably still love you even if you raped her dog.  She knows you must have had a real good reason to do so.  Then you have the tsundere athletic type.  In this case, the tsundere is a bit interesting because she\'s not so unbelievable as a character.  She\'s disciplinary somewhat, but not outright hateful and stone-hearted yet somehow turns really dere for no apparent reason.  Then you have your yandere.  It\'s pretty much like that.  My favorite is Zitong (the deredere)As far as enjoyment goes, I have to say its been pretty funny actually.  Theres a bit more to it than it just being ""cute"" and having ""cute"" be considered ""comedy"".  There is legitimate comedy in there.  Not just situational comedy, either, but actual jokes.  Being that the ""bar"" for romcom anime is set very low for comedy, I am impressed that they actually went above it.Sound was alright, too.  However, sometimes I could hear a bit of echoing in the voices.  I was confused when this happened because I thought maybe they were doing a flashback but I was wrong.Overall, I give it a 7 lot like The World God Only Knows.

Then you have the tsundere athletic type.  In this case, the tsundere is a bit interesting because she\'s not so unbelievable as a character.  She\'s disciplinary somewhat, but not outright hateful and stone-hearted yet somehow turns really dere for no apparent reason.  Then you have your yandere.  It\'s pretty much like that.  My favorite is Zitong (the deredere)As far as enjoyment goes, I have to say its been pretty funny actually.  Theres a bit more to it than it just being ""cute"" and having ""cute"" be considered ""comedy"".  There is legitimate comedy in there.  Not just situational comedy, either, but actual jokes.  Being that the ""bar"" for romcom anime is set very low for comedy, I am impressed that they actually went above it.Sound was alright, too.  However, sometimes I could hear a bit of echoing in the voices.  I was confused when this happened because I thought maybe they were doing a flashback but I was wrong.Overall, I give it a 7', ""I HONESTLY DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING FROM THIS....I can't Speak nor Ready chines...although its awkward reading english while listening to chines but not a bad anime 7/10Also The Story Is Pretty Good Like Yeah if you want Ecchi and harem etc. this anime is surely for you if you like chines voice though...no offense to chines people i still love you guys <3Its just hard to listen different language...Story Pretty Good Typical harem Anime - Highly RecommendedCharacter Good Typical Mix Characters - Waifu MaterialArt Good Art and animation = but work on the background sometimes..I Did Enjoy the Anime it was really Fun <3 "", 'Favorite Quote: ""My life is dull and boring.  But this dull life suits me, since I hate getting into troublesome situations.  If I could stay like this forever, that would be the best."" -Jiang HaoWhenever somebody asks me ""hey do you watch anime?"" Immediately the thing that comes to mind would be a Japanese style drawing along with Japanese voice actors.  This Chinese cartoon definitely caught me by surprise.  Without any spoilers I have presented my personal opinion on this series as of right now.Story: The story is pretty much similar to how all harems and romantic comedies are.  Most...harems either center around a loner or an average everyday student who does something and suddenly finds himself surrounded by a bunch of pretty girls.  However, as of right now,  the plot in this series is very fast paced and extremely hilarious.  It had me laughing out loud in alot of their sequences.  The series does a very good job in allowing the audience to understand the story despite being roughly 15 minutes long for an episode.8/10Art: Anime is a Japanese style animation.  It is very interesting to see how far anime has gotten throughout the years.  In my opinion, the artwork has gotten alot better over the years.  For Aishen Qiaokeli-ing or Cupid\'s Chocolates, I would say that the artwork is mirrored to have it feel like an anime type artwork.  But I had to say that the artwork in this series is very well done.  The colors were on point and it didn\'t feel distracting at all to the very least.  It also feels great to know that anime has made an impact worldwide.10/10Sound: As mentioned this is a Chinese cartoon.  Initially when I watched this series the voice acting for the characters sounded very strange for me.  As I progressed in the series I didn\'t find their voices strange rather I didn\'t come mind it as much.  For the opening theme, it is very well done despite being a non lyrical theme.  In my opinion, it captures the plot and the mood of the series.9/10Character: One of the biggest downfalls and complaints of bad animes would be the how the characters fit with the storyline.  This would also include their overall personalities throughout the series.  In this case however, I actually enjoyed every single character.  Despite the main character being the overused loner student in typical harems, the other character were very entertaining.  The reason for this being is that after the main character sets in motion the plot, each character in this series has their own desires and backstories.  As mentioned before, the episodes are roughly 15 minutes long, so how can they do all of this in such a short time? The series does a fantastic job of clearing their desires and backstories in a non-overwhelming way.  Each episode presents the main character tackles each issue in his own way making it very satisfying until the very end.10/10My Opinion: I thoroughly enjoyed this Chinese cartoon.  The artwork is great, the characters are well done, the sound and openings perfectly capture the mood in each episode.  All of these points contributed into making this rather overused harem genre into a very satisfying series so far.  Also this anime makes it enjoyable for the viewer because it constantly makes us imagine who the main character will eventually fall for.  I believe he will fall for the first girl he met, but that is just a speculation at this moment.  It also makes me genuinely happy to know that anime is spreading and appreciated worldwide.  This cartoon is a great example of that.  Just realized I\'m also submitting this review on Valentines day, this cartoon is great for that occasion!  Oh and also I\'m rooting for Xia Zitong!Thank you for reading my review, I really appreciate it guys.Final Score: 9/10 harems either center around a loner or an average everyday student who does something and suddenly finds himself surrounded by a bunch of pretty girls.

While the overall story is very cliche, it is pretty enjoyable if you don't want anything but just harem enjoyment. It definitely has alot of plot holes that don't get filled and it jumps pretty quickly between each girl, but it does tend to tie things up pretty nicely all things considered.Art 8/10I have to say that this is the most noteworthy...of the series, since i don't get to see this kind of effort put into most Japanese series these days. While it may come off as pretty bland characters, the way they move and act are definitely on chinese standards which makes it stand out amongst all the japanese animes. I really liked it even though it could have been so much more.Sound 5/10OP/ED songs are nothing really outstanding. But one thing that is extremely hard to ignore is the Chinese actors. I have watched alot of subbed chinese movies and japanese animes, so it definitely seems out of place mixing them both together. Unfortunately, the voice acting seems to fall short at times and can be bland or out of place.Character 5/10Aint much to this at all. Typical cliche harem characters. Though it is nice to see the MC not a full idiot (i use this phrase loosely).Enjoyment 6/10I can't really say that this will appeal to alot of people, but its simple and short.OverallI always felt like this was a Chinese animation trying a little too hard to be a japanese animation. It was very obvious to see the difference in how cliche situations are handled, but i was let down in hopes that china would have surprised me with something different. I applaud them for their efforts and enjoyed this as a break from alot of other animes i've been watching recently.Do not have high expectations of this, as i believe this to be just a quick enjoyment.

It follows all of the generic tropes in a harem, romance anime centred around a male MC. Of course, there is no explanation behind the characters and who or what they are. The female characters just throw themselves onto the MC. Paired with a horribly executed plot, it is just plain unenjoyable to watch and kind of gives me second-hand embarrassment. It's a shame because the art is decent and goes to waste. Also, the voice acting is not clear at all and sounds like it has been recorded in a...bathroom.

Of course there are good ones, but this one? It is not one of them. It can't decide what it is. It can't decide if it's serious, a comedy, or a harem. It doesn't fuse the three together well, if that's what it was going for. I enjoy the comedy aspect of it a lot, I found it to be pretty funny. I also think it had some aspect to be a good serious anime. The plot is unique. If it had just been the first girl we see, or just any...one of them, I think it could have been much better as a serious anime.

If you do, this anime(?) will offer you quite the ride. This isn't the kind of show where an idiotic male lead slips into one scene after another, but rather a plot that causes the harem to exist and Haoyis quest to get rid of it one by one. Of course, this makes the girls fall for him for real, but at least this makes a lot more sense than what other harems have to offer. Each individual arc is interesting and thankfully not filled with clichés (if they are present, they are played...with and lampshaded).9/10Art:One would think that the very small anime industry of China does not have the capabilities to produce animation that is as stunning as its Japanese counterparts...but that is not quite true. While it is visible in some brief scenes that the quality isn't as flawless as in many Japanese anime, the overall artwork is surprisingly good. Especially the character designs are every bit as good as anything they give us across the Japanese Sea.8/10Sound:If you want to point out something that is inferior to Japanese animation, it would be this. The opening and ending themes are horribly stock. They sound like something that you'd hear in a cheap-ass hentai or something. There is a lot of room for improval here. The voice actors do a fine job, but obviously, they lack the experience to make their words really shine. Especially the voice of Zitong is unsatisfying, though her voice actress really tries her best. A+ for effort, but C- for execution.5/10Characters:This may be the best harem cast I have ever seen and I'm not kidding. It starts with a proactive(!!!) male main character, who is neither stupid nor unlucky nor perverted (well, at least not more than any other teenage boy). He is the driving force in all of this, something that is painfully missing in most harems. Then we have the girls, who, while of course filling out some harem stereotypes, are very three-dimensional. They have varying intensities in their affection for Haoyi and they worry when he's spending time with another girl. They all have reasons for being the way they are and most important, they are all likeable.10/10Enjoyment:Getting used to the Chinese language was by far the hardest part. I'm so used to hear characters speak Japanese by now, that I was slightly distracted the first 2 or 3 episodes by this. But once I was over that, I had a lot of fun watching. As stated, I liked all the girls and would have been happy with either of them to win. With only 15 (rather short) episodes, there is also no time wasted in development of the story and the characters. If you want to give China a chance, this may be a good point to start.9/10Overall:8.2/10 with and lampshaded).9/10Art:One would think that the very small anime industry of China does not have the capabilities to produce animation that is as stunning as its Japanese counterparts...but that is not quite true.

They have varying intensities in their affection for Haoyi and they worry when he's spending time with another girl. They all have reasons for being the way they are and most important, they are all likeable.10/10Enjoyment:Getting used to the Chinese language was by far the hardest part. I'm so used to hear characters speak Japanese by now, that I was slightly distracted the first 2 or 3 episodes by this. But once I was over that, I had a lot of fun watching. As stated, I liked all the girls and would have been happy with either of them to win. With only 15 (rather short) episodes, there is also no time wasted in development of the story and the characters. If you want to give China a chance, this may be a good point to start.9/10Overall:8.2/10"", 'Flat out horrible. The problem is that this story would have been better had the author decided to commit to one girl. For a harem anime besides the authors favorite 2, the rest of them get zero attention.Story (Spoilers)- The biggest story issue is that the authors favoritism of 2 characters really makes u question why the others are there. They serve no purpose to the plot. The premise of the anime is that a couple girls have eaten ""cupids chocolate"" along with the MC and now have false memories of dating him. If the MC solves the major knot in their heart the spell...will be undone and the MC gets helps from a goddess to undo the spell. This where the problem lies.Zidong is the 1st girl introduced and is ur stereotypical sweet FL. Nothing outstanding about her but nothing to hate either. She just gets all the attention from the author and in turn the MC.Tang is the second girl introduced and is a typical tsundere. She doesn\'t act like a lead character at all and instead acts like the typical female best friend to the female lead. The ""if u dare hurt her ill make u regret it"" or ""don\'t look at her you perv!"". She\'s a background character pretty much.Yuan is the third character and is completely neglected after her story arc. She\'s the most frustrating to me because at the end of her story arc the mc even makes a promise to ""marry her"" or something along those lines and then completely ignores her. She serves no purpose besides being the ""smart character"".Mei is the goddes which helps the mc. I can understand his frustration with her early in the show as he\'s been dragged into a situation he didn\'t want to be a part of. (Not her fault btw). But by the end of the series he has completely neglected her. She has countless times cheered him up, put him on the right path, saved his LIFE, etc. She goes missing for large portions of time? ""Mei where have you been?! I need your help!"" She comes crying to him about something? ""Mei where have you been?! I need your help!"" She\'s used as a tool and not treated as a person. It\'s even stated that she only sticks around because she likes him and her job is finished.Sandy- Doesn\'t exist after her arc. She was unique too because she was implied to be special needs (at least from what I understood) but she flat out doesn\'t exist after her arc.Xueli- what bad anime wouldn\'t be complete without a horrible person for the mc to simp over and make excuses for? She is flat out a bad person and is completely irredeemable. This is going to be a long one so buckle up.Her and the mc grew up together. She starts treating him like garbage one day out of the blue and mc is understandably hurt by it. Mc chooses to stop interacting with her and ignore her as she keeps bullying and ignoring him. She gets hurt by this and uses the ""villian"" as a Rebound for mc. The villian is a bad person no doubt but he understandably notices that she\'s interested in mc and not him and gets mad. He makes big elaborate plot to humiliate her. It happens. Mc being the ""white knight"" he is comes to comfort her and she uses the mc as a scape goat to escape her loneliness and depression and masks it behind ""love"". Mc then proceeds to make excuses for her terrible personality because she\'s ""broken and It\'s my fault I didn\'t save her"". Mc makes light of her attempts to ki11 other Female leads, her actively bullying the FL\'s, etc. She also kidnaps mc and actively threatens and xexually harrases him. Which he again white knights for her. She\'s the authors favorite and it SHOWS.Audio- horrible sound quality. Chinese is already a rough language for people who aren\'t used to it to hear but this anime just makes it worse. Sounds like it was recorded on someone\'s laptop speaker outdoors.Animation- solid. Good quality when it matters but also has its moments where it\'s bad. But appropriate attention to detail when it\'s important stuff.Overall Story- simplistic in nature and execution. There aren\'t really any ""plot holes"" but a lot of the problems in the show are pretty one dimensional because the characters are pretty one dimensional. Good for turning ur brain off for a while.Pacing- Horrible. I watched the entire show in 2x, 1.5x, and 1.25x for really important parts. 2x is for when the show is unbearably cringy and slow, 1.5 is regular watching speed, and 1.25 is for important moments. It\'s unwatchable at regular speed.

The whole idea of writing out a multitude of paragraphs on why I think a show is the best thing ever, utter trash or 'nothing to write home about' and then publishing it to the world never appealed to me. That's not to say I don't think reviews have their benefits. They give readers a general idea of what a show (or film or book etc.) is about, helping them to decide whether watching it is worth their time (wait, isn't that what the synopsis is for?).The main problem I have with reviews, however, is that they are often (more...like always) coloured by the opinions and biases of the writer, no matter how hard they try to remain 'objective' and they can lead to someone giving up on watching something they may have thoroughly enjoyed.I think I should rephrase my first sentence. I've never understood negative reviews... or those who take the time to write them. Rather than listening to the judgements of others (which are rarely objective), I believe you should take a chance on things that initially pique your interest, particularly if it doesn't cost you or costs you very little.This anime (is it right to call it 'anime' if it's Chinese?) may have piqued your interest after watching a trailer. You might also be a harem fanatic or even just  a casual fan who likes a few shows of that sort. If so, I think you should give this one a chance. I can't promise you'll like it but I found many of the jokes laugh out loud hilarious, the absurdity was refreshing and there was a general heartwarming feeling to it all (maybe I'm crazy?).

I thought it wouldn't be very good from the starting episode but it grows on you and the ending was actually pretty good in a touching way.The story follows a man named Jiang, Haoyi, through some antics caused by a loved goddess. We start off with Jiang who is your typical high school male who only wants the quiet life. One day he finds a cake and takes a finger swipe of the icing, and the next thing he knows a handful of girls are all coming onto him and he...is being chased around by his jealous classmates. It turns out the cake he had was cupids chocolate which makes people who eat it love one another.After the first episode's plot building we get into the show. Each girl gets her own 2 or 3 episode arc where Jiang is forced to figure out their problems to break this love spell caused by the cake. It feels very similar to Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai. One thing I liked about this was that they didn't just dispose of the girls afterwards and it felt fluid and world building rather than routes in a visual novel. They did end it for the most part, they finished all the current arcs and hinted that they may do more.The art was great, very beautiful and interesting. The voice acting was cute, but it did take me some time to get used to the Chinese language instead of Japanese.The characters are pretty solid, cant tell you what they are like completely without spoilers. Jiang is our male MC, who again likes the quiet life and has to now deal with a harem he never asked for. He's pretty likeable, he gets down to business and is manly and relate able, not like your typical harem MC. Then we have his yandere childhood friend Ouyang, Xueli who pops up every now and then to try and be with him. She seems to have some back lore that isn't explored however. Another girl is Xia, Zitong who is your typical rich girl. She's kinda dense but has a cute personality. Next we have Xia, Zitong who is the athletic sports captain. She over all the posturing and more prone to violence also has a rather cute personality. The last harem girl is Lin, Yuan who is very intelligent. She actually has a decent story, shes and odd one to describe but she wasn't one that caught my attention until her arc. Our final character is Mei, Tata who is a love goddess who doesn't seem to be very good at what she does. She helps Jiang as he works with all the girls, but seems to be their for comedic value for the most part.I enjoyed this anime a lot. Getting past the first episode is the toughest challenge, as people could easily say how generic and bad it is and not give it a fair shot. One of the more popular reviews calls it no different from other harems and I got to disagree. Its like A world god only knows. Maybe not as good, but I was entertained. Comedy was not bad, story arcs concise and not terrible, likeable characters, world stays in tact through the entirety of the show. The art was simply awesome and the story kept me interested enough for me to look forward to the next episode.TLDR: Pretty good, a lot like a world god only knows.

Cupid's Chocolate is a REAL Chinese Anime ... the art is not so good at the beginning, but then in the second season you can notice a very good improvement, and the story is not sooo cliche, so you can enjoy it, you can be trap in all the fictional situations that the protagonist have to deal and try to fix. First season less then 15 minutes, but in the second part is a total 20 minutes per episode.I seriously recommend this anime! Is very good! I want to watch it until the end ... Oh! I almost forgot ... it have a...manga and is veeeeery advanced!Greetings from Peru! ;) manga and is veeeeery advanced!Greetings from Peru! ;)"", 'Ah, the most famous or infamous of CN harem donghua. This is also one of my favorite manhuas from back in the day. It was adapted, with changes, into donghua. I remember back when it was released. It later became so controversial that it got reported and banned in China, so it is technically illegal to watch, but it certainly won\'t stop me from doing a full watch now in 2024 and reviewing it.Plot Summary: Jiang HaoYi, the most ordinary of ordinary students, is happily living a quiet and ordinary life; that is until the school belle appears in front of him to announce she...is pregnant with his child!? WHAT!? And then as he is trying to figure out what is going on, girls appear one after another to announce or accuse him of something crazy! What the hell is going on!? Turns out, not long ago, he found a cupid-magic-infused cake and brought it to a clubroom that these girls all consumed. The magic manifested in creating false memories for each girl centered around their insecurities or wishes and involving the MC. Once he is able to resolve this for them, the false memories will disappear. Will HaoYi be able to help each girl and return to his ordinary life?PlotA very general overview of the plot is: a classic school setting harem anime; these types of shows were much more popular and prevalent in the 2010s when this story was written and adapted. The plot starts with a crazy event, acting as the hook, and moves on from there as the MC tries to solve the problems presented in the opening. While it can be considered a relatively generic start, it does go into each character presented in the harem and tries to grow each one. However, the progression of the plot can be a bit forced and disjointed. This problem, in my opinion, is an adaptation problem (I will explain more in the adaptation section) as the original manhua did not give this feeling when I read it. Overall though, it was interesting enough, but there are ALOT of cringe ""comedic"" harem event/encounters (as expected of harem comedy stories).CharactersAt first glance, the characters all seem like the standard characters from any harem show, and for the most part, they are. The MC is a quiet person who avoids conflict, or standing out for that matter despite is personal abilities. Most of the girls have very standout characteristics that fill some harem girl cliché, but they get their development (to some extent) throughout the show. The show does give each girl a backstory with a unique circumstance/struggle and time to develop rather than simply add them to an ever growing collection without reason; the development of each girl\'s character passable, but there are some problems due to the how the plot can be choppy and feel forced.AnimationClassic harem anime aesthetic, this is how I would describe how the animation and designs are presented. Since this is a school harem type show, there are the usual: beautiful girls, bouncing ""assets"", etc that you would expect to see in a harem type show. The animation, even for this first season is surprisingly crisp and fluid though, something I definitely did not expect. If you disregard the overexaggerated harem animation tropes, this is actually animated quite well. The designs for the characters are directly lifted from the manhua, so no complaints there; and the designs of each important character are very unique and hard to confuse with each other. There are also some exaggerated (cringe) comedy animations which could have been done without. The ED shots of each character also look very nice and clean.Final ThoughtsSurprisingly, I did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would, given its high praise and my enjoyment of the manhua (source). The plot and hook of this donghua was a bit fresh and unique, given they had a reasonable (albeit magical) explanation for the harem circumstance. But the storytelling was a choppy and disjointed. This made the plot feel a bit forced and disconnected. The characters themselves were alright and the animation and character designs are nice. If you enjoy school-setting harem-type stories, this is certainly a recommended watch, but if not, then you should probably skip this.Score: 6/10Adaptation Review (contains spoilers):The first difference is observable difference between the manhua and the donghua adaptation is that age and setting that the story is taking place. In the manhua, the characters are in high school and 15 years of age while in the donghua it is set in college (presumably) and the characters are 19 years of age. While this change isn\'t that bad, it does create a bit of dissonance for some of the jokes, actions of characters, and some of the dialogue because these were intended for a high school setting. This change probably happened because of some of the topics that the setting touches on. Teen pregnancy, teenage parents, pre-marital relationships, PDA aren\'t exactly recommended behaviors, especially in China, where this was released and is set.After that, there are many changes to the plot, mostly for dramatization purposes. This is first seen in how the opening was changed. The chasing, drama, and even the ""jumping off the roof to commit suicide"" scene was very different from the opening in the manhua. This is the first blatant change, there are many many many more that follow throughout the show. From an adaptation perspective, the core story and each girl\'s scenario is basically unchanged, but the progression of events is VERY different; the ending/result is the same, however. The donghua changed many of the events/encounters during the scenarios with each girl to make them ridiculously harem-tropey, so much of the encounters now overflow with the classic harem-comedy-cringe-misunderstanding aura. In essence, the manhua was much more realistic and grounded in its approach, making the story and plot much more believable.The next change I\'d like to point out is the oversexualization/suggestiveness of some relationships. Clearly, as a harem story donghua, this kind of portrayal is not unexpected, but they, in my opinion, went way overboard. The MC\'s relationship with that teacher is the premier example in this donghua (it happened to other girls too, but that was expected). The MC has a very complicated relationship with the teacher he visits late at night (the manhua does explains better, and gives more details later in the story); in the donghua, they really made this scene way too sexualized and suggestive, contrary to the more parent-child relationship the manhua suggested. It was clearly a harem-trope comedy situation and change.Then, like stated in the general review section, the plot is very jumpy and disjointed. I don\'t remember the manhua feeling as disjointed as the it does in the donghua. I do believe this is an adaptation problem; part of this likely stems from the fact that some character thoughts are translated/adapted as flashbacks or character dialogue and enhanced by some of the exaggerated visuals/animations, and another part because of how they end episodes to create a cliffhanger instead of single panel teases that we get in the manhua.The character designs are basically lifted directly from the manhua, there is basically no difference in artstyle between the two, though the designs/art in the donghua are a bit more refined since it is newer (the older chapter art is much more rough).There is one change that got removed I would like to have seen. This was what I considered the punchline and what hooked me to the manhua in the first place. After solving ZiTong\'s wish (first, pink-hair girl), HaoYi finds out that the magic gets dispelled but the memories of him helping her remain, the punchline after was: ""When the Cupid\'s Magic is dispelled... is when the TRUE STORY begins"". I thought this was a great setup for the story; was disappointed this wasn\'t in the donghua.The donghua ""adapts"" chapters 1-63 of the manhua with quite a few changes to the progression of events (not changes to the core story). After watching this, I still prefer the manhua and would recommend that over this adaptation.Adaptation score(how faithful to source): 5/10 is pregnant with his child!? WHAT!?

But the problem is that the audio of this anime sucks (yes, I know that some kid will ask - or say - if/that the version of Anime Fire is bad. NO, IT IS NOT! I use 247 tabs in the browser and More than 30 of them are from different anime sites and they are all at that level, INCLUSIVE, THE ONLY site I found to download the original version - not subtitled - of the anime in...MKV with 1.1 GB of each episode and the audio is the VERY SAME thing) and the animation is not good either. I don't recommend watching it, unless you've already watched the 500 best anime ever produced by human beings AND you have nothing else to do with your life, not even watch the episodes of the anime that are coming out. Because it is very serious for an anime to have such shitty audio in today's times. Even more so when it comes to Chinese production, where a country with 1.2 billion people, 8000% more than Japan, the land of technology, has many more audiovisual resources than the Japanese country. I thought this anime's low rating on MAL was because of it having Chinese dubbing, as the standard of its production nativity, obviously. But the low score is for several reasons. Especially the technician. Note 4 for this donghua and, if it weren't for the bad animation, the story and script are good that would easily give this production a note 7.

Chou Robot Seimeitai Transformers Micron Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1675/Chou_Robot_Seimeitai_Transformers_Micron_Densetsu,"[""(this review will be for the English version, Transformers Armada. There are some dialogue differences between the English version and the Japanese version, Micron Legend).Transformers Armada is the first of the Unicron Trilogy, a series plagued by animation errors and dubbing errors, among other things. Although not as badly hit as Energon, Armada still suffers a lot of these and it prevents fans from watching or enjoying the show.But is this show any good? Let's find out.Story: At first the story starts slow, I'll admit that. A small team of Autobots and Decepticons land on Earth, in a race to capture Minicons, small transformers that...can enhance the power of a large transformer and turn the tide in a battle. However once new characters are introduced-especially the enigmatic Sideways-it becomes clear that there is more at stake in this war than just control over the Minicons. Midway the story becomes better, and the 3rd part of the series is definitely the best part.Animation/Dubbing: Oh dear... where do we start. Frankly, animation is bad. Armada is animated by Actas, and you can tell what a rush job this is. Animation errors abound in this series, including a scene where jet-mode Starscream is represented by a flying black dot. Yeah. There are also lots of mistakes in the dubbing. Calling characters by their Japanese names (for example, calling Tidal Wave Shockwave) or giving the wrong name to a character (Sparkplug, Optimus's Minicon, is almost always called Leader-1).  Animation and dubbing is clearly the low point of this series.Characters: First of all, the human characters. Yes, they're annoying, and for the most part, useless. But I hope that you learn to tolerate them, since they're here to stay. The Autobot and Decepticon teams are better; they all have different personalities, from the battle-crazy Cyclonus to the loner, Blurr. However special mention must be given here to Starscream. This version of Starscream breaks away from the traditional mold of Starscream characters and is not a backstabbing second in command. His character arc is very interesting to watch, and this makes him the best  character in the show.Enjoyment: At first I was forcing myself to watch, especially at the first few eps. But once the hunt for the Miinicon weapons begins, the story takes a more interesting turn, and I found myself very excited to watch the next episode.Overall: Don't let the bad animation and dubbing stop you from enjoying this series. It's actually good, and I'd recommend it. can enhance the power of a large transformer and turn the tide in a battle.

A winning cast of voices added to largely developed, and still developing characters, and decent sub-plot, led to an unforgettable series.The Transformers are back once again, making earth their battleground for control of the mysterious Minicons. While this slowly caused the original plot of the show to turn mostly episodic, with the occasional Aesop, that really wasn't a bad format for the show. Sure, sometimes it could be boring or predictable, and for a show involving giant robots from outer space that's a bit of a stretch, but Armada took the concept...and ran with it. Despite the largely episodic initial plot, many subplots began to tie in, such as how the Minicons came into existence, their purpose, etc, culminating in a rather large climactic finish to the series (sequel not withstanding).Of course, with such Iconic characters, you need the proper voices. Forgoing using Peter Cullen, Armada instead brought in Garry Chalk to voice Optimus Prime, giving him a somewhat younger sound, whereas Megatron was voiced by David Kaye, who previously voiced the Decepticon leader in Beast Wars, as well as voicing Sesshomaru in Inuyasha. However, the character/voice combo that really gave me chills was Michael Dobson as the voice behind Starscream. It was almost like hearing the original Starscream combined with the original Megatron. Not quite a deep, monstrous voice, but not the high-pitched annoying voice either, and it was strangely menacing.All in all, the plot, though episodic, was fantastic, the characters received quite a bit of character development, and the acting was very well done across the board. I give the series an overall 8/10. and ran with it.

There are some dialogue, story, name, and even animation differences between the English and Japanese versions.)I don\'t write reviews on here often, but seeing as how there are only two reviews for ""Transformers Micron Densetsu"" on this site, I decided to go ahead and give my thoughts on it.Story: 8/10The story and dialogue can be cheesy and corny at times, of course. But, let\'s be honest, there are some versions of ""Transformers"" that are cornier than this one.The story starts out innocent, but as the show goes on, it gets better. For a kid\'s show,...it\'s pretty good. I actually got invested in what was going on, I didn\'t know where it was heading, and I legit wanted to see how it would unfold.Art: 6/10The animation can be lazy and stiff at times. You can tell that they were rushing to get each episode out. Although, to be fair, since they were rushing trying to animate two-story tall robots with complex designs, the animation should look much worse than it does.The best scenes that are animated the best are the openings and the transformations, obviously because they were stock footage.The artwork itself is very colorful and pleasant to look at, and the Transformers are well drawn.Sound: 10/10The openings \'Dream Again\' and \'Koutetsu no Yuuki\' are great. \'Koutetsu no Yuuki\' is the whole reason I saw this Anime. Before I heard it and saw the show, I knew barely anything about ""Transformers.""The endings ""Never Ending Road"" and ""Never Give Up"" are also insanely catchy. If you\'re not interested in the show, at least find these songs.Character: 7/10It was hard to give a rating for this category, because while I think most of the characters are great, some of them are pretty poor.Everyone will tell you Starscream is the best character, and, well, he is. His story arc and personality are very well written, making him entertaining to watch. It was so interesting watching him go through his arc, and I found his personality to be cute. If you\'re going to watch this Anime, watch it for him. Please.The main problem with this Anime falls into this category: The kid characters. I could tolerate them for the first few episodes, but after awhile, I began to get sick of them, and I grew to hate them. They really don\'t have a purpose that other characters couldn\'t fill.And then we have the main character, Convoy. Or, Optimus Prime as he\'s known in English. They didn\'t give him stand-out character traits like the other Transformers. In fact, they didn\'t give him a personality at all. They did give him a bit of a story arc towards the end, but I think it was a bit late in the game for it.Enjoyment: 8/10While it wasn\'t anything extraordinary, I did find myself intrigued by the characters (most of them) and the story. The only scenes I really didn\'t like were the scenes focused on the kid characters, but thankfully, they\'re not too long.Overall: 8/10For an Anime that was made for the sole purpose of selling toys, it tried way harder than it had to. So, if you\'re at all interested in ""Transformers,"" this is a good show to start with. it\'s pretty good.

So, if you\'re at all interested in ""Transformers,"" this is a good show to start with.', ""This score is a hundred percent due to nostalgia; if i were to rewatch this chances are I'll probably not even watch 10 episodes of it. However, I grew up with this show, and it's an absolute banger.First half's plot was quite dry to be honest. Very repetitive and predictable plot, with not much to make itself special from the dozens of Transformers media out there. Second half however, or rather the final 10 episodes or so (Unicron Battles), is legendary. Yes, the editing is still really horrible; dialogue is still cheesy and clunky, making it infamous within the transformers fandom, but the plot is...very gripping and fast paced for the final section, culminating in a fantastic finale.Characters are fine. this version of optimus is not one of my favourites, however he's not bad by any means, he's just not one of the better primes out there. Megatron was almost in the same league as optimus at first, being a rather cheesy melodramatic villain, but the final section made him a much more compelling character and the way his character ends up is one of the best endings for a megatron.Best character is easily Starscream however. Armada Starscream, despite being worlds apart from most iterations of Starscream, is superbly done. He is easily the most tragic character in not just the show, but in all of the many Transformers continuities i've seen. His arc is very well executed, and probably the strongest aspect of the show imo.Human characters in TF media are 90% of the time annoying, and while Rad and Carlos are rather stupid at times they're still ok compared to a certain boy named kicker jones. Alexis however is actually competent and the way her character is tied with Starscream's arc is beautiful.Unicron was as intimidating and had more screentime than in the 1986 movie, which is nice.Animation is... not the best, but compared to Energon it's a godsend.Not much to say about soundtrack, but that main theme that's always played is quite the banger.Overall, it's just nostalgia, but while the first half was an easy 5/10 being extremely mid, the final section was amazing. and since it has dismal ratings on mal, imma give it an 8. very gripping and fast paced for the final section, culminating in a fantastic finale.Characters are fine. this version of optimus is not one of my favourites, however he's not bad by any means, he's just not one of the better primes out there.

Double Decker! Doug & Kirill,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37496/Double_Decker_Doug___Kirill,"['I can’t really imagine a society in our world today without laws. Hell, I can’t even begin to fandom what would happen if the police force disappeared in my neighborhood. As a police story, Double Decker runs with a plot that managed to capture the essence of crime fighting. I’m not going to lie, this show made me realize that sometimes, we can make the simplest ideas and turn it into a blockbuster.As an anime original, Double Decker may look familiar especially those who have experienced a show in the past known as ‘Tiger & Bunny’. Produced by studio Sunrise, it didn’t take long to...realize the familiar character designs by Masakazu Katsura. Even after all these years, it feels like his talent never left us with these T&B aesthetics. I would also assume the setting of the show takes place in the same universe although that’s not clear. Regardless, watching Double Decker is a profound experience that I did not regret.Initially, the first few episodes introduces us to the main character cast. The most prominent characters consists of the SEVEN-O Special Crime Investigation. It shouldn’t take long for viewers to understand the experience level between investigator Doug Bilingham and rookie cop Kirill Vrubel. To me, they are like Batman and Robin. In other words, Doug plays the role of an action hero while Kirill presents himself as a sidekick. I don’t want to undermine Kirill’s credibility because he does have some potential. However, my impression of his character in the beginning was not enthusiastic. He lacks experience and often ends up being the butt monkey for feminine jokes. It doesn’t help that he looks like a bishounen rather than a cop. This is an antithesis to his partner Doug as he looks much more mature, experienced, and always gets the job done. There’s a lack of chemistry in the beginning due to their conflicting personalities. However, the two does get along on a professional level and Kirill begins to learn more on the job.Joining them includes Deana, Katherine, Maxine, Yuri, Travis, Sophie, and Apple. Each of them play a different role that compliments the team overall. For instance, Deana’s sniper skills is valuable during missions that targets dangerous individuals. Yuri possesses computer skills that provides intelligence to the team. Apple is in charge of maintaining the team’s equipment and works well with technology. You get the idea. In order to fight crime, it’s definitely important to establish character roles so this show managed to get that point across from the start. On individual levels, each character has also personalities that sometimes clashes with one another. Because let’s not forget one thing, it’s not always easy for everyone to get along on such a dangerous job. Being part of a crime fighting force is not easy when you have a group known as the Esperanza who deals with a powerful drug known as the “Anthem”.That actually takes to the core plot of the story. Initially, I had thought the show would involve monster of the week format episodes. The plot evolves more and more as conspiracies, corruption, and the dark side of Lisvaletta is revealed. Esperanza also begins to show to the world more of their dark ambitions that clashes with law enforcement. To me, Double Decker managed to make its antagonists marketable as an international threat in their world. Slowly but surely, their sinister plans come together that really throws off SEVEN from their ordinary cases. Speaking of cases though, I regrettably admit that most of them aren’t as executed as I had anticipated. Most of them uses recycled ideas such as investigating clues, following up on leads, tracking down the suspect, and bringing them to justice. If you’re familiar with media like Batman or even Spiderman, you can probably get a sense of these cases are like. Not to mention, the criminals they deal with often resort to using dangerous chemicals and experimentations. It’s only later in the show we how far the plot deepens to test the limits of our crime fighters.It would be unfair to say this show is a poor man’s Tiger & Bunny to be honest. Double Decker works as a successor by using its character relationships to sell its story. We find out more about some of the main characters’ past too in order to understand them more. And while this show may be goofy at times, it manages to work well for its character partnerships. There are moments where I couldn’t help but feel attached to them. Make no mistake, you don’t need to understand law enforcement to watch this show or see Tiger & Bunny. In fact, jumping into Double Decker is perfectly fine with its playful humor and oddball set of characters. It still contains its emotional content as the main characters tackles on social issues. An elephant in the room also exists with the same gender relationships. However, it’s far off from a shounen-ai and works more as a buddy cop police tale.You probably noticed that character designs in this show looks stylish with their looks. Some of them don’t even look like detectives or like they belong in the police force. An easy finger to point at is Kirill as he’s often made fun of for his feminine features. Sunrise managed to make Kirill into a comic relief in the beginning for his lackluster skills. It’s not until later that he becomes more useful to the team. But still, I do applaud the director and studio for recreating a society of these colorful characters. Not to mention, I feel the setting of Double Decker runs well with its technology concepts; namely the Anthem used by criminals and their consequences.It’s been around 7 years since Tiger and Bunny made its premiere. This isn’t really an upgraded or downgraded version as Double Decker is fully a show of its own. What this anime managed to do is creating a story in this fictional society that makes us believe in. Here, we have characters that risks their lives to deal with criminals and showing the dark side of their society. Yet at the same time, it also shows how partnerships can truly be meaningful when the right people work together. realize the familiar character designs by Masakazu Katsura.

However, the comedy and characters that are the show's main selling points become less inspired toward the mid-point. An example would be that only a small portion of the characters get any kind of backstory, and the team-work they need to form as cop duos rarely gets any focus.The action doesn't help in elevating the experience either, due to the odd mix of 2D and CGI animation that makes the action too clumsy to be enjoyed on...its own.Double Decker’s greatest downfall however is the plot-twists. Comedies love to subvert expectations and go for the less expected outcome, which is great in exploring stories and characters. Doing something unexpected is however not enough in and of itself. Twists need to either be equally as fun or even more interesting than what you normally would've expected. It's the difference between 'playing' with expectations, and 'betraying' expectations. Examples would include rushing out answers to mysteries in anti-climactic ways, robbing characters of their agency by trivializing their goals, awkwardly changing genre from crime comedy to sci-fi action, among other things I won't mention to avoid spoilers.Double Decker is ultimately a bumpy ride, not without its merits in the first half, but I can't recommend it due to untapped potential with the characters, a plot that becomes a train-wreck in the second half, and the comedy and action that fails to shine compared to other shows one could be watching. its own.Double Decker’s greatest downfall however is the plot-twists.

Doug & That Other Guy is an anime series taking place inside the world of Tiger & Bunny, a franchise which I personally highly enjoyed and which I thought Sunrise would be ruining like seems to be their favorite hobby these days. Thankfully that wasn't the case as this time around the story centers around new detective side of the universe and this appears to be almost as comedic as Tiger and Bunny.The story of this thing is a generic cops vs. crime. The good part is that it's not taken very seriously. The focus is on banter between the main characters, goofy...moments and scenes were nothing seems to really work out and that's precisely why they work out eventually. The single best part is how comedic these appear and how well timed the comedy is. There is always a start gag/situation that itself is already funny, followed by the comedy scene being extended and pushed onward with small details that are both unexpected and surprisingly well-planned. It's silly and awesome at the same time, yet never fully comedic, rather just balanced real well with the action/cop side of the story.The characters follow some sort of confrontation where Doug is ideal cop Jesus and The Other Guy AKA the real mc kinda just is there, but all will play well for him anyway. To understand what type of a show this really is, even the mc's past story is hilarious because he wants to be a hero but always ends up falling asleep when it would be his time to shine, and the times when he can finally shine only work because something equally stupidly awesome is happening to some other character. Like this one time Dough got stuck inside a pipe similar you see in Super Mario or some shit. How this ain't making everyone lol is beyond me.The female cast is ridiculously hot and follow the Tiger and Bunny design. Same with the overall art which looks amazing. Simple, yet effective, colors really standing out. So far I am impressed. I never thought this series could be so highly entertaining and fun to watch. Highly recommend this show from current season, nice action show. You can also watch this without seeing Tiger & Bunny tho I would recommend that one more than this. I actually didn't plan to review this preliminary, but seeing how this is getting hate for whatever silly reason and how there is no reviews yet, I had to say that this thing is totally cool, just check out the first episode if that ain't convincing you then stop there. moments and scenes were nothing seems to really work out and that's precisely why they work out eventually. The single best part is how comedic these appear and how well timed the comedy is.

It was pretty funny at times, it had lots of action, the characters were likable.  But, it just has the feel of something you\'ll forget you saw a year from now.If I could point to two things that make it feel more like a B-rate anime, it would be the fact that it never really felt like it had an identity of its own, but was trying to appear to.  It looked like it was pulling from Tiger & Bunny (Without being nearly as good), and adding...aspects of Wizard Barristers and Samurai Flamenco into it.  It didn\'t really seem to know what kind of anime it wanted to be which is why it started as a vice detective comedy, but ended up with space colonies and attacks on military bases.  And while they properly explained the transition from back alley\'s to jet bombers, it just felt a bit too far fetched.The second thing that hurt it was the needless pushing of the crossdresser agenda throughout the anime.  I\'m not the type to automatically hate on crossdressing in anime. I really enjoyed animes like Princess Jellyfish, Maria+Holic, Tokyo Godfathers and Gokudolls.  But, if you\'re going to do it, do it well.  Episodes like the one about Max\'s back story and prom was just stupid and out of place and brought the anime down.  It seemed more like an agenda driven episode that was shoved into the middle of the anime, trying to convince kids to accept crossdressers than a strong attempt at a back story.  While that was poor, the repeated mix ups with Kirill looking like a woman was actually funny. But, they even went too far with that and broke the logic.  (MINOR SPOILER): If the whole time he doesn\'t like it when people mistake him for a woman, why would he ever dress up in a bride\'s gown? Logically, they would get Rookie to do that. They really wanted to hammer home the acceptance of cross dressing in this anime for some reason, but the attempts were ham-fisted and cringeworthy.  But, mostly, they were completely unnecessary to the story.Other than that, it\'s really not a bad anime.  It\'s not a great anime, but it\'s not bad.  The animation was mostly solid, although you could tell the parts where they mixed in some pretty mediocre looking 3D animation.  If studios are going to do 3D animation, they need to make it look like Land of the Lustrous.  Otherwise, it\'s just off putting.  But, I think they\'ll get there in time.  The soundtrack was cool, especially the ending theme song.Overall, it\'s an entertaining anime. It\'s not a waste of your time to watch it.  But, even though it will give off strong Tiger and Bunny vibes, don\'t expect Tiger and Bunny quality.  It\'s just not there.Story: 6Art: 6Sound: 9Character: 7Enjoyment: 7Overall: 7 aspects of Wizard Barristers and Samurai Flamenco into it.

Visually stunning, great fighting scenes, easy humor, and likable characters.And what really stands out is the characters. The anime archetypes, while there at the core, have been drastically altered and switched in appearance and given a unique flair that's less cringy and more interesting.The main character Kirill is great. His personality seems to draw from the typical shounen anime hero with his hyper determination to achieve his goals except that this time that character archetype has been fused with the pretty boy that tends...to be in the background sipping tea. Well, not this pretty boy. And unlike most typical shounen heroes he doesn't make me cringe -- but he does make me laugh. I really love his character and, as the protagonist is the one to lead us through the story, this makes the journey an enjoyable one. to be in the background sipping tea. Well, not this pretty boy.

Anywayz , if we\'re to consider the plot of the anime, it was...basically your run of the mill good guys versus bad guys , that involves a group of specialize police officers called ""Seven -O""  which was headed by a Clark Gable look alike named, Travis with his secretary that has a resemblance to that of Becky from the anime Norin whom were tasked of arresting users and suppliers of Anthem, a drug that can give one some super powers a the cost of one\'s sanity, health and humanity, but the plot wasn\'t about the drug, but more like the conspiracy behind it  and we later found out that it was them military headed by Cooper aka Bamboo Man , who basically was responsible for the distribution of the drug to perform some kind of experiment on unwilling subjects which was the populace.  But the confusion about the anime was Kirll being a Nikai just like his brother Valery Vrubel whom also belong to the same species or wtf so ever, quite frankly even with the info dump that the antagonist, Cooper, one would still be confuse as to what does them Nikai have to do with creating chaos in earth and what  the military\'s GMS wanted with them Nikai. In the end it was nice to see the main antagonist get beaten in his own game and some  a veteran and was finally finished off by another antagonist who wanted some payback for betraying them or at least it was  the kind of ending that I like. Now for the art , what see around here were the ff: Clark Gable Hollywood actor who lived during the 50\'s up to the early 60\'s , Becky from the anime  Norin, some 70\'s fashion chick and 80\'s Punk, White Haired girl from Nyaruko-san, 80\'s cop show guy, and a guy from Utapri, well we can say for sure that  art director, Mizuno, Yuusuke  and character designer ,Tomizawa, Kayano\'s inspiration came from what I\'ve mentioned, which was pretty obvious. The characters , well they\'re pretty much as to what we see in any office politics , we have distraction someone who serves as the office fool Vrubel, Kirill, who serves as a in fact he does a very good job of being used as a distraction than anything else so forget about his expertise in genetics, next is the office wise guy, Bilingam ""Veteran"" Douglas whom has the wits but pretty much a laid back guy, next the office bully which was played by Del Rio, Deana and her control freak sidekick Rochefort, Katherine, and let\'s not forget the office romance between  a bisexual Silverstone, Maxine and her robot lover Fujishiro, Yuri, shees I hate those two, cu\'z to me Max was more like a kind of woman whom sees Yuri as her sex toy . if were to look at these characters , they\'re more like a bunch of homos , where we see Deane and Kay whose relationship were like that of bickering couples that make up afterwards , Max and  Yuri more like a woman who goes around with a sex toy, Doug and Kirill wher pretty much gay, and Travis and her Secretary, Sophie could be compare to that of an old man and a young girl relationship. So without any more  bush baeting , here were my ratings:Story- Fair 6: Thought, the plot has some direction, the addition of Kirill and his Bro/ sis being Nikai adds to the confusion of the story as a whole.Art-Good 7: When it come to the character design and their attire, they\'re pretty a  hodgepodge of fashion from different era\'s and places, like Deane\'s fashion was 60\'s , Max\'s 80\'s punk rock, Doug\'s 80\'s Miami vice look , Kirill\'s Utapri look, Sophie\'s Norin anime look of Beckey, Kay\'s office lady in pant suit look , Cooper\'s Gen Bison\'s look from Street Fighter , Apple\'s 90\'s cut and Travis\' 50\'s fashion, but the coat\'s that them Seven O\'s wore, were pretty much a fashion crime.Sound- Very Good 8: That\'s for the ending theme, "" Buntline Special""  by VickeBlanka and Deane\'s voice Hayami, Saori whom doesn\'t have to force herself to her signature cutie voice.Don’t give a shitto now i’m just in a rush, lallalalalala, I hate bothersome things oh my gosh lalalalalalalala, mendou wa gomen da ne dance with me, lalalalalala, don’t give up don’t give in I’m on the run  lalalalalala.Character- Good 7: Though the Doug X Kirill partnership was good, there\'s just a lotta indirect homosexuality that goes around this anime.Enjoyment= Very Good: Cu\'z Kirill being this office fool was something else.Overall- Very Good: Season 2????

I realized this anime has so much potential. I'm not exaggerating but I think this anime deserves much more attention that it already has.The art reminds me of the JoJo franchise. I think it's because they use a similar art style and uses CGI too. I also think that...this is one of the reasons why I am still watching this anime.Now for the sounds I have no complaint.

The overly smug narrator and the direction will try to convince you otherwise, but this is not the show that you were looking for.My main gripes with Double Decker are threefold:- The genre shift- The needlessly complicated sci-fi elements- And the fact that everything has to be a plottwistThe first point is pretty self-explanatory. If you go into the sequel of a samurai show after it has been advertised as the new samurai show, but for some reason they changed the setting...to a modern day highschool drama where only one character is a major samurai fanboy, you\'d be disappointed too. Now the genre switch from superhero to supernatural detectives isn\'t too big. Especially when they kept some key similarities. Both shows are set in an ambiguously America-inspired world. The heroes in Tiger & Bunny work for agencies with strict rules, almost like a police department. Both shows feature a fujoshi-baiting buddy cop duo as the main characters with a quirky support cast on the side. And they also fight criminals who abuse superpowers in a rigid Monster of the Week format. Wow, it\'s almost like they\'re not so different after all, huh?But that\'s exactly the problem. The fact that they changed the concept from superheroes to regular cops, but still had to incorporate the supernatural aspects, forces them to waste a lot of time on introducing stupid gadgets and technology that only serves the purpose of Monsters of the Week or Deus Ex Machinas, rather than intriguing you by exploring how this technology would change society. Most of the time they don\'t even explain the technology - in fact one of the main plotpoints is that nobody knows how anything really works. At that point it might just be magic or regular superpowers. So if they had just set the story in the same world as Tiger & Bunny where the audience accepts that some people have superpowers, it would\'ve worked much better, even if the plot only focusses on regular cops (as opposed to superheroes).Some of the supernatural contrivances are extremely stupid. And just like with their audience\'s expectations, Double Decker is VERY aware of that. The most obvious indicator for that is the obnoxious narrator who constantly lampshades how stupid or convenient some of the events are, as if that made them okay somehow. But some events don\'t need a narrator to rub the show\'s overbearing attitude in your face that ""you totally thought we\'d play out this old stereotypical plot for the entire 20 minutes, but lol psyche we tricked you"". A twist at the end of a story arc, isn\'t bad at all. But Double Decker throws around twists at any moment of any episode for minor and major things alike. There\'s a limit on how often you can do this before turning into a parody, and unfortunately Double Decker crosses that line and just keeps driving while pretending to be serious.If this doesn\'t discourage you from wasting your time on a show that\'s just milking your leftover goodwill from a better show, at least let me warn you that the plottwist which kicks off the final arc is David Cage levels of stupid. And I\'m not talking Detroit era Cage. I mean Indigo Prophecy era Cage. to a modern day highschool drama where only one character is a major samurai fanboy, you\'d be disappointed too.

I can, however, tell you why I intuitively put off watching it for 3 years. Most of the team responsible for Double Decker also worked on Tiger & Bunny and the two shows share the same character designer, Masazaku Katsura. The series was even billed as a ""Tiger & Bunny New Anime Series Project"" when it was first announced.Alas, Double Decker is to Tiger & Bunny what Mac and Me is to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, that’s if E.T. were a huge pile...of shit to begin with. T&B felt like a candy-colored shampoo commercial with a variety of plastic characters put on screen, which were all more believable as dolls and figurines, rather than real people. I understand that was kind of the central conceit of the show, that the so-called superheroes in T&B were nothing more than corporate shills, kind of like in The Boys (though way, way, way less dark), but even if it was done intentionally, it didn’t change the fact that the show felt superficial. I don’t feel like really going into the subtleties of presenting pretense in fiction.Double Decker is really nothing more than a shitty clone of the same show, same characters, same protagonist duo, same supporting cast, same-looking setting, same everything. The only difference is that they dispensed with the at least vaguely interesting figurehead superhero theme, and instead went for a buddy cop show about detectives trying to fight the distribution of some sci-fi drug that gives people superpowers and makes them go crazy, just like you’ve seen in, well… every sci-fi show that has some kind of drug that gives people superpowers and makes them go crazy… which is quite a fair number of them. If you’re looking for a show with a comprehensive overarching story, you ain’t gon’ find one here. That not to say it doesn’t have some hazy notion of an overarching narrative, but it’s weak. What you’re essentially dealing with is a case of the week grind, with only the last 3 episodes being a continuous arc.Doug is the veteran sensei-figure detective whose personality is defined by… uh, really not much of anything. He’s just smart and gives vaguely sardonic answers to questions sometimes. It’s not that he’s uncaring or jaded, or to consider the opposite side of the spectrum, he’s not really a sarcastic jokester either. He’s just whatever the script wants or needs him to be in any given moment. Rather than “What would make sense for his character to do or say?”, it felt like more of a “Hey, wouldn’t it be cool or funny if he did or said this, that, or the other?” type situation. Motherfucker felt like he was written by an AI, and definitely nothing as sophisticated as ChatGPT. Whenever he appeared on screen, at no point, not even for one solitary second, did I think: “Oh, shit, look, it’s Doug Billingham! He’s so cool! I’m so hyped!” I’ve barely finished the show 30 minutes ago, and he’s already blurry in my memory. What about this dude was I supposed to find inspiring? Honestly, who the fuck was this guy? We’re talking about a guy with less charisma and personality than Asuma from Naruto. Remind me, why is his name in the title again?As for the, so to speak, proper protagonist of the story, Kirill, I suppose the highest praise I can bestow upon him is that his personality is clearly defined and consistent. The problem is that he’s just plainly obnoxious. I don’t mean it in an Asta (Black Clover) or early Naruto-type way, that he’s too loud and annoying, or that he’s too hot-headed, too aggressive à la Bakugo, or too much of a horndog à la Mineta – it’s none of that. In extremis, he’s some kind of haphazard combination of most of those things, but there was nothing really that stood out to me in a love-to-hate type way. I was just not keen on him. His whole shpiel is that he’s got main character syndrome. At the start of the show, he’s a regular beat cop, but nurtures dreams of being some John McClane type badass hero. The problem is that he’s really got nothing going for him. Underdog protagonists are a dime-a-dozen, but no matter how much they suck at everything, they all have one thing going for them, one thing they can do really well, which they ultimately leverage to overcome their station. Kirill is not just like a regular guy fantasizing about being an action hero. He legitimately is a regular guy fantasizing about being a superhero.Nevertheless, though contrivance upon contrivance, shit seems to somehow work out for him? I guess? It most likely doesn’t happen the way you think it does, with the plot being so kind to him as to allow him to miraculously be the hero. He never really gets to properly be a hero or succeed, and yet, the main cast still allow him to join their super elite taskforce for… some reason. He just awkwardly sort of fails upward, you know? This state of affairs honestly doesn’t change at any point in the story. After the show’s finale, I didn’t feel like he underwent any meaningful performative or personal growth or change. He’s still just the same old largely useless dickhead. I don’t have the faintest why the taskforce feels he’s so necessary. I never got the impression he was in any way, shape, or form good at his job or that he had real chemistry to speak of with any given member of the cast.Just about the most significant character development he undergoes is the realization that detective work is not all about gunfights and car chases, and instead mostly about boring paperwork, endless interrogations, and stakeouts. Wow, what a revolutionary idea. I’ve never seen this story hook before. How ever did you come up with it? We better call the Academy Awards people in here quick! Are you taking notes, Simon Pegg? Oh, and I almost shit myself from hysterical laughter when the show made a gag about how he looks like a girl for the 478th time.Easily the best part of Double Decker was the over-the-top narrator, who plays it up like he’s constantly high on cocaine and pretty much exclusively makes fun of the show and its tropes. I’ll admit I laughed in spite of myself a couple of times. Trouble is, he gets played out after a while. It’s not that he becomes unfunny, I was just over the whole shebang after about 4 episodes. Besides, just because you use self-deprecating humor to joke about your own show’s plot holes and contrivances and make fun of how there’s nothing interesting going on in a self-aware manner, which the narrator does explicitly in exactly so many words on several occasions, that doesn’t obviate the fact that there is in fact nothing interesting going on. Scores of authors seem to be laboring under the delusion that as long as they toy around with the 4th wall and point out the flaws of their own stories to the audience in a tongue-in-cheek manner, that makes them somehow acceptable. It don’t work like that, son. It was less “Oh, haha, wink, wink!” and more “Uhm, well, yeah…”Regardless, forget about all that, because frankly, who fucking cares? The worst aspect of both Tiger & Bunny and Double Decker is that they are poor attempts at Westernizing anime. Setting aside the fact that they fail in doing so, why would anyone attempt it in the first place? You know how cringeworthy it is when weebs mix in Japanese words in real life conversations and express themselves with anime gestures as part of their body language? Yeah, it’s kind of like that. I call this version of cringe Americaboos or Westaboos – except the cringe factor is turned up to 11 by the political angle.Anime is the last haven of non-pozzed entertainment in existence. Adding Western ideas of diversity, inclusivity, and equity into it defeats the whole fucking point. There were traces of this cancer in T&B, as well, but the shit hits the fan in Double Decker. Early on in the show, Doug says that his goal in life, which is incidentally the reason he became a cop, is to eradicate poverty and inequality in the world. Mind you, this is never narratively relevant or revisited in any way, but the writers felt you needed to know that. Thank you, Kanye. Very cool. There’s unsurprisingly an arc about a trans character and plenty of dialogue about gender identity and stereotypes, discrimination, the works. I’m not joking when I say that another episode goes so far as to feature feminization hypnosis. Yes, it really is that kind of show.The entire elite taskforce of Doug & Kirill feels like it was designed along the same lines as a modern American sitcom cast. There’s Doug, your irrelevant straight, white male who agrees with the current things, then you have Kirill, your resident femboy beta with progressive ideas, then a butch dyke with the obligatory Skrillex haircut, a robot, a boss babe who takes no shit, a huge effeminate black guy, a disabled chick with a cartoonishly thick lisp, an authority figure who sounds like a gay pimp, a crossdresser, a dude literally named Bieber, and a young girl who joins at the same time as Kirill (effectively supplanting him) shattering all kinds of glass ceilings. Brave! Stunning and brave!Probably the thing that pissed me off the most is that the disabled chick was their “guy in the chair”, as it were. She’s the one always at HQ relaying all manner of vital information and enabling the team to do their jobs. Are you fucking kidding me? Bro, I wouldn’t have minded if she were just a generic member of the team to show that even people with disabilities can be of use, yes, very inspiring, but you’re putting the chick with the thickest lisp I have ever heard in any anime in charge of verbally communicating information? Am I being Punk’d right now?In Banana Fish, every character was either gay, a rapist, or both, and the show featured gay sex or gay rape every 5 minutes of runtime. And yet, Double Decker somehow managed to be even gayer than that. And you know what the real tragedy of it is? You know why I asked what the point of even making something like this was? Because you go to all this trouble to inject woke cancer into the anime medium only for the very people whom you were trying to pander towards to hate it. Of course they hate it. You absolute buffoon, you cannot appease creatures who are fundamentally animated by resentment and a primal desire to tear down everything of value and prestige. There’s no filling the all-consuming hungering void in their hearts. It’s such a wide-spread problem that there’s a consecrated term for it, woke scolding. There is no limit to how petty the woke scolding can be. You may side with them, but sooner or later, they will cannibalize you. I’ve done some reading and imajun moy shock when I found out that the woke brigade holds Double Decker in contempt for not being woke enough, presumably because the dyke doesn’t smash the patriarchy hard enough or some bullshit like that. I don’t know, don’t ask me to divine the mental musings of the inane.The one detail that makes Double Decker markedly better than Tiger & Bunny is that it’s only 13 episodes long, so you would hypothetically only have to subject yourself to this dogshit for one cour – how far that goes in terms of redemption is a different matter altogether. Forgive me, I am just feeling enormous trepidation at the prospect of watching the T&B sequel.There’s no reason for this show to exist. There’s even less reason for you to watch it. of shit to begin with. T&B felt like a candy-colored shampoo commercial with a variety of plastic characters put on screen, which were all more believable as dolls and figurines, rather than real people. I understand that was kind of the central conceit of the show, that the so-called superheroes in T&B were nothing more than corporate shills, kind of like in The Boys (though way, way, way less dark), but even if it was done intentionally, it didn’t change the fact that the show felt superficial. I don’t feel like really going into the subtleties of presenting pretense in fiction.Double Decker is really nothing more than a shitty clone of the same show, same characters, same protagonist duo, same supporting cast, same-looking setting, same everything. The only difference is that they dispensed with the at least vaguely interesting figurehead superhero theme, and instead went for a buddy cop show about detectives trying to fight the distribution of some sci-fi drug that gives people superpowers and makes them go crazy, just like you’ve seen in, well… every sci-fi show that has some kind of drug that gives people superpowers and makes them go crazy… which is quite a fair number of them. If you’re looking for a show with a comprehensive overarching story, you ain’t gon’ find one here. That not to say it doesn’t have some hazy notion of an overarching narrative, but it’s weak. What you’re essentially dealing with is a case of the week grind, with only the last 3 episodes being a continuous arc.Doug is the veteran sensei-figure detective whose personality is defined by… uh, really not much of anything. He’s just smart and gives vaguely sardonic answers to questions sometimes. It’s not that he’s uncaring or jaded, or to consider the opposite side of the spectrum, he’s not really a sarcastic jokester either. He’s just whatever the script wants or needs him to be in any given moment. Rather than “What would make sense for his character to do or say?”, it felt like more of a “Hey, wouldn’t it be cool or funny if he did or said this, that, or the other?” type situation. Motherfucker felt like he was written by an AI, and definitely nothing as sophisticated as ChatGPT. Whenever he appeared on screen, at no point, not even for one solitary second, did I think: “Oh, shit, look, it’s Doug Billingham! He’s so cool! I’m so hyped!” I’ve barely finished the show 30 minutes ago, and he’s already blurry in my memory. What about this dude was I supposed to find inspiring? Honestly, who the fuck was this guy? We’re talking about a guy with less charisma and personality than Asuma from Naruto. Remind me, why is his name in the title again?As for the, so to speak, proper protagonist of the story, Kirill, I suppose the highest praise I can bestow upon him is that his personality is clearly defined and consistent. The problem is that he’s just plainly obnoxious. I don’t mean it in an Asta (Black Clover) or early Naruto-type way, that he’s too loud and annoying, or that he’s too hot-headed, too aggressive à la Bakugo, or too much of a horndog à la Mineta – it’s none of that. In extremis, he’s some kind of haphazard combination of most of those things, but there was nothing really that stood out to me in a love-to-hate type way. I was just not keen on him. His whole shpiel is that he’s got main character syndrome. At the start of the show, he’s a regular beat cop, but nurtures dreams of being some John McClane type badass hero. The problem is that he’s really got nothing going for him. Underdog protagonists are a dime-a-dozen, but no matter how much they suck at everything, they all have one thing going for them, one thing they can do really well, which they ultimately leverage to overcome their station. Kirill is not just like a regular guy fantasizing about being an action hero. He legitimately is a regular guy fantasizing about being a superhero.Nevertheless, though contrivance upon contrivance, shit seems to somehow work out for him? I guess? It most likely doesn’t happen the way you think it does, with the plot being so kind to him as to allow him to miraculously be the hero. He never really gets to properly be a hero or succeed, and yet, the main cast still allow him to join their super elite taskforce for… some reason. He just awkwardly sort of fails upward, you know? This state of affairs honestly doesn’t change at any point in the story. After the show’s finale, I didn’t feel like he underwent any meaningful performative or personal growth or change. He’s still just the same old largely useless dickhead. I don’t have the faintest why the taskforce feels he’s so necessary. I never got the impression he was in any way, shape, or form good at his job or that he had real chemistry to speak of with any given member of the cast.Just about the most significant character development he undergoes is the realization that detective work is not all about gunfights and car chases, and instead mostly about boring paperwork, endless interrogations, and stakeouts. Wow, what a revolutionary idea. I’ve never seen this story hook before. How ever did you come up with it? We better call the Academy Awards people in here quick! Are you taking notes, Simon Pegg? Oh, and I almost shit myself from hysterical laughter when the show made a gag about how he looks like a girl for the 478th time.Easily the best part of Double Decker was the over-the-top narrator, who plays it up like he’s constantly high on cocaine and pretty much exclusively makes fun of the show and its tropes. I’ll admit I laughed in spite of myself a couple of times. Trouble is, he gets played out after a while. It’s not that he becomes unfunny, I was just over the whole shebang after about 4 episodes. Besides, just because you use self-deprecating humor to joke about your own show’s plot holes and contrivances and make fun of how there’s nothing interesting going on in a self-aware manner, which the narrator does explicitly in exactly so many words on several occasions, that doesn’t obviate the fact that there is in fact nothing interesting going on. Scores of authors seem to be laboring under the delusion that as long as they toy around with the 4th wall and point out the flaws of their own stories to the audience in a tongue-in-cheek manner, that makes them somehow acceptable. It don’t work like that, son. It was less “Oh, haha, wink, wink!” and more “Uhm, well, yeah…”Regardless, forget about all that, because frankly, who fucking cares? The worst aspect of both Tiger & Bunny and Double Decker is that they are poor attempts at Westernizing anime. Setting aside the fact that they fail in doing so, why would anyone attempt it in the first place?

It have decent sound/music,and the character development is just like in any other anime of the type. Half the side kicks get an episode focused on their story. But it have a lot of negatives for me. So i decided to put them out for people that care about it.-Censorship,rude parts are scratched off and words are changed with *. It had it on the version that i watched and i have the feeling that it is part of the anime and not put on by the distributors.-Really bad CGI that is an...eyesore at best. It is the main reason that the battles feel so bad.-Far too americanized for me,if i want to watch american things i have plenty of serials to rewatch. I don't watch anime to just see another USA cartoon. The writing,the art,the setting...all of them feel american. If that is your thing,then you could enjoy it.-Finally the politics. I am not from the west and i personally don't care about all those things,their countries,their people and their political vies. But i am getting tired to see it hamfisted in to everything i watch,read and play. I really do hope that i will still be able to watch animes in the upcoming years,but seeing how this is the second one to do it....i am not too optimistic.I do hope that this review helps you to make a decision,no matter if you see those things as positives or you agree with me. eyesore at best.

I hope more people give it a chance because it's such a fun & enjoyable watch as well as an original show. Maybe you aren't fond of the use of CGI, but it was done really tastefully in this series & it doesn't interrupt the animation quality at all here.The only thing I hope they explore more on is actually Kirill & Doug's relationship. There hasn't really been any development with them as SEVEN-O partners. I get that the other characters need to be introduced as well for us to understand character dynamics...& such but that also pushes the main leads out of the picture the majority of the time this season. Hopefully if it goes onto a 2nd season, we will see more chemistry & a deeper more meaningful connection of our two detectives. & such but that also pushes the main leads out of the picture the majority of the time this season. Hopefully if it goes onto a 2nd season, we will see more chemistry & a deeper more meaningful connection of our two detectives."", 'I\'ll start this quoting a running gag:Double Decker is not an anime about heroes and dreams,It\'s about a bunch of people who can seamlessly turn between 2D animation and CGI.art:No, seriously, the whole series has a combination of 2D animation and 3D animation, and while the 3D segments look and move really good, the 2D animation sometimes fails, not because the movement is bad, but rather because the lines seem more like a rough sketch than the final deal, it\'s especially noticeable right in the opening, where there is a rather large sections where the images pass from these solid illustrations to something not...quite as good looking, it still retains it\'s good looks when it\'s important.Sound, Music:Talking about the opening, while rather generic, when it comes to soundtrack, it is not terribly bad. The soundtrack and ending tho, is really good to the ears. The ending might lack animation, but it\'s quite the bashing song (if you like it), you can tell the band itself made a couple of changes for the official release of it, but that only fixes little things that don\'t impact the feel of the song. The other music in the anime is also good, but you\'ll have to pay attention for it as it doesn\'t stand out as much as other anime soundtracks. The sound effects are rarely unfitting, so I\'d say that\'s not evidently bad, the guns actually sound really good, and so do the voices as you\'d expect.Story and Characters:And all of the voices fit the Characters well, although most of them don\'t get over an episode to develop, but when they do, they become better. Kiril is the main guy, but also the guy who develops the most, and definitely the most enjoyable, that said, all of the characters bounce well with each other as soon as they apear for over 2 minutes at a time, because some characters are definitely left to the side and barely explained and one of them specifically only starts being ""part of the group"" towards the latter episodes.That doesn\'t mean that the characters are perfect, some characters just get a cool trait for the sake of giving them a cool trait and some others do stuff for no interesting reason other than ""Something like this happened to me"" or a bunch of uninteresting reasons.The way the anime tells a story is really unique, see, the characters do develop over the episodes, but each episode can be viewed individually and you\'d understand them just fine. That does break the immersion, but the fact that it works towards the latter episodes is really good. Each episode has some sort of story development that will come on latter episodes, and similarly to older anime series, the important stuff does come back on the latter half of the anime but it\'s heavily wiped out in the last episode, so that was rather disappointing.TLDR: The characters are good, but they are much better towards the latter half of the series.Finally, I do gotta say that if you like detective story anime, your experience will be much more solid. It\'s a great anime regardless!So when watching this series; Don\'t Think!

In fact I loved the main character and I thought his personality was nice and fresh. The plot was rather unique so if you wanted to watch something a bit different that involved crime, solving mysteries, but with some drugs that make people monstrous then yeah this is great. Voice acting- no complaints. Soundtrack- loved it. Art- yeah this is where most my 'complaints'...would be. The art was rather inconsistent. It would look like a typical drawn anime in some scenes but other scenes (typically the ones with a lot of movement) suddenly looked like cgi that was trying not to look cgi (looked like a ds game to me tbh) but it wasn't like the worst thing my eyes have ever been laid upon.

Fantascope: Tylostoma,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5802/Fantascope__Tylostoma,"['If you\'ve heard of Yoshitaka Amano or if you\'ve seen some of his artwork elsewhere (and you likely have), you probably have an idea that Fantascope Tylostoma invites you to an artsy, experimental, uncommon viewing.Particularly in an age where fluid movement and colorful palettes are some of the main characteristics of a praised or popular show, we are just not used to an anime that is visually told the way Fantascope Tylostoma is: highly stylized monochrome paintings accompanied by narration. I don\'t think a modern viewer can be entirely blamed for finding something like this OVA ""boring"" or just ""weird"". To some, that will...be the nail in the coffin. But others might be willing to give it a try, and embrace this unusual journey.This story uses the narrative device of ""Story within a story"". The narrator tells us the myth of the immortal Man who appears every 700 years, and the mysterious Man tells a joyful prostitute he meets his own story of how he came to be that way. There is some interesting playing of this device, but I will not spoil it for you. The meaning of the title is the first thing explained, and is a thread all too interesting to follow; I was immediately intrigued and this feeling remained for the entirety of the episode. As perhaps it\'s expected from an experimental movie so tied to its visuals, not every character action and not every thought is clear. The narration functions as a fine anchor and although its presence is a tad excessive sometimes, its existence is thoroughly justified: Fantascope feels very much like a tale, told verbally to you by someone else.As for the characters. As I want this to be a spoiler-free review, I\'ll try being brief about this point. The (few) characters are appropriate for the setting they\'re in, and I think they\'re well-done for such a short story. The Man is a jaded and taciturn person, but he also doesn\'t shy away from telling his story, and to share his past actions (not all sympathetic, by the way). It would\'ve been easy to have him be a distant, alien-like voyager, and I thought interesting that he\'s a more approachable protagonist and generous narrator than one might think. The prostitute who takes an interest in The Man is a charming character, and has some great lines of dialogue and an interesting form of enunciation that I talk more about below. The Goddess in the Cave is what you expect from a divine character: uncanny, passionate, and hard to fully grasp.There isn\'t much in the way of character development, not only because of the running time, but also due to the very nature of this being a ""legend"" of sorts; in those, the tale and setting tend to override the characters and their psychological aspect.The art is an imperative aspect of Fantascope, and any other artist would make of this an entirely different thing. Liking an art style or not is of course subjective, but Yoshitaka Amano\'s flowy lines and his ghostly, otherworldly characters so perfectly fit the post-apocalyptic and wavering gray setting, that it\'s hard to dispute its efficiency in introducing us to this world and the characters in it. The subtle movement of hair and water in static scenes were some of my favorite details to catch while watching the episode.Another interesting point that I mentioned by passing above is the voice acting. I do not know if this was an artistic choice or a matter of budget, but the characters\' voices in this OVA don\'t seem to come from trained or experienced voice actors; they feel bare, like real people talking. It\'s something I\'ve seen used in ""down to earth"" anime movies (the adult segments of Ghibli\'s Only Yesterday come to mind), but in fantasy is rarer. It\'s a positive stand-out in my opinion, and it adds to the aura of mystery and unorthodoxy.Honestly, I too was expecting no more than 30 mins of an out-of-my-comfort-zone experience, and was ready for a healthy amount of boredom, but Fantascope was actually quite enthralling  to me. I\'m not sure if it\'s a gem of storytelling or a must-watch for obscure OVA\'s. It\'s a fairly simple story (with its layers of complexity being open for interpretation), but it competently sets its atmosphere and aesthetic and maintains it firmly to the end. It\'ll probably give you, at least, an interesting half hour of entertainment. be the nail in the coffin.

It\'s a positive stand-out in my opinion, and it adds to the aura of mystery and unorthodoxy.Honestly, I too was expecting no more than 30 mins of an out-of-my-comfort-zone experience, and was ready for a healthy amount of boredom, but Fantascope was actually quite enthralling  to me. I\'m not sure if it\'s a gem of storytelling or a must-watch for obscure OVA\'s. It\'s a fairly simple story (with its layers of complexity being open for interpretation), but it competently sets its atmosphere and aesthetic and maintains it firmly to the end. It\'ll probably give you, at least, an interesting half hour of entertainment.', ""Really good. It has a feeling of being a small and very personal work of Yoshitaka Amano who is going to push for his creation to exist even if it's outside of the industry. Really clear watching it that for Amano this is one of the works of his life.That's why it can feel at times like the amateur story that a child (who draws wonderfuly as Amano) imagines in his mind, drawing it, creating the voiceover, making some animation that sometimes works so good but other can be a bit strange.Very heartfelt and passionate artistic creation with beautiful black watercolour paintings.

Engage Kiss,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51417/Engage_Kiss,"['While Lycoreco dominated the headlines and got praise for being an A-1 masterclass, I fell in love with the world and characters of Engage Kiss more and think it was the better of the two A-1 anime originals.Engage Kiss’ very first episode hooked me. Waifus, great action scenes, Grade A hentai quality kisses, it was love at first watch. But it’s not just fanservice that kept me. The story and world are very interesting and remind me quite of bit of Toaru, Strike the blood, etc. with the island city created for research trope. It’s always a major plus for me when there’s an MC...who isn’t afraid of women and can handle himself competently around them. Shuu is just that type of person and while he may have a bland design, I really enjoyed his personality and banter with the girls. I also loved how despite being a normal human, he doesn’t just sit on the sidelines and is an active participant in the action scenes.Of course you can’t discuss a harem without the girls. Engage Kiss gives us 3 unique flavours of women to suit a diverse taste palate. The cute pink haired yandere who will do anything to keep her man safe. The blue haired ex gf who is still madly in love with the MC. And the blonde hot nun. While Kisara was pretty annoying to me, the other two waifus are among some of my faves in recent memory. There’s a waifu for everyone here and they’re all very well written. I really enjoyed how the show doesn’t take itself too seriously and allows for some pretty funny moments of jealousy between the girls. Nothing like a good old cat fight.Speaking of fights, as you’d expect from A-1 as of late, the sakuga in Engage Kiss is pretty impressive. There’s some real talent working on this series behind the scenes and it showed in some of the big set pieces. Although it’s actually quite hard to tell which got more effort, the fight scenes or the kiss scenes.Engage kiss is my anime of the season and I will definitely miss it. It’s a fun wild ride with great waifus, fights, an interesting story and a really cool and likeable MC. I have absolutely zero complaints with the show. I’ve been pushing this agenda for months and I wish more people would give the show a chance.If you’re able to sit down and watch things without looking for Beethoven or DaVinci level art in everything, I think you’ll find Engage Kiss to be a blast.Engage Kiss gets 10 demons out of 10. who isn’t afraid of women and can handle himself competently around them.

Wow,that kiss belongs to some echhi anime.The story is also very simple and easy to understand,it’s even easier to understand than the dialog between character.There’s a demon and there’s an organization that kill demon,kill the demon,saves the world.Sounds familiar ? yeah cause it is indeed similar to Takt.OP and other hundreds animes as well,but originality never matters to me.So is the story interesting ? yes,eventhough the repeated concept of story is quite boring for some people,I do found the concept of demons in this anime quite interesting,cause instead of using the “IT CAME FROM THE SKY’ tropes it decides to pull Kamen Rider Revice’s Inner demon and possessed by demon concept which I absolutely prefer.The Character that plays the most important part for me also made very well,despite the overused design that appeared which is very understandable,I still grow very fond of them.Ayano looks like Mona from Genshin Impact and any other anime chara with that kind of hairstyleKisara looks like a combination of Kaos Moeta from Comic Girls,Yuno Gasai from Yume Nikki and that damned Yandere girl from Happy Sugar Life which by the way not happy at all,and what more surprising is the fact that Kisara also have some Yandere side as well.Pink haired anime girl really terrifying these days huh.Shuu which is our male lead is basically the combination of Naofumi from shield hero and basically any other basic anime MC with a personality of a less boring and less dramatic version of Kimihiko from Tantei wa Mou Shindeiru.The female MCs are very interesting and it’s obvious since they’re the main selling point.The writer decide to make our male MC a smokers and if the purpose of making him a smoker is to make him look cooler than the writer failed miserably,it’s infact doesn’t make him looks cooler,it just make him looks like my jobless uncle.This anime is not recommended if you are the type of person that easily bored and likes a heavy story anime,not really recommended to people that already watch Takt OP since the story is pretty much the same with less drama and more lewd but if you wanna watch it still,im not gonna stop you.Very recommended to people that can like a show just cause a single character like me,also recommended to people that likes watching a ‘’lewd-ish” couple action…like me.Overall,8/109/10 if they add even more fanservice.A very good waifu bait anime,wouldn’t surprise if they make a mobile game out of it just like it’s predecessor which by the way haven’t release even after roughly 7 months of the day it last airing. waifu bait while this one actually does,in Takt OP,the anime doesn’t instantly encourage us to like Destiny or Anna but rather make us grow fond to them as the story progress cause in the beginning we don’t even know exactly what kind of person Destiny is,Engage kiss in the other hand quickly encourage us to like and love the heroine by showing that she good at cooking,doesn’t afraid to get naked (if only that towel or blanket doesn’t cover her in the first episode) and basically any other criteria that makes her a “waifu” which is the main selling point of this anime.The other aspect that also make this anime a fully waifu bait is the fact that the writer decide to give us a fanservice scene where the two MC have a very wet kiss to somehow refill the heroine powers and solidify that this indeed a waifu bait,I mean I don’t dislike it but first episode?

Imagine getting a bowl of cereal, and pouring orange juice into it. Imagine eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but the jelly was replaced with mayo. Now grab a plate, and put all these foods together and eat it all. Are you utterly confused by what I just said? That's how much I felt confused watching this show. This recipe is what I call the “Engage Kiss”, which was a plate of every trope imaginable in the most nonsensical and dumb ways sometimes, plus a lot of plot points crammed together. Harem, check! Cute...girls, check! Demons, check! Dumb waifu wars, check! Ecchi, check! Little sister, check! Rip-off Naofumi, check!Say hello to yet another A-1 Pictures original airing this summer season, and once again, the animation and music did not miss. Everything else though, had its share of frustrating and generic moments. This show really does not start well in my opinion, and because of that, it really lost me for a good chunk of the series, except for a few very good episodes, which made this a passable series overall. If you were wondering which A-1 Pictures original from this season was better, it would easily be Lycoris Recoil. Funny enough, I’d thought for sure it’d be the other way around, but guess I was wrong.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 9.8/25To give a quick overview first, this show takes place in Bayron City, a rather futuristic and extravagant looking place that strives to give every citizen a lavish lifestyle. However, for wannabe Shield Hero MC Shuu Ogata, that is not the case. He struggles to make ends meet, and is taken care of by his demon partner, Kisara, who holds down the fort and takes care of chores. These two work side by side along with the military forces to take down demons who pose the biggest threat to the city. In order to gain enough power to defeat these formidable creatures, Shuu and Kisara must kiss for her to turn into a more powerful being. This arrangement comes at a cost for Shuu, and it whittles him down bit by bit throughout the story.So this seems interesting right? So it seemed, but this show has quite the identity crisis in that instead of having some world building for us to understand how the city works and why the demons are here, it focused a lot of the romance aspects instead, of a lazy deadbeat and his harem who for some reason are smitten with him. To be honest, an exposition dump of why the demons were here would have been better than whatever was presented. In a show like this, you would expect that the romance would come second, and the story come first, but nah, let’s just have girls getting jealous for a big chunk of the show.There are some good parts about the story, and some emotional bits too, and while the emotional scenes were honestly executed well, if everything was developed properly, it would have hit even harder. Otherwise, the plot is quite ambitious, but because of a lack of world building, nothing felt very significant, it just felt like many things crammed together in an attempt to make a good plot, but felt like a pile of things that didn’t mix well, just very messy.ART: 8.9/10The animation is quite worthy of praise. The action is fluid and the character designs are decent, except for Naofumi 2.0. The colour palette also works well. Lots of pinks that give the show its uniqueness.MUSIC: 8.4/10The sound is pretty solid too. The OP and ED were both great songs, and the soundtrack fit well in each scene.CHARACTERS: 9/20The character development in the show was quite abysmal, because first of all, there was so little backstory, so we had no idea how why all the girls like Shuu, and that made it hard to justify their motives. Kisara was the cute character, and helped Shuu make ends meet, and was also the military’s biggest weapon in countering the demons. Ayano was the more mature character who also played a role in fighting the demons. Some of the supporting cast felt more well developed than the mains honestly, especially Miles, who was Shuu’s caretaker when he was little.Shuu, while he starts out being extremely frustrating to watch, ends up being a solid character in my opinion, but all his goodness came at a point where I already lost most of my interest in the characters.ENJOYMENT: 8.7/15There were good moments in this show, but few and far between. I did enjoy the action sequences too, but not much else. Pretty average throughout.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 8/20Like I have mentioned throughout, the lack of world building made a lot of the themes dull, and the plot points insignificant and I just found myself not caring a whole lot. The show attempts to make you feel a wide range of emotions, but it doesn’t work out very well.OVERALL: 52.8/100There is some minimal enjoyment to be had here, but there wasn’t a whole lot to enjoy except for the action. If you like waifus, go ahead and give this a try, but the dysfunctional plot had me bored at times, although there were a few great moments in this show. I don’t exactly know what we were served up here, but it ends up just feeling messy and tropey. girls, check! Demons, check! Dumb waifu wars, check! Ecchi, check! Little sister, check!

Not a really interesting synopsis, and has very mediocre ratings, turns out to be probably the biggest surprise of the season. Engage Kiss got its flaws, but definitely is rated way too low.[Story - 7]I can\'t tell I don\'t have objections about the storyline. The show is mixing too many themes at once, and sometimes it\'s hard to tell, what should you focus on more. Engage Kiss isn\'t a typical rom-com, as MAL suggests. There\'s much more action than comedy (fortunately), but when comedy is present, it doesn\'t help the show at all. Sometimes this comedy aspect...in Engage Kiss is fitted poorly, so it ruins any meaning and mood of the moment. There are few emotional scenes in the story. This was something that honestly couldn\'t have been better, and made me love this show, but because of unnecessary comedy, being put before or after mentioned scene, it\'s hard to take it seriously. It was something that annoyed me the most during this anime. Action, along with romance is the crucial element of this show, and is good. The fight scenes are presented really well, with a proper approach, and because of that whole anime isn\'t boring at all. There\'s a love triangle at the beginning of the story, to become a harem, after introducing Sharon. As far, as I got no issues with Kisara and Ayano since their competition made the anime much more interesting, the existence of Sharon is pretty much useless, and because of that Engage Kiss follows the path of every generic, mediocre rom-com harem. The theme of fights with demons is pretty common in anime, but here I have really little, to no issues with it. The story in the first episode reminded me of SAO. A few episodes later, it was rather Date A Live (defeated enemies become allies, and sometimes even a harem). Kisara is basically Yuno from Mirai Nikki, but much more likable. Even though Engage Kiss is a mix of many things one can imagine in the anime, it\'s still reasonable and doesn\'t lose overall sense, which is praiseworthy.[Art - 9]Engage Kiss can easily be a flagship product of A-1 Pictures in the art category. This studio is making amazing work, when it comes to visuals, and Engage Kiss is no exception. Characters are looking really good, colours are fitting perfectly, and environments are reproduced correctly. There are little to no flaws in visuals throughout the whole show.[Sound - 8]Really good job with the sound. Even though I didn\'t find the opening theme that catchy, the soundtrack fits really well. In more serious scenes, it keeps the mood pretty well. It also builds up tension properly. The sounds during the fight are good and so is the voice. Can\'t complain![Characters - 7]It should be higher and could be a higher rating if the show didn\'t end up being a generic harem, as I mentioned in the story section. Even though I found introducing the crazy nun, quite bad, what can be said about Shuu\'s sister? I honestly don\'t know how to treat her character, cause it looks like she\'s also about to be part of the Shuu\'s harem. So basically another loli, so that Engage Kiss won\'t be much more different, than every harem, by an accident. End of the rant, let\'s examine the main characters.Kisara is by far my favourite character in the series and the fact that I find Engage Kiss enjoyable. Viewers may see her as manipulative, controlling, and not worth the trust, but her real side can be seen at the moment she gives Shuu back all of his memories, even though it means losing her own. She also genuinely cares and loves MC. Kisara always wants the best for Shuu, even if it means, she\'ll lose out on it. Kisara also shows respect to Ayano in some situations, since she knows how much Ayano means to Shuu (""You are willing to embrace a woman you do not love, to get your objective. You even discard memories of the woman you love, so you can save her""). If viewers dive deeper into her character, it can be easily seen, Kisara is a very nice, helpful, and respectful girl, which makes her really likable. This respect is shown also for Ayano, even if she\'s her ""enemy"".Ayano is another girl in Shuu\'s harem, or rather his ex-girlfriend. Her feeling, however, didn\'t change at all. She\'s still in love with her ex-boyfriend. Ayano is a pretty unlucky girl, since her boyfriend supposedly left her, because of the contract with a demon (Kisara). There\'s not much more about her backstory, other than that, Shuu was pretty irresponsible in many situations in the past. The whole thing with the harem wasn\'t her fault, but rather the immature behaviour of Shuu, but that\'s probably a topic for another discussion. Even though they broke up quite a while ago, Ayano still genuinely cares for him and tries to get him back. She\'s very stubborn, outgoing, and confident, which suits perfectly the role she has in her mother\'s business. Since her character is written on a really surface level there\'s not much more to be said.The main protagonist Shuu is a character about which I got mixed feelings. At the first sight, he seems to be pretty likable. After a while viewers can feel, he doesn\'t really care about other people\'s feelings. Yet, he uses a demon girl, only to reveal the truth about his family\'s death, and to find his lost sister. He also left Ayano, for the same purpose. But he\'s doing this all for his family? So he\'s justified? Well... Not really. At least in my eyes. His behavior can be seen as a little obsessive, and I know, it is hard to deal with losing your parents, or even your whole family. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t justify hurting other people. But hey, it is just a rom-com anime, and Ayano is pretty naive, so whatever. Besides that, Shu shows genuine respect for Miles (who is actually a pretty decently written character) and is motivated to fight every demon he encounters in Bayron City since his family died because of them a few years before. He seemed to have the best character development throughout the series.Sharon is the most unnecessary character I could ever imagine. As far as she was a decent enemy, during her first appearance in the anime, her backstory, and behaviour toward MC are at least funny. Just another girl to the Shuu\'s harem, but this time it\'s a hot nun, with pretty crazy combat skills.[Enjoyment - 9]Even if the story got some smaller or bigger flaws, I still enjoyed Engage Kiss. There\'s much romance and much action. Sometimes, viewers were able to witness some more emotional scenes too. I loved Kisara\'s character. Ayano was really good too. I liked some supporting characters I didn\'t mention before as well. The story was interesting, and I genuinely wanted to know, what will happen next. Engage Kiss did not bad as a rom-com, but unfortunately, there are many signs, that it is just another harem anime, which are countless in the market already. I still call Engage Kiss pretty original, since it does many things better than other anime from this genre. This show wasn\'t far from being extraordinary.Summing this all up. Yes, Engage Kiss is a mix of everything. This mix, however, is pretty tasty. There\'s a bit of everything here, so at the end of the day, everyone will find something for themselves. I wish more people would taste this title. Not only it is not popular, but it\'s also really underrated. What I can do, for now, is give an honest 8/10, so it will lift the rating just a little bit. in Engage Kiss is fitted poorly, so it ruins any meaning and mood of the moment. There are few emotional scenes in the story. This was something that honestly couldn\'t have been better, and made me love this show, but because of unnecessary comedy, being put before or after mentioned scene, it\'s hard to take it seriously.

The whole thing with the harem wasn\'t her fault, but rather the immature behaviour of Shuu, but that\'s probably a topic for another discussion. Even though they broke up quite a while ago, Ayano still genuinely cares for him and tries to get him back. She\'s very stubborn, outgoing, and confident, which suits perfectly the role she has in her mother\'s business. Since her character is written on a really surface level there\'s not much more to be said.The main protagonist Shuu is a character about which I got mixed feelings. At the first sight, he seems to be pretty likable. After a while viewers can feel, he doesn\'t really care about other people\'s feelings. Yet, he uses a demon girl, only to reveal the truth about his family\'s death, and to find his lost sister. He also left Ayano, for the same purpose. But he\'s doing this all for his family? So he\'s justified? Well... Not really. At least in my eyes. His behavior can be seen as a little obsessive, and I know, it is hard to deal with losing your parents, or even your whole family. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t justify hurting other people. But hey, it is just a rom-com anime, and Ayano is pretty naive, so whatever. Besides that, Shu shows genuine respect for Miles (who is actually a pretty decently written character) and is motivated to fight every demon he encounters in Bayron City since his family died because of them a few years before. He seemed to have the best character development throughout the series.Sharon is the most unnecessary character I could ever imagine. As far as she was a decent enemy, during her first appearance in the anime, her backstory, and behaviour toward MC are at least funny. Just another girl to the Shuu\'s harem, but this time it\'s a hot nun, with pretty crazy combat skills.[Enjoyment - 9]Even if the story got some smaller or bigger flaws, I still enjoyed Engage Kiss. There\'s much romance and much action. Sometimes, viewers were able to witness some more emotional scenes too. I loved Kisara\'s character. Ayano was really good too. I liked some supporting characters I didn\'t mention before as well. The story was interesting, and I genuinely wanted to know, what will happen next. Engage Kiss did not bad as a rom-com, but unfortunately, there are many signs, that it is just another harem anime, which are countless in the market already. I still call Engage Kiss pretty original, since it does many things better than other anime from this genre. This show wasn\'t far from being extraordinary.Summing this all up. Yes, Engage Kiss is a mix of everything. This mix, however, is pretty tasty. There\'s a bit of everything here, so at the end of the day, everyone will find something for themselves. I wish more people would taste this title. Not only it is not popular, but it\'s also really underrated. What I can do, for now, is give an honest 8/10, so it will lift the rating just a little bit.', ""I'm just gonna be honestAnime (9.6 so I gave it a 10)Has Good Animation, Story, and keeps you entertained through all epsMakes you sad and happy and gives alot of action.

GLAD THEY STUCK TOO THE STORY...  10 OUT OF 10 FOR THIS ANIME CAUSE ITS 9.6 WHICH IS CLOSE TO 10."", ""Engage Kiss, also known as Project Engage as the very Japanese Wikipedia page calls it, since it is a mixed-media project that got an anime, a manga and an announced game at the same time, this is definitely not the first time you see something similar to a mixed-media project that works exactly this way, and if you were tuned in for the Fall 2021 season then you should have heard of Tatk Op Destiny, I think I learned that too late. So, for a short TLDR, when you give a semi-interesting plot to an insufferable cast of characters you get what Engage Kiss is.Shu...is probably one of the least likable MCs I have seen in a while, when watching him for the first time you can see that he is some kind of lame scrounger guy that everything he does is beg people for favors and apologizing to them while being also extremely poor for making the lowest bets possible in demon hunting which irritates the other demon hunters. But then you discover he is a scrounger that is fine with leaving everything behind including his memories as long as he can know the cause for his parent’s death and to save his sister that he thinks that is still alive due to some dreams he has, doing all of this without caring about the girl that he himself admits to love (even if it doesn’t seem that much, but more about that later) or literally not caring if he remembers anything at all because the thing that powers up Kisara is losing part of his memories.Also, I wonder if this series can stop for a second to show me how much of a Casanova Shu is really, first we get that Ayano is Shu’s ex-girlfriend and that he lived with her, not long after breaking up with her he got into something with Sharon having sex with her but after dumping (read as: poisoning) her he got Kisara who he named by the name of the first girl he kissed. Also apparently he had sex after drinking and paid the hotel he and the girl stayed in with Ayano’s credit card and probably many more that weren’t mentioned, this series really went through such lengths to mention that he was with any girl on existence. And for some reason girls like Ayano are still crawling on their feet to be with Shu that she goes on her way to have sex with him again because he is just that “awesome” to have girl after girl going for him, I want to say that I feel bad for her but she is the one that is trying to keep going with that no matter how many times Shu disappoints her. No, showing your character having sex doesn’t make him suddenly good or cool, I don’t need his sexual relationships thrown down my throat as if he were a hentai protagonist.I started watching this series because a friend of mine said “hey, you like Date A Live watch this series, they are similar”, so I decided to take a watch because why not? And by the end of the very first episode I realized that this series is not like Date A Live at all. I don’t want to engage in too much DAL talking, but since it was basically what made me watch this series I’ll make a little point, just take a little comparison to the main character of Date A Live, Shidou and the main character of Engage Kiss, Shu. Shidou is a guy that lives with his sister, they are basically alone since their parents seem to always be busy, he is the one that takes care of domestic labor in the house, his power is to kiss a Spirit and seal their powers, he is a playboy that keeps around his girls to have them happy. Meanwhile with Shu the girls he knows have to do everything for him from cooking, paying his debts, etc and this is not only done from 1 girl but for 2 girls, his contract with Kisara makes it so that she gets stronger with a kiss, he is also a playboy but one who has basically no problem dumping the girls he has been with if he already did his objective with her. Now, I’m not saying that I want every MC to be like Shidou or that he is a masterclass protagonist, but really, he is far better than what I’m watching in Shu.I think the funniest joke of this series was in episode 12 when they said that Kanna, Shu’s little sister, never matured emotionally past the age of 3 and wants to kill the girls that are around Shu because she was apparently connected to him all this time in his dreams and saw how he had sex with them and that's why she is angry at them, it was definitely hilarious... but then I saw how everyone on screen was dead serious on that, I had to stop the episode for a moment to realize that it was actually 100% serious and that it was sadly funnier than the other jokes this series did.Now, now, not everything is bad, the part of the story that addressed Miles and Shu’s relationship was pretty good, I think it was nicely done the way they showed the bond between people that are not blood-related but who can have a parental relationship. The animation is also of nice quality with the sakuga going around across the fights, and the kiss scenes are really well done and animated, as I supposed you should expect from a series that has kiss in its name.Engage Kiss tried to be a normal romcom with action at the beginning, then it tried to be more serious with its plot but it failed miserably doing so by the point that even at the final battle they are making terrible jokes and even the serious stuff being unintentionally funny. The characters alone make me not want to take a look at this series since aside from Shu’s lameness and his harem they were pretty vapid to me, there’s a reason I didn’t even touch the side characters on this review, they might as well not exist and not much changes. Really, the only thing you will get from this series is some eye candy with the cool animation, but at the end of the day this is just a 3 hours commercial for the game that is still waiting its launch at the time of writing this.Thank you for reading. is probably one of the least likable MCs I have seen in a while, when watching him for the first time you can see that he is some kind of lame scrounger guy that everything he does is beg people for favors and apologizing to them while being also extremely poor for making the lowest bets possible in demon hunting which irritates the other demon hunters.

A good show to watch for sure."", ""It's ambigious to say exactly what Engage Kiss appeals to for its target audience. Most people will probably watch it for its romance context while others may find interest related to its sci-fi storyline. Engage Kiss strikes to me as a risky project because it tries many elements at once. Whether it's trying to engage in relationships with its main cast or tell a colorful story, Engage Kiss does earn its reptuation for what it sells.Perhaps the most obvious is how much romance context the anime throws at the audience from the start. From the promotional poster, preview videos, and even title itself, it's easy...to designate this anime with a romance genre tag. Videos on the Internet have spawned memes for this show, so clearly there's a target audience. The premise of the show speaks for itself that follows the lives of characters Shuu, his partner Kisara, and former co-worker and girlfriend Ayano. As you'd imagine, a love triangle is practically set up from the start between the three. That's however the least of their worries. For in this anime, it takes place in Bayron City, where we are introduced to demons known a 'D Hazards'. They threaten humanity and it's up to Shu and his partner Kisara to take care of business.Engage Kiss' first episodes clearly doesn't hide its intentions. As the title suggests, we are greeted early on with how much Kisara adores her partner. Even though they have a contract between each other that requires kissing, it's also plainly obvious that she enjoys kissing him beyond such reasons. Similarly, Shu's former co-worker Ayano displays degrees of jealousy and it shouldn't take rocket science to realize she still harbors feelings for him. From this viewpoint, the show may feel like it's also setting up for the 'three episode' rule. That means for this anime, the first three episodes can make or break for its viewers. Let me just say that if you're not a fan of generic love triangles or science fiction stories, then this anime may be worth dodging a bullet for.If you managed to get through past the first three episodes, then do be prepared for a somewhat deeper story that's been told on the surface. For intance, we learn more about Shu's past and how he's linked to Kisara and Ayano. Later on, we are introduced to Sharon, a young woman who dresses like a nun and has her own history with Shu. When watching this show, it seems Shu attracts from the opposite sex without him realizing it. Some fans may designate the anime as a 'harem' and to be honest, it does give off such vibes at times. Nonetheless, the anime does make it clear that he deeply cares about his friends. On the other hand, the relationship dynamics of this anime can be mixed. The show tries its best to sell character relatinoships, in particular between Shu and Kisara. However, Kisara's character personality often comes off as childish and even impulsive. I know the anime plays it for jokes for her occasionally yandere-like reactions, but it's hard to get behind her character when she practically throws herself at Shu whenever she gets the chance. Ayano also suffers from character development despite her connection with Shu. Being more mature than her love rival, she also displays moments of insecurity and characteristics related to a tsundere. On a fundamental, she does have geninue feelings towards her ex-boyfriend in the present timeline. In one particular episode, it's clearly obvious that she loves him but hey, Shu's got more to worry than about dating.It's hard to come into this anime with high expectations when we have Tomoya Tanaka as the director. Upon checking their resume, their most recent work 'Visual Prison' left little to be desired. Even with an established company such as Aniplex behind its marketing campaign, Engage Kiss felt like it was overshadowed by some of their recent lineup. That is to say, this anime is better watched at how you want to than what it shows. In other words, you need an open mind to truly enjoy this anime and adapt with how the relationships are protrayed. But to be honest, none of the main cast is any unique by writing standards. They're set up to carry their role as how the story protrays them to be. Furthermore, Engage Kiss supporting cast and antagonists are heavily overshadowed by our main trio protagonists. Yes, even Sharon, the badass nun we see is no match for the lips of Kisara or Ayano when it comes to getting television time.Animated by A-1 Pictures, you can tell right away it's from their studio. Let's face it, character designs does look fluid but often lack the 'wow factor'. By anime adaptation standards, I had expected this show to at least make the D Hazards look unique. Unfortuantely, it falls short and the action scenes doesn't truly impress either. However, if you're looking for some fan servicy kisses, then look no further. As the title states, you're going to see a lot of kisses being engaged between the main cast. Oh and sometimes, there's also saliva because the anime wanted to the kisses look more engaging.Engage Kiss knew its intent from the start by engaging a show about an unsettling utopia, demons, and a whole load of kisses. Mind you, that's not a flaw and it's actually quite a catchy way of getting our attention. But sometimes, you have to wonder how much is too much. Those kissing segments can be very distracting and even in later episode when the plot deepens, you sometimes forget what the anime's true purpose is about.

opinion out there,so Engage Kiss isn't the deepest anime ever but it sure is hella entertaining, and i'm a little bummed that the first episode or two has given a lot of people the wrong idea, sure it's got a bit of fanservice here and there but with the first episode and the title it feels like it's appearance is that of a highschool dxd type show, and it's damn far off,first of all, what everyone is talking about, the animation- it's amazing, there's no...world where a show like this should have animation like this but i'm all for it, the show is gorgeous from the fight scenes to the uh... *special scene* in episode 5, there's no way anyone can complain about the animationthe characters whilst not the deepest ever are all entertaining, from the mc who for the first 2 episode comes off as a little bland & probably being the weakest out of the main 3 characters, yet still being hella entertaining to see on screen, to pink haired yandere esc character, who at first literally just seems like yuno gasai, while not too far off the mark she has a fair amount of development and her design is still pleasant (even if it does wear it's yuno inspiration on its sleeves quite literally from the outfit), and finally, the best and most fun character, Ayano, who at first just seems like an uptight tsundere slowly is shown to not be very tsundere and instead just a straight up good character with a fun personality- i'm not the best at describing characters but they're basically all entertaining even if they're all built off either a trope or another character they're still unique enough in their own way to get me to enjoy watching themand finally what i'm going to talk about is the plot so a little bit of spoilers here,as i've said already the first 2 episodes are what will make people drop the show after thinking it's just a super fanservice show but then you're rewarded so much for watching till episode 3 when you start to get the plot and details gave to you and it's so good, not too deep but deep enough to keep you engaged and you get even better rewards for watching till episode 5 where the show genuinely makes you feel sad and sorry for the characters which i was not expecting at all, so if i had to summarise the show in a single sentence to get people to watch it, it would probably be- watch yuno gasai, better wrote naofumi & best girl ayano in

""Set inside a fantasy world, Engage Kiss tells a tale of the dysfunctional relationship between a demon who harbors unrequited love, and a human who is so obsessed with revenge that he goes to extreme lengths to achieve his goals.Engage Kiss is an anime that requires the audience to be cultured enough to approach the show with an open mind and not be offended by fictional anime characters even if you disagree with the way they act. The characters have been purposefully made to have a few unlikable traits and flaws; especially the male MC whose relationship with the heroine starts off as a toxic...and manipulative one. If you cannot agree that not every MC needs to be perfect for self-insert or morally flawless, then you are not the target audience of this show. I also need to caution potential viewers that despite the show being advertised as a slapstick romantic comedy, it is not the case for a good chunk of the show where it contains a significant amount of melancholic drama that is brilliantly executed to tug at one’s heartstrings. Now if you are still mentally able to accept this show, then you will come to appreciate Engage Kiss as a hidden gem of Maruto’s work.Shu is a demon exterminator who is in hot pursuit of the demon responsible for his parent’s death and finding clues to search for his little sister whom he believes to still be alive. To accomplish his goals, he needed power that significantly exceeds the capabilities of himself and his then-girlfriend, Ayano. Hence he left Ayano to form a contract with a powerful demon, Kisara. In their time spent together, Kisara has grown to love him more than anything, but her overpowering feelings are not being reciprocated by Shu who only treats her like a tool. Using Kisara’s demonic powers also comes at a terrible cost that is destroying him bit by bit, which creates a dilemma for Kisara and a strong rivalry with Ayano, who is against Shu’s method of doing things but has to accept her helplessness at the situation.The premise of Engage Kiss has been well set up to deliver a love triangle where both heroines have their own compelling reasons for the audience to empathize and root for, and to delve into the mysteries surrounding the male protagonist's tragic past. The execution of the show is excellent, and as an anime original, it has been directed in a way that takes full advantage of its weekly episodic format and lack of source material to maximize the audience’s engagement and anticipation.One of the story’s charms is that it utilizes a lot of backstories to constantly reshape the narratives of the characters. The characters were intentionally made to feel shallow initially, then given more depth as their past and motivations are revealed. My first impression of the heroine is that she is a possessive yandere succubus but later discovered that she is the most selfless person who genuinely loves Shu unconditionally and put his wellbeing above everything else. I initially thought that Shu is a useless deadbeat, but later learned that he is the succubus all along with his ability to seduce any girl and even incapacitated a nun by poisoning her during sex. We also learned how tragic Shu’s past is and that his goals are noble although the manner that he carries them out is contentious, which results in a unique character that is detestable but also someone that the audience can sympathize.The animation and voice acting are top-notch, and I have to especially give credit to Saya Aizawa for perfectly nailing her role as Kisara.  From her shiver-inducing yandere voice to her soft-as-cotton gentle tone; her ability to perfectly vocalize every type of expression and bring to life a multi-faceted character never ceased to amaze me. Her devotion to playing her role as Kisara can be seen in her social network account where she constantly talks about how much she loves the character and has even made three cover songs of Kisara.Nonetheless, the main selling point of Engage Kiss has to be the development between Kisara and Shu. Their relationship started out being one of the most dysfunctional and manipulative couples in anime and reforms towards one with genuine love and trust by the end. This beautiful relationship development has made Engage Kiss a must-watch for any romance drama fans.From the flashy rom-com first episode to the heart-tugging drama and shocking revelations in the middle, to a smooth ending, Engage Kiss has faithfully served the audience what they wanted to see – romance, comedy, action, and drama, all exceptionally well-packaged with excellent animation and voice acting into a single series. and manipulative one. If you cannot agree that not every MC needs to be perfect for self-insert or morally flawless, then you are not the target audience of this show. I also need to caution potential viewers that despite the show being advertised as a slapstick romantic comedy, it is not the case for a good chunk of the show where it contains a significant amount of melancholic drama that is brilliantly executed to tug at one’s heartstrings. Now if you are still mentally able to accept this show, then you will come to appreciate Engage Kiss as a hidden gem of Maruto’s work.Shu is a demon exterminator who is in hot pursuit of the demon responsible for his parent’s death and finding clues to search for his little sister whom he believes to still be alive.

He’s a brokeass guy who lives with a pink haired yandere girl named Kisara. (Unfortunately, many people are put off by Shuu because of the controversy surrounding him. However, if you push past that, there’s a good chance that you’ll still enjoy this anime.) Anyways, in this world there are creatures referred to as “demons”, who...are so far, the main antagonists of the series. People such as Shuu and Kisara get paid to stop these demons from wreaking havoc in their area. Genre-wise, it’s an action packed rom-com with a few elements of sci-fi.

It's like a throwback to anime from 15 years ago and your enjoyment of it will depend on just how fond you are of that era.Engage Kiss is Anime As Hell basically from the opening moments of the series. The protagonist, Shuu, is a loser that bums money from his demon girlfriend, Kisara, and he fights other demons by sloppily french kissing her to turn her into an edgy one winged goth girl. The love triangle between these two and the protagonist's ex girlfriend, Ayano, forms the core of the early...series. It sometimes gets tiring watching two cute girls argue over which of them loves a scumbag more, and you learn little about any of them through all this idle bickering. This all leads into a questionable shift in tone that ends up being a constant problem throughout the series.Around the end of episode 3, the series takes a jarring turn into tragic melodrama as Shuu's backstory and the particulars of his relationship with Kisara start to be revealed. It comes across poorly after 3 episodes of goofy romcom antics, and the series is never able to pick a lane and settle into a comfortable rhythm as it flips between these two modes for its entire run. Several episode-closing moments that are intended to be weighty and emotional are also comically undercut by the chipper opening lines of the ED crashing into the scene like the damn Kool Aid Man.Overall, I think the show would have been better served by sticking with the silly romcom stuff rather than make frequent half-hearted attempts to Get Serious in a show with a premise that's difficult to take seriously even when it's firing on all cylinders. That is exemplified by my personal favorite character in the series, Sharon Holygrail, the slutty, motorcycle-ridin', hard-drinkin' combat nun. Her mere existence is ridiculous and over the top in the exact ways that I want anime to be. The most enduringly memorable scene of the entire series involves Shuu literally poisoning his own dick and then having sex with her to paralyze her. That is the kind of stupidity I was hoping for from this series, not the kind of mediocre angst that often brings the show's momentum to a stop. Engage Kiss is at its best when it leans into comical excess and doesn't take itself seriously rather than attempting dramatic plot developments.

The title is so uninteresting that everyone has watched this anime and hoped that this was finally a good hentai. But instead, they had watched a total uninovative, so predictable garbage. The overall quality of this anime is so shitty that even my grandmom could think of a better story and title.The whole story is situatte on a small island with our main character being a total douchebag. Somehow he is clearing the city of all demons with his demon servant, with whom he has a contract that he has to give him *redacted*. It could be summarized as: Get to know a...main character a little bit (They never explain the powers and shit of his), give him an amnesia and a demon servant whom he pays by giving him his memories, some girls he supposedly somehow dated and are interested in him. Let him kill some demons. Wow, now comes his family tragic story ""How unexpected! *laughting on the floor*"". And then let him fight his sister end. So copy paste anime. I cant say anything.

Luckily a whole cottage industry of independent demon hunters has popped up whom the city hires to deal with demon attacks if the contractor bids low enough. Shuu Ogata is usually the one to win these contracts because he bids so low that he’s constantly broke. However, he has a secret weapon in his powerful, pink-haired demon partner Kisara who also happens to be head over heels for him. However, there...is a price for using her powers and it’s up to Shuu to find his missing family and take revenge on the demon who was responsible before that price is paid in full.“Engage Kiss” is a battle anime and a silly one at that. I can see this being critiqued as ‘trashy’ understandable by some, but there's a lot of fun to be had if you’re willing to raise yourself a bit above the honestly, not very low bar. The art and animation are of high quality, the action is slick and well directed, the dialogue witty and sharp, and there are not many anime where the main protagonists Yandere demon girlfriend and his tsundere ex-girlfriend fight each other to the death whilst fending themselves off from a pack of demon dogs.Shuu himself is an interesting protagonist. He’s motivated mainly by revenge and his disregard for work plus his general attitude towards those who care about him does make him come off as an asshole, but there are also a lot of layers to the story which once peeled back add a tragic nuance to his character which explains a lot of his actions.

Kisara is a total sweetheart until her man is threatened and Ayano is a straight-laced militia leader who's growing concern over what Kisara’s powers are doing to Shuu keeps her coming back to him. These two have wonderful on-screen presence and banter with each other, and they’re always a delight. Especially Ayano… for simping reasons.I can’t say much about the other side characters. They’re certainly a weaker area when it comes to the presentation of the show. Even Sharon the demon-killing nun whose introduction was very fun and memorable felt like it came a bit too late into the season to stand out.I overall really enjoyed Engage Kiss. The story does lose its way and it’s identity a bit towards the end which feels like another case of an original anime trying to over-egg the pudding in the space of 12 episodes, but I do think the ending makes up for that. The rest of the time it’s a very horny kiss of a time and I like my horny kisses.

Well, at least I was. After all, both of his most famous works were very firmly in the traditional high school romance genre: it\'s hard to imagine him writing something so out of his comfort zone. Right? Right...?Well, it turns out, Engage Kiss is a very Maruto show. He is, without a doubt, a master at playing with the conventions of the romance genre in anime culture, and Engage Kiss is no different. White Album 2 asked the...question: what happens when the high school harem protagonist grows up? While he presented a very well written, if conventional love triangle plot in the Introductory Chapter (which is the only part that got adopted into anime), in Closing Chapter and Coda he turned those conventions on their heads to present a thought-provoking tear-jerker on the meaning of love and becoming adult in modern society. On a glance, Saekano returned to those conventions, but the main heroine, Megumi, was anything but conventional. That work was a meditation on the trope characters in anime culture, and an exploration into precisely how to break those tropes. In both of his most famous works, he took those conventions that defined anime culture and bent it to his will, creating something truly unique to him.And that trend continues with Engage Kiss. Here, the question he asks is: what happens if you put those harem tropes into a serious battle anime? In this sense, the show has a lot of similarities with Lycoris Recoil, the ""other"" original show from A1 this season often compared together with it. That show tries to combine yuri tropes with battle/social critique. Yet if Lycoris started on a very high note but ended somewhat blandly, Engage Kiss is the exact opposite: it started with all kinds of cliché only to end up with a genuinely good story. What started out as trope characters, including the good-for-nothing male main character and the two love rivals who are somehow mysteriously attached to said male character, were given a lot of depth to their motivations. In typical Maruto fashion, he self-consciously creates characters based on those tropes, but then laughs at them by turning them on their head.You can feel this from the ending theme of the show, Renai Nou, literally translated as ""Romance Brain"", a term often used to refer to people who are obsessed with love and relationships. The theme couldn\'t be more fitting for the first few episodes, yet as the show progresses, it almost feels like a prank created to laugh at the viewer for assuming things based on the tropes. This is especially true for episode 9, the definite highlight of the show. The cheerful ending theme plays right after an extremely well-presented tragic scene, as if saying ""haha, got you, you thought this was a harem rom-com didn\'t you?""The show itself is filled with such jankiness. Everything are cheap on the surface, and intentionally so, but, like a playful child, Maurto just piles them one on top of another because why not? Indeed, why not? It turns out 1+1>2, and the result is a show that is consistently and incredibly fun. It\'s nothing to write home about, but if you want a solid watch, one that blends typical Maruto-ism with a battle anime twist, you will find yourself having a good time with this show. question: what happens when the high school harem protagonist grows up?

Yet, I\'ll outline my musings to guide those with akin preferences, saving them from a potential misspent watch.Story: The aimless protagonist moonlights as a ""bounty hunter,"" tackling demons alongside a demon companion, barely scraping by. Enter a demon girl cohabiting and an ex-girlfriend—still nursing feelings—pushing him along. Episodes revolve around missions veering off course, rinse and repeat.Art: Credit where due—the art holds up. Engaging fights stand out, an aspect that didn\'t falter.Sound: Neither exceptional nor bothersome, at least not in a standout genre-defining way.Characters: Our MC feels like a...diluted Cowboy Bebop version. His demon housemate echoes shades of a pink-haired, psycho-stalker a la Yuna from Mirai Nikki. Then there\'s the predictable hot, wealthy ex, cliché as can be. Not much to pen with enthusiasm here.Enjoyment: Frankly, it left me yawning. The spark of originality or excitement was amiss, failing to kindle my affection.Overall: A subpar anime drenched in clichés. Should you find solace in this genre\'s embrace and seek a boredom remedy, perhaps it\'ll suit your palate.

Brace yourself for ample fan service, zoom-ins on anime anatomies galore.', 'Engage Kiss is anime with greater potentional, but unfortunatelly it didn’t manage to utilize it that well. There is lot of scenes whereseries completely slips into mediocrity and harem cliché. Thing is there is also plenty of scenes which are commendable either plot-wise, solid fights or nicely done ecchi kissing scenes. All these made me wonder how to rate this show. I’m an average ecchi fan of some occasional fan service with some boobas, asses or kissing if it’s well done and not on children like characters as it can be goodaddition to spice things up. Needles to say that this is one of...the stronger aspects of the series as kissing feels comparatively realand ""hot"". On the other hand when fanservice is the only thing on point which can series offer it’s impossible to take it seriously.Don’t be fooled as Engage Kiss is trying to incorporate more major elements like interesting storyline, diverse characters, relationship drama and romance or sci-fi. This effort not to rely on one aspect makes it piece worth watching. The execution could be better which is the main reason of unfulfilled potential.Story: 6,5/10First of all story takes place in futuristic modern city which perfectly fits with each other more then some post-apocaliptic world like Darling in the Franxx or Chrome Shelled Regios for example, plus this setting was used so much in other shows that it’s not a best option unless it’s done in solid quality like those mentioned.Major issue of the plotline is that it’s easily predictable with a few exceptions. One such exception which I couldn’t predict was in episode 12 relating to memories of Kisara and Shuu, who watched certainly knows. Situations with predictable outcome are muchmore often whatever they are most fights, reason of Kanna fighting the girls which was by the way stupid as hell and could be more impactful than average brother complex, villians motives etc.Introduction of the world also wasn’t precise which is pitty, because more worldbuilding would certainly helped it’s plotline as such. Story jumps right into it and process to focus more on romance from the beginning and not so much on why are things the way they are and how did the world end up in this whole demon situation. In consenquence of that love story often overshadows all that major issues that the whole city is dealing with until few latest episodes.Romance, drama and emotional side of the plot are main players of the show. In comparison sci-fi elements are not excecutedas well but still done on point to be interesting enough. Whole memories losing thing makes these interactions mainly betweenAjano and Shoo more dramatic and almost heartbreaking from her point of view that it’s not just typical love drama. Also it revealsdevoted maybe little bit twisted side of an MC, who willingly sacrifices memories of his loved one to save his family without much thinking about it. Obviously it’s extremely hard choice to make and hard to say how would any of us act in situation like that, but it certainly doesn’t feel right. There are nice dynamics between Kisara and Shuu relationship which seems like he uses her mainly atthe beginning, but as story progress he shows the audience his real feelings about her.Ending was little bit dissapointing as it was typical harem-like ending where multiple girls argue about nosense in front of an MC.Characters: 6/10Characters has same issue as story and that is poor introduction. Show starts with every FL already thirstin for MC and we have noidea why except of Kisara later on. This is especially true in case of Ayano and Sharon which motives of love for an MC are unclear even at the end of the show. In consenquence it was harder to emphatize with these FLs or even uderstand their actions and affection towards Shuu. Shuu is character which has from lead characters the most vigorous character development. At the beginning he wasn’t quite likable and evoked mixed feelings of bitterness and empathy as his problems were complex and obvious, but his actions were at least questionable. In the end he was able to learn from his mistakes that in order to find someone important you can’t sacrifice everything and everyone else, because then it hurts not only yourself but everyone around you to even see you like that. Character development of others was minimal. Each of the girls is basically same as she was in first debut if you won’t count some memory loss which I don’t see as any development.Overall characters aren’t inovative in any way and their characters traits in general are similar to others from another shows. There isn’t an character which would be literally bad or unlikable to the point I would rather stick my manhood to the outlet, on the other hand there also isn’t character which would be top-notch. Still they are mostly fine enough to be likable and somehow ""carry"" the show. Most interesting characters were Miles with most impactful character development and complexity, Akino which seems mysterious and rational. From main characters pobably Kisara as she is simply most likable.Art: 8/10Artwork and animations are really well done either in fighting, shots from affar on the surroundings or just casual talking and walking in the city. Also design of the characters is stylish and smooth. There isn’t anything bad what can be pointed out maybe except the fact, that there are still better looking pieces in terms of art.This is the only reason why I won’t rate it higher as very good, because the bar for perfection is set high in nowadays anime production.Music/Sound: 5/10Music and sound effects throughout the show was on point and it fits the anime well BUT...Opening and ending was in my opinion completely appalling and I awaited my time to skip it as your average gym pump skips leg days. It was so bad that I was embarrassed when it started to play for the first time and didn’t manage to skip it in time, if my neighbours didn’t overheared this creation as it is worse then old german movies for adults. In the end my rating is average mainly thanks to the hauntingly bad OP/ED either way it was solid.Enjoynment: 6/10Engage Kiss was for quite a long time in my On-hold section almost to my oblivion. This speaks for itself as I wasn’t eager to start re-watching it at all. After doing so, show delivered me higher quality harem like anime which isn’t bad, but won’t stick in my memory either. One of the biggest positives is that I wasn’t bored during the show at all. It has mostly a nice flow which keeps you steady, but except of few rarities it didn’t evoke any deeper emotions of happiness, anger, sympathy or surprise as well.Overall: 6/10If you like classical harem anime tropes with solid animations and action go for it. Still there is a lot of plot holes, bland/cliché characters and basically nothing original in order to count it as quality anime. Most likely majority of audience will be able to enjoy emotionally and plotwise undemanging fun which is exactly what they get. The plus is you get to see well made kissing and fan service scenes which aren’t pointless this time as they are in many other harem shows.It’s deffinitely not a piece for everyone, but I would still recommend it for majority of other viewers. the stronger aspects of the series as kissing feels comparatively realand ""hot"". On the other hand when fanservice is the only thing on point which can series offer it’s impossible to take it seriously.Don’t be fooled as Engage Kiss is trying to incorporate more major elements like interesting storyline, diverse characters, relationship drama and romance or sci-fi. This effort not to rely on one aspect makes it piece worth watching. The execution could be better which is the main reason of unfulfilled potential.Story: 6,5/10First of all story takes place in futuristic modern city which perfectly fits with each other more then some post-apocaliptic world like Darling in the Franxx or Chrome Shelled Regios for example, plus this setting was used so much in other shows that it’s not a best option unless it’s done in solid quality like those mentioned.Major issue of the plotline is that it’s easily predictable with a few exceptions. One such exception which I couldn’t predict was in episode 12 relating to memories of Kisara and Shuu, who watched certainly knows. Situations with predictable outcome are muchmore often whatever they are most fights, reason of Kanna fighting the girls which was by the way stupid as hell and could be more impactful than average brother complex, villians motives etc.Introduction of the world also wasn’t precise which is pitty, because more worldbuilding would certainly helped it’s plotline as such. Story jumps right into it and process to focus more on romance from the beginning and not so much on why are things the way they are and how did the world end up in this whole demon situation. In consenquence of that love story often overshadows all that major issues that the whole city is dealing with until few latest episodes.Romance, drama and emotional side of the plot are main players of the show. In comparison sci-fi elements are not excecutedas well but still done on point to be interesting enough. Whole memories losing thing makes these interactions mainly betweenAjano and Shoo more dramatic and almost heartbreaking from her point of view that it’s not just typical love drama. Also it revealsdevoted maybe little bit twisted side of an MC, who willingly sacrifices memories of his loved one to save his family without much thinking about it. Obviously it’s extremely hard choice to make and hard to say how would any of us act in situation like that, but it certainly doesn’t feel right. There are nice dynamics between Kisara and Shuu relationship which seems like he uses her mainly atthe beginning, but as story progress he shows the audience his real feelings about her.Ending was little bit dissapointing as it was typical harem-like ending where multiple girls argue about nosense in front of an MC.Characters: 6/10Characters has same issue as story and that is poor introduction. Show starts with every FL already thirstin for MC and we have noidea why except of Kisara later on. This is especially true in case of Ayano and Sharon which motives of love for an MC are unclear even at the end of the show. In consenquence it was harder to emphatize with these FLs or even uderstand their actions and affection towards Shuu. Shuu is character which has from lead characters the most vigorous character development. At the beginning he wasn’t quite likable and evoked mixed feelings of bitterness and empathy as his problems were complex and obvious, but his actions were at least questionable. In the end he was able to learn from his mistakes that in order to find someone important you can’t sacrifice everything and everyone else, because then it hurts not only yourself but everyone around you to even see you like that. Character development of others was minimal. Each of the girls is basically same as she was in first debut if you won’t count some memory loss which I don’t see as any development.Overall characters aren’t inovative in any way and their characters traits in general are similar to others from another shows. There isn’t an character which would be literally bad or unlikable to the point I would rather stick my manhood to the outlet, on the other hand there also isn’t character which would be top-notch. Still they are mostly fine enough to be likable and somehow ""carry"" the show. Most interesting characters were Miles with most impactful character development and complexity, Akino which seems mysterious and rational. From main characters pobably Kisara as she is simply most likable.Art: 8/10Artwork and animations are really well done either in fighting, shots from affar on the surroundings or just casual talking and walking in the city. Also design of the characters is stylish and smooth. There isn’t anything bad what can be pointed out maybe except the fact, that there are still better looking pieces in terms of art.This is the only reason why I won’t rate it higher as very good, because the bar for perfection is set high in nowadays anime production.Music/Sound: 5/10Music and sound effects throughout the show was on point and it fits the anime well BUT...Opening and ending was in my opinion completely appalling and I awaited my time to skip it as your average gym pump skips leg days. It was so bad that I was embarrassed when it started to play for the first time and didn’t manage to skip it in time, if my neighbours didn’t overheared this creation as it is worse then old german movies for adults. In the end my rating is average mainly thanks to the hauntingly bad OP/ED either way it was solid.Enjoynment: 6/10Engage Kiss was for quite a long time in my On-hold section almost to my oblivion. This speaks for itself as I wasn’t eager to start re-watching it at all. After doing so, show delivered me higher quality harem like anime which isn’t bad, but won’t stick in my memory either. One of the biggest positives is that I wasn’t bored during the show at all. It has mostly a nice flow which keeps you steady, but except of few rarities it didn’t evoke any deeper emotions of happiness, anger, sympathy or surprise as well.Overall: 6/10If you like classical harem anime tropes with solid animations and action go for it. Still there is a lot of plot holes, bland/cliché characters and basically nothing original in order to count it as quality anime. Most likely majority of audience will be able to enjoy emotionally and plotwise undemanging fun which is exactly what they get. The plus is you get to see well made kissing and fan service scenes which aren’t pointless this time as they are in many other harem shows.It’s deffinitely not a piece for everyone, but I would still recommend it for majority of other viewers.', '*This review has been written when only 3 episodes came out**Minor spoilers ahead*So... Engage Kiss. I don\'t like to say this, but this was unfortunately, one of the most horrible anime I have seen this year. Now, taking into account I have only watched the three episodes that were out when this review was written, I cannot say for sure whether it will get better, but even if this anime somehow becomes a masterpiece in the next 10 episodes, I will still have my gripes with this series.Firstly, this anime REALLY does not know what it wants to be. The general rule of thumb...for anime is that you should try to include a few distinct ideas so that your anime is multi-faceted and interesting to watch, but you should not be including too many distinct ideas. This anime is currently, at least from the first three episodes, doing that. It\'s delving into a weird romance triangle that doesn\'t even get explained until episode 3, a half-yandere female mc still attending school (high school I assume), supernatural forces, politics which implement the idea of government corruption and the idea of the MC being a mindless sheep for the government, the looming darkness of the MC\'s backstory, all while repeatedly reminding us that the MC is extremely poor. I am glad that the producers are trying to incorporate different ideas to make the story more interesting, but add too much and it becomes a big messy pile of ideas. I\'m not a producer, so I have no right to judge, but my personal opinion is that the producers maybe should have tried removing some of the ideas implemented, and go with a simpler story. Otherwise, the anime can get overwhelming at times.Secondly, the exposition of this anime is honestly horrible. While I get that no one likes exposition dumps, that doesn\'t make it an excuse for the first few episodes to be this confusing. Even if the anime picks up and gets really good, it doesn\'t matter because people are going to drop this anime either way. If it really becomes a great masterpiece, then people still have to sit through 3+ episodes of very bad exposition. Why its bad you ask? Well, the anime makes no effort explaining what the relationship between the characters are, or how the demons appeared, or how demon hunters (or what they\'re called) are formed, or how the president even got elected in the first place? While I do get that the relationship was addressed in episode 3, and maybe some of these details were not revealed so early to have more of a ""shock factor"" when eventually they are revealed, we are given not even given an inkling as to what the answers to these questions are, which will confuse some people and make some people annoyed.Story- 3/10The exposition was really bad, and the anime seems to just skip to the fight scenes pretty quickly, making the moments in between the fights seem like filler episodes to be honest. And this is mostly because there was not much exposition at the start, so the entire situation was pretty confusing.Art- 8.5/10This is easily the best part of this anime. It uses a palette of vibrant colours and crisp animations to draw you in, and hey, at least for me it did a pretty good job. The character designs were also pretty good, and it didn\'t feel like a reskin of older animes. They actually had pretty unique designs. (Lets not talk about happy sugar life here...)Sound- 7/10The opening was pretty good, but I wouldn\'t say so for the ending. This is more of a personal opinion, but the ending was pretty lackluster, especially compared to the opening.Character- 3/10The characters were pretty dull and the two main female MCs personalities all boil down to both of them fighting for the MC, the only difference between them is that one\'s a tsundere, and one\'s a yandere. Oh, and they also have different hair colours. Due to... you guessed it, the bad exposition, the characters were not fleshed out that much, though I think I remember some mild dialogue about one of the girl\'s backstories, which is okay I guess. Meanwhile the MC\'s character is a bit better, he\'s not a beta male (thank you) and actually has some personality, but is in constant, barely explained debt.Enjoyment- 3/10Honestly, Engage Kiss felt like a chore to watch. It was very confusing, and was a really big mess. However, it was slightly fun to watch, due to it being quite the goofy show.Overall -4/10The animation and art is pretty amazing, which probably is the only reason why I could continue watching 3 episodes. Also, I wanted to watch 3 episodes before I could make an unimpaired judgement. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who wants to watch whatever genre this is, and I sincerely hope that the anime gets better in the next episode, because I will probably drop it if it doesnt.*please note that even though I didn\'t like the anime that much, I still have respect for the producers, and this review is in no way shape or form ridiculing them for their work.

It’s how you tell the story that counts, and Engage Kiss does a ‘meh’ job. It’s a procedural show wrapped in flimsy storylines that often make episodes feel congested. Each week there’s 1) a “monster-of-the-week” they have to defeat, 2) the steady unfolding of Shu’s past and the case he’s working because of it, 3) a sprinkle of corporate demon exterminators, 4) a detective breaking the rules to catch the bad guy, and of course 5) the love triangle. Which brings me to characters.Right now they’re...all a bit underwhelming. Yes, Kisara and Ayano are kicking ass and taking names, but there’s nothing too noteworthy about their characters. Who they are outside of Shu isn’t made clear—and that’s by design because that’s the nature of the genre/trope. But even in relation to Shu, it all feels shallow. And Shu’s charm is dwindling as more of his back story is revealed.I did like the latest episode (5) because we got to see a genuine moment of Shu sitting with his sacrifice (literally and metaphorically), and witness how it’s really affecting everyone involved with more depth. The optimist in me considers that a promising development!So, at the moment, I think the show is doing a decent job handling the congestion they created lol. While there’s dissonance between storylines, I’m surprised all these stories are cohesive at all.Overall it’s a cute show but the convoluted—and unreliable—narrative is weighing it down. So I’m still not hooked, but I’m still biting!Quick note: I really appreciate the cinematography if the visual aesthetics matter to you. The slow pans that build tension, the shift in focus to punctuate the dialogue, the quivering of the camera to convey Shu’s disorientation, etc. Love it, I think the show’s animation is beautiful.

But the thing is that it fails to even do that, i.e the basic purpose for which it is made.The protagonist of the story is a fucking loser with 0 talent and skills, but he is still able to maintain a harem of women head over...heels over him just because of his fictional privileges. Not only that, but even the side characters just revolve around the MC and have no self care/ decision making abilities. And on top of that the MC is an asshole and a hypocrite who\'s basically living controlled by his dick each turn.The fight scenes and the art being the only good thing about this garbage is what made me to stick around till the end.

It's not that it's bad, but there were some pretty big pacing flaws and just flaws with some of the characters and the story in general. To me, it was an anime with a pretty promising concept that failed to deliver on its potential.Art: 8One thing I can’t take away from it though is the fact that the art is great. I thought the character designs were a bit generic, but the animation was really stellar. Every fight scene was...also pretty hype to watch. I do think the music was kind of just okay which is my biggest issue with the art.Characters: 7Personally, I’m a bit torn with the characters. I think some of them like Miles, and Ayano were done really well, but I can’t stand behind the MC. The main character is genuinely not a good person, and I think defending him is okay, but not the number of times they did defend him throughout the anime. But it's not all bad with Shu, as I think some of his choices are a little justified to a point, and his backstory is genuinely depressing, but sometimes I felt like he went too far.Story: 5To be honest the story felt like lost potential, too inconsistent. I think there were a lot of good moments with the story, but it felt like they tried to fit too many things within the 13 episodes. I think this anime would've been a lot better if the pacing issues were solved and it just had more episodes to really explain each event that happened because at the end of the day it just felt like the anime jumped around too much which could lead to some confusion. Overall it wasn’t a bad anime, but it could've been a lot better. 6/10 also pretty hype to watch.

He struggles to find out his sworn enemy( who killed one's innocent family is unforgivable in this life) and revenge. He lives in a positive way despite his sad memory.This work is composed of battle scenes of exorcising, comic scenes of indigence in realism, and amour scenes of two girls love the young man from two hearts. Among them the love by two girls is the main theme and drives the story. In episode 4. moto-kano learned the reason his memory span had shortened from imma-kano. Since moto-kano and imma-kano...both loves him, they would cooperate as time goes to support him.The battle scenes are most exciting in the anime though, the battles are in the course the young man is chasing his sworn enemy.

The storyline is engaging, complemented by impressive animation throughout. While there are occasional moments that feel cliché, the overall narrative shows promise and room for improvement. Interestingly, I couldn\'t help but draw comparisons to the popular ""Date A Live"" series, as there are undeniable similarities. Despite initial skepticism, there have been rumors circulating about a potential continuation of the anime, especially considering the recent release of the mobile game ""ENGAGE KILL."" It\'s exciting to think about the possibilities this could bring, although I hope the show takes a unique direction rather than simply emulating ""Date...A Live"" in a more mature and ecchi manner.One commendable aspect of this anime is its mature exploration of themes, setting it apart from its counterpart. However, my primary criticism lies in the lack of diversity among the female characters\' appearances. It\'s disheartening to see that they all possess nearly identical hairstyles, with only variations in color. In contrast, the male characters exhibit distinct designs that make them visually distinct. This lack of variation among the female characters\' appearances could be seen as the anime\'s major shortcoming, potentially hindering its overall impact.

It made a good use of the episode sequencing and the MC\'s (Shu\'s) Memory flashbacks to tell the significant background events and giving it all near the end...of the anime as a drop. Some people may like this, some may not, big plot drops in 1 or 2 episodes are not always good, but imo this one did it well because of the memory plot device.Saying that this anime ""fails to have any logic in many- many things. There are just too many questions and no answers."", is simply just not a factual thing to say.

The problem here is that a overused topic was taken, and there really was no dramatic twist laid out on it, so the result is painfully average.Story: Engage Kiss takes place in Bayron City, which is built on a resource-rich field.  In fact, it's suppose to be so amazing that it should attract the attention of every civilian in the country.  Right?  Wrong!  Demons invade it pretty regularly and the city's security...hires mercenary groups to fend them off.  When a demon is spotted, the kill is essentially auctioned, and the organization offering to do the job for the least amount of money is hired.  But what is the source of all this chaos?  That's what we're trying to conclude through this weird tale, that attempts to be funny, full of action and downright silly at other times.On the base of it all, I didn't mind the central concept.  You're hiring a defense force to defend your beautiful city.  This was fine in itself.  A bunch of politics do get dragged into this as well, and even that wasn't all that bad.  It's something I don't typically like, but Engage Kiss still manages to weave it into the story.  The story is straight forward, and our characters' goals are pretty crystal clear too.  As we get through the story, we do get the inside scoop as to how our story starts to edge forward toward our goal, as an investigation team is regularly brought into a bunch of episodes.  It's executed fine and with a predictable pacing to it.One concept that was used in multiple episodes that I thought was the dumbest idea was the inclusion of the Takuhaigyousha service that our main cast member, Shuu, used regularly.  He essentially paid out of his own wallet to use a service that delivers within seconds.  Their inventory?  A stockpile of some of the most overpowered weapons seen in the series.  With no background story to work off of, why on earth isn't this group used regularly if they're so powerful, and in the hands of someone much more fit for their use.  It just feels like a cheat code and I have no idea why we felt they needed to be in the story.Another problem I had with the story is it never felt like it really progressed as we went on, save for a few baby steps.  When we're introduced to a new demon threat, you can tell it is all part of this grand plan to get you to the end, but it doesn't feel like some episodes take a big enough step.  You start to notice the direction you're going when you get to the back half of the series, and this is where the pacing starts to finally pick up.  Just, getting there, is a bit of an undertaking, due to the slow start.  The last few episodes were action pretty solid, even though I wasn't really a fan of how it ended.  (5/10)Characters: Engage Kiss has one of the weaker cast of characters I've seen in an anime series in a while now.  Shuu Ogata lost his parents and sister in a demon-related incident when he was pretty young, and he's hell bent on finding out how and why this all happened to him, including getting revenge on those responsible.  This tends to be a warning, as these kind of characters have a tendency to not have a ton of depth to them.  While that is somewhat the case here, Shuu's problem is that he's just a terrible character in general.  He doesn't take anything seriously, he ignores the financial situation he's constantly in, and seems to have no regard to the people around him.  Not only that, but when he plays dumb in certain situations, even a smack on the side of the head doesn't seem to make him get a clue.  Add to that, that he doesn't really have much in the way of strength on his own really doesn't help his case.  He's just a horrible character to circle your story around.Kisara is a demon that Shuu essentially signs a contract with in order to get his revenge, which is already counterintuitive to his goal.  They gloss over this for the most part, and isn't offensive on it's own, but she has very little depth to her.  In order to power her demon abilities, she needs to kiss Shuu.  This is because she takes his energy to fight, in exchange for giving his memories to her.  She seems to be able to control what memories she takes until she bleeds him dry.  This is similar to how the Valvraves worked in Valvrave The Liberator.  The one kink in there is that she gains those memories herself, so she essentially gets to see what Shuu gives up, including the women that he's slept with.  While the concept around her powers were fine, I just didn't care for her as a character due to a lack of depth.Ayano Yuugiri has a past with Shuu, but is also one of the companies tasked with killing demons.  She, herself, is nothing impressive to me, as she doesn't have anything special about how she fights like many of the other company's leaders have.  She simply fights with whatever guns she has on hand, mixed in with okay fighting instincts.  As a person, she gets insanely jealous of any girl around Shuu, which gets even more pathetic in the finale.  Sharon Holygrail is a nun from a group that are essentially anti-demon.  She also has a past with Shuu, and it doesn't feel like she adds much to the overall story, outside of the fan-service she brings.  It's pretty blatant, and most of her interactions with Ayano are just plain boring.  Mikhail gets introduced to the story a few episodes in, and even though he starts off as a pretty annoying forgettable character, he could warm up to some audiences when his importance to the story gets weaved in.Other side characters fair a bit better than our main group, as Tetsuya and Miles have some decent story around them.  Some background on Kanna, Shuu's sister, also eventually gets included in our story, and that all seemed okay too.  As a group though, it's just an unlikable main character and group around him that really kills the potential that the story has.  There's not enough there to cheer for them and they mostly lack development of any kind.  (3/10)Art: This series looked solid with colours that really popped during the fighting sequences.  This was most obvious during the final fight.  You still get the typical deterioration of the animation as the series carries on, which is at least a little disappointing.  Fan service starts to occur when Sharon enters the picture, and this seemed pretty misplaced.  Though, I can't say I'm surprised due to this series' lack of ability to take itself seriously at times.  (6/10)Sound: I can't say I was a fan of either the OP or ED, as they sounded too similar to each other.  The OST seemed fine for the most part though.  VO work was solid though.  Howard Wang (Shuu) plays off his character's consistent silliness quite well.  Beau Bridgland (Mikhail) hasn't been in a whole lot since his work on Genshin Impact where he voices Chongyun, but I felt he was easily the best part of the cast.  Suzie Yeung (Ayano) continues to prove me wrong, as she was pretty solid here once again.  (8/10)Overall: Engage Kiss was a slog to get through, with it's terrible additions to an overused story and unimpressive execution.  The characters really aren't a fun group and there's not a ton of people cheering for Shuu after what he'd lost, given his terrible attitude toward anything serious.  There are much better demon-related series out there, I'm sure, as Engage Kiss just doesn't have enough to it.  (5/10) hires mercenary groups to fend them off.

It has some impressive animation, some of the time, although there is a tendency to lean in a little heavy on big light flashes that don't do a good job of communicating the tactile feel, the tangible nature, of a fight. But, I've just got to say. There's very little of substance stringing those fights together. Without revealing any plot details, near the end of the series, the anime threatens to maybe introduce some interesting ideas that might cause the characters to experience real conflict. Unfortunately, it has already wasted to much of...it's run-time on it's weakest element, the love triangle sub-plot, at that point to make good on that threat. Any interesting ideas or vestiges of character growth just fizzle. Monster designs are cool and fights are flashy but if you're wanting my honest take as someone who sat through the whole series, you don't have to. you're not missing much. if you've got time to spare, sure, whatever, watch it. But there are definitely more substantial, more interesting, more fun shows that pack as good or better action.

Not only that, but He's really broke so they need money to survive.

And Regular guy Shu, start a business to get hired to defeat demons. But even though Kisara loves him he still pays a price for her help. Ayano, his ex, also helps from time to time, and clearly still loves Shu.Now the reason I'm not sure I'd recommend is the story can get a bit off pace or confusing at times. It could be because they mention important info in one line a few times and don't mention it again. But while I...think the story was good what really kept me around were the characters and the funny interactions they had with each other, and the character development. They also had some sexy interaction lol, but not too much. The season concluded in a sweet spot where you could accept it as the end, or they could make a season 2. Ultimately a good anime in my book. think the story was good what really kept me around were the characters and the funny interactions they had with each other, and the character development.

The anime lacked in showing how the hell did he suddenly choose Kisara and love her, there's no substance at all. Yes, it showed in one episode that he realized he loves her when Kisara lost her memories but the foundation of his love was not explicitly /implicitly shown in the anime, it's just suddenly he loves her and kissed her (in the forehead) in the hospital. And to add to that, the conclusion of the story is just another member to his harem. The most pitiful character here is Ayano, at...the end of the story she's still yearning for Shu, while Shu has already found a new love 😒. Shu should have at least settled it with Ayano and stop asking her for favors (he's a really worst character).And the plot isn't on the satisfactory level at all. He said at the end that it's finally over, what's really over? you just added another member to your harem. Yes, your sister is freed from the cave but she's now locked up in the city.His reaction when he first saw his sister is lacking, on the contrary you should be delighted that you finally meet your sister that you thought all your life might be dead but just when he finally have all his memories back, it's like his resolution or purpose has been degraded and what's more he fight his sister from the very 1st time he saw her.  His resolution and purpose lacks unlike what we have seen on the first few episodes.

The plot has a strong start but slowly focused more on side characters development more than the main character's, which are by far the most interesting and compelling to watch.The arc between the main characters Shuu and Kisara throughout the anime is great, with a solid backstory and continued character dynamic that carries the anime. Unfortunately, my main complaint are the countless times the anime focuses on other side character dialogue, which felt long and uninteresting in comparison.

Therefore he\'s losing his personality and at the end even some memories of his family! In other words, he forgets the very meaning of what he has been sacrificing all...this time. This and the question whether it\'s worth it at that point is building up so perfectly that it makes the viewer be so curios about how will this end.This concept is so good and really shouldn\'t be implemented in this kind of show where the protagonist basically builds a harem.The thing that went wrong is that surprisingly it\'s possible to bring all of his memories back. Which then eliminates the only above average trait this show had, and basically undoing all the good stuff about this show. That leaves us with bad characters, bad romance, unreal interactions between characters, mediocre twist, pretty good comedy to be honest and a bad story overall.In conclusion, I give this 3 stars to this anime for good comedy and nice animation but that\'s it. I honestly think it\'s impossible to rate this show any higher than 4 and it\'s a shame how easily this could be so much higher if it would take the right route. this time.

The title is completely ironic or misdirective, I guess. It was well played out and all of the build up around the last three episodes set it up nicely. It wasn't show up at the last minute and get killed at the last minute, though there was the end of the big enemy that was a bit abrupt for my liking. The focus was put on what had been directed through the entire show though, which was nice to see consistency.Despite all of those pros, there's enough about it...that just feels off. I can't exactly explain it but as I watched each episode with just like things weren't flowing correctly maybe? It's like each episode is broken up into different sections and they were kind of clunky sometimes. The animation seemed a little old school in style and color, but that didn't entirely detract out of anything other than the backgrounds. The visuals are big for me and to see just a bunch of dull, drab, same colored scenes with little vegetation over and over and over got to be just a bit much. It wasn't exactly exciting and you can see where the budget got cut.Despite reading it a 7, I have to say that I kind of have mixed feelings on it because I can see where some people would like it and others wouldn't. It's definitely not something that will ever go on my rewatch list, but it might be worth someone taking a gander at it one time around. that just feels off.

Then I saw yandere at the end of episode 1, so I assumed Mirai Nikki.Fortunately, both assumptions were wrong.If you liked Kill la Kill\'s or Assault Lily\'s action, this isn\'t quite that, but it\'s decent, as long as you like blurry lines and big explosions and swords.I like women that know what they want and are powerful. Main girl does that. Secondary girl, blue haired, reminded me of the black haired girl from Black Bullet,...but fortunately this one actually has a company and actually went out of her way to be an actual girlfriend, which is hinted at by episode 5. There\'s a third girl, a nun, that comes up later, who I swear is was created as a reference character to the priest guy (Kotomine) from Fate Stay Night.Oh, and you see a character actually get laid by context clues DURING THE ACTUAL PLOT OF THE SHOW, which is rare. You get a flashback of another woman, which is much more par for the course, but unlike other shows where it might just be fanservice and not advance the plot, the flashback is there to provide an ACTUAL explanation! Perish the thought, answering a plot hole question!I am a devotee of strong female characters in shows. This not only has headstrong and capable women as the love interests, but fortunately there are other female characters in the background, particularly around the mayor\'s advisors and the AAA company president, who becomes a reoccurring secondary supporting side character. You\'ve got plenty of potential waifu material to go around.At the end of the show, you get a happy ending. This gives it a + .5 immediately in my book.You get some minor plot holes, like what happened to Shu\'s mother, you never see the mcguffin mineral on screen, it\'s not clear how the demons actually get summoned (it\'s unclear whether it\'s Kanna\'s powers or Asmodeus\', etc.). One plot hole that isn\'t directly addressed is the ""threat of other countries"" - you don\'t see an American battleship or fighter dropping a nuke/bombarding the city, but that is definitely a reason that the story relies on heavily for some situations. The main conflict is somewhat resolved at the end, every one of the love interests is aware of how strange and silly the situation is during the final scene.I went through some of the reviews of this show, and it\'s clear that you\'ve gotta be able to follow and pay attention to the little bits of dialogue (""exposition"") if you want as many plot holes answered. It\'s not quite as detailed as say Eldenring, but there\'s literally explanations of why people ended up in certain relationships or situations because of 10 seconds of explanation, that happen repeatedly. This show expects you to pay attention, not to be on your phone, etc.A lot of reviews also talked about how it was jarring or confusion how the show jumped from serious to lighthearted and back again. I see this personally as a sign of realism - there are characters that obviously grasp the lessons of the past and how terrible things could be. Some reviews talked about how there\'s no logic in the show, which is, let\'s say, confusing of a take, as this show bends over backwards to provide interesting and action packed flashbacks to provide explanations. Another talked about how the main character was unrealistic/unlikeable/etc., which I get, if you\'re a devout monogamist, which this show openly and unapologetically laughs at.I\'m over 30, and I think that this show might be jarring for some younger viewers that may have gotten used to certain shows\' level of quality - Demon Slayer, Lycoris Recoil, Kaguya, Hunter x Hunter, etc. This is much more of a Kill la Kill show, but it\'s got more polish and a lot less jank.

You have shows like Evangelion, Death Note, and Fruits Basket, that are not just genre defining, but also (mostly) devoid of imperfections. Then you have shows like Golden Boy or Nichijou that aren’t meeting the same standards, but are equally special (to me) in their own way. Engage Kiss fits in MyAnimeList awkwardly. It’s not as legendary as Evangelion, as funny as Nichijou, or as emotionally resonating as Fruits Basket, but it ticks a lot of boxes for what I like to see in an anime. Perhaps it’s my fault for getting too invested in anime always,...thus my 1-5 ratings significantly pale in comparison to all the shows I’ve rated 6-10. Still…Engage Kiss resonated with me. The question is why?From the other reviews I’ve read, it seems several reviewers thought Engage Kiss to be shallow, lacking direction, and bereft of any true impact. I won’t argue any of that, and I wouldn’t feel the need to persuade anyone otherwise. For me though, I found the series thought provoking, degenerate in a good way, humorous to the degree that it was “cute”, and pretty well animated…if you’re not comparing it to AOT, Demon Slayer, Fate, etc.First and foremost, Engage Kiss has its flaws. Story is difficult to follow and felt rushed. It could’ve been more degenerate, funny, and deep. Character arcs could’ve been done better. This is all true, however I left this series appreciating what it did have to offer.As a brief overview, and feel free to skip this paragraph if you’ve seen the series, Shuu is our main character living in an isolated city experiencing intermittent demon attacks. Driven by his desire to discover what happened to his family, he makes a contract with a demon (Kisara) in order to fight his way to the truth. Unfortunately this contract comes with great loss…his memories. This not only effects him, but his loved ones as well. The 13 episodes explore this journey he takes with friends, lovers, and some unexpected enemies.The series never actually gets too convoluted or in the weeds. There were times I was a little confused, specifically when a specific character was referenced, but, aside from that, it’s pretty easy to follow. The story itself I enjoyed though. The concept of a human making a deal with the devil is well ingrained in history, and is executed so well here. I personally don’t think Shuu is a particularly likable main character, however I often found myself sympathizing with his situation, thus I see his presence as positive overall. I’d be miserable if I lost all the memories I held most dear of the people I cherished most. The memory loss element really resonated with me.This leads to the characters. I really liked everyone involved and felt they had impact. I usually prefer more character growth but there was enough for me to be satisfied. And though Shuu is very flawed, his interactions felt natural and understandable. Kisara, the demon with whom Shuu made a contract, is my personal favorite. She has immense character growth amidst a sea of flawed individuals. She does have bad taste in men though, but what would you expect from a demon? This applies to all of Shuu’s love interests though, not sure what they see in him.The world building is also done well. I seemed to have a good grasp on the city’s lay out, often remembering locations characters had previously visited. Demon activity and destruction held weight, with characters often referencing the economic effect of a particular battle. The city’s leadership is very present as well, giving good context as to the hierarchy of how things work. There are additionally a lot of allegories to the real world, with references to escalating technology, world politics, and even a reference to Amazon Prime. It’s a small but welcome element that helps the viewer gain more clarity on what life in this fictional world is like.This isn’t as lewd of a show as I had initially assumed, yet it still has a bit of degeneracy sprinkled in. To be honest, I was just grateful to see the characters actually kiss and hook up regardless of the motivations…Not sure why anime is always toned down in this regard but it was refreshing and made the relationships feel more realistic. Shows that have multiple seasons before the main characters even kiss irritate me (*cough* Rent-a-Girlfriend).Music and SFX are done well…that’s it on that front.The conclusion of the series was perfect imo. There are a lot of unanswered questions and brief explanations, but aside from making the series longer, I’m not sure how they could’ve resolved it any better. The story involving the sister was heartwarming and the dynamic of all the characters by the end was nice to see. I really appreciate the individuality shown in each of Shuu’s love interests. Some could’ve been expanded on, but I really enjoyed each one in their own way. They all felt profound, with some feeling slightly vapid, like with the nun (which I believe was intentional).I know, I know. How could anyone find deep meaning in a show named Engage Kiss. With titans like Evangelion, Death Note, Demon Slayer, JoJo’s, Violet Evergarden, and too many others to name off here, why would I rate this series so high? It’s simple, I really enjoyed what this series brought to the table. I loved the design and theme. I appreciated the demonic contract element that harkens back to stories in various culture’s mythology. I loved the characters, their resolutions, and their hidden (but realistic) natures. I enjoyed the series upfront approach to both relationships and missteps in said relationships. I appreciated the fact that the relationships extended beyond flirting for 50 episodes. Lastly, I particularly loved how the series concluded. My valuation may come across as flawed, but ultimately I had a great time with this series and foresee I’ll be rewatching it again in the near future. thus my 1-5 ratings significantly pale in comparison to all the shows I’ve rated 6-10.

I felt so empty watching this anime every time. At first, I wanted to watch it because I give most animes a chance. And, I was very impressed with the first episode because of the beautiful animation and potential. However, I was left uninterested by the 4th episode. I felt no connection to the characters of the show or thought any of them were interesting. And, found myself watching the anime solely because of the animation.The Problems:- Uninteresting characters (a lot of them)- the story is very boring...where in each episode the MC fights an enemy and then the MC has a few interactions with the main two girls and a few side characters.I felt like nothing really happened besides one thing (MC's sacrifice for his goal, which I won't spoil) and that's about it. No real main villains or arcs, just a repeat of the same story. I always end up dropping one or two animes each season and this might be the one. I won't recommend it unless you like these generic fighting animes with a splash of romance. where in each episode the MC fights an enemy and then the MC has a few interactions with the main two girls and a few side characters.I felt like nothing really happened besides one thing (MC's sacrifice for his goal, which I won't spoil) and that's about it.

I perhaps should not have.The show tries to be deep and hard about demons and morals and fighting them through sacrifices but then it's just a harem. Even turns out Shuu isn't that nice a guy either but at least he has progressed 5000% more than most other harem protagonists and his sister... get this... she wants to be just his sister. That shouldn't be such a shock but here we are.The art is pretty good but also sucks. Imagine showing a Cobra helicopter from the outside correctly but inside with side-by-side seats.The sound...hasn't really got anything that needs a surround sound which sucks, it is all I want!The characters are all very generic and have a specific trait whether they are a nun, a girl that can't get over someone, or a demon. Oh and a sister that only wants to be a sister which again is crazy unusual!The show has a city of autonomy run by dictators. It has private military units that do what they want for money. Demons with a half-arsed reason for being bad and then a main character who isn't really a nice person generally but is tricked over and over with his harem. For a part of the show, I thought Shuu has this deep sacrifice but then I realized perhaps not. Oh and the sister who wants to be just a sister, again crazy! goes from being the most powerful you can ever know to then after the power of love and friendship being just a normal girl that could kill everyone again.It is your generic let's try and fail to camouflage a harem behind as little smoke as possible. It is not the first and will certainly not be the last of its kind. 6/10, it is honestly not the worst show just not the best. hasn't really got anything that needs a surround sound which sucks, it is all I want!The characters are all very generic and have a specific trait whether they are a nun, a girl that can't get over someone, or a demon.

Which is often one of the laziest and worst ways to grade something. If you automatically think of harem when looking at every show, you are most likely someone whowants an insert an agenda into entertainment and have it ruined like what is happening to western entertainment at the moment.

It\'s a ridiculous show where the waifus all battle due to their association with the main character, which gradually worsens later.Issue 1: The plotThe storytelling in this original series makes you think as if the writers just pull some disgusting waste out of their \'god-knows-what\' hole to shove some confusing and boring story down your throat. It also has plenty of downtimes, what does it use...that for? Making you listen to dozens of expository dialogue that are supposed to relate to the plot, and if you don\'t like paying attention to the awful story it has to present, you can always look at Kisara, the main waifu who also doesn\'t care about the story either, providing you fanservice whenever that fails.The love triangle or to be clear, the love centre is where 3 waifus seem to fight for the ownership of the degenerate fiend that exists in Bayron City, as I have stated earlier. This rivalry is hard to watch honestly since Shu doesn\'t seem to want any of his relationships to end and lets all of his girls get their hearts broken because of the dumb decisions this guy does.The action, on the other hand, is good. The problem is that the plot started to shift towards waifus being at each other\'s throats and betrayals coming out of nowhere more often rather than demons posing a threat to their beloved city. Shu\'s problem somehow becomes the whole entire city\'s problem. I wonder how no one decides to ban this guy from the city since every problem that happens in this anime stems from Shu himself.Along with the story, it also has some drama to provide you with. It\'s a melodramatic fest where climaxes are all filled with ""So, Shu is this hardened, filled with vengeance guy. Therefore, we need to always provide him flashbacks and screentime so that people can understand him better when we replay it for almost every episode."" Of course, we should have sympathy for a guy who screws around his waifus for his main motivation, he is a character we can root for. Whenever something climaxed (I\'m not talking about THAT S one), he for some reason remembers himself and immediately transforms into a vengeful hero who\'s out for redemption.While the other characters have some drama, they always have some relation to the main character, as if they can\'t exist without him, despite being the problem child itself.Issue 2: The charactersThe waifus are a definition of tropes fighting to see which suits better. Is it the older woman and childhood friend, who should know the main guy better out of the three? The demon girl, who is a yandere and dresses up as a school girl only for it to be irrelevant in the next episode that is also a century old? Lastly, the nun, being a part of the assassin\'s organisation, despite having no sort of backup after losing due to plot armour. Which one will win? Of course, none, because in the end, it doesn\'t even matter. Because they get roped into Shu\'s mess and are expected to clean up his mess.Some characters suffer from a lack of screen time, like the Hachisuka sisters, who are nowhere to be seen after the first few episodes. While some don\'t seem to stand out since they are constantly overshadowed by the main character and his overgrowing problems behind him. Mikhail\'s story is different to say, he initially was written to be a comic relief character, but his personality changes into a radical route where you can\'t believe he\'s the same guy who was persistent on Kisara.Issue 3: The fanserviceName one action scene that doesn\'t have fanservice in Engage Kiss. Every scene makes sure to sparkle some of it, even the minor ones. Sharon doing her martial arts? Get ready for suggestive shots of what lies underneath. Kisara fights a demon? First, watch her claiming her eternal love for the fiend and kiss like the world isn\'t about to end. Ayano gets attacked? Watch physics wiggle her whole body whenever she gets pushed around and make you wonder how is she not dead yet.End of review:Ultimately, this is a poorly written show. I prefer you go into it, ironically enjoying it as a hot mess. I don\'t have anything else to say other than the fact that it should be clear this is how you should avoid writing.

gdgd Fairies,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11809/gdgd_Fairies,"['Holy crap! I mean who thought that an anime with poor CG graphics, bland setting straight out of saturday mornings girls\' cartoon and an animation studio nobody has ever heard of, could actually be kinda... good?In my case, it all begun with a youtube video ""Piku Shiru Can\'t Stop"", which is a mash-up of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song and gdgd Fairies. I found it strangely entertaining and annoying at the same, and after a while I noticed that the 2nd season was among the on-going series. I watched some random episode and was pleasantly surprised how amusing it was, and right after got...hooked on the 1st season.To make it clear, this is no My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic kinda series that was targeted to little girls, but somehow grown men got around watching it. Gdgd fairies\' forte is the constant flood of references and humour, most of which younger audiences wouldn\'t get in all its Japanese weirdness.Most episodes go by the same formula: The opening, sitting around a table chatting (plenty with sit-com humour and tsukkomi), the room of might and magic (I think it was called something like that), where the fairies e.g. invent new sports such as bungee jumping from space and trying to catch a bread roll with your mouth at the same time. This represents the more physical and weird type humour much like the one you see in Monty Python.Then there\'s also the magic spring that serves as a Teletubbie Screen that shows us another worlds that bear frightening similarities to Garry\'s mod videos. Then the seiyuus try to improvise and dub over these videos of naked old men soaring through the sky. This is literally improvising so the characters\' ways of speech chages notably. The voice actors do a great job.Finally, after the ED, is the next episode\'s preview, which actually is just a spoof of some popular anime such as Haruhi, Higurashi or Oreimo. It\'s way too easy to miss these, considering the relatively high entertainment value they have.Overall, this is a better anime that anyone could reasonably expect. It\'s strange and funny as hell, but the animation is nothing to speak about and storyline non-existent. Many will definitely think gdgd fairies is just plain awful, but as many or more willl find it strangely addicting. Just watch some random episode like I did and find out. hooked on the 1st season.To make it clear, this is no My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic kinda series that was targeted to little girls, but somehow grown men got around watching it.

Just watch some random episode like I did and find out.', ""Comedy in anime can feel tired at times. Even the best series the genre has to offer will sometimes fall back on tropes that have been done a thousand times, whether in parodying them or outright playing them straight faced. That's not to say comedy anime is bad for this reason (it's one of my favorite genres), but sometimes the idea of watching a series completely out of left field in its comedy and presentation can feel refreshing and be a nice break from the same old stuff.And this is why I love gdgd Fairies, a show that has legitimately made me laugh out loud...harder and more frequently than any other anime series out there. The simple episode structure, excellently crafted jokes, unique visual style, likable characters, and overall fun atmosphere of this series work towards my considering gdgd Fairies a 10/10 show, meaning I love it on every conceivable level, which I will discuss here.Each twelve minute episode of gdgd Fairies follows a three-part formula: the opening conversation bit, the Room of Spirit and Time, and the Dubbing Lake. The show follows pretty closely to this structure, though there may be an episode or two where one segment is cut out to make room for another one to be longer, and the final episode is completely fucking insane and does not follow the structure at all: you are not prepared for the final episode of season 1 of gdgd Fairies.A typical episode of gdgd Fairies starts with the three main characters—the innocently dumb pkpk, quiet and mysterious krkr, and the more extroverted and cheeky shrshr—sitting around a table, drinking tea, and talking about some mundane topic, such as sleeping, sneezing, etc. While these conversations usually start in a reasonable place, they inevitably spiral out of control into hilariously imagined scenarios, which are visualized by the bizarre cast of background characters (which I will discuss later).While the scenarios in these segments are funny in their own right, what really sells them is the chemistry of the characters. Despite being in a “cheap kids show”, the three main fairies are all adorable and lovable, each with a distinct yet realistic personality (none of the characters have gimmicks—they're all just dumb kids that feel real, not gag characters). Much like in a show like Lucky Star or K-On where a lot of the appeal is watching cute, authentic characters interacting with each other, pkpk, krkr, and shrshr are always a joy to watch on screen together, with dynamics that feel more realistic than many other more gag-oriented comedies.The second segment of an episode of gdgd Fairies sees the three characters go into the “Room of Spirit and Time”, where their magical powers are greatly enhanced, allowing them to play batshit, absurd games that often reach massive scale. The scenarios presented in the first segment may be out there, the absurdist humor is pushed even farther in this segment, with some of the most unforgettable scenes in any comedy anime out there (shrshr launching herself out of a cannon to knock down over 600 old men stands out in my mind).And finally, an episode of gdgd Fairies ends with the Dubbing Lake—a segment where the three fairies watch a short, silent, and strange clip and then make dialog based on what is happening in the clip. These scenes are often the funniest and some of the most memorable of the show, as the dialog here is actually improvised by the voice actresses themselves.Watching the voice actresses fall in and out of character, playfully jab at each other's good or bad attempts at comedy, and often make genuinely gut-busting dialog makes the whole show feel like it was fun to make and work on in a way no other anime can. The voice actresses themselves almost feel like characters themselves, and learning about their own unique personalities and habits inform how we perceive the characters they portray. This extra bit of metanarrative makes the experience feel completely unlike any other anime out there (well, I say “unlike any other anime out there”, but there have been other series in this vein that have tried the same style of voice actresses improvising, like Straight Title Robot Anime and Tesagure Bukatsumono, but to a much lesser effect—I did not find either of these anime to be nearly as engaging as gdgd Fairies).Now, if you've even looked at the poster for this show, you're probably thinking that there is one glaring aspect to this anime that I have yet to talk about in depth, and that is the way this show looks. Yes, gdgd Fairies is a low-budget CG kids show, but the fact that it is a cheap-looking CG show is part of what sells it so hard for me.A lot of the comedy of gdgd Fairies is absurd, surreal, and just fucking weird, and the uncanny and unconventional artstyle of the show is able to capture the insanity of what is happening on screen better than any more traditionally styled show. While the main girls all manage to be adorable moe characters in their own unique ways, the “background characters” (stand-ins during games, “actors” in the Dubbing Lake, etc.) are all weirdly realistic looking, and the contrast between these real-ass looking people in their weird-ass situations makes the comedy that much funnier. Watching shrshr mow down 600 anime-looking old men is not as distinct and instantly memorable as watching her mow down 600 realistic old men. Absurdist comedy anime like Nichijou are funny in their own ways, sure, but there's just something about the contrasting, uncanny visuals of gdgd Fairies that really stands out to me.Overall, gdgd Fairies is a unique anime that I love in every way. Sometimes anim can feel monotonous in terms of its visuals and content, and gdgd Fairies just exists in its own little bubble that feels untouched by anything else anime has ever tried to do. It's its own beast, and whether you absolutely love it like I do or just find it weird and offputting, I definitely think checking this show out worthwhile, just for the novelty of it. There is no other comedy anime out there that I have found to be so consistently funny, creative, and unique. It feels like gdgd Fairies has a goal in mind—to be an insane, absurdist clusterfuck of a comedy series that will leave you completely baffled by what is happening on screen, but not at the cost of sacrificing fun likable characters or solid comedy—and not only accomplishes it, but goes even further to add little details that aren't needed and metahumor and 4th wall breaking character depth.If you are in the market for an original, hilarious comedy anime, definitely give this one a watch.(note: I've given the Story a 10 and Sound an 8, but I'm equating story to content and therefore comedy and including voice acting in sound because the score is nonexistent, or at least I never noticed because it's not really necessary to fully enjoy this show. harder and more frequently than any other anime series out there.

The scenarios presented in the first segment may be out there, the absurdist humor is pushed even farther in this segment, with some of the most unforgettable scenes in any comedy anime out there (shrshr launching herself out of a cannon to knock down over 600 old men stands out in my mind).And finally, an episode of gdgd Fairies ends with the Dubbing Lake—a segment where the three fairies watch a short, silent, and strange clip and then make dialog based on what is happening in the clip. These scenes are often the funniest and some of the most memorable of the show, as the dialog here is actually improvised by the voice actresses themselves.Watching the voice actresses fall in and out of character, playfully jab at each other's good or bad attempts at comedy, and often make genuinely gut-busting dialog makes the whole show feel like it was fun to make and work on in a way no other anime can. The voice actresses themselves almost feel like characters themselves, and learning about their own unique personalities and habits inform how we perceive the characters they portray. This extra bit of metanarrative makes the experience feel completely unlike any other anime out there (well, I say “unlike any other anime out there”, but there have been other series in this vein that have tried the same style of voice actresses improvising, like Straight Title Robot Anime and Tesagure Bukatsumono, but to a much lesser effect—I did not find either of these anime to be nearly as engaging as gdgd Fairies).Now, if you've even looked at the poster for this show, you're probably thinking that there is one glaring aspect to this anime that I have yet to talk about in depth, and that is the way this show looks. Yes, gdgd Fairies is a low-budget CG kids show, but the fact that it is a cheap-looking CG show is part of what sells it so hard for me.A lot of the comedy of gdgd Fairies is absurd, surreal, and just fucking weird, and the uncanny and unconventional artstyle of the show is able to capture the insanity of what is happening on screen better than any more traditionally styled show. While the main girls all manage to be adorable moe characters in their own unique ways, the “background characters” (stand-ins during games, “actors” in the Dubbing Lake, etc.) are all weirdly realistic looking, and the contrast between these real-ass looking people in their weird-ass situations makes the comedy that much funnier. Watching shrshr mow down 600 anime-looking old men is not as distinct and instantly memorable as watching her mow down 600 realistic old men. Absurdist comedy anime like Nichijou are funny in their own ways, sure, but there's just something about the contrasting, uncanny visuals of gdgd Fairies that really stands out to me.Overall, gdgd Fairies is a unique anime that I love in every way. Sometimes anim can feel monotonous in terms of its visuals and content, and gdgd Fairies just exists in its own little bubble that feels untouched by anything else anime has ever tried to do. It's its own beast, and whether you absolutely love it like I do or just find it weird and offputting, I definitely think checking this show out worthwhile, just for the novelty of it. There is no other comedy anime out there that I have found to be so consistently funny, creative, and unique. It feels like gdgd Fairies has a goal in mind—to be an insane, absurdist clusterfuck of a comedy series that will leave you completely baffled by what is happening on screen, but not at the cost of sacrificing fun likable characters or solid comedy—and not only accomplishes it, but goes even further to add little details that aren't needed and metahumor and 4th wall breaking character depth.If you are in the market for an original, hilarious comedy anime, definitely give this one a watch.(note: I've given the Story a 10 and Sound an 8, but I'm equating story to content and therefore comedy and including voice acting in sound because the score is nonexistent, or at least I never noticed because it's not really necessary to fully enjoy this show."", ""gdgd Faeries is a bizarre comedy. In the sense that I couldn't find a Studio listed for it. It was directed by Sugahara Souta, who's done some stuff I've never heard of & written by Ishidate Koutarou, who has also done some work on things I've never heard of. I have no idea what to expect, so let's dive right in.Story:We follow three faeries, Pikupiku, Shirushiru & Korokoro as they boldly hang around a forest and chat. There are four basic types of gags in this anime. In the first, the three faeries sit around a stump with tea and just have strange comedic conversations...on random topics. In the second, they go to the hyperbolic time chamber... I mean “room of mental and time” which resembles but is legally distinct from the similar area of empty space from Dragonball. In this room they basically play around with magic in absurd ways. The third type of comedy we get is the faeries gathering around a magic pool that let's them see into other worlds. And then the actresses ad lib responses to the random CG videos they're shown. The final type of gag comes with the next episode previews. Basically, instead of doing an actual preview they parody some other anime.The comedy in this tends to be of the really rapid fire variety. Whatever's happening on screen, the japes come out at a pretty continuous pace. The comedy is also very hit and miss. When it's working, it's amusing enough but when it doesn't work it drags. During the conversation segments, for example, they might just ramble about something that isn't funny but you can tell they're trying to have some punchlines in there. The saving grace, when that happens, tends to be Koro coming in and just derailing the whole thing with a comedic non sequitur. You might get four minutes of a kind of boring conversation before that happens but it's something. The magic practice suffers a slightly different hang up. In those segments, they like to have more elaborate set ups leading to bizarre outcomes. The problem is that sometimes they just go on with one beyond the point where there was any good material for it. There are other times that the jokes end up being pretty obvious which isn't something you want in comedy that heavily relies on absurdity. The ad-libbed segments are actually my favourites. The actresses are quite clever at coming up with things to dub over the videos with. They're also clearly having a good time doing it and their cheer is more than a little infectious.Characters:This is one of those comedies where the characters are very simple but they complement one another pretty well and there are plenty of comedic opportunities to explore with their interactions. Which is good since this anime is mostly spent on the interactions.Art:There's no denying that this anime is pretty damn ugly. The CG looks like something you'd find from a particularly lazy Newgrounds animator. I thought Kemono Friends looked kind of bad, but compared to this it looks pretty decent. At least that series had more movement and more varied backgrounds. Then again, it probably wouldn't be practical to have the ad-libbed scenes in a work that put things like time & effort into the animation. So, maybe it's worth looking like they could have bought a single pack of gum if they used the entire animation budget.Sound:The main actresses of this give some good performances and not just with their improvisation skills. We've got Akesaka Satomi, Mizuhara Kaoru & Mimori Suzuko. The music is... it's okay. It's not a soundtrack you're likely to listen to outside of watching the anime but it serves its purpose.Ho-yay:There really isn't any. None of the conversations the trio have ever indicate anything that might be beyond friendship.Final Thoughts:So, that's gdgd Faeries. Overall, it's a series that looks pretty shit but it's not bad at all. It has its funny moments and both the characters and actresses work off of each other well. Is it one of the funniest anime you'll ever see? No. It's not an uproariously funny anime in general, to be honest. It's more one where the comedy is enjoyable and you can chuckle at it, when it works. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If it sounds like it could be your type of humour, I'd encourage you to try an episode or two. It may well work for you better than it did for me. Next Week I'll look at Twilight Q, no relation to a certain notorious book series. on random topics. In the second, they go to the hyperbolic time chamber...

Curiously, CGI exists in many forms, such as VRchat-based and MikuMikuDance-based anime. One of such MMD productions is Gdgd Fairies. This anime shows us the mental struggles of three little fairies called PikuPiku, ShiruShiru and KoroKoro (or more accurately, pkpk, shrshr and krkr), friends who gather everyday on a giant tree in the Fairy Forest to play around. In a formulaic but-not-quite manner, almost every episode starts with the fairies getting together for tea time, talking about their day, fun things they did or trivial things they\'ve noticed about...their daily lives. This always sparks a small discussion which goes completely off rails once their minds start brainstorming all kinds of solutions to scenarios they\'ve cooked up, such as ""Need an unusual hobby with a twist? Why not watch theater buildings instead of the actual movies?"", all illustrated humorously.Afterwards, it\'s time for the Dubbing Lake, where the girls switch through dimensions on the other side of a lake, TV style. The problem is, since they\'re merely watching a reflex of the other side, there\'s no sound. And so they dub over whatever\'s on the other side of the lake in turns, from a naked Saitama-ish dude farting through the skies to a fat lady dancing in lingerie as buildings collapse around her. This segment is highly notable for one reason: The voice actresses are not specifically in-character; they\'re ad-libbing through the entirety of each Dubbing Lake. We get to see their raw selves laugh, crack studio in-jokes nobody could hope to understand and say (hilariously) awkward things constantly with no script, with their characters animated accordingly. In the second season, the Dubbing Lake is replaced by a similar segment with even more ad-libbing goodness.Finally, we have the Room of Mental and Time, a magical room which amplifies the powers of the girls, allowing for infinite possibilities. At the end of every episode, the trio comes up with some kind of seemingly simple game or challenge which always descends into absolute chaos. This includes lauching themselves out of cannons to see who can knock over the most (not real) old men in a straight line (for reference, krkr knocks over 749 old men!), figuring out how to get people to watch your livestreams by showing them some magic, and doing a scavenger hunt while bungee-jumping from space. Again, this is a MMD anime, but if you were to watch this segment alone you\'d think it was actually made in something like Garry\'s Mod due to how creatively crazy it gets with its usage of the 3D models.Using the format to do things that would be impossible through regular animation and with a really special kind of narrative where we get to see the voice actresses bond with each other well beyond their script, Gdgd Fairies shows us that CGI doesn\'t exist solely to cut costs (CGI cars and the such in 2D anime are absolutely disgusting by the way) and that in the end, substance reigns over style especially in a medium where not everything can afford to look good. their daily lives.

Gi(a)rlish Number,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32607/Giarlish_Number,"['♪ Rookie seiyuu, availability is first, acting comes in second ♪Everyone. please meet the cynical sister to Sore ga Seiyuu!, Gi(a)rlish Number!.Gi(a)rlish Number is another one of those workplace animes like SHIROBAKO or for more precise for this review, Sore ga Seiyuu!, this time it looks at the voice acting, light novel and anime industry through the lens of cynical narcissistic Chitose, in comparison to Sora ga Seiyuu\'s Futaba Ichinose optimistic ones.The main group of seiyuu\'s Chitose Karasuma voiced by Sayaka Senbongi (Koutetsujou no Kabaneri as Mumei, Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku as Claire Kokonoe), Koto Katakura voiced by Yui Ishikawa (Shingeki no Kyojin as Mikasa Ackerman,...Qualidea Code as Canaria Utara, Owari no Seraph as Shigure Yukimi), Yae Kugayama voiced by Kaede Hondo (Handa-kun as Miyoko Kinjou, 91 Days as Luce Lagusa), Kazuha Shibasaki voiced by Saori Oonishi (Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka as Ais Wallenstein, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata as Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Shiougeki no Souma as Hisako Arato) and Momoka Sonou voiced by Eri Suzuki (Amanchu! as Hikari Kohinata, flying witch as Chinatsu Kuramoto, Heavy Object as Milinda Brantini) felt like caricatures as the ACTUAL seiyuu\'s and their careers, such as Kazuha Shibasaki and Momoka Sonou being some recent veterans into the industry and knows all the pitfalls and perks to the industry (as Eri Suzuki and Saori Oonishi have been in the industry longer just by seeing their voice acting roles) compared to the newbies like Yae and Chitose. Though Chitose\'s parallel to Sayaka Senbongi a bit with Gi(a)rlish Number actually with Sayaka Senbongi being casted in Koutetsujou no Kabaneri as Mumei (a lead role), similar to her being one of the leads in the in-universe Gi(a)rlish Number plot. Koto Katakura as Yui Ishikawa felt like it was what happened with Yui Ishikawa in Shingeki no Kyojin and her gaining knowledge from the industry from a ""hit anime"" and that transferred into Yui Ishikawa\'s character. It\'s just LA\'s meta-thoughts about Gi(a)rlish Number and the obvious reasons of LA wondering about the voice acting industry.Meta-talking aside, LA wants to delve into the characters themselves. Shall we?.Let\'s start with Momoka and Kazuha, for the most part they are the sempai\'s to Yae, Chitose and Koto, they to have some cynicism in the form of their parental issues with being a seiyuu. Momoka and Kazuha have a bit of duality when it comes to their parental issues and becomes a major focus for the both of them. See Momoka\'s mother is a famous seiyuu and Momoka herself being brought up into the same industry as her, she is effectively put in the shadow of her mother when it comes to Momoka\'s job as a seiyuu, this contrasts quite well with Kazuha\'s more resistant parents especially Kazuha\'s father who dislikes Kazuha being in ""fanservicey"" acts with her job and wants her to quit, this kind of duality with both Momoka and Kazuha helps develop these characters for the most part and as much as it opens up both Momoka and Kazuha, their personalities are pretty much the same by the end of it. Next is Yae and Koto. Yae doesn\'t get the best character development with her being a rookie like Koto and Chitose and she effectively becomes the cheerleader to Chitose by her arc and not much else. Koto is the exposition fairy and mild comedic relief and also has the same position as Yae another cheerleader for Chitose. Now with all this Chitose this and that. It\'s time for Chitose, she is LA\'s favourite character and pretty much has the last half of the anime to herself along with the shady, don\'t give a crap Kuzu-P and his name is apt at that. Chitose gains a great deal of character development, all from how she see\'s the industry, as for her to gain popularity and not caring how she\'ll do it and quite the narcissistic, cynical behavior to go with it might LA add. Her character development really grows from what would happen if a seiyuu gains popularity but falls from grace quite quickly as the in-universe audience too quickly fades Chitose as a ""main lead"" from a ""shitty anime"". Thinking back on it though the circumstances isn\'t exactly the same, it reminds LA of real life seiyuu\'s like Yui Kondou to Asami Imai to Mari Nakatsu and hell even Ikumi Hayama who went through something like this fading from popularity after some main leading roles. Really Chitose\'s development as a rookie seiyuu and her experiences as one isn\'t all rainbows and easy pickings on the next roles she gets, bringing in the cynicism of the seiyuu industry.Gi(a)rlish Number also jabs in how the current (as LA writes this review) landscape of light novel adaptations anime are been looked at also with the same cynical look at ""anyone can write, but not everyone can act, what good are light novel authors if all they do make hack stories that gets made into anime boom"" and very quick jabs at the light novel industry as well as the main anime the Gi(a)rlish Number cast are casted in is a light novel anime with abyssal production values due to...well Kuzu-P, on speaking of which.Kuzu-P voiced by Kazuya Nakai gets something of a simultaneous character development along with Chitose bringing in the parallels to each other but for Kuzu-P on the producer side, his character development fall from grace and slow gains afterwards is nothing but what happens when a producer only cares about money and not the overall product of the anime and he\'ll drag EVERYONE one else down just to get his ambitions done with.....he does get ""better"" with the help of Chitose but only ""slightly"".Really both Kuzu-P and Chitose reigns in the statement that yes the seiyuu industry is a rather harsh and brutal industry and that even ""wasted potential"" from a person with horrible personality can still have the potential to do great, cynical but uplifting for those in this brutal industry that we as the audience especially outside Japan, don\'t get an honest look at this brutal industry.In terms of diomedea, the anime is full of moe, however LA will bring up this point about the moe and the cynicism ""clashing"" with each other. The moe in LA\'s eyes does NOT clash with the cynicism from the characters, if anything the moe helps highlight the fact that it is using moe which is a prevalent style in the anime industry to appeal to the demographic as being ""cute and nothing else"" to actually utilizing this same style to show that moe is being manipulative and cynical much like how the characters are being portrayed and their own cynical intentions of the ""moe anime industry boom"", it\'s not a detriment or clashes as it makes the point of using moe as their own antithesis to point out the cynical nature of the anime and it\'s own jabs at it\'s own industry. Ok with that rant out of the way, the moe aesthetics if anything is pleasing to the eye and the character designer QP;flapper with it\'s bolder, moe and colorful designs made the character designs overall one of the best things about the animation.Well LA is gonna talk about voice acting in a voice acting anime, well what can LA say but favourite character = favourite seiyuu, it goes to Sayaka Senbongi as LA really loved Chitose\'s narcissistic and snarky attitude for the most part and used for all the jabbing at the other characters she did, but also given Sayaka range gave her a chance to do DRAMA at the same time. LA will quite honestly say that the voice cast did a 100% really, from Kaede Hondo to Yui Ishikawa, Eri Suzuki and Saori Oonishi and the more gung-ho characters like Kuzu-P\'s Kazuya Nakai and Namba Shachou voiced by Kenyuu Horiuchi, the CEO of Number One Produce and even Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as...himself???...huh they pulled a Sore ga Seiyuu with that one. Nonetheless, the voice cast is great in Gi(a)rlish Number and to be expected from an anime about voice acting!Gi(a)rlish Number is another one of Wataru Watari\'s (Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru., Qualidea Code) original cynical creations and that blatantly shows, but having a cynical look at an industry that is more or less that is under wraps and hardly told to us about in greater detail but shown in a brutally honest yet cynical side of it\'s industry through the eyes and manifested in Chitose went through is somewhat refreshing take on the ""workplace anime"". Gi(a)rlish Number with some odd yet cynically encouraging theme of even a horrible person with a horrible personality wants to be in an dog eat dog industry like being a seiyuu can still have the potential to be a great one if one can apply themselves and move with the flow of the brutal and cynical industry they work in instead of being left behind. Qualidea Code as Canaria Utara, Owari no Seraph as Shigure Yukimi), Yae Kugayama voiced by Kaede Hondo (Handa-kun as Miyoko Kinjou, 91 Days as Luce Lagusa), Kazuha Shibasaki voiced by Saori Oonishi (Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka as Ais Wallenstein, Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata as Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Shiougeki no Souma as Hisako Arato) and Momoka Sonou voiced by Eri Suzuki (Amanchu! as Hikari Kohinata, flying witch as Chinatsu Kuramoto, Heavy Object as Milinda Brantini) felt like caricatures as the ACTUAL seiyuu\'s and their careers, such as Kazuha Shibasaki and Momoka Sonou being some recent veterans into the industry and knows all the pitfalls and perks to the industry (as Eri Suzuki and Saori Oonishi have been in the industry longer just by seeing their voice acting roles) compared to the newbies like Yae and Chitose.

Nonetheless, the voice cast is great in Gi(a)rlish Number and to be expected from an anime about voice acting!Gi(a)rlish Number is another one of Wataru Watari\'s (Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru., Qualidea Code) original cynical creations and that blatantly shows, but having a cynical look at an industry that is more or less that is under wraps and hardly told to us about in greater detail but shown in a brutally honest yet cynical side of it\'s industry through the eyes and manifested in Chitose went through is somewhat refreshing take on the ""workplace anime"". Gi(a)rlish Number with some odd yet cynically encouraging theme of even a horrible person with a horrible personality wants to be in an dog eat dog industry like being a seiyuu can still have the potential to be a great one if one can apply themselves and move with the flow of the brutal and cynical industry they work in instead of being left behind.', '{Razovy}[NO SPOILERS]First of all I want to say that I consider this anime not only to be the best of this season (fall 2016) but also to be one of the best I\'ve ever seen! If you like a feel good show about funny characters trying to make it in the world of voice acting than this anime is definitely for you!Story 10 / 10The story itself starts out with Chitose who, with the help of her brother / manager, is making her big deput as one of the main characters of a new anime. She\'s awful at first, but gradually gets better by learning...from her fellow actors / friends.What struck me as odd when taking a look at the genres after finishing this amazing anime is that the only genre included is ""slice of life"". The great thing about this anime is not just the interaction between the characters but also the amazing jokes and the drama (that will definitely surprise you since it starts out very mellow and fun).As I said before this show is a feel good show and one of the best out there! Normally when I watch the last episode of an anime I feel bad since it\'s over (or relieved when it was awful), but when I watched the last episode of Girlish Number I sat there with a smile on my face, looking back at an incredibly wonderful experience!The plot itself was amazing but slow moving at times which I\'m sure could bother some of you (one of the few flaws this anime had). This is unfortunate as I think that the writers could have spend some of the screen time on more interesting things...Characters 10 / 10The characters are AMAZING! Although Chitose was the main character, I felt a connection with every single one of them, especially Kuzu-san, who to me will always be a very memorable character. In fact, I could watch this whole anime again just for Kuzu alone! What I mean by this is that every character was very interesting: I\'m sure that for every character, major and minor, a whole new anime could be created, that\'s how good the character development of this show is. Every character gets enough screen time to make them interesting and at the end of the show they all seem to have made great progress, which leaves you with a very satisfying feeling.Art 10 / 10Now this is of course very personal, but when I think of amazing art I think of Girlish Number. It\'s really colorful, the character design is amazing and the backgrounds were beautiful! Since art is incredibly subjective I\'ll keep it short: when I think of anime art, this is what I want to see.Sound 8 / 10I like the OP theme so much that I\'m listening to it right now while I\'m typing this! The ED theme is awesome, and the OST of the show is great too. Giving the soundtrack a 10 would be an exaggeration since I can name a few other anime that have a better soundtrack then Girlish Number, but nonetheless the great OP theme and the nice OST still deserve an 8 out of 10.Enjoyment 10 / 10If you couldn\'t guess this score you weren\'t paying attention while reading this XDI REALLY enjoyed Girlish Number and loved every minute of it! I will never forget this wonderful anime and to be honest, since I\'m finishing up all the anime of this season (fall 2016) I think I\'ll rewatch this one before Winter 2017 starts to experience these great characters once more!Overall 10 / 10For anyone who likes slice of life this is a no-brainer: watch this great anime because I\'m sure it\'ll leave a smile on your face just like it did with me. For the people out there who have little experience with the slice of life genre or aren\'t really a fan I still recommend this one to you guys. Why? Because this show could change your view on the slice of life genre completely with it\'s funny cast of characters, beautiful art and great soundtrack!Overall I rate this anime a 10 out of 10. And as the OP theme song starts playing again I want to thank you guys for reading my review!

Its sickeningly ideal group photo as the flagship header of the title would lead most seasonal anime consumers to think that the title is nothing other than another skin-deep value-less moe title that does nothing other than behave incessantly saccharine throughout its entire cour. Girlish Number couldn’t be farther from that reality, definitely not with Wataru Watari’s writing credits.While Watari procrastinates indefinitely on releasing that highly anticipated yet elusive Volume 12 of OreGairu, he’s been keeping himself busy with other works such as Qualidea Code and this season’s Girlish Number. Typically when established writers...deviate from their staple series and comfortable genres there tends to be a noticeable dip in quality; but is that the case with Girlish Number? Does this title fail to reach the heights Wataru’s other titles do? The answer is simple: no.The first attractive feature of Girlish Number definitely is the cynicism of the characters. The only reason I picked this title up is because of a familiar author, and within five minutes of the first episode, Wataru’s cynical character writing stuck out like a sore thumb, and it was amazing. Every single character in this show is despicable. Petty, jaded, distrustful, two-faced… there aren’t enough descriptors out there to perfectly paint how morally disgusting these characters are, and I find myself hooked. This title is filled with those stupidly beautiful yet equally stupid group of teenage girls peppered in every high school that say “wow girl, you look hot as hell today!” only to think to themselves “I can’t believe this bitch wore that today! What a slut!”As amusing as that comparison is, it should paint a good picture as for the type of characters there are in Girlish Number. On paper, they are not likeable characters; they’re everything we’re raised not to be like. Yet, because in the real world nobody is as idealistically perfect as they’d like to be, the brutal (and maybe even excessive) honesty of these characters is refreshing and, by extension, likeable.Though don’t be fooled into thinking this show is some sort of one-trick wonder, with only the cynicism of the characters to justify my score of 7; no, there is far more to it. In fact, the whole cynicism appeal to the show is exploited and frankly dried up by the third to fourth episodes. More than the excessive honesty of the characters, Girlish Number is a show about growth. Growth of character. It’s a huge part of the show, almost everyone in the cast is clearly stagnant at a point in their lives—or rather, careers—and Watari explores the ball and chain that holds them back, as well as what they do to sever them.The show is set in the Seiyuu industry, a facet of the anime-production industry that while is popularized by the number of idols within it, the specifics of it still remain blurry. And Girlish Number explores that in great depth as well, exposing the disdain held by Seiyuu against Light Novel authors (otherwise known as “people who don’t have the talent to sing, draw or dance trying to cling to the industry”); exposing that nobody cares about the ED song and all the glory is in the OP song; exposing the cutthroat competition to stay active in the voice acting industry, and far more subtleties that are engaging to learn about. It’s also worth mentioning the finesse in which Girlish Number exposes these things, there is no explicit, talking-to-the-viewer breaking the fourth wall exposition nonsense (looking at you Yuri on Ice), nor is there that one dumb character who has to get everything explained to them as a form of exposition. The exposition is nested within the dialogue of the characters and Wataru trusts the audience will be smart enough to pick up on these things.Furthermore and finally, Girlish Number does a great job of capturing and exploring all the nuances that come when working in any workplace environment. Professionalism, imitation, flattery, achievement, satisfaction, and a lot more concepts are all also explored. Characters who do not take their job seriously, characters who do not work hard and slack off, characters who socially engineer their way into friend circles, characters who find enrichment in their duties—these are all people who you could find, and probably have found, in any working environment. It goes without saying of course, but the occupational hazards that come with being a voice actress/actor are also revealed through the show’s runtime.The visuals are superb. Vibrant, memorable colours that couldn’t be more appropriate. The sickeningly optimistic colour palette juxtaposes exceptionally well with the inherent cynicism and diluted melancholy present at any given moment.Girlish Number is perfect for viewers who seek something a little different; it’s not extravagantly unique, but it’s unique enough to be always engaging. The pessimism of the characters is charming, the exploration of an unknown industry absorbing, the nuances of a workplace relatable, and the growth of character heartfelt. It’s a pleasant show, one that highlights Wataru’s character writing and versatility, and one that sheds some long overdue light on a concept and industry that’s so interesting it’ll make you question why something like this wasn’t already made before.I hope this review was informative and helpful. deviate from their staple series and comfortable genres there tends to be a noticeable dip in quality; but is that the case with Girlish Number?

So instead of talking about artists or writers like so many other anime do, Gi(a)rlish Number focuses on the one very important aspect that hasn\'t really cropped up in this bloom of insider anime.  Seiyuu.Story: Our story begins with Karasuma Chitose, a very exuberant and confident rookie seiyuu...who finds great pride in her ability and skills.  Wanting to be a strive and become a very popular and very recognized voice actress, she one day is given a heroine role for a harem series known as KuuSure, thus boosting her ego and starts paving the way for her eventual success as a seiyuu.  Or does it?On the outside, Gi(a)rlish Number looks like a flowery look into the anime and manga industry given its cheerful and colorful artstyle, the main plot point being a rookie getting her big break, and the joyful and pleasant OST.  But as they say, looks can be deceiving.  In truth, Gi(a)rlish Number shows us the pitfalls and struggles of climbing to the top of the Seiyuu world, further emphasized by what happens when anime is poorly produced.  These struggles encompass the entire span of the series\'s runtime and become its main plot points, which is all well and good.  But there\'s one thing that this show suffers from.  Subplots.Mostly focusing on other Seiyuus aside from Chitose and various members of the side cast like the producer, Kuzu, and the author of Kuusure, these subplots mixed into the show produce results that could be argued as lost potential.  For a show that tried to create an overarching deconstruction story about a rookie seiyuu and the kind of business the anime industry is, I\'m not really quite sure why they decided to try and shove in more stories about other members of its cast.  A couple of them worked out, like the ones involving other seiyuus, but the rest were half-assed and incomplete.  The show builds up quite a bit of backstory for a variety of cast members, but never pulls them through enough to feel complete or fulfilling.  Which honestly is a shame, since a few of them were honestly worth exploring.Ignoring the middle area of the series where the subplot plague begins, the main story is arguably one of the series\'s best points for one reason.  Character development.  Because the show focuses so hard on Chitose and her transition from a rookie to a \'main role\' seiyuu, a lot of the runtime is devoted to her change in attitude and her eventual blossom into what can be summarized as a step forward in the right direction.Gi(a)rlish Number is a tricky little thing.  While looking pleasant and jovial on the outside, the show hits the head on the nail to some hard truths and a reality that many people have to face.  It\'s not a completely happy anime, and it doesn\'t have a happy end, which is something that a lot of insider industry anime don\'t really show that happens more often than not.  Its got a plethora of unfinished subplots, but putting that aside, Gi(a)rlish Number ended up becoming a surprisingly good show that personally, I\'m glad to have seen.Overview:+ Great main plot+ Good character development+ Good touch of reality (compared to other inside industry anime)-  Too many subplotsCharacters:  Characters in Gi(a)rlish have a weird love them/hate them vibe about them where you support them in their endeavors in one scene, then possibly hate them in the next.The biggest contributor to that notion is one of the biggest problems and benefactors of the series, our egg shirt queen, Karasuma Chitose.  (Like seriously, that egg shirt though.  She has a bunch of those things.  What is your wardrobe, Chitose?)  I said earlier she was exuberant and confident, right?  Let\'s see what other adjectives can describe her.  Narcissistic, overconfident, two-faced, selfish, and stagnant.  Did I miss any?  No?  Ok.  While seemingly cute on the outside, Chitose is in fact, an asshole.  Her poisonous demeanor consistently plagues the series as the episodes roll by, and her laid-back attitude towards anything work related is so nonchalant that it often clashes with the progression of the story as other characters work to push the project forward while Chitose lies on the couch sifting through forum posts that praise her.  But honestly, I think that\'s why her character works so well with this series.  She tells the tale of ""Getting what you deserve"" and spends the latter half getting meaningful progression in the right direction.  She\'s not special, and the show knows that, ultimately creating a main character whose dream unfortunately have to be shot down and be grounded by reality.  Her story feels very real, and that\'s why personally, I find Chitose to be such a great character.As for the rest of her Seiyuu co-stars...not so much.  There\'s Kazuha and Momoka, the popular veteran seiyuus who have a subplot devoted to each of them, Koto, who\'s the veteran who clawed her way to become popular, and Yae, who\'s just...sort of the moe blob character, actually. Due to the majority of the character development being so focused on Chitose, the rest of the characters ironically have to fight for scraps (even though they\'re in a much better position in the show) if they want to tell their story or have any kind of personal struggles.  As characters, they did their part, and I don\'t really have any complaints about what they did in the series, but there is a huge gap when compared to what Chitose got.Karasuma Gojou, Chitose\'s older brother, is the one member in the side cast that I really wish got more than what he received.  Acting as Chitose\'s manager for the majority of the series, Gojou is introduced very early on with being a Seiyuu who eventually quit and switched over to a managerial position.  And they don\'t tell us why.  It\'s a little detail that bothered me so much throughout watching the series because the show makes a commendable effort to make it sound and seem important without giving much detail as to why there was this sudden switch.The rest of the supporting cast involves the variety of characters who make up the \'corporate\' part of the series.  Now this is the section of the cast that I personally really, really hate.  Adding another depth of reality to the overall span of this anime, these characters, particularly Kuzu, give us the inside look to the dark side of anime production, where the business of making money becomes a lot more important than fan reception or dedication to the craft.  This predominantly exists in the first half of the series, but is still pretty sprinkled in throughout.  Their actions speak for their personalities, and begrudgingly, I have to admit is well done despite how loathsome these characters truly were.  (I also feel bad for that author.  Getting shat on through no fault of his own.)Overview:+ Chitose (She may be a bitch, but goddamn was she well made)+ Good side characters that contribute to the scope of the series-  Lacking character traits for the majority of the cast-  Subpar subplots hurt charactersArt: Produced by Diomedia, the art for Gi(a)rlish Number is very colorful, crystal-like, and bright.  (And reminds me very much of a P.A. works show)  Boasting a bright, moe-like art style, the art if both fluid and pleasing to look at, which really contrasts the true nature of the show\'s content.  The characters are nicely designed, the backgrounds are well drawn, and the overall quality is so good that I really have no complaints about the show\'s aesthetics at all.  (Except that one in-series PV that they made for Kuusure, though I\'m sure they intentionally made it look like shite.)Overview:+ Great artSound:  Adding to the illusion of a bright and happy anime is the show\'s OST, which I must say, has some pretty dark lyrics when you translate them.  Both the OP and ED are cheerful, bright, and happy which are pretty good songs to listen to with a bit of catchiness to them.  Which is nice.  Something memorable is always good.But I have to give Senbongi Sayaka special commendation.  She did a good job voicing Chitose, both encapsulating the shitty voice acting that her character does in the series and the dynamic and egotistical nature that would make you want to punch her in the face because of how awful of a person Chitose is.  She\'s also a rookie with a track record similar to that of her character (which I hope was intentional), and given how well she portrayed Chitose, I hope to see her more in the future.Overview:+ Somewhat memorable songs+ Chitose\'s voice actressPersonal Enjoyment: Gi(a)rlish Number is a weird anime for me.  It\'s one of those shows I both loved and hated watching, yet still anticipated the next episode for because I wanted to know what was happening next.  Personally, I see this show as ""The one arc in Shirobako they never did"", as Gi(a)rlish Number is about Seiyuus, the one character in Shirobako that they never really touched on.  Combined with the scarily realistic nature of the show, Gi(a)rlish Number became that one show that I latched onto, and one of those pleasant surprises (or unpleasant in some cases) that I never thought I would obsess over.Did I enjoy this anime?Again, I don\'t know what to say.  Admittedly, with all of the praise I\'ve been singing about this show, it really has become a show that I\'ve come to like.  I suppose aside from the obvious aesthetics, the main story and Chitose herself really became parts of the series that I really liked simply because of how grounded in reality her situation really is.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Aside from the obvious asshole characters (yes, even Chitose herself), there really isn\'t much that I actually hate.  Sure the writing hurt to watch at times, but that was mostly because it was stuff that could actually happen.Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re looking for something really out of the ordinary that\'s also really good, or you\'re a fan of inside industry anime like Shirobako or Bakuman, then I\'d say Gi(a)rlish Number is right up your alley.  Just fair warning though.  It\'s not a happy story, almost nothing for our main character goes right, and Chitose can get REALLY annoying REALLY fast.  But trust me, if you can get past her initial hubris, you\'re in for a really unexpected dark horse of a show that had way more than it seemed like it had to offer. who finds great pride in her ability and skills.  Wanting to be a strive and become a very popular and very recognized voice actress, she one day is given a heroine role for a harem series known as KuuSure, thus boosting her ego and starts paving the way for her eventual success as a seiyuu.  Or does it?On the outside, Gi(a)rlish Number looks like a flowery look into the anime and manga industry given its cheerful and colorful artstyle, the main plot point being a rookie getting her big break, and the joyful and pleasant OST.

It\'s a little detail that bothered me so much throughout watching the series because the show makes a commendable effort to make it sound and seem important without giving much detail as to why there was this sudden switch.The rest of the supporting cast involves the variety of characters who make up the \'corporate\' part of the series.  Now this is the section of the cast that I personally really, really hate.  Adding another depth of reality to the overall span of this anime, these characters, particularly Kuzu, give us the inside look to the dark side of anime production, where the business of making money becomes a lot more important than fan reception or dedication to the craft.  This predominantly exists in the first half of the series, but is still pretty sprinkled in throughout.  Their actions speak for their personalities, and begrudgingly, I have to admit is well done despite how loathsome these characters truly were.  (I also feel bad for that author.  Getting shat on through no fault of his own.)Overview:+ Chitose (She may be a bitch, but goddamn was she well made)+ Good side characters that contribute to the scope of the series-  Lacking character traits for the majority of the cast-  Subpar subplots hurt charactersArt: Produced by Diomedia, the art for Gi(a)rlish Number is very colorful, crystal-like, and bright.  (And reminds me very much of a P.A. works show)  Boasting a bright, moe-like art style, the art if both fluid and pleasing to look at, which really contrasts the true nature of the show\'s content.  The characters are nicely designed, the backgrounds are well drawn, and the overall quality is so good that I really have no complaints about the show\'s aesthetics at all.  (Except that one in-series PV that they made for Kuusure, though I\'m sure they intentionally made it look like shite.)Overview:+ Great artSound:  Adding to the illusion of a bright and happy anime is the show\'s OST, which I must say, has some pretty dark lyrics when you translate them.  Both the OP and ED are cheerful, bright, and happy which are pretty good songs to listen to with a bit of catchiness to them.  Which is nice.  Something memorable is always good.But I have to give Senbongi Sayaka special commendation.  She did a good job voicing Chitose, both encapsulating the shitty voice acting that her character does in the series and the dynamic and egotistical nature that would make you want to punch her in the face because of how awful of a person Chitose is.  She\'s also a rookie with a track record similar to that of her character (which I hope was intentional), and given how well she portrayed Chitose, I hope to see her more in the future.Overview:+ Somewhat memorable songs+ Chitose\'s voice actressPersonal Enjoyment: Gi(a)rlish Number is a weird anime for me.  It\'s one of those shows I both loved and hated watching, yet still anticipated the next episode for because I wanted to know what was happening next.  Personally, I see this show as ""The one arc in Shirobako they never did"", as Gi(a)rlish Number is about Seiyuus, the one character in Shirobako that they never really touched on.  Combined with the scarily realistic nature of the show, Gi(a)rlish Number became that one show that I latched onto, and one of those pleasant surprises (or unpleasant in some cases) that I never thought I would obsess over.Did I enjoy this anime?Again, I don\'t know what to say.  Admittedly, with all of the praise I\'ve been singing about this show, it really has become a show that I\'ve come to like.  I suppose aside from the obvious aesthetics, the main story and Chitose herself really became parts of the series that I really liked simply because of how grounded in reality her situation really is.What didn\'t I like about this anime?Aside from the obvious asshole characters (yes, even Chitose herself), there really isn\'t much that I actually hate.  Sure the writing hurt to watch at times, but that was mostly because it was stuff that could actually happen.Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re looking for something really out of the ordinary that\'s also really good, or you\'re a fan of inside industry anime like Shirobako or Bakuman, then I\'d say Gi(a)rlish Number is right up your alley.  Just fair warning though.  It\'s not a happy story, almost nothing for our main character goes right, and Chitose can get REALLY annoying REALLY fast.  But trust me, if you can get past her initial hubris, you\'re in for a really unexpected dark horse of a show that had way more than it seemed like it had to offer.', '[6.5/10]_____________________________________________________________________________________________________The last thing I was expecting was a show about people. Rather, a show about humans. It\'s very common in anime, whether it\'s due to subs or the mediocre writing, that characters feel detached from what you would imagine people to be like. That\'s why it\'s so easy to ""act"" like an anime character, because the very concept is so cliched. Just become loud, abrasive, and energetic and talk about some pseudo-philosophy. For the most part, you just encapsulated every single action-anime protagonist. Or maybe be an understated cool-kid that pretends he doesn\'t care but really has a heart of gold. There, you got the...other half. Obviously i\'m over-exaggerating and joking, but to every joke there\'s a nugget of truth.Why is acting like an anime character so easy? Why is ""acting"" like a person so hard? Well, because, to put it bluntly, anime characters are very rarely like people. Especially in anime shows. That\'s not necessarily a bad thing, you may not want to watch a show to see ""people"", but that distinct void is there.  It\'s more common that these characters are just a combined jambalaya of quirks that could maybe fool you into thinking they are people. But if you ever extensively knew any real person, you\'d know that a person doesn\'t fall under specific quirks as their entirety. Much like a cake, a person isn\'t just the frosting. Quirks are the frosting.If you aren\'t following me, please read on. The point here is that for whatever reason, characters in anime are distinctively inhuman in the way they talk, act, and react to just about anything. I find it very hard to relate to an anime character. Of course, ""an anime character"" is a broad way of saying, ""characters which I\'ve seen in anime.""They are often incredibly exaggerated in a specific direction. Direction being a metaphor for personality traits. If a person is shy, an anime character literally can\'t speak to people properly. If a person is courageous, an anime character would jump in front of a train to save a hedgehog. If a person is mean, an anime character will spit in your cereal and cum in your eyes.This exaggeration may make mundane situations more interesting for a lot of viewers, but for someone like me, it cuts off any relate-ability, which is a crucial aspect in creating likeable characters. Mind you, it\'s not mandatory, but in many cases, likeability stems from the ability to connect to the character you like. You can relate to a situation or a character. I\'ve related to situations in anime, but characters have been difficult to me. No character that I\'ve seen has had the depth of someone like Walter White, from ""Breaking Bad"", but more specifically, no character has had the personal relate-ability of almost any character from a show like ""The Americans"" or anything like it.Depth does exist. But that depth is usually lacking emotions. Look at Monogatari. Relate-ability may exist, however, it lacks interest....So Girlish Number is kind of a black sheep for me. Which is why it surprised me so much. It\'s a flawed show, yes, but the biggest thing I got from it were the characters. Just how fascinatingly real they were. Instead of that obvious over-exaggeration (which, truth be told, was prevalent in at least one or two of these characters), the show goes for calm, flowing dialogue that didn\'t try too hard to make you laugh or cry. It felt real.For everything the show did wrong, and it did really drop the ball on a few things. Girlish Number finished with spades in the characters department. It\'s very hard to finish the show and try your best to act like some of the more developed characters here. Why? Because apart from quoting quotables, you can\'t really ""act"" like a person without exaggerating on quirks. I can exaggerate on these character\'s quirks. But that\'d be like scooping off the frosting and saying it\'s a slice._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[The Curious Case of Satire]So this show follows a group of generally unlike-able girls as they venture into anime voice acting. This set-up, naturally, is rife with possible satire. If you noticed, I never really mentioned the story of the show because surprisingly it kind of drifts into the background.This show, for as cynical as it was about the industry on occasion, never really developed much of a bite. The anime industry has so much inane and awful shit in it that for a show trying to be cynical and biting, it hardly did any of that. Which is a bit of a disappointment since I doubt there are many shows out there that would be critical of this.The story is pretty much character oriented, rather than plot oriented. A bunch of unlike-able girls mediocrely voice-acting a shitty idol-bait anime is, as I said, interesting, but it never really goes anywhere. It was the backdrop to the character-driven story at the forefront....That being said, there still is satire to be had. But instead of the industry being under the microscope, it\'s the concept. They poke fun at how shoddy the marketing is, how little actors have to go off of and how overworked the animators are. But by poke fun at, I mean gently tickle from afar cause this was some very easy satire.Satire, at its most effective, is something that needs to have punch to be memorable. Look no further than South Park, and then compare that to Family Guy. The reason South Park is still making headlines isn\'t just because it\'s very ""in the now"", it\'s because it\'s utilizing satire to its maximum potential. The format is very simple and easy to reproduce, so the writers try to go whole-hog with creating some incredibly harsh criticisms of modern day life.Here... not so much. What\'s a bit disappointing about the satire in Girlish Number is that the show isn\'t over-the-top enough to become obvious satire, so they instead have to pretty much have characters explain what\'s wrong. Which isn\'t really effective. In a few cases, you find yourself sort of high-and-dry when it comes to the shows more cynical segments._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Colorful Girls in a Bleak World]I\'d be remiss if I didn\'t dedicate a segment talking about juxtaposition and character design. In a show that\'s supposed to at least somewhat mirror reality with production, the show had this very odd choice of making the main characters, specifically the girls only, be extremely colorful doll-like beings in appearance.I\'m very torn on this subject because I feel like it either misses the point of the entire show, or perhaps bites a bit too close to the plate when it comes delivery. What I mean is that if it\'s the designers making these girls purposefully colorful and ""magical"" looking to parody elements within the show, then fine. However, the show never really discusses anything like this. It\'s left up to interpretation, and this kind of interpret-able writing and design choices aren\'t really thematically appropriate with the kind of story being told.One of the characters, Momoka, straight up looks like a magical girl in most scenes. She belongs on screen with Madoka, not Chitose. Which really juxtaposes these cool-colored environments with these bright and vibrant characters. Especially since the males, for the most part, are left realistically portrayed design-wise....The design folds hand-in-hand with the animation, which is thoroughly mediocre. Especially towards the end of the show, where it often felt rushed, visually. There was a lot of filler images and an abusive amount of still-images to convey time. These characters were made to perform (like idols, i\'m guessing), and pretty much each one of their performances was just still-images of them ""dancing"" and ""singing"" with this elevator music playing the background.I get creating a real song is tough. Especially making it believable. But this is just one of those things that if you put a bit more effort into the show you could be left with a more rewarding product. Songwriting in anime is another really easily parody-able concept and it was woefully ignored.That being said, the animation does stand out on occasion. Especially when it comes to character close-ups. Which the show uses sparingly. What I mean is that the director brings the camera way up to the character\'s mouth and we get this shot of them speaking or reacting. Lip syncing is done very well here.But... those shining moments are generally padded with poorly synced sequences and scenes that felt a bit empty in sound design. A character would place a coffee cup on the table and the sound of the ceramic hitting the wood would be louder than anything in the room for whatever reason. These audio issues could\'ve been fixed with just a bit more editing.This show criticizes and, to a certain extent, parodies rushed anime. However, it is a rushed anime. That being said, I don\'t hold it to that fault. A show can be something but still criticize it to an interesting and funny extent. This show, on occasion, does succeed._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Characters]So lets talk about the most important part. The characters and their interactions, and in some cases, their stories made this show feel significantly more fulfilling than it had any right to be. Especially since a lot of the plot aspects felt kind of tedious. For example, these are voice actors and they talk about voice acting throughout the entirety of the show. Yet we hardly ever get to see them actually voice act! I, for the life of me, can\'t figure out why the hell they\'d cut any voice acting from the show about voice acting!In certain scenes certain characters would say like, ""Oh X had a bad day acting today!\' and we\'d be thrown through a loop because we don\'t know if she\'s lying or if she\'s telling the truth. We didn\'t actually get to see the session! Not even a little!...That being said, the characters do truly shine. As I said in my introduction, these characters felt more like real people than just about any television anime characters I\'ve seen. Especially Chitose, Shibasaki, and Momoka. Ironically, the most out-there characters with the nuttiest designs felt like the most grounded and human people. Their conversations were often very appropriate and natural.When writing a conversation you want to make the scene flow. This is done through directing, editing, sound design, and dialogue. Girlish Number really does impress with the dialogue. In one episode, two characters headline for the entirety of it\'s running. They simply walk around a location you haven\'t seen before and chat. They talk about what I would expect people in similar situations to talk about and not once did I feel like I knew where the conversation was heading due to plot necessity. That\'s some damn good character writing.The show is at its best when it has a slow-moving, dialogue driven, somber tone. However, it still does comedy well. While this show very rarely made me laugh out loud, I will say that it has some of the most relaxed delivery I\'ve seen in a show that does try to be funny. Which is so rare, since most anime has this very abrasive reaction-oriented comedy that gets old very very fast.In Girlish Number, characters would chat and if their conversation turned comical, then fine, if it turned serious, then fine. What matters is it felt believable. In a show about humans in a distinctly shitty industry, that\'s pretty much the best thing this show could\'ve done....The development feels pretty spectacular too. Since this show\'s focus is definitively on humans, then the development must not only feel natural, but feel realistic in execution. I may argue that it got a bit too corny towards the end, especially within the last ten or so minutes. But for the most part, Girlish Number knew exactly where to bring its characters.It, or I should say, the writer(s) understand that people are inherently flawed and don\'t just change because the plot demands it. Or that other people demand it. People are set in their ways. Since this is understood here, the development feels realistic to me. Our protagonist is pretty much an asshole. And not in the way where she\'s either over-exaggerated for comedic effect or so under-exaggerated that she\'s simply an asshole because people says she is. She\'s genuinely kind of a self-righteous brat that is unlike-able. The fact that this show does that so well makes her like-able though.I much rather watch a show about a human being being a human being than some self-insert bullshit trying to pretend it\'s not a harem. Humans are very interesting creatures because they don\'t just harbor four different quirks. Even when this show does fanservice, and it does, it does so in a fairly tasteful way. The camera doesn\'t linger and it doesn\'t go places where it shouldn\'t. For example, there\'s a beach episode and instead of... well, being a beach episode, it went into the territory of being self-deprecating. Making fun of how fake it all was, with these voice actors acting like moe girls and how the fans eat it all up.What\'s kind of ironic about all this, as I mentioned, is that these voice actors are in fact moe girls. Which makes me feel very strangely about the entire purpose of this show. The writer(s) can\'t be this unaware of the kind of marketing this show is criticizing it\'s doing itself. But then again, does this self-awareness have any merit? What is it saying? These are questions I don\'t know the answer to, and as I said again, these open-to-interpretation ideas don\'t belong in a show like this....This show constantly addresses the idea of being aware of your own personality. Especially in our protagonist\'s case, where she\'s an asshole, and becomes aware of this. But that\'s a part of her human nature. That\'s who she is. If she were to change, or try to, what would that do?These dilemmas sit very oddly in a show like this. It\'s main marketing point is that it has cute girls being voice actresses. Yet it offers so much more in terms of actual character than it does animation....Much like real people, conversations have this looping feeling in this show. Not like French-new wave looping, but more like previous conversations play a part in new ones. I get that that may feel like an obvious writing technique. What I mean, specifically, is that even minute details are brought back as in-jokes and references. Not by the writers to the audience, but characters to characters, which really surprised me.Tonally, the show stays consistent, but it often doesn\'t really know where to take certain secondaries. While most of the primary characters are developed quite well, the secondaries either feel like caricatures or nobodies. Which is a minor flaw in the character writing. We have people, in-show, that act so over-the-top and nuts that it may be funny, but doesn\'t really fit in context with the rest of the show at all.Much like the battle between design and message, the battle between human and character is also prevalent._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Conclusion]So it\'s far from a perfect show. It\'s definitely a surprising one, however. What I was expecting was a show about cute girls being voice actors. I was also expecting it to be a more biting of a parody than what it ended up being.What I did get, however, was a very scenic and poignant show about human nature and the way people are. Imperfect. Every member of the main cast is imperfect. Some more so than others, but in the end, they all have their flaws. The ending was a bit too cornball for me and I would\'ve loved it much more if they ended on a bittersweet note.Chitose was a great standout, with Shibasaki and Momoka being honorable standouts of the main cast. While their designs were absolutely strange in the world, their humanity shined through. The character melodrama was surprisingly well-handled for an anime, too. Maybe it was because I was coming off some incredibly lame and corny melodrama-filled shows, but I was thoroughly impressed with just how realistic the reactions were to certain situations.Nothing felt over-exaggerated for drama. Everything felt perfectly in place for the kinds of situations these characters found themselves in. That and the character development was extremely well-handled, with some absolutely amazing uses of dramatic stingers that honestly took me by complete surprise.Perhaps that\'s the benefit of watching a slice of life. You are watching character interact and really aren\'t expecting anything until it\'s delivered. To entertain my cake metaphor, a slice of life is wholly about characters in certain situations. But I feel like the slice may be referring to the characters themselves, too. A character can be many things, and relateable is definitely an important aspect to many characters. Especially ones that are there to be realistically there, int he real world. Much like a slice of cake, there need to be multiple layers to have something be truly filling and not overwhelming in taste. Too much frosting it becomes too sweet. Too much bread it\'s too dry.I wish that this show had more time invested into it because I feel like it could\'ve been much better. However, for what it was, it was surprisingly engaging towards the middle half and to the end. Girlish Number utilizes the frosting, bread, and cherry. By the end, I felt happy with my slice. other half. Obviously i\'m over-exaggerating and joking, but to every joke there\'s a nugget of truth.Why is acting like an anime character so easy? Why is ""acting"" like a person so hard? Well, because, to put it bluntly, anime characters are very rarely like people. Especially in anime shows. That\'s not necessarily a bad thing, you may not want to watch a show to see ""people"", but that distinct void is there.

Yet it offers so much more in terms of actual character than it does animation....Much like real people, conversations have this looping feeling in this show. Not like French-new wave looping, but more like previous conversations play a part in new ones. I get that that may feel like an obvious writing technique. What I mean, specifically, is that even minute details are brought back as in-jokes and references. Not by the writers to the audience, but characters to characters, which really surprised me.Tonally, the show stays consistent, but it often doesn\'t really know where to take certain secondaries. While most of the primary characters are developed quite well, the secondaries either feel like caricatures or nobodies. Which is a minor flaw in the character writing. We have people, in-show, that act so over-the-top and nuts that it may be funny, but doesn\'t really fit in context with the rest of the show at all.Much like the battle between design and message, the battle between human and character is also prevalent._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Conclusion]So it\'s far from a perfect show. It\'s definitely a surprising one, however. What I was expecting was a show about cute girls being voice actors. I was also expecting it to be a more biting of a parody than what it ended up being.What I did get, however, was a very scenic and poignant show about human nature and the way people are. Imperfect. Every member of the main cast is imperfect. Some more so than others, but in the end, they all have their flaws. The ending was a bit too cornball for me and I would\'ve loved it much more if they ended on a bittersweet note.Chitose was a great standout, with Shibasaki and Momoka being honorable standouts of the main cast. While their designs were absolutely strange in the world, their humanity shined through. The character melodrama was surprisingly well-handled for an anime, too. Maybe it was because I was coming off some incredibly lame and corny melodrama-filled shows, but I was thoroughly impressed with just how realistic the reactions were to certain situations.Nothing felt over-exaggerated for drama. Everything felt perfectly in place for the kinds of situations these characters found themselves in. That and the character development was extremely well-handled, with some absolutely amazing uses of dramatic stingers that honestly took me by complete surprise.Perhaps that\'s the benefit of watching a slice of life. You are watching character interact and really aren\'t expecting anything until it\'s delivered. To entertain my cake metaphor, a slice of life is wholly about characters in certain situations. But I feel like the slice may be referring to the characters themselves, too. A character can be many things, and relateable is definitely an important aspect to many characters. Especially ones that are there to be realistically there, int he real world. Much like a slice of cake, there need to be multiple layers to have something be truly filling and not overwhelming in taste. Too much frosting it becomes too sweet. Too much bread it\'s too dry.I wish that this show had more time invested into it because I feel like it could\'ve been much better. However, for what it was, it was surprisingly engaging towards the middle half and to the end. Girlish Number utilizes the frosting, bread, and cherry. By the end, I felt happy with my slice.', 'It is only natural as humans to crave meaningful relationships with one another. However, for as much as we can try to foster worthwhile relationships with everyone, it is inevitable that we realize not all relationships are fortuitous. As we weed through to decide the ones worth keeping, mistakes and misunderstandings are bound to arise. In fact, we’re bound to get burned at some point or another. These mistakes can sometimes do us more harm than good, as the pain of being burned can serve to form mental walls, preventing us from being vulnerable.While I can commend Girlish Number for attempting to explore these themes...of vulnerability and misunderstandings, it often misses the mark entirely.  Just when we start to see the potential of introspection or self-awareness in characters necessary to advance the plot, they quickly revert to their old ways. Sure, creating a compelling cast of characters who explore these flaws is not an easy task, but it does not excuse the monotonous nature of the piece as we see these same characters repeat the same mistakes over and over again. To say it becomes rather grating after a while is putting it lightly.The primary issue with  Girlish Number is that it is a character driven piece without any depth of characters. Everyone is so painfully obvious they’re pretending to be happy and that doesn’t change.  It’s as if everything about this show adheres to a character’s emotional state too tightly. There’s no sense of growth or transformation. There’s no emotional journey, so-to-speak. Throughout the course of the entire series, characters cling to their facades without showing any form of improvement. They are all the same people they were when they started; emotionally insecure rocks that run away from their problems. And this does not make for a particularly engaging or entertaining story. The characters don’t really learn from their mistakes, even after they’re pointed out to them in the most explicit of terms. They’re not really well developed with the exception of Shibasaki whose development came completely out of nowhere.Another huge underlying issue with the story is the pacing of the plot. Actually, it feels like nothing really happens primarily because Chitose is a passive protagonist. Throughout the entire series, she does not take the initiative. The only time she was about to do something out of her own accord was when she volunteered to visit Shibasaki’s family and even then, she ended up sleeping through it. It was a completely unnecessary plot point. Yes, she’s supposed to be self-centered to a degree, but when it gets to a point where it holds the story to a complete standstill. . . well, it doesn’t make for a very interesting story, to say the least. Nor does she make for a very appealing character.Chitose is a character plagued by self-deception, often boasting about her capabilities as an actress without merit. Chitose didn’t feel compelling; She’s an immature brat who wants people to cater to her every whim. When she was feeling down about seeing insulting posts online, I honestly didn’t feel a thing until her brother commented on how accurate they were. Then I just laughed like a hyena. Her insecurities are painted in a manner that is way too heavy-handed. None of the characters are explored beyond the point of stating they’re all deathly afraid of vulnerability.Everything about this show is superficial nonsense. The topic of vulnerability is only scratched at surface level. Maybe that’s the point of the series. Maybe it’s supposed to be mentally draining to point out that as people, sometimes we don’t learn after committing the same mistakes over and over. Whatever the point Girlish Number is trying to make, it doesn’t make for a potentially moving or worthwhile story. It simply fails to have any redeeming qualities beyond its art. Gi(a)rlish Number?

First of all of this project the only thing that i seen is the anime but after watching this i think i will look for both the manga and the novel as well.The story for girlish number follows the lives and careers of five different girls as they enter the world of voice acting and looks at some of the struggles that they face in the industry as...well as the effects that it has on their lives as well. The anime takes place in the modern world and is largely centered in Tokyo with few exceptions.Chitose voiced by veteran seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi of Unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main characters of the show and like the rest of the cast is an aspiring seiyuu. Chitose is a confident and proud girl that has obvious skill in voice acting but this is offset by the fact that she is carefree and lazy and the fact that she does not put her enough hard work into her roles which led to her having a slow start to her career. One personality trait of Chitose that i find amusing is that despite having a rather positive attitude is also rather cynical which is a interesting contrast for her character.The gradual change of Chitose's character from her overly proud self that blames the industry for not seeing her talent to one that is willing to admit her shortcomings and admit that she may have as much talent as she thought was a great thing to see and one of the many highlights of the show. Chitose's role within the story is to act as the heart and glue of the cast and her positive attitude and determination is what makes her such an endearing character that while sometimes annoying to the cast is also solely missed when she's not present. I felt that Chitose's seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi did a great job portraying the character of Chitose.Yae played by veteran seiyuu Kaeda Hondo is a fellow voice actress and friend of Chitose and is also one of the main characters of the show. Yae went to the same voice training school as Chitose did and as a result she is familiar to Chitose. Like Chitose and the rest of the cast Yae is a aspiring voice actress but unlike Chitose Yae gets flustered and nervous quite easily but despite this tries her best to overcome this aspect of her personality and try to do the best that she can in the roles that she is given. This is one aspect of her personality that i admire as this is something that most seiyuu's and indeed most new people experience when they enter a new job and i felt this was executed pretty well. I felt that Kaeda Hondo did a great job portraying Yae.Koto voiced by veteran seiyuu Yui Ishikawa of Owari no Seraph and Qualidea code fame is a veteran seiyuu thats been in the voice acting industry for some time and actually has more experience than the rest of the cast. Koto is a calm and professional thats also pretty mature due to her age and experience and often serves as the voice of reason in any arguments that take place. Koto and fellow seiyuu Kazuha have a lot in common in that both came to Tokyo to for a job and in both cases become Seiyuu's and both do not want to go back to their families empty handed. As a result of this Koto understands the problems and frustrations the cast encounters and has to deal with in their careers and tries to help them whenever she can.Momoko voiced by veteran seiyuu Eri Suzuki of Amanchu and Flying Witch fame is a veteran seiyuu as well as a singer and idol voice actress. Confident, talented and considerate Momoka though still a high school girl has plenty of experience in voice acting due to her career as well as her parents to which her mother is also a well known seiyuu. As a result of this Momoka is rather adapt at dealing with people able to extract herself and others without causing ill feeling among people. At the same time she's slow to trust people but those that she trust will find that she's a great friend as she is able to easily tell if something is bothering someone. As an experienced seiyuu Momoko and Kazuha know each other and have worked alongside each other in a number of projects and have acquired a mutual understanding of each other. Both won't admit it but both see each other as friends as they both have similar problems that bother them. in the course of the story Momoka helps Kazuha deal with her problems while Kazuha helps in dealing with Momoka's problems thus cementing this bond.Out of all the main characters Momoka is one of my favorite characters as she is kind, considerate and always willing to help others. This is especially apparent in Kazuha's family arc in which she had no reason to go along with her back to hometown but decided to anyway. After Amanchu i believe that this is a another role that Eri Suzuki once again played well in.Kazuha voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Onishi of Denpa Kyoushi and food wars fame is a main character and is a veteran seiyuu having been in the industry for some time. Due to family problems Kazuha decided to leave her hometown and head to Tokyo where she subsequently become a voice actress. However despite that Kazuha still wanted to off to her family that she is doing well without them and as such constantly wishes for the chance to be featured in a serious anime series. Kazuha is a confident person thats also rather direct with requests and can be rather willful.Despite this Kazuha is also a professional and plays her assigned roles with diligence and skill that she has. Like Momoka Kazuha's behavior and attitude changes after her arc was resolved and her relationship with Momoka who she seen as her rival and friend changed as well with the two becoming actual friends. Kazuha was an interesting character and i felt that Saori Onishi did a great job portraying her.Nanami portrayed by new seiyuu Amina Sato is a new seiyuu that joins the cast of the last anime that the cast are assigned and appears halfway through the story. Though still fresh Nanami has a great voice range and skill and because she's also relatively pretty she also has a lot of fans which is nice to see.Nanami really admires Chitose because it was her that inspired her to become a seiyuu and as such she is always asking her questions and advice on her roles. Nanami's positive attitude is a nice contrast to Chitose's sometimes negative attitude and she serves as sort of villain in the final arc of the anime although no fault of her own. Nanami is a positive, upbeat and cheerful person that tries the best she can in the roles that she is assigned to which is quite inspiring and nice to see  in a new seiyuu. Despite being a relatively new seiyuu Amina Sato did a great job portraying Nanami here and after Momoka she's my second favorite character.Kuzu is a support character of the show that works as a producer. In this role he's in charge of the production of the anime and project that the main cast are assigned to. Despite the importance of such a role however Kuzu doesn't seem to understand how a anime is actually produced and neither does he care about the quality of the anime. Indeed Kuzu seems to be more concerned about making money and acting important because of that regardless of the reaction to the quality of the anime that was produced. For the purpose of the story Kuzu mainly serves as comic relief of the show and his antics while funny actually do annoy not just the rest of the cast but me as well. However like all characters Kuzu eventually does shape up later on and tries to be a more responsible producer. We just have to see whether he can be one though.Gojo is a support character of the show and is both Chitose's brother and manager that managers her career. A former voice actor himself Gojo knows very well the challenges that new seiyuus face as they enter the industry and as such he tries to help Chitose whenever possible. Being both the brother as well Gojo also has his hands full in getting Chitose to be serious with her acting and at the same time motivate her. The relationship between Chitose and her brother is one of the main focuses of the show and while Gojo is hard is on Chitose you can clearly see that he does care about her and is trying to guide her away from his own failing.I though that this relationship was a pretty well designed one and was acted out by their respective voice actors pretty well.Arts and animationIn terms of art I felt that the character designs of the characters were very well designed and detailed as was the environments that were featured. The animation i felt was also pretty detailed and pretty sharp.MusicA major part of a seiyuu's role is that apart from voicing characters and dubbing foreign dramas and films they also often sing songs whether opening, ending or insert songs for the anime that they feature in. In this case the opening and ending themes were sung by the seiyuus that voiced the main characters and i actually liked these songs as they were both catchy and positive and kept to the main spirit of the anime's story and theme. The anime also featured a number of insert songs that i also liked.Voice actingOverall i believe that the anime had a great cast of seiyuus and that they managed to portray their respective characters pretty well. Of the characters Eri Suzuzi, Sayaka Senbongi and Amina Sato who portrayed the characters of Momoka, Chitose and Nanami respectively i feel deserve some praise as i felt that they managed to play their characters really well.ConclusionGirlish number i felt was an interesting and fun anime that did a good job in showing some of the challenges that new seiyuu's would face as they enter the industry. Voice acting in Japan is very closely connected with Anime production and as such seeing how these two interact with each other was a great move. Girlish Number's story was simple but too the point and the bonds that the girls forged with each other was nice to see. Both the voice acting and animation for the anime was well done and i really enjoyed this anime.

Nice work Chi Sama"", 'Ever since the 11th volume of OreGairu was released, fans were heavily waiting for the next volume. For the last two years, the author of the series, Watari Wataru, has been working on many multimedia projects, including Qualidea Code from last year and Gi(a)rlish Number from this season. With Qualidea Code being average and with Gi(a)rlish Number looking like a “cute-girls-doing-cute-things”, many were keeping their expectations low. Luckily Watari Wataru uses the same formula that made OreGairu a success; a mix of heavy cynicism and characters reflecting on themselves. What originally seemed overused and generic managed to be some of the best fun you’ll get...this year.~{Story}~The story revolves around Karasuma Chitose, a newbie in the seiyuu industry who dreams of making it big. With a narcissistic attitude and glowing with overconfidence, she manages to get her first main role in an anime. This point on, the story focuses on Chitose and her colleagues and how they get through the anime project while improving themselves. Slice of Life anime normally don’t end up being story-heavy and Gi(a)rlish Number is no exception. The story isn’t its selling point as rather it’s the commentary and characters. However, the story works well as a backbone for its characters and the situations the characters go through is amusing at times. The series has an arc-like structure to it, as it focuses on different situations at a time. The series goes from focusing on Chitose lack of proper voice-acting abilities to Kazuha and Momoka’s family issues. As the series continues, it widens up its scope and starts focusing on Chitose’s surroundings rather than Chitose herself. Despite the fact that the light novels are still continues, the way the anime ends off doesn’t feel incomplete. Even if Gi(a)rlish Number never gets a second season, this season itself is satisfying enough to be its own standalone.Story: 7/10~{Presentation}~What Gi(a)rlish Number excels in is not its story, but rather its characters, and most importantly, its commentary to Japan’s entertainment industry. The series is full of jabs to the anime industry, the light novel industry, the idol industry and the seiyuu industry. Gi(a)rlish Number shows what Watari Wataru excels at the most, cynical writing that doesn’t hold itself back. Many of the writing showcases the harsher aspects of the anime industry, even though some of it is a bit nitpicky. As supposed to Shirobako that showed the anime industry and a hard, but fun place, and Sore ga Seiyuu that showed voice acting in a positive manner, Gi(a)rlish Number contrasts those tones with its narcissistic characters and their negative opinion towards those industries. However, just like OreGairu, during its second half it changes tone. The series slows down with is cynicism and focuses more on its characters and their growth. And this is when Gi(a)rlish Number ends up being a character-driven anime. Without moment like this, the only thing the series would’ve had was its cynicism. The pacing gives time for the characters to get fleshed out. However, there are times when the pacing can get a bit slow. Overall, Gi(a)rlish Number’s style and execution is something that is rarely seen in anime, and it makes the series feel much more unique.Presentation: 8.5/10~{Character}~As a character-driven anime, it is necessary to have likable and relatable characters. Does Gi(a)rlish Number succeed in doing so? Not at all, since it wasn’t aiming for such a goal anyways. But do the characters still end up being great? Definitely! Most of the cast of characters are a bunch of careless narcissists and that are filled with self-confidence, particularly the series protagonist, Chitose. Chitose is exactly as what was mentioned previously, yet she manages to be a very interesting protagonist. Just seeing her being so full of herself manages to be satisfying because it rare to see a protagonist like Chitose. However, she ends up being more complex than she seems because she tries to improve and near the end of the series, she goes through a lot of necessary character development. But Gi(a)rlish Number isn’t just about Chitose but also about her surroundings. Chitose’s colleagues, Kazuha and Momoka are both characters that contrast each other. Momoka is still a teenager, but she has a lot of freedom due to her parents being busy and them trusting her decisions. Kazuha on the other hand is in her late twenties, yet due to her overprotected parents, she lacks freedom. There’s proper contrasting between these two characters and shows how age never represents one’s responsibility in society. Chitose’s other two colleagues, Yae and Koto are also both quite likable, but they don’t get as much character development as the other character do. However, due to these character’s characterization, development isn’t necessary. There’s also a bunch of other supporting characters that makes the series more enjoyable. Chitose’s brother, Gojou, has an entertaining dynamic with her sister that creates a lot of enjoyable and hilarious bantering between the two. The producer of the anime project the characters work on, Kuzu (coincidently he has that name), is a completely lazy and pathetic person, yet he’s immensely hilarious. His assistant, Towada, is used as a nice contrast for Kuzu. And there are many other characters that make Gi(a)rlish Number’s cast pessimistically cynical, yet immensely enjoyable.Character: 9/10~{Art}~,Diomedia is a mixed bag when it comes to their art quality and content. Mayoiga was a decent looking series (minus the CGI), but Handa-kun lacked proper detailing and the backgrounds were empty. Luckily Gi(a)rlish Number’s art is really pretty and, for the most part, consistent. QP:flapper’s character designs made for the light novels is well presented in the anime. There’s no doubt that the characters in Gi(a)rlish Number are good-looking and attractive, which makes it seem like as if it’s a “cute-girls-doing-cute-things” type of anime. However, these character designs contrasts with their characterization. But it’s not just the character designs that looks pretty, but the backgrounds too. They’re not the most detailed, but due to the color palette of this series being very vivid, the backgrounds end up looking very pretty. Also, the series tends to blur out its backgrounds or the sides to make the art have some sort of photographic feel to it. In photography, these are known as bokeh or Gaussian blurs, and they manage to make the art look stylish and modern.Art: 8/10~{Animation}~Just like it’s art quality, Diomedea’s isn’t known to be consistent with their animation quality. However, Gi(a)rlish Number’s animation quality is very good for most of the time. The fluidity in the character motion is really good, and some slight additional animations are given to characters, such as wrinkles in clothes or hair movement. However, these detailed animations aren’t anything too special. There are moments when the fluidity in the character movements drop, but they’re nothing too bad. The backgrounds aren’t too static and has some animations to it. One pretty impressive thing is that vehicular moments aren’t CGI and are well animated. The series uses a lot of still shots which is primarily used so the studio has less animating to do. These aren’t too bad as they don’t tend to be distracting, and they’re never used when characters are speaking.Animation: 7.5/10~{Voice Acting}~For an anime about voice acting, it would be pretty embarrassing if the voice acting quality of this series wasn’t good. Luckily that’s not the case. Senbongi Sayaka (who’s starting to get more main roles for anime… what a coincidence) voices Chitose and she does an excellent job with her character. She gets her narcissistic character right. There are moments when Chitose’s character poorly voice acts in an anime project, and her seiyuu manages to make the voice acting sound as cringeworthy as possible successfully. Oonishi Saori does a great job at portraying the level-headed Kazuha and gives her character a mature voice. She also does her character’s Yamagata dialect well. Momoka is voiced by Suzuki Eri and she does a very good job with her character, despite being a relatively new seiyuu. Koto’s voiced by Ishikawa Yui, who is best known for her role as Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin. She does a good job as her character and she does her Kansai dialect really well. Hondo Kaede voiced Yae really well and her voice matches her characters. But the most impressive voice acting comes from the supporting characters. Gojou’s seiyuu, Umehara Yuuichirou, does a very good job with his character and his mature voice plays well with his character. Kuzu’s seiyuu, Nakai Kazuya, is one of my favorite, and he does a splendid job in making his character as irritating as possible, while making the character hilarious. Eguchi Takuya, who’s also one of my favorite, does a good job as Towada. Interesting fact: Matsuoka Yoshitsugu plays as a character called Matsuoka Yoshitsugu in Gi(a)rlish Number.Voice Acting: 9/10~{Music}~The music in Gi(a)rlish Number is also quite good. Both the OP and ED is sung by the main cast, Senbongi Sayaka, Ishikawa Yui, Hondo Kaede, Oonishi Saori, and Suzuki Eri. The OP, “Bloom”, is really good, an it contrasts well with the actual tone of the series. The ED, “Ima wa Mijikashi Yume Miyo Otome” is retty catchy, though it starts and ends off with unmeaningful (but catchy) lyrics. The group also sings two insert songs in the series and they’re both decent. Unfortunately, there’s not much variety in the background music, but what’s there is good. The music that is played whenever things are in an upbeat mood, or if Kuzu is spurring out bullshit, is pretty good and I like how the tempo changes depending on the current mood. For example, when Kuzu has a discussion with other executives, when his ideas get rejected, the tempo slows down. When he comes up with another idea, the tempo goes back to normal.Music: 6.5/10~{Enjoyment}~Gi(a)rlish Number was a blast to watch from start to finish. The pacing might be slow, but the character interactions and their take on the entertainment industry was always fun to watch. Gi(a)rlish Number proves that you don’t need likable characters to have good characters. As long as they’re interesting to watch, it doesn’t matter if they’re a scumbag of a character or not. The character development in the series is adequate and the contrasting between some of the characters are well done. I’m a sucker for cynical stuff (hence why both OreGairu and Hikigaya are in my favorites), so anime like Gi(a)rlish Number immediately click with me faster than Killer Queen.Enjoyment: 8.5/10In the end, Gi(a)rlish Number is what I would come to expect from Watari Wataru. After the disappointment of Qualidea Code and the indefinite hiatus of OreGairu, Gi(a)rlish Number was a treat for both OreGairu fans, and those who’ve never seen Watari’s work before. With a good mix of both cynicism and character development, the series manages to know when to waste time taking jabs at the anime industry and when to actually give some depth to its characters. The interactions between the characters are hilarious due to many of the characters’ narcissistic and over-confident behavior. It’s a shame that a series like this is basically going unnoticed or people are skipping over it since the synopsis and key visuals don’t look particularly interesting. But if you haven’t watched Gi(a)rlish Number yet, it would be best to give it a try and see if it’s your type of anime.+ The cynical and pessimistic comments towards Japanese entertainment and their industries are great.+ Great characters that contrast each other and have adequate character development.+ Genuinely hilarious that doesn’t rely on slapstick, with entertaining bantering between characters.+ The voice acting done by the seiyuu is reall good, especially for the supporting characters.- Not much variety in the background music.- Pacing can get a bit slow at times.Overall: 8.0/10 this year.~{Story}~The story revolves around Karasuma Chitose, a newbie in the seiyuu industry who dreams of making it big. With a narcissistic attitude and glowing with overconfidence, she manages to get her first main role in an anime. This point on, the story focuses on Chitose and her colleagues and how they get through the anime project while improving themselves. Slice of Life anime normally don’t end up being story-heavy and Gi(a)rlish Number is no exception. The story isn’t its selling point as rather it’s the commentary and characters. However, the story works well as a backbone for its characters and the situations the characters go through is amusing at times. The series has an arc-like structure to it, as it focuses on different situations at a time. The series goes from focusing on Chitose lack of proper voice-acting abilities to Kazuha and Momoka’s family issues. As the series continues, it widens up its scope and starts focusing on Chitose’s surroundings rather than Chitose herself. Despite the fact that the light novels are still continues, the way the anime ends off doesn’t feel incomplete. Even if Gi(a)rlish Number never gets a second season, this season itself is satisfying enough to be its own standalone.Story: 7/10~{Presentation}~What Gi(a)rlish Number excels in is not its story, but rather its characters, and most importantly, its commentary to Japan’s entertainment industry. The series is full of jabs to the anime industry, the light novel industry, the idol industry and the seiyuu industry. Gi(a)rlish Number shows what Watari Wataru excels at the most, cynical writing that doesn’t hold itself back. Many of the writing showcases the harsher aspects of the anime industry, even though some of it is a bit nitpicky. As supposed to Shirobako that showed the anime industry and a hard, but fun place, and Sore ga Seiyuu that showed voice acting in a positive manner, Gi(a)rlish Number contrasts those tones with its narcissistic characters and their negative opinion towards those industries. However, just like OreGairu, during its second half it changes tone. The series slows down with is cynicism and focuses more on its characters and their growth. And this is when Gi(a)rlish Number ends up being a character-driven anime. Without moment like this, the only thing the series would’ve had was its cynicism. The pacing gives time for the characters to get fleshed out. However, there are times when the pacing can get a bit slow. Overall, Gi(a)rlish Number’s style and execution is something that is rarely seen in anime, and it makes the series feel much more unique.Presentation: 8.5/10~{Character}~As a character-driven anime, it is necessary to have likable and relatable characters. Does Gi(a)rlish Number succeed in doing so? Not at all, since it wasn’t aiming for such a goal anyways. But do the characters still end up being great? Definitely! Most of the cast of characters are a bunch of careless narcissists and that are filled with self-confidence, particularly the series protagonist, Chitose. Chitose is exactly as what was mentioned previously, yet she manages to be a very interesting protagonist. Just seeing her being so full of herself manages to be satisfying because it rare to see a protagonist like Chitose. However, she ends up being more complex than she seems because she tries to improve and near the end of the series, she goes through a lot of necessary character development. But Gi(a)rlish Number isn’t just about Chitose but also about her surroundings. Chitose’s colleagues, Kazuha and Momoka are both characters that contrast each other. Momoka is still a teenager, but she has a lot of freedom due to her parents being busy and them trusting her decisions. Kazuha on the other hand is in her late twenties, yet due to her overprotected parents, she lacks freedom. There’s proper contrasting between these two characters and shows how age never represents one’s responsibility in society. Chitose’s other two colleagues, Yae and Koto are also both quite likable, but they don’t get as much character development as the other character do. However, due to these character’s characterization, development isn’t necessary. There’s also a bunch of other supporting characters that makes the series more enjoyable. Chitose’s brother, Gojou, has an entertaining dynamic with her sister that creates a lot of enjoyable and hilarious bantering between the two. The producer of the anime project the characters work on, Kuzu (coincidently he has that name), is a completely lazy and pathetic person, yet he’s immensely hilarious. His assistant, Towada, is used as a nice contrast for Kuzu. And there are many other characters that make Gi(a)rlish Number’s cast pessimistically cynical, yet immensely enjoyable.Character: 9/10~{Art}~,Diomedia is a mixed bag when it comes to their art quality and content.

Gi(a)rlish Number offers insight into the industry through the lives of ‘seiyuu’; voice actors. It’s a slice-of-life show adapted from a light novel by the creator of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, Wataru Watari. It’s animated by Diomedea and is a slight shift from their bright and colourful comedy shows like Noucome and Campione.[A boring critique]The plot of Gi(a)rlish Number revolves around the production of KuuSure, an anime by the fictional studio Number One Produce. From the onset we see a critique of the anime industry as the...producer of the show and the CEO aren’t interested in creating a great series but in how much money they can make off it. The plot of KuuSure is generic, the art and animation are poor and the character designs diverge from the source material; KuuSure is a poor adaptation of its light novel. Not only do the producer and CEO skimp on quality for the anime, they have the voice actresses spend a great deal of their time marketing the show.Gi(a)rlish Number is the first series about the anime industry that I’ve seen so I initially watched it with the perception that the sole role of a voice actress in an anime’s production was voice-acting. Through the activities of the five main voice actresses for KuuSure I learned the seiyuu are also heavily involved in the marketing of the show, often through various events. I also learned how ephemeral a voice actress’s career could be; one moment she/he is getting a lot of roles, the next, she’s replaced by a younger, more energetic voice actress. The little insight provided by the series is short-lived, however, as the show soon delves into the lives of the main characters.While Gi(a)rlish Number is a slice-of-life show and the drama is expected, it’s a bit boring. The developments are slow, the characters are mostly uninteresting and the side stories sometimes seem disconnected from the original plot. There are few comedic moments to add a bit of balance; only the antics of some of the characters are engaging. And the most engaging of them is the main character, Karasuma Chitose.[Brilliant MC]Karasuma Chitose is a college student who joins Number One Produce as a rookie voice actress and is fortunate to be given the role of the main female character in KuuSure. She takes great pride in this, believing it was what she deserved for her apparently immense talent and rarely misses the opportunity to bring it up in conversations. For a voice actress with little experience, Chitose is the laziest of the five which includes the more experienced Shibasaki Kazuha and Sonou Momoka, and is solely fixated on growing her popularity. But she’s also the most positive of the five voice actresses and one of the boldest characters in the show. She’s easy to dismiss as the character everyone hates but she clearly stands out in a show with mostly staid characters.The other voice actresses, Kazuha, Momoka, Koto and Yae, while being much less interesting than Chitose, are notable in their own rights. Kazuha is ever-pessimistic and serious of the lot who lets herself go once in awhile and changes a bit later in the show.  Momoka is young but mature and does her best to help Chitose see the reality of her career. Koto is the friendliest and often acts as a diplomat amongst the voice actresses. Yae is one of Chitose’s peers and worships her endlessly. They are more engaging than the rest of the cast with the exception of Kuzu, the producer, and Karasuma Gojou, Chitose’s manager and brother.Kuzu is the seemingly inept producer that does everything wrong. He cuts corners, regularly misses deadlines and budget estimates and trades the quality of the show for money. But it is these traits that make him more compelling to watch than the rest of the corporate staff.[Cheery art]The art of Gi(a)rlish Number is bright, fluffy and colourful, as expected from Diomedea. The characters, especially the voice actresses, are cute and look like teenagers even though they’re much older; the background art and the art in the opening and ending sequences are colourful. The art almost seems like it was designed to take your mind off the reality of the state of KuuSure and Number One Produce as a whole.[Mellow, invisible music]The music of Gi(a)rlish Number, like the art, is soft and often cheery. There are a variety of background scores that complement the key moments of the show adequately, especially the music for the more dramatic scenes. In all, the sound and music isn’t particularly memorable. What is remarkable is the voice acting.The characters in Gi(a)rlish Number are voiced by veteran and new voice actors/actresses alike. While Namba Shachou, the CEO of Number One Produce, is voiced by Kenyuu Horiuchi, an anime veteran, Chitose is voiced by Senbogi Sayaka, who debuted as a seiyuu in 2013. What’s more interesting is that the veterans in the show, such as the CEO and producer, are equally voiced by veteran voice actors while the newer members, such as the voice actresses, have less experienced voice actresses.[My gateway to meta anime]Gi(a)rlish Number is a good show, clearly better than average, but I didn’t enjoy watching it. It hit all the right spots in term of its technical aspects but wasn’t engaging because I had expected a more detailed treatment of the anime industry and its seiyuu.

It started as a light novel by Wataru Watari, with illustrations by QP:flapper and Yamcha. A manga version was created around the same time by Yuuki Doomoto. The twelve-episode anime aired from October to December 2016. It was created by Studio Diomedea, which has made many all-girl anime and several Ecchi anime. I know them for animating Akuma no Riddle (Spring 2014) and Mayoiga (Spring 2016).Since it\'s such a recent anime, Girlish Number has few votes on IMDb and even fewer on Crunchyroll. Viewers have begun...ranking it on myanimelist.com, however. There, as of February 2017, nearly fifteen thousand viewers have given it an overall rating of 7.07 out of 10. This may not seem like the most promising number, but it doesn\'t surprise me. As will be discussed later, fans had issues with Girlish Number because many of them couldn\'t understand the heroine.Story: Structure and ExecutionMajor plot points in the story are the acquisition of a lead role in episode 1, struggling with performance in episode 3, the swimsuit fiasco in episode 6, arrival of the rookie Nanami and the resulting change in episode 9, and Chitose\'s admittance of her situation and the resolution in episodes 11 and 12. The pattern of 1-3-6-9-11-12 does occur sometimes in anime, but the better structure for 12 episodes is usually 1-3-6-8-10-12 with 12 as a single-episode resolution.The story of Chitose\'s personal journey could have been delivered adequately in half the number of episodes, but since there four or five other main heroines, there was enough material for twelve. Though the other girls have their own mini-plots, the main story of Girlish Number is undoubtedly the journey of Chitose as she takes her first lead role as an anime seiyuu. The story was a classic tale about pride, humility, and finding yourself, but I thought the creators did a reasonable job making it original.Art: Overall and Character DesignsAs I sometimes like to note in my reviews, I am not an artist, so my ideas of good art are mostly based on whether I enjoyed it. I thought the animation of Girlish Number was perfectly adequate, though nothing stunning. To be honest, I am a little tired of the common look of anime in the last few years (very colorful and moe with super sparkley eyes), and I would have liked to see something more stylized. For the most part, I liked the character designs, and was glad they weren\'t forced into the usual cookie-cutter personalities and body types of anime girls. I especially liked the design of Koto Katakura, the seiyuu with the Kansai dialect. Character expressions were alright but a little limited and/or redundant between characters.SoundLead seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi, Kaede Hondo, Yui Ishikawa, Eri Suzuki, Saori Oonishi, and Amina Satoo are all relatively new voice actresses who have so far mostly played supporting characters. Then again, some have already started making names for themselves. Senbongi (voice of Chitose) played Mumei in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Ishikawa (voice of Katakura) played Mikasa in Shingeki no Kyoujin (Attack on Titan). Oonishi (voice of Shibasaki) has had more roles than most of the others and is known for playing Aiz Wallenstein in Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? Of all of them, I was most impressed with Senbongi (Chitose) and Suzuki (Momoko). For being mostly new talent, the voice acting was great.I was not particularly impressed with the music in Girlish number, though it\'s difficult to say for sure since the OST has not been released. Opening theme ""Bloom"" by the seiyuu of Girlish Number was performed well as far as I could tell, but it\'s not a style of music I like. It was pretty much the same for the ending theme ""Ima wa Mijikashi Yumemi yo Otome."" No information is available on the composer and none of the musical scores I heard really stuck out at me as amazing.CharactersOverall, characterization was good in Girlish Number. I was expecting the characters to be more cookie-cutter and steroetyped, but they were actually fairly original. Katakura, ""the girl with the Kansai Accent,"" was fairly modest and cutely sensitive about her age rather than being loud and humorous like many ""Kansai Accent"" characters. Yae, the rather timid girl, ended up showing her true colors as an amazingly loyal and genuine friend to Chitose despite getting little care from her in return. Shibasaki, with her family problems and issues ""getting into"" promotion activities, felt very real, like you would expect a real girl to be as she develops her career as a seiyuu. Though a little over-the-top, Kuzu was an unforgettable character and supplied much needed comic relief.You can\'t discuss the characters in Girlish Number without saying something about the heroine, Chitose Karasuma. You don\'t have to get very far into the series before noticing that she has a big head and gets ahead of herself easily with her endless confidence. Girlish Number is largely the story of Chitose as she comes to realize that her over-confidence is hurting her and those around her, and that she isn\'t putting as much effort forward as she needs to in order to be successful. Many vocal fans on Crunchyroll and Gogoanime seem to hate Chitose, saying she\'s a useless bitch, worthless, devoid of talent, and most of all, has an annoying personality. I felt the opposite, however.While Chitose obviously had character flaws such as believing too strongly in her own talent, she also had positive traits such as undying courage, and I don\'t think confidence in itself is a negative trait. It is really refreshing to have a female protagonist who is confident and courageous. Furthermore, I find the hate against Chitose\'s personality somewhat hypocritical for anime fans. Leading male protagonists are often airheaded and cocky, and rely on their perceived ""talent"" even when they have none. I have seen very few people dislike protagonists like this who are male. Since Chitose is female, people aren\'t used to a confident character, or a character who\'s a little too cocky. Chitose\'s personality made the show for me and I hope that others can try getting used to a female lead who isn\'t timid, weak, or overly modest.EnjoymentTo be honest, my enjoyment of Girlish number was somewhat reduced by the male fans in the comments who trash-talked Chitose endlessly. Even so, however, I still enjoyed the short series. As mentioned above, my favorite part of the series was having a lead female character who was outspoken, proud, and brave. Naturally, she was a little TOO proud, but she is able to eventually learn to be a little more humble. On the flipside, I also enjoyed watching the aloof and more culturally appropriate Shibasaki, who worries, for example, about securing a good marriage after being made to appear in a revealing swimsuit to increase sales on the anime she acts in. I liked Yae and how loyal she was to Chitose, and I thought her voice was adorable. All in all, for a slice of life anime, Girlish number was enjoyable and better than average. ranking it on myanimelist.com, however. There, as of February 2017, nearly fifteen thousand viewers have given it an overall rating of 7.07 out of 10. This may not seem like the most promising number, but it doesn\'t surprise me. As will be discussed later, fans had issues with Girlish Number because many of them couldn\'t understand the heroine.Story: Structure and ExecutionMajor plot points in the story are the acquisition of a lead role in episode 1, struggling with performance in episode 3, the swimsuit fiasco in episode 6, arrival of the rookie Nanami and the resulting change in episode 9, and Chitose\'s admittance of her situation and the resolution in episodes 11 and 12. The pattern of 1-3-6-9-11-12 does occur sometimes in anime, but the better structure for 12 episodes is usually 1-3-6-8-10-12 with 12 as a single-episode resolution.The story of Chitose\'s personal journey could have been delivered adequately in half the number of episodes, but since there four or five other main heroines, there was enough material for twelve. Though the other girls have their own mini-plots, the main story of Girlish Number is undoubtedly the journey of Chitose as she takes her first lead role as an anime seiyuu. The story was a classic tale about pride, humility, and finding yourself, but I thought the creators did a reasonable job making it original.Art: Overall and Character DesignsAs I sometimes like to note in my reviews, I am not an artist, so my ideas of good art are mostly based on whether I enjoyed it. I thought the animation of Girlish Number was perfectly adequate, though nothing stunning. To be honest, I am a little tired of the common look of anime in the last few years (very colorful and moe with super sparkley eyes), and I would have liked to see something more stylized. For the most part, I liked the character designs, and was glad they weren\'t forced into the usual cookie-cutter personalities and body types of anime girls. I especially liked the design of Koto Katakura, the seiyuu with the Kansai dialect. Character expressions were alright but a little limited and/or redundant between characters.SoundLead seiyuu Sayaka Senbongi, Kaede Hondo, Yui Ishikawa, Eri Suzuki, Saori Oonishi, and Amina Satoo are all relatively new voice actresses who have so far mostly played supporting characters. Then again, some have already started making names for themselves. Senbongi (voice of Chitose) played Mumei in Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress. Ishikawa (voice of Katakura) played Mikasa in Shingeki no Kyoujin (Attack on Titan). Oonishi (voice of Shibasaki) has had more roles than most of the others and is known for playing Aiz Wallenstein in Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? Of all of them, I was most impressed with Senbongi (Chitose) and Suzuki (Momoko). For being mostly new talent, the voice acting was great.I was not particularly impressed with the music in Girlish number, though it\'s difficult to say for sure since the OST has not been released. Opening theme ""Bloom"" by the seiyuu of Girlish Number was performed well as far as I could tell, but it\'s not a style of music I like. It was pretty much the same for the ending theme ""Ima wa Mijikashi Yumemi yo Otome."" No information is available on the composer and none of the musical scores I heard really stuck out at me as amazing.CharactersOverall, characterization was good in Girlish Number. I was expecting the characters to be more cookie-cutter and steroetyped, but they were actually fairly original. Katakura, ""the girl with the Kansai Accent,"" was fairly modest and cutely sensitive about her age rather than being loud and humorous like many ""Kansai Accent"" characters. Yae, the rather timid girl, ended up showing her true colors as an amazingly loyal and genuine friend to Chitose despite getting little care from her in return. Shibasaki, with her family problems and issues ""getting into"" promotion activities, felt very real, like you would expect a real girl to be as she develops her career as a seiyuu. Though a little over-the-top, Kuzu was an unforgettable character and supplied much needed comic relief.You can\'t discuss the characters in Girlish Number without saying something about the heroine, Chitose Karasuma. You don\'t have to get very far into the series before noticing that she has a big head and gets ahead of herself easily with her endless confidence. Girlish Number is largely the story of Chitose as she comes to realize that her over-confidence is hurting her and those around her, and that she isn\'t putting as much effort forward as she needs to in order to be successful.

I will try to write it with careful.1. StorySo, the story itself about Chitose Karasuma, a newbie seiyuu. It\'s all about her to achieve success with her ""stardom"" attitude. Okay, the story was good but it\'s just that. They can explore with much roast about industry they have work, but then they turn it to be some drama and character development. It looks like generic anime in the end and clearly not look as good as first half.2. ArtArt was great. Sometimes it was inconsistent, but in the end, i can\'t complain so much about this aspect....3. SoundI like opening song, the BGM look fit with this anime, but nothing special about them.4. CharacterAll character have problem and they could resolve it in the end. With such a lazy and diva attitude like Chitose, this show maybe have one of the most interesting character in Fall season. They have different attitude each other (ofc, all anime like that too) and their relationship more like co-workers than friendship.5. EnjoymentIt have enjoyable first half, but the second half was a bit let down. I never expected some drama from this anime and from my view, that drama kind of make this anime to drop their quality.Overall, this show was good but for me, it\'s not kind show you want to watch twice 3.

The story had weird pacing, and didn\'t end at a time that felt like a natural perfect end to the story. However, it was watchable, and I finished it thinking it was alright.The in universe anime had a cool title tho, millennium princess and the Kowloon overlord, sounds like it slaps. However, found it a bit odd in the whole show, we never see the voice actor for the Kowloon overlord. They state it\'s a harem show, and make it clear there should be a male protagonist, but his...VA is never even a background character. I know it\'s a show focused on the girls, but when we have male producers, managers, and light novel authors, I thought it would make sense to at least have such a va as a minor supporting character. Perhaps they just forgot to include one?Annoyingly, the subtitles were done to suit the most anal anti localisation nerd, with Wikipedia style notes popping up on screen and forcing you to pause and read just to explain a pun that makes no sense in English. Of course, they could have changed the exact meaning of the line but replaced it with an English language pun that gets across the same message, but nooooo.""Lol, Kuzu, more like... Garbage... Amirite guys?"" ** Huge infodump of context about how war criminals are called garbage in Japanese and that name kinda sounds like the Japanese word for garbage that\'s different from the Japanese word for trash and AAAAAAAA just make up an English pun for the love of goodness!Many times a little localising could have helped, but clearly this was one for the dorks, and I feel that a lot of the Japanese intended comedy didn\'t carry over super well when you have to have the joke explained to you in an on screen paragraph. Sure some localisation can go too far at times, but in this case, it would have been very warranted to avoid these weeby infodumps that had me reaching for the pause button every 3 minutes. Still, I did appreciate them putting themed subtitles over diegetic text so just I know what the signs and written notes say, as opposed to some anime, like Bleach on Disney plus, that just don\'t translate on screen Japanese at all, and leave you to simply miss important information.Still, if any of this is half accurate to the real anime industry, it does explain why filler arcs are a thing. I assumed like live action, they\'d make a show, finish it, v then release it on TV. This seems to imply they\'re using the South Park method of making episodes in the week it airs and rushing it out as the go, not having even started episode 10 when 1 airs. this makes sense with Japan\'s toxic work culture and crunch practices, but seems like a really stupid way to make a show that\'s any good.Also I gotta say, they treat voice actors with such reverence in this, with fans weebing out over them like idols. I can honestly say I\'ve never given less of a crap about who the voice actors are in literally any project ever, and even, I don\'t want to know, as if I start to recognize their voice in everything they do, the whole of media will feel a same sight smaller, and break immersion. Unless you\'re Trey Parker or Matt Stone, it\'s highly unlikely I would ever recognise the name or voice of a voice actor in anything, much less care. Not too say it\'s not an important skill or type of acting, as it is, but it\'s not the kind of skill where I\'m interested in the celebrity of the person doing it, that\'s irrelevant to me.Overall, meh, no strong impact on me, no story that will stick with me, and I\'ll forget v quick.

But it was fine.', ""The main character in this is the cheeky Chitose, an aspiring voice actor. She's a breath of fresh air in this genre where the leads tend to be very wholesome characters. It's not that Chitose is a bad person at all, but she's quite the arrogant, self-centered, brash individual. Her conversations with her brother, Gojou, is by far the most interesting thing in this anime because we get to see how far Chitose can go on thinking very highly of herself.Girlish Number is a show about a group of voice actors, most of them just getting into the business. We get to see a little...bit of their daily lives, talking with the producers, the recordings sessions and the conventions. The characters are interesting enough and the plot gives ample space for character development so it's always fun to follow this people around.There's this one scene where the girls meet the author whose's work is the base for the anime they're recording and they do their very best to avoid him. I wonder if this particular scene comes from personal experience or was just a moment of brilliant inspiration.

I wish there could be more awkward moments like that between authors and actors."", ""One of my favorite things about Japan is that it's culture seem to be the last resort against cynicism: the only country where giving your best is really a value in itself, not only as a justification, but as the foundation of a whole culture, a kind of shared social pathos. There is no backlash to doing so, no social interference, no evil antagonist sabotaging your every move, no one ridiculing your attempt: there's a weird purity in this.But there's also Gi(a)rlish Number -- which is actually my introduction to japanese cynicism, I guess. The making of a shitty light novel adaptation, anchored by two...over-confident incompetent characters that want to do everything but their best.The series is build on this great dynamic: those characters (Chitose, a newbie seiyuu, and Kuzu-P, the irresponsible producer) inhabiting a traditional japanese universe where everybody has the responsibility to do their best, while they get by on blind enthusiasm and recklessness alone. There's no pleasure in doing a good work, no honor in achieving something - there's only selfishness, the search for notoriety and popularity. And the strangest thing is: I mean this in the most endearing way possible.The greatest strength of the series is how this cynicism spices what is at its heart a very straight-forward slice of life. The anime builds great characters and explores their emotional landscape with great care - the drama is very simple, but in a clear, delicate way: those are characters with rich interior lives, that arrived at this work by different means, approaching life in their particular way. All of them a little broken, a little disheartened -- all of them with some kind of cynicism for the profession, not perfectly build to it. And we got to follow them coming to terms with this life, learning the value of doing a great job, opening up to people you like, and being proud to try their best (Aha! Earnestness wins again! Thank you, Japan!).(I mean, everybody but Kuzu-P. He is mostly helpless. That the only romance of the series is his love for a hostess that doesn't really care that much for him is one of the best little things the anime does.)Also, very beautiful art. over-confident incompetent characters that want to do everything but their best.The series is build on this great dynamic: those characters (Chitose, a newbie seiyuu, and Kuzu-P, the irresponsible producer) inhabiting a traditional japanese universe where everybody has the responsibility to do their best, while they get by on blind enthusiasm and recklessness alone.

Whereas titles like Shirobako and Seiyu\'s Life paint a more optimistic mood of the developments of their lead characters within the anime industry, Girlish Number opts for a more realistic look at things in its focus on our main lead and struggling seiyuu, Chitose. While a struggling seiyuu in the same vain as Seiyu\'s Life\'s Futaba, Chitose sports a more cynical outlook on her present situation as she is struggling to get a breakthrough role and...while putting on the public persona of a highly confident and energetic person, her private persona is not so appealing as her brother/ manager often has to put up with. In addition, Chitose also has to face the limitations of her talents in voice acting when she struggles with a main role that she is able to land for an anime production, has to put up with the high pressures that the industry put on seiyuu like herself with looks and talent, and has to deal with harsh criticisms from fans of the anime she is cast in. Outside of Chitose\'s struggles, the series also believably looks into the not so appealing aspects of anime production as meddling from production management, a source material\'s creator having little to no say in the production of their work, production delays, milking marketing gimmicks, and not making a faithful adaptation of the source material are common issues that can come up with anime production and this is an occurrence with the anime that Chitose stars in.Outside of the realistic lens it paints on the anime industry, Girlish Number also takes the time to get into the heads of its major characters to see how the realities of the industry effect them. With Chitose, the series delves into her cynical outlook on her situation and how it affects her relationship with her manager/ brother, who had his own past successes within the industry. Chitose\'s co-stars also get their focus with each being at different stages of life with some having difficulties with their families due to focusing on their seiyuu careers and seeing the anime production they are involved with as either a major stepping stone for their careers in the anime industry or a ""make it or break it"" opportunity.Overall, Girlish Number offers a rather solid and realistic focus on the anime industry by exploring the less glamorous elements of working in production and being a seiyuu. If you have enjoyed titles like Shirobako that offer a grounded focus on elements of the anime industry, you are likely to get as much enjoyment out of seeing Girlish Number. while putting on the public persona of a highly confident and energetic person, her private persona is not so appealing as her brother/ manager often has to put up with.

Spoilers ahead!)Parenthetical asides (or those statements that are enclosed by parentheses) are awesome. They invite extra information within a sentence without impeding on the purpose of said sentence.It’s not recommended to us them all the time since they can clutter a paragraph or even distract the reader from its meat. But, when a side comment or a small explanation for something written is required, the use of a parenthetical makes for a wise decision (or at least that’s what I believe).Gi(a)rlish Number contains a parenthetical right in the middle of its title. And it’s less a...phrase and more a single letter. My guess (and it’s really just a guess) is that it’s a metaphor for the show itself. That is, like anime, there are certain things that, while not always said or deemed “important,” are around and related all the same.STORYChitose Karasuma is a newbie voice actress in the ever-growing world of anime. She seems like any other woman in her field: bubbly, cute, and inviting. However, as Gi(a)rlish Number displays the behind-the-scenes action of the anime industry, not-so-glamorous truths begin to rear their ugly heads.It’s uncommon for an anime to focus on the meta aspects of the medium itself. It’s even rarer (if not outright unheard of) for an anime to cast this focus in a cynical light. Japan is known for their overly courteous ways and strict business formality, so going against the grain by looking at the dirt instead gives a different edge that the anime audience is most likely not used to.The unclean revelations target many different areas. The notion that authors of source material are weird if not downright disgusting. Unfair working conditions make the process seem like a slog. How those involved merely put up with the work because they must. That marketing and side venues arguably mean more than the anime itself.Gi(a)rlish Number even goes so far as to out the community. Subpar promotional videos are met with cheering crowds. Fans are harshly vocal in their hatred and fleeting in their preferences. There’s even a jab at how quickly viewers make assumptions based off rumors read on public forums without any substantive evidence.These “revelations” aren’t necessarily surprising. Many members of the community are fully aware of the stigma behind light-novel adaptations, the insane fandoms, and the odd financial structure. Regardless, it’s still interesting to see it put in a different perspective. A perspective that comes from people literally involved in the creation of anime.It should be noted that not everything is cynical. The anime doesn’t take a completely contrarian viewpoint, painting the medium with such negativity that the community wonders why they watch the stuff in the first place. No, it has its hardworking lackeys, passionate voice actresses, and heartfelt moments. The plot simply has a lot more of the opposite end, forcing the audience to think about what really goes on within anime as it puts it on blast. (How much one accepts as truth, though, is up to him or her.)This motif represents the foundation of Gi(a)rlish Number throughout the season, and it’s what nearly every event in the plot revolves around. Unfortunately, it cannot support the anime indefinitely, for the show finds itself split into two halves: a strong first half and a lackluster second half.In the first half of the season (roughly episodes one through six), the anime takes advantage of the negativity. Chiding remarks from Chitose bring comedy. Kazuha and Momoka voice their eye-opening “taboo” thoughts in private. Fans forgive lies about first-episode screenings when the voice actresses belt out into song.All the while, the anime highlights what a failing project looks like. In this case, Millenium Princess x Kowloon Overlord. An incompetent producer and mediocre source material lead everyone down a tough path filled with strict deadlines and financial woes. It’s compounded negativity, and it aligns very well with Gi(a)rlish Number’s goals.Come the second half, though, the anime starts to lose steam due to a few different issues.One, the anime doesn’t stay centered on Chitose. The story wants to wrap up Kazuha and Momoka’s subplots, so these two gain the spotlight, awkwardly and simultaneously reaching resolutions through visits back home and a phone call. Kuzu-P, the producer, likewise has a subplot, but his is handled even worse. He feels insignificant when compared to a former workmate, so he loses his drive – only to pick it back up again within the span of a couple episodes.Two, the anime doesn’t establish its vital background plot point. A big reason for why Chitose’s later regression and depression scares some of her friends comes from the fact that they have seen it before. Namely, in Chitose’s older brother Gojou. He used to be an up-and-coming voice actor, too, but the anime only alludes to this fact through a music track, an advertisement, and a nostalgic photo. The show never shows what happened let alone takes the time to make it an important ordeal within the narrative. As such, her mirrored circumstance fails to reflect all that well.Third, the anime doesn’t stay consistent. This second half is rather dramatic, departing from the derisive comedy that the first half thrived on. To be fair, the first half had bits of drama as well, but the whole point was still mainly to out the bad side of the anime world. The second half, in contrast, goes the other way. The heavy drama removes the comedy for the most part, and it only serves to detract from the anime’s original motif. Technically speaking, this drama is negative, but it’s of the emotional kind rather than the factual kind.To Gi(a)rlish Number’s credit, the second half isn’t unwatchable or without strength. Introducing Nanami as a bright new hopeful is a natural move to push the drama (regardless of its necessity), and it still has the meta-anime-digging commentary like lame afterparties.However, it’s still too bogged down by odd plot directions and distracting drama to be a proper wrapping up of the anime’s initial ideals.ANIMATIONFor the most part, Gi(a)rlish Number’s art and animation provide a stronger-than-not visual experience. Arguably, its middle set of episodes cannot always keep up in terms of crisp movement and perfect proportions. However, when Chitose gets into a pillow fight with Momoka or the anime shows off Kazuha’s hometown with pretty backdrops and smart lighting, it demonstrates its artistic fidelity well enough.If nothing else, the anime has one memorable aspect that almost everyone agrees on: Chitose’s reaction faces.Chitose has more reactions than she has voice-acting roles. All right, that’s not saying a whole lot, but it’s still a large number regardless. While a smug look most often covers her face, she is no stranger to variety. Pouting. Anger. Scared. Jubilant. Disinterested. Unlike her skillset, she can react like it’s nobody’s business. Her reactions provide an extra layer of comedy, making the audience wonder how she will respond in her next banter with Gojou or after hearing some positive news.After Chitose’s array of faces, the character designs argue for their positive impact, too. Dark color choices – maroon, purple, dark pink – both fit the mood of the anime and are no doubt attractive. Kazuha maintains a mature look with long hair and a business-esque outfit. Yae goes cute with a short skirt and big eyes. Koto’s lax clothes, stylish hair, and catlike mouth give her a fun look. Momoka’s classier dress highlights her professionalism. And Chitose’s egg shirt symbolizes her (selfish) sunny-side up personality almost too well.The anime also makes slight alterations to the visuals of its opening track, changing the poses, props, and positions of the characters’ distinctive outlines as the season progresses. It honestly doesn’t add or mean much, but it’s a cute little attention to detail.The ending track’s visuals also deserve a small shout-out if only for their quirky dance sequence. Chopped frames, shifting spots, and timed movements aim for and reach a nice level of silliness.CHARACTERSGi(a)rlish Number unfortunately doesn’t do a whole lot to build bonds between all the women in the anime. They are friends, but they lack distinctive moments together. However, there’s only one true star in this story: Chitose.On the outside, Chitose’s like any other woman in her field: smiling wide for the audience and thanking those in charge for their support. On the inside, she’s a narcissistic, arrogant jerk who cares only for the fame her profession brings.Harsh, but true. The anime sets the tone for her character within the first thirty seconds where she inwardly laments how the voice actress beside her on stage “took” the line she was going to use in her own final comment. And she continues to reinforce her horrible personality at almost all times. She’s not grateful towards Gojou, her literal older brother, for the support he provides as her agent. She doesn’t mind speaking her mind, including off-the-cuff thoughts and oblivious words. She basks in her “fame” despite her inexperience, the lack of quality in her work, and her unwillingness to improve.Surprisingly, her greatest weakness is also her greatest strength. For, while she’s hard to get along with, her bravado provides her with an uncanny level of confidence. Even as she can’t properly voice act. Even as the anime project is failing all around her. Even as their events fall apart minutes before they go onstage. She doesn’t let these issues faze her. Indeed, she’s quicker to blame everyone else first and then focus on the fact that the upcoming opportunity presents yet another chance for her to earn more Twitter followers.As she sings her made-up songs, two of her friends stand beside her: Yae and Koto. For the most part, these two are inconsequential save for their grounded personalities. Yae’s nervous about pretty much everything, and Koto, while lacking in major roles, knows a great deal about the industry. Furthermore, Yae can sometimes say things nestled deep in her “black heart,” and Koto values this gig because she understands that, at her age, she may not have many chances left. Altogether, these two women balance out Chitose’s rough personality, contrasting in a strong manner.Chitose remains unlikable for a good while. She does improve a bit as a voice actress, and she finally receives hate mail online that knocks her down a peg. But she continues to think overly highly of herself as their song CD sells several thousand units and their last-ditch-effort photoshoot goes over reasonably well (at least she thinks so).Afterwards, she takes a backseat for a little bit. In her stead, Kazuha and Momoka grab the limelight. The two are the professionals among the whole group. Super popular and with obvious experience, they take charge and often refuse to take part in most of the extra events.In private, they express their concerns to each other for both their profession and their personal lives. They understand more than the others that their work isn’t as rewarding as it may seem. All the pandering, all the fakeness, all the inopportunity. Kazuha and Momoka put up with it all not because they like to but because they have to.On that personal level, Kazuha fights against a feeling of unfulfillment. She’s always wanted to be an actress, but she doesn’t believe that her current line of work matches her aspirations, losing fun in the process. She also worries about her overprotective parents who meddle too much in her life.As for Momoka, she lives in the shadow of her mother, a famous voice actress that everyone knows and compares her to. Even worse, she feels as if she doesn’t have a mother when the woman neither directs nor suggests anything to her daughter.In a way, they are envious of Chitose. Kazuha wishes she could have as much fun as Chitose does, and Momoka would like to be seen for who she is just like Chitose rather than constantly compared to somebody else.Their trip away to Kazuha’s hometown allows them to unwind for a bit and get closer as friends, each wanting what the other has in their families. Kazuha wants more freedom, and Momoka wants more guidance. However, they realize that they’ve had fortune of their own all along. Kazuha’s father supports her in his own way, and Momoka’s mother pushes her as a respected rival. Together, the two finally understand that maybe their parents aren’t as bad as they may have thought.It’s a quick wrap-up to their characters, and both Kazuha and Momoka are mostly ignored come the final few episodes, but these are necessary directions as attention swings back to Chitose and her woes.At the end of episode nine, Gojou is moved away from being Chitose’s manager. Worse still, she goes one step too far in voicing her opinion. She makes a comment to him about how she will end up like him, acting in one big role then quitting forever. It puts a rift between the two siblings, and it kicks off her downward spiral.Her descent escalates when the even more rookie voice actress, Nanami, officially joins the club. The spry, happy, and ready teenager shows a drive. A spark. A willingness that Chitose has never had before. The more Nanami gets involved – getting a CD debut, getting buddy-buddy with the other women – the further Chitose falls. Despite how much Nanami looks up to and admires Chitose, Chitose feels inadequate. As if she no longer has a place.Her feelings of self-doubt are exacerbated by numerous other factors going on simultaneously. Waning popularity in their series. Losing fans of her own. Missing out on new voice-acting roles while the others gain new ones.Altogether, Chitose loses that biggest strength and that biggest weakness of hers: overconfidence. And it’s felt by everyone. Her depressing mood brings a heavy atmosphere in the recording booth, and she essentially closes everyone out. All the while, Gojou, still on bad terms with his younger sister, looks on from afar, seeing himself from years ago in her.In comes both Yae and Koto. Yae speaks with Gojou, earnestly expressing to him how she believes in Chitose and knows just how hard she has been working. Koto speaks with Gojou, too. The two of them were once voice-acting partners, so she understands exactly what’s going on with Chitose and tells him as much.Their words (as well as the uncharacteristic ones from Namba, the CEO of Number One Produce) give Goujou the insight he needs. He confronts Chitose in her room, but, before he can say anything, she breaks down. She knows she’s selfish, but she still doesn’t want to fade away from the minds of those around her. Gojou (with an extra few set of harsh words) explains to her that so many people support her. Himself included. That voice acting is the job for her, and that her positivity gives her the wherewithal to push forward, making her into a (nonspecific) amazing person.Goujou’s words save Chitose. Her renewed vigor makes her mission more than just about earning due fame. Rather, like the other women around her, she wants to work hard at it. For her sake and for all the people that support her. When she gets back to the studio the next day (after some dramatic delays and falls), she apologizes to her friends, letting them know that she now understands her own weaknesses.She’s welcomed back with kindness and returned understanding, allowing Chitose and the other voice actresses to deliver a strong finish to their anime series. This happy ending may arguably be unfitting for such a constantly cynical story, but it’s nice to see that success and positivity does, indeed, exist within this industry.SOUNDGiven Gi(a)rlish Number’s content, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the voice acting is top-notch. Specifically, relative newcomer Sayaka Senbongi as Chitose steals the show with her smug attitude, matching guffaws, fake cuteness, purposefully subpar in-anime work, and emotional moments.Next up, the anime uses a few different techniques with its sound outside of the music. For example, Chitose and Momoka meet the light-novel author whose anime adaptation gave them roles. When he uses his phone to (almost) get their numbers, the audience hears a greasy, squishy noise. A noise that punctuates the author’s less-than-savory self and also pokes fun at the caliber of these writers. Not to mention, the next light-novel author is so quiet that the characters can barely understand him.The music itself doesn’t include anything impressive, but these pieces do have their own charm.For the original soundtrack, it consists of many slice-of-life tunes with techno-backed trumpets, light acoustic guitar playing, and slow, off-kilter piano keys. They get at both the laidback and cynical styles of the show rather easily.For the opening track, it contains strong vocal work from the voice actresses, and it starts and finishes in grand fashion. The middle, though, doesn’t reach the same level of power as it goes instead for computerized sounds and daintier instruments. To its credit, it does act as a cute gap between both flourishing sides. It just doesn’t have a similar spark.For the ending track, it follows a similar trend to the OP. Once again, the voice actresses perform well, and the start and finish are a weird, stepping lyrical composition that make for a fun little dance number. It’s just the middle section again that doesn’t have the same oomph. A loud whistle and a steady drum beat back the singing but don’t invite the same intrigue.ENJOYMENTWhat I find most fascinating is that this anime calls me out. How I’m maybe part of the problem. I love the cutesy, moe approach. I get hyped up by the PVs and the key visuals. I’m a fan of the songs, the merchandise, and the extra material.I can’t help it; I adore anime too much. While I won’t not like this stuff anytime soon, I do appreciate what this anime set out to do. How it gave me new insight and something more realistic to think about the next time I catch a new announcement for an anime adaptation.Onto the anime itself. For me, Chitose was a ton of fun. Her silly reactions and her confident attitude were hysterical if only because she just didn’t care about anyone. It’s why her suffering was a-okay in my book. Yes, it was a harsh yet direct way of getting her to have some humility. But she totally deserved it after all the mean, arrogant, and selfish thoughts that she either kept in mind or let loose from her lips.I also quite liked many of the other characters even if some of them didn’t have too much screen time. Koto’s optimism. Kazuha’s maturity and dichotomous drunken tirades. Nanami’s inability to process that she shouldn’t do her best.My favorite, though, was Yae. She was cute and sincere and fun. She was always trying her best, and she let out the occasional Freudian slip. Overall, it was her kindness that won me over – especially when she had her small conversation with Gojou – and I was glad to see her do well as a voice actress.I also quite liked the cringe moments. Chitose’s mediocre voice acting. Kazuha forcing herself to take part in the bonus footage. The low-quality PV. These cringe moments are tough to watch, but that’s what makes them work so well.Unfortunately, the second half wasn’t as entertaining to me simply because it started to make the drama, rather than the comedy and the meta discussion, its focus. It was probably inevitable since letting Chitose be mean and uncaring for the entire season wouldn’t do a whole lot for her character. But it didn’t have the same intrigue that the first half presented in full.Gi(a)rlish Number doesn’t shake the industry, but it at least provides its audience with a different way to view the anime medium. A cynical outlook as well as a more honest set of characters create both dark humor and a realistic situation. A waning plot, missing relationships, and standard musical offerings don’t help the show, but it’s still an interesting, reaction-filled experience nonetheless (parenthetical asides or otherwise).SUMMARYStory: Fine, a more cynical behind-the-scenes look at the world of anime presents a fresh (although perhaps not new) perspective on the medium, leading to a strong first half but a weak second halfAnimation: Good, pretty background art has nothing on Chitose’s wealth of reactions and the attractive designs of the charactersCharacters: Good, while Momoka and Kazuha receive some attention, Chitose’s growth from self-centered to slightly humble, thanks mostly to Gojou and the other women who support her, demonstrates the anime industry is not without positivitySound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay OST, good VA performances, and interesting extra effectsEnjoyment: Good, the harsh commentary fits, it was fun to both watch Chitose succeed and fail, Yae is too cute and too nice to dislike, but the second half wasn’t as entertaining as the first halfFinal Score: 6/10 phrase and more a single letter.

That is, like anime, there are certain things that, while not always said or deemed “important,” are around and related all the same.STORYChitose Karasuma is a newbie voice actress in the ever-growing world of anime.

She’s always wanted to be an actress, but she doesn’t believe that her current line of work matches her aspirations, losing fun in the process. She also worries about her overprotective parents who meddle too much in her life.As for Momoka, she lives in the shadow of her mother, a famous voice actress that everyone knows and compares her to. Even worse, she feels as if she doesn’t have a mother when the woman neither directs nor suggests anything to her daughter.In a way, they are envious of Chitose. Kazuha wishes she could have as much fun as Chitose does, and Momoka would like to be seen for who she is just like Chitose rather than constantly compared to somebody else.Their trip away to Kazuha’s hometown allows them to unwind for a bit and get closer as friends, each wanting what the other has in their families. Kazuha wants more freedom, and Momoka wants more guidance. However, they realize that they’ve had fortune of their own all along. Kazuha’s father supports her in his own way, and Momoka’s mother pushes her as a respected rival. Together, the two finally understand that maybe their parents aren’t as bad as they may have thought.It’s a quick wrap-up to their characters, and both Kazuha and Momoka are mostly ignored come the final few episodes, but these are necessary directions as attention swings back to Chitose and her woes.At the end of episode nine, Gojou is moved away from being Chitose’s manager. Worse still, she goes one step too far in voicing her opinion. She makes a comment to him about how she will end up like him, acting in one big role then quitting forever. It puts a rift between the two siblings, and it kicks off her downward spiral.Her descent escalates when the even more rookie voice actress, Nanami, officially joins the club. The spry, happy, and ready teenager shows a drive. A spark. A willingness that Chitose has never had before. The more Nanami gets involved – getting a CD debut, getting buddy-buddy with the other women – the further Chitose falls. Despite how much Nanami looks up to and admires Chitose, Chitose feels inadequate. As if she no longer has a place.Her feelings of self-doubt are exacerbated by numerous other factors going on simultaneously. Waning popularity in their series. Losing fans of her own. Missing out on new voice-acting roles while the others gain new ones.Altogether, Chitose loses that biggest strength and that biggest weakness of hers: overconfidence. And it’s felt by everyone. Her depressing mood brings a heavy atmosphere in the recording booth, and she essentially closes everyone out. All the while, Gojou, still on bad terms with his younger sister, looks on from afar, seeing himself from years ago in her.In comes both Yae and Koto. Yae speaks with Gojou, earnestly expressing to him how she believes in Chitose and knows just how hard she has been working. Koto speaks with Gojou, too. The two of them were once voice-acting partners, so she understands exactly what’s going on with Chitose and tells him as much.Their words (as well as the uncharacteristic ones from Namba, the CEO of Number One Produce) give Goujou the insight he needs. He confronts Chitose in her room, but, before he can say anything, she breaks down. She knows she’s selfish, but she still doesn’t want to fade away from the minds of those around her. Gojou (with an extra few set of harsh words) explains to her that so many people support her. Himself included. That voice acting is the job for her, and that her positivity gives her the wherewithal to push forward, making her into a (nonspecific) amazing person.Goujou’s words save Chitose. Her renewed vigor makes her mission more than just about earning due fame. Rather, like the other women around her, she wants to work hard at it. For her sake and for all the people that support her. When she gets back to the studio the next day (after some dramatic delays and falls), she apologizes to her friends, letting them know that she now understands her own weaknesses.She’s welcomed back with kindness and returned understanding, allowing Chitose and the other voice actresses to deliver a strong finish to their anime series. This happy ending may arguably be unfitting for such a constantly cynical story, but it’s nice to see that success and positivity does, indeed, exist within this industry.SOUNDGiven Gi(a)rlish Number’s content, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the voice acting is top-notch. Specifically, relative newcomer Sayaka Senbongi as Chitose steals the show with her smug attitude, matching guffaws, fake cuteness, purposefully subpar in-anime work, and emotional moments.Next up, the anime uses a few different techniques with its sound outside of the music. For example, Chitose and Momoka meet the light-novel author whose anime adaptation gave them roles. When he uses his phone to (almost) get their numbers, the audience hears a greasy, squishy noise. A noise that punctuates the author’s less-than-savory self and also pokes fun at the caliber of these writers. Not to mention, the next light-novel author is so quiet that the characters can barely understand him.The music itself doesn’t include anything impressive, but these pieces do have their own charm.For the original soundtrack, it consists of many slice-of-life tunes with techno-backed trumpets, light acoustic guitar playing, and slow, off-kilter piano keys. They get at both the laidback and cynical styles of the show rather easily.For the opening track, it contains strong vocal work from the voice actresses, and it starts and finishes in grand fashion. The middle, though, doesn’t reach the same level of power as it goes instead for computerized sounds and daintier instruments. To its credit, it does act as a cute gap between both flourishing sides. It just doesn’t have a similar spark.For the ending track, it follows a similar trend to the OP. Once again, the voice actresses perform well, and the start and finish are a weird, stepping lyrical composition that make for a fun little dance number. It’s just the middle section again that doesn’t have the same oomph. A loud whistle and a steady drum beat back the singing but don’t invite the same intrigue.ENJOYMENTWhat I find most fascinating is that this anime calls me out. How I’m maybe part of the problem. I love the cutesy, moe approach. I get hyped up by the PVs and the key visuals. I’m a fan of the songs, the merchandise, and the extra material.I can’t help it; I adore anime too much. While I won’t not like this stuff anytime soon, I do appreciate what this anime set out to do. How it gave me new insight and something more realistic to think about the next time I catch a new announcement for an anime adaptation.Onto the anime itself. For me, Chitose was a ton of fun. Her silly reactions and her confident attitude were hysterical if only because she just didn’t care about anyone. It’s why her suffering was a-okay in my book. Yes, it was a harsh yet direct way of getting her to have some humility. But she totally deserved it after all the mean, arrogant, and selfish thoughts that she either kept in mind or let loose from her lips.I also quite liked many of the other characters even if some of them didn’t have too much screen time. Koto’s optimism. Kazuha’s maturity and dichotomous drunken tirades. Nanami’s inability to process that she shouldn’t do her best.My favorite, though, was Yae. She was cute and sincere and fun. She was always trying her best, and she let out the occasional Freudian slip. Overall, it was her kindness that won me over – especially when she had her small conversation with Gojou – and I was glad to see her do well as a voice actress.I also quite liked the cringe moments. Chitose’s mediocre voice acting. Kazuha forcing herself to take part in the bonus footage. The low-quality PV. These cringe moments are tough to watch, but that’s what makes them work so well.Unfortunately, the second half wasn’t as entertaining to me simply because it started to make the drama, rather than the comedy and the meta discussion, its focus. It was probably inevitable since letting Chitose be mean and uncaring for the entire season wouldn’t do a whole lot for her character. But it didn’t have the same intrigue that the first half presented in full.Gi(a)rlish Number doesn’t shake the industry, but it at least provides its audience with a different way to view the anime medium. A cynical outlook as well as a more honest set of characters create both dark humor and a realistic situation. A waning plot, missing relationships, and standard musical offerings don’t help the show, but it’s still an interesting, reaction-filled experience nonetheless (parenthetical asides or otherwise).SUMMARYStory: Fine, a more cynical behind-the-scenes look at the world of anime presents a fresh (although perhaps not new) perspective on the medium, leading to a strong first half but a weak second halfAnimation: Good, pretty background art has nothing on Chitose’s wealth of reactions and the attractive designs of the charactersCharacters: Good, while Momoka and Kazuha receive some attention, Chitose’s growth from self-centered to slightly humble, thanks mostly to Gojou and the other women who support her, demonstrates the anime industry is not without positivitySound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, okay OST, good VA performances, and interesting extra effectsEnjoyment: Good, the harsh commentary fits, it was fun to both watch Chitose succeed and fail, Yae is too cute and too nice to dislike, but the second half wasn’t as entertaining as the first halfFinal Score: 6/10', 'If you have spare time and the only thing in your backlog is isekai garbage No.10000, this deserves some time just for how meta it could be, especially if you are familiar with the world behind Japanese animation, like the voice acting world.Let me start by explaining why some might have a low opinion of the series, calling it a waste of time. The gist of it is it tried to do 2 things at once, and both of them were not particularly well done. By well, I mean exploring uncharted territory or going in depth and exposing ideas that the audiences might not be...familiar with.Those 2 things are: revealing the inner workings of the voice acting and animated production world and emotional development of its characters. About half way through they switched from the former to the latter. The transition can be jarring while the exposition, tedious, especially the first few episodes. They consisted of mostly the unlikable lead and just people talking. Thus, for those still hesitating to watch it, let me lay the groundwork as to why it’s definitely worth your time.The world of voice actors and actresses (VA), or Seiyuu as many of you might be familiar with, is quite insane particularly compared to the west, or anywhere else for that matter. That might be changing, as of right now, 2019, not that bad yet.Because animation is mainstream in Japan and is as popular to young people as Marvel is recently, VA are treated as stars. For those who could recall, Lucky Star was one of the most notable shows to highlight the influence of voice actors. I remember Haruhi and Lucky Star radio shows actually reached the West through fan translation which made its way to YouTube. Seiyuu started to only fulfil the role of an actor and actress, but essentially the human faces of the shows, idols, to put in a term, kind of like how the cast of shows and movies are interrogated at ComicCon.In case you have no idea how big VAs are because you are not interested in behind the scenes matters, as am I, you can go on YouTube and type in Seiyuu. What you find is something insane to me. These real human beings who merely did their job: providing voice to an animated work, have to carry the role of promoting and interacting with fans. It\'s ironic in a way, since animation is supposed to be fantastic, cater to escapists. The activities they are involved in include promo, PV shows, handing out materials, live streaming, radio shows etc... They are treated as movie stars in Otaku circles, as you can see from the comment section, which are in English. You can imagine how ridiculous they would be in Japan.That brings me to Watari Wataru\'s Girlish Number. The reason why I provided context was for those who could be unfamiliar with the animated shows production process or VA\'s world, the conversations can be puzzling and boring. Watari dug into the heart of the facade of the industry, and it\'s not always entertaining if you don\'t know what he\'s trying to make fun of.For instance, the scenario of a frivolous producer pitching his adaptation of a relatively popular novel into an animated show to the president who doesn\'t know enough about the product and subsequently producing a soulless, rushed and fragmented show slapped many projects in the face. I would imagine this to be a more common scenario than we think, only without the fun of the optimistic producer and the clueless president with a sense of humour.The producer blatantly misuse the fund for a trip to Okinawa. On top of that, he coerced his staff to make abrupt changes. The most heinous of all is forcing the VA to do promotion, sing, present and do a beach photoshoot at the beach to promote and generate sales. He\'s deeply cynical and seemingly can\'t be bothered to care about anyone else.Next is the managers. On the face of it, the managers got off the easiest. They provide support to the actresses, but most of the work is done in the background. As the show progressed, you can see the managers being helpless or incapable of solving the VA\'s emotional and personal issues, despite that being their primary duty. The worst one of all manipulates his customer to ensure her career advances, at the cost of her personal\'s feelings. He freaked out when her career options were in jeopardy, and rather than caring about her personal issues.Then, we have the VA themselves. They are the main cast of the show, figuratively and literally. They all have varying personalities and backgrounds. It’s worth going through each of them.If I have a lot of time and energy, I would love to go through each character, but I can only single out the producer, Kuzu (trash). Like the main character, Chitose, I shall only do what I feel like I can. Let\'s start with the most straight forward character:Koto is the most idealistic character in the show. She\'s the oldest among the cast and is very friendly despite her long tenure in the industry on the back field. She was not given a significant role until the fictional show, and was about to give up on her career. Her Kansai accent whiplash throughout the show. If my Japanese is better, I might have been able to interpret more from when her accent is on and off, but a part of her character in the show is to guide her juniors in the industry through their own emotional troubles. It was hinted that she felt compelled to do so because of her regrets about colleagues who couldn\'t survive the trial and tribulation of the work of a VA, with one of them still working but at a different role as we later found out. She\'s surprisingly hopeful for someone who has been through that many years without success and was on her last rope. The strength and care she brings to the cast is slowly revealed as the show goes on. If you are familiar with OreGairu, she\'s the equivalent of Shizuka, but less comedic and cool.Yae is the friend from the same acting school as the main character. She\'s a very wholesome and hardworking character, almost to the point of being without fault when it comes to cynicism. She\'s very nice and kind to everyone and cares about the main character deeply. In that, however, she\'s also aware of her general politeness and careful nature. She admitted that her words are cheap at the climax of the story. It is cynical in that she can\'t help but be nice to others, even if she might not completely think so.Sonou is the first of those with a bit more meat in the cynical category. She\'s the daughter of a famous actress and director. While merely being in high school, she has had a successful career thus far. She was the first, other than the main character, to fully acknowledge the facade of being a VA and animation production. She knows the ins and outs of being a VA and kindly teach the newbies despite them being older than her. She\'s aware of the quality of the work she\'s working on but contend to follow her manager\'s plan. Couple with that, she\'s also put on a show during presentation and giving out products willingly despite also being in agreement that this is quite unusual elsewhere but the animation industry. In that, she clashes with Shibasaki who openly questions the work they are doing and its quality. The character\'s arc of Sonou is coming into term of being a professional. Sonou entered the industry after being asked to try out during one of her mother\'s project. It could be implying that she entered not only through her own curiosity, but also her desire to match up to her parents\' success. Sonou felt lonely and neglected when her parents stopped giving her advice and dictating her decisions after she made her debut. Without being guided, she felt as if they are not interested in her future and feelings. I think her trouble is a pot of negligence, dislike being compare to her parent, feeling like her success came from her parents connections. That looks to make more sense when her issues are resolved when her mother, on the phone, acknowledges her as a professional but also as an actress of equivalent level, validating her efforts and shows that her parents are caring and guiding her in their own way.Shibasaki is set up to be the opposite of Sonou. While Sonou is cheerfully cynical, Shibaraki is grumpily cynical. She came from a resort inn family in Yamagata prefecture (famous for its beef, give Aboard in Japan a look if you want to visit). Having to defy her parents and came to Tokyo to become an actress. Because of that, she felt that singing, dancing, and doing promotional works are beneath her role as an actress. I suspect the intention is to depict her as a failed actress who had to resort to voice acting. She\'s also very keenly aware that the work she is doing is utter crap, but soldier on anyway. She put on a facade for the shows and became stressed out over her current circumstance, with Sonou notably commenting on her sour expression during her work. Shibaraki\'s trouble with her career path intertwines with her family feud. Her return to home and reconciliation with her father concluded her trouble, giving her a sense of pride in her work and dispeling the burden of disappointment, both to her family and herself, for the rest of the show. My problem with hers and Sonou arc is that they are resolved within 2 episodes. I do like that they are quite focused and there\'s a healthy amount of build up in previous chats with the other characters to slowly reveal more about their issues. It\'s quite disappointing that in the 3/4 of the show, the two mysteriously troubled veterans issues are essentially vanquished, Sonoe without much fuzz. I expected more of a pay off, frankly.Lastly, Chitose is one of the most cynical character in recent time. Her cynicism is quite different from what people usually think about cynics, but to me is the more common type of cynic. She\'s comically cynical. She can, or at least she thinks she can, see through the facade and lies of the VA profession and make harsh remarks about components of the animation production process. Most importantly, she sees VA not as a passionate project like the other Koto and Yae, but as a mean to be loved and famous. In that, she doesn\'t believe in the idealism of serving others, nor that humans should pursue higher causes. She\'s a slave to her frank and honest nature, accepting that she and humanity are selfish and self-centred. That\'s far more cynical than Hikigaya from OreGairu, who still hopes that there is something real if we strip away the facade.In addition, the author also gives her a lot of guts and confidence. It\'s very refreshing to see such a scummy protagonist who\'s arrogant, lazy, unambitious, delusional yet possessed infinite charisma. I think many people might have known or met this kind of person, and if you have never met one... I think it\'s time to dust out the mirrors. People who were disappointed by the ending might have been so because Chitose didn\'t exactly suffer any traumatic moment and soldiered on with her selfishness and carelessness.I think, however, there are a few little details about her that perhaps might be worth exploring or clarifying by the show. Her brother\'s rocky career didn\'t deter her entry to the industry. From the fact that she keeps listening to her brother\'s works and that she only confide in him her thoughts and feelings, I think she enters the industry either because she wants to be close to her brother, following his footsteps. Of course, this is only half of the reason if my conjecture is close to Watari\'s intention. The other half is she plainly just wants to be loved and famous. The second part might have developed as she got more success and gained more fame, which is also around when her head starts to inflate. While her self confidence was already sky high before she got her big break, she behaved according to industry conventions until she got the starting role. From there, she has something to cling on as a basis of her actually unfounded hubris.I love her not only because she\'s refreshing, but also because she\'s a commentary about cynical people who could actually see the cynicism and take advantage of it but not enough to overcome their own self-aggrandise and frankly, laziness. It got to a point that it seems they used cynicism as an excuse for their laziness rather than being a real cynic. You can see her small moments of brilliance when she puts her mind on improving as an actress to not piss off her colleagues, because she wants to be loved. Her story kind of encourages people like her to work harder if their hubris ever gets them into trouble. Some critics have called it ""fake it till you make it"", which is fair enough. I would also add to that, Elon Musk for example has no experience in mechanical engineering, Jeff Bezos was not an experienced manager and businessman. They have experience in doing related activities, but they all learned the rope as they went along. It\'s better to have the hubris and dive into whatever the hubris is attached to as a form of “confidence”, than having it and not using it.I also think Watari also sympathises with them, telling the audience to give these very annoying idiots a chance, because while they might be full of shit and pomposity, they ultimately are in the same situation as us, with a perhaps equally honest goal. You can see the cast gel together through her shameless behaviour and attitude. It gives a different perspective to hubris, and I can\'t think of many other works that dare to portray a very theatrical society like Japan in such a frank and snarky manner. This is the spirit of freedom of the doomer\'s Japan, where cynicism rules, but to the detriment of society but as fuel to drive people towards optimism and idealism after they have stripped themselves off of the lies that they told themselves.In general, all of them are cynical in that they accept the VA ridiculous demand and have to put on a show their scope of training and responsibility. They follow orders and customs to please others around them, while always thinking the opposite. Not only that, they take horrible projects, with the knowledge that it is crap. As with Watari\'s thus far pattern. It is not a field of cynicism. Quite contrast in fact, just like Nietzsche, Watari sees fit that to justify idealism, cynicism is needed to strip down the facade, so that idealism can take over or be built.As the story progresses, idealism kicks in, and possibly bored those who were excited about the previous cynicism. It was done through a literal goddess of idealism, Nanami, who is also cynically portrayed as a genuine airhead idiot who idolised the wrong “god”, so to speak. After all, idealists are the worst voters.The producer, Kuzu, almost parallels Chitose, and shows how in Japanese society, the race for success pushes very honest and hardworking people into reprehensible behaviour and plans, all to succeed and repair their mental damage. I also love that throughout the story, him and the president are portrayed as silly idiots with immense power. But when it comes down to it, they are still idiots, but highly functional at the same time. Kuzu might have done a lot of damage, but he sets up almost everything in his project, balancing out the interest of the studio and the publisher. By balance out I mean pushing the limit, but that\'s what producers have to do to squeeze projects out at reasonable cost.The president clearly has a lot of faith in his team, and is willing to act like he\'s going to hardball his staff to push them to do what he thinks would be good for their growth. He might not have been familiar with the trends, but his experience in dealing with people keeps his team afloat through trials and tribulations.Those little and subtle details about the side cast is what I like about this over Shirobako which covers the same subject. That seemed like a story of and about the industry. This feels like a proper story, with the industry as a background character. I prefer this one, it’s still a story with a clear theme and its characters, while Shirobako is definitely more of a slice-of-life, about everything yet nothing.Now, that\'s not to say I do not have problems with the show, even the plot and characters as a whole. The struggle of the big brother is not very well told. He\'s been given a lot of screen time but only during the final episodes did more of him open up. That\'s not the worst part. To me, the ending is the antithesis to the entire show. A damn concert? This is not an idol show.Which brings me to the next point. The art style.The colourful and eye pleasing characters design and animation, to me, kind of defeats the point of the show. The colour tone distracts me during heavier moments such as Chitose feeling isolated or Honou and Shibaraki going through their arc. In a world filled with greys, the colourful, detailed animations don\'t sit right. The characters\' designs also don\'t add a lot to more serious moments when characters are in pain. Don\'t get me wrong, when Chitose is going through her growth period, the art did a great job bringing those emotions to her face. It\'s just, not the best. A good example of that done right is OreGairu season 2. Season 1 of that show did not have as much drama, and during more serious moments, the art style surprisingly brings out quite a bit of intensity but the colour palette didn\'t help much. Season 2 on the other hand did drama very well thanks to them upgrading the budget and changing the colour tone to be more, movie like? Realistic? Those colours helped elevate the rom com drama\'s emotional heavy moments. In this, it\'s pretty hard to take these characters\' struggles seriously if the colours are so bright and cheerful, the characters design is from cute girls doing cute things animated show number 415.There\'s a fine line to walk with that meta thing, seeing how the opening and the ending of the show is still very formulaic and lacking in any sort of snarky, out of box ideas to make the show more meta. I\'m disappointed, to be honest. It has all the ingredients to be more meta, more revolutionary, more shocking to be out of the box. But in the same way that the plot outlines the failure of the animation industry to bring souls to the work, this, to me, did that very same thing. You might say it\'s intentionally contradicting, kind of like how Madoka characters design is deliberately cutesy and moe and its colour tone is very vibrant. I would say, this is just laziness. If the producers and director is in sync with the author\'s plot, this could have been a lot crazier than this almost opposite of the plot presentation. Did it add to the story? I wouldn\'t know to be honest. I can\'t imagine those who came for the cute girls doing cute things stay for the unlikable main character, and the cynics fully embrace the moment. I think only those who sit on the fence and fans of Watari would not have much trouble swallowing this. For me, however, the art is just not enough.\'Not only the art that\'s troubling me, and I rarely complain about music and sound direction, but I realised how brilliant the composer for OreGairu both seasons did with Watari\'s story tone. Girlish Number\'s mood is watery and bland due to the utterly generic and unmemorable music. When Chitose ran to the studio, I was waiting for something, anything to play to knock that moment out. All I got is something reminiscent of the usual cute girls doing cute things. Bland, generic, uninspired. I\'m not sure if the sound and art directors, as a sign of rebellion to how the author is portraying them, intentionally ignore the tone of the story and go with what is the usual generic direction, masking his work as cute girls doing cute things to hurt its reputation and sales. If you are puzzled by why I am so disturbed by the generic music design. I would point to shows such as K-On, Haruhi no Yuuutsu, Evangelion, Bakemonogatari, Air Gear and everything by Yoko Kanno. Heck, even my arch-nemesis Shinkai has a very capable composer at his side that immediately incurs the mood, the emotion into the scenes, almost instantly. There\'s this very average and nonsensical show called Galilei Donna which is unworthy of its composer, who worked on Shirobako and Final Fantasy. I would have never made it to the end without his composition. Another piece of crap that was elevated by its music is the Deen\'s adaption of Fate Stay Night, who butchered the story and frankenstein it into something, but its music was extremely memorable, especially in contrast to the utterly forgettable Unlimited Blade Works TV series. All of these shows were better because the music is good. When the music is generic like this one, it feels like part of its soul is missing. I don\'t think I have ever been as disappointed in a soundtrack as I am with this. What a joke.That being said, while I have dished out ""cynic"" and ""cynicism"" like Chinese factories producing consumers disposable craps, the entire point of the show is ultimately that while the VA world is full of cynics, the industry is all messed up, the value of individuals and their passion for their work is ever present. When Nanami is introduced and immediately jolts everyone with her infectious enthusiasm, you can see that Watari is ultimately an idealist, much like Nietzsche before him, while being less cryptic. It\'s a nice little lesson not only in the situation of the industry, or a funny depiction of it, but also one in the value of hardwork, professionalism and optimism. If I had more writing talent and time, I should have gone into a few scenes where they depict the ritual of the industry and the human face behind those facade, created to milk money of fans who don\'t really care buy into it anyway to run away from their own trouble. This is a little preview on how the show seems to me, and it\'s a damn surprising one, despite not being extraordinary, and well worth the time of those who are familiar with animation, and are looking for something a little different from the usual power fantasy garbage and more nonsense. Of course, this is not for those who are looking for a slice-of-life or are relatively new, it would just be a bore-fest, or worse, flies right over your head.Small discussion:I have given some thought to the entire package being very misleading. The trailer, poster of the show shows none of its main strengths, such as interesting cynical characters and fun writings. It seems to be a generic, cute girls doing cute things animated series. Combined this with the lacking in animation direction department, sound/music design and poorly throughout mood and tone of the series, it’s almost too meta that a story about making a half-assed animated show with some bright spot was half-assedly animated with some bright spot! Intentional or unintentional, it’s just too interesting not to discuss. familiar with.Those 2 things are: revealing the inner workings of the voice acting and animated production world and emotional development of its characters. About half way through they switched from the former to the latter. The transition can be jarring while the exposition, tedious, especially the first few episodes. They consisted of mostly the unlikable lead and just people talking. Thus, for those still hesitating to watch it, let me lay the groundwork as to why it’s definitely worth your time.The world of voice actors and actresses (VA), or Seiyuu as many of you might be familiar with, is quite insane particularly compared to the west, or anywhere else for that matter. That might be changing, as of right now, 2019, not that bad yet.Because animation is mainstream in Japan and is as popular to young people as Marvel is recently, VA are treated as stars. For those who could recall, Lucky Star was one of the most notable shows to highlight the influence of voice actors. I remember Haruhi and Lucky Star radio shows actually reached the West through fan translation which made its way to YouTube. Seiyuu started to only fulfil the role of an actor and actress, but essentially the human faces of the shows, idols, to put in a term, kind of like how the cast of shows and movies are interrogated at ComicCon.In case you have no idea how big VAs are because you are not interested in behind the scenes matters, as am I, you can go on YouTube and type in Seiyuu. What you find is something insane to me. These real human beings who merely did their job: providing voice to an animated work, have to carry the role of promoting and interacting with fans. It\'s ironic in a way, since animation is supposed to be fantastic, cater to escapists. The activities they are involved in include promo, PV shows, handing out materials, live streaming, radio shows etc... They are treated as movie stars in Otaku circles, as you can see from the comment section, which are in English. You can imagine how ridiculous they would be in Japan.That brings me to Watari Wataru\'s Girlish Number. The reason why I provided context was for those who could be unfamiliar with the animated shows production process or VA\'s world, the conversations can be puzzling and boring. Watari dug into the heart of the facade of the industry, and it\'s not always entertaining if you don\'t know what he\'s trying to make fun of.For instance, the scenario of a frivolous producer pitching his adaptation of a relatively popular novel into an animated show to the president who doesn\'t know enough about the product and subsequently producing a soulless, rushed and fragmented show slapped many projects in the face.

The most heinous of all is forcing the VA to do promotion, sing, present and do a beach photoshoot at the beach to promote and generate sales. He\'s deeply cynical and seemingly can\'t be bothered to care about anyone else.Next is the managers. On the face of it, the managers got off the easiest. They provide support to the actresses, but most of the work is done in the background. As the show progressed, you can see the managers being helpless or incapable of solving the VA\'s emotional and personal issues, despite that being their primary duty. The worst one of all manipulates his customer to ensure her career advances, at the cost of her personal\'s feelings. He freaked out when her career options were in jeopardy, and rather than caring about her personal issues.Then, we have the VA themselves. They are the main cast of the show, figuratively and literally. They all have varying personalities and backgrounds. It’s worth going through each of them.If I have a lot of time and energy, I would love to go through each character, but I can only single out the producer, Kuzu (trash). Like the main character, Chitose, I shall only do what I feel like I can. Let\'s start with the most straight forward character:Koto is the most idealistic character in the show. She\'s the oldest among the cast and is very friendly despite her long tenure in the industry on the back field. She was not given a significant role until the fictional show, and was about to give up on her career. Her Kansai accent whiplash throughout the show. If my Japanese is better, I might have been able to interpret more from when her accent is on and off, but a part of her character in the show is to guide her juniors in the industry through their own emotional troubles. It was hinted that she felt compelled to do so because of her regrets about colleagues who couldn\'t survive the trial and tribulation of the work of a VA, with one of them still working but at a different role as we later found out. She\'s surprisingly hopeful for someone who has been through that many years without success and was on her last rope. The strength and care she brings to the cast is slowly revealed as the show goes on. If you are familiar with OreGairu, she\'s the equivalent of Shizuka, but less comedic and cool.Yae is the friend from the same acting school as the main character. She\'s a very wholesome and hardworking character, almost to the point of being without fault when it comes to cynicism. She\'s very nice and kind to everyone and cares about the main character deeply. In that, however, she\'s also aware of her general politeness and careful nature. She admitted that her words are cheap at the climax of the story. It is cynical in that she can\'t help but be nice to others, even if she might not completely think so.Sonou is the first of those with a bit more meat in the cynical category. She\'s the daughter of a famous actress and director. While merely being in high school, she has had a successful career thus far. She was the first, other than the main character, to fully acknowledge the facade of being a VA and animation production. She knows the ins and outs of being a VA and kindly teach the newbies despite them being older than her. She\'s aware of the quality of the work she\'s working on but contend to follow her manager\'s plan. Couple with that, she\'s also put on a show during presentation and giving out products willingly despite also being in agreement that this is quite unusual elsewhere but the animation industry. In that, she clashes with Shibasaki who openly questions the work they are doing and its quality. The character\'s arc of Sonou is coming into term of being a professional. Sonou entered the industry after being asked to try out during one of her mother\'s project. It could be implying that she entered not only through her own curiosity, but also her desire to match up to her parents\' success. Sonou felt lonely and neglected when her parents stopped giving her advice and dictating her decisions after she made her debut. Without being guided, she felt as if they are not interested in her future and feelings. I think her trouble is a pot of negligence, dislike being compare to her parent, feeling like her success came from her parents connections. That looks to make more sense when her issues are resolved when her mother, on the phone, acknowledges her as a professional but also as an actress of equivalent level, validating her efforts and shows that her parents are caring and guiding her in their own way.Shibasaki is set up to be the opposite of Sonou. While Sonou is cheerfully cynical, Shibaraki is grumpily cynical. She came from a resort inn family in Yamagata prefecture (famous for its beef, give Aboard in Japan a look if you want to visit). Having to defy her parents and came to Tokyo to become an actress. Because of that, she felt that singing, dancing, and doing promotional works are beneath her role as an actress. I suspect the intention is to depict her as a failed actress who had to resort to voice acting. She\'s also very keenly aware that the work she is doing is utter crap, but soldier on anyway. She put on a facade for the shows and became stressed out over her current circumstance, with Sonou notably commenting on her sour expression during her work. Shibaraki\'s trouble with her career path intertwines with her family feud. Her return to home and reconciliation with her father concluded her trouble, giving her a sense of pride in her work and dispeling the burden of disappointment, both to her family and herself, for the rest of the show. My problem with hers and Sonou arc is that they are resolved within 2 episodes. I do like that they are quite focused and there\'s a healthy amount of build up in previous chats with the other characters to slowly reveal more about their issues. It\'s quite disappointing that in the 3/4 of the show, the two mysteriously troubled veterans issues are essentially vanquished, Sonoe without much fuzz. I expected more of a pay off, frankly.Lastly, Chitose is one of the most cynical character in recent time. Her cynicism is quite different from what people usually think about cynics, but to me is the more common type of cynic. She\'s comically cynical. She can, or at least she thinks she can, see through the facade and lies of the VA profession and make harsh remarks about components of the animation production process. Most importantly, she sees VA not as a passionate project like the other Koto and Yae, but as a mean to be loved and famous. In that, she doesn\'t believe in the idealism of serving others, nor that humans should pursue higher causes. She\'s a slave to her frank and honest nature, accepting that she and humanity are selfish and self-centred. That\'s far more cynical than Hikigaya from OreGairu, who still hopes that there is something real if we strip away the facade.In addition, the author also gives her a lot of guts and confidence. It\'s very refreshing to see such a scummy protagonist who\'s arrogant, lazy, unambitious, delusional yet possessed infinite charisma. I think many people might have known or met this kind of person, and if you have never met one... I think it\'s time to dust out the mirrors. People who were disappointed by the ending might have been so because Chitose didn\'t exactly suffer any traumatic moment and soldiered on with her selfishness and carelessness.I think, however, there are a few little details about her that perhaps might be worth exploring or clarifying by the show. Her brother\'s rocky career didn\'t deter her entry to the industry. From the fact that she keeps listening to her brother\'s works and that she only confide in him her thoughts and feelings, I think she enters the industry either because she wants to be close to her brother, following his footsteps. Of course, this is only half of the reason if my conjecture is close to Watari\'s intention. The other half is she plainly just wants to be loved and famous. The second part might have developed as she got more success and gained more fame, which is also around when her head starts to inflate. While her self confidence was already sky high before she got her big break, she behaved according to industry conventions until she got the starting role. From there, she has something to cling on as a basis of her actually unfounded hubris.I love her not only because she\'s refreshing, but also because she\'s a commentary about cynical people who could actually see the cynicism and take advantage of it but not enough to overcome their own self-aggrandise and frankly, laziness. It got to a point that it seems they used cynicism as an excuse for their laziness rather than being a real cynic. You can see her small moments of brilliance when she puts her mind on improving as an actress to not piss off her colleagues, because she wants to be loved. Her story kind of encourages people like her to work harder if their hubris ever gets them into trouble. Some critics have called it ""fake it till you make it"", which is fair enough. I would also add to that, Elon Musk for example has no experience in mechanical engineering, Jeff Bezos was not an experienced manager and businessman. They have experience in doing related activities, but they all learned the rope as they went along. It\'s better to have the hubris and dive into whatever the hubris is attached to as a form of “confidence”, than having it and not using it.I also think Watari also sympathises with them, telling the audience to give these very annoying idiots a chance, because while they might be full of shit and pomposity, they ultimately are in the same situation as us, with a perhaps equally honest goal. You can see the cast gel together through her shameless behaviour and attitude. It gives a different perspective to hubris, and I can\'t think of many other works that dare to portray a very theatrical society like Japan in such a frank and snarky manner. This is the spirit of freedom of the doomer\'s Japan, where cynicism rules, but to the detriment of society but as fuel to drive people towards optimism and idealism after they have stripped themselves off of the lies that they told themselves.In general, all of them are cynical in that they accept the VA ridiculous demand and have to put on a show their scope of training and responsibility. They follow orders and customs to please others around them, while always thinking the opposite. Not only that, they take horrible projects, with the knowledge that it is crap. As with Watari\'s thus far pattern. It is not a field of cynicism. Quite contrast in fact, just like Nietzsche, Watari sees fit that to justify idealism, cynicism is needed to strip down the facade, so that idealism can take over or be built.As the story progresses, idealism kicks in, and possibly bored those who were excited about the previous cynicism. It was done through a literal goddess of idealism, Nanami, who is also cynically portrayed as a genuine airhead idiot who idolised the wrong “god”, so to speak. After all, idealists are the worst voters.The producer, Kuzu, almost parallels Chitose, and shows how in Japanese society, the race for success pushes very honest and hardworking people into reprehensible behaviour and plans, all to succeed and repair their mental damage. I also love that throughout the story, him and the president are portrayed as silly idiots with immense power. But when it comes down to it, they are still idiots, but highly functional at the same time. Kuzu might have done a lot of damage, but he sets up almost everything in his project, balancing out the interest of the studio and the publisher. By balance out I mean pushing the limit, but that\'s what producers have to do to squeeze projects out at reasonable cost.The president clearly has a lot of faith in his team, and is willing to act like he\'s going to hardball his staff to push them to do what he thinks would be good for their growth. He might not have been familiar with the trends, but his experience in dealing with people keeps his team afloat through trials and tribulations.Those little and subtle details about the side cast is what I like about this over Shirobako which covers the same subject. That seemed like a story of and about the industry. This feels like a proper story, with the industry as a background character. I prefer this one, it’s still a story with a clear theme and its characters, while Shirobako is definitely more of a slice-of-life, about everything yet nothing.Now, that\'s not to say I do not have problems with the show, even the plot and characters as a whole. The struggle of the big brother is not very well told. He\'s been given a lot of screen time but only during the final episodes did more of him open up. That\'s not the worst part. To me, the ending is the antithesis to the entire show. A damn concert? This is not an idol show.Which brings me to the next point. The art style.The colourful and eye pleasing characters design and animation, to me, kind of defeats the point of the show. The colour tone distracts me during heavier moments such as Chitose feeling isolated or Honou and Shibaraki going through their arc. In a world filled with greys, the colourful, detailed animations don\'t sit right. The characters\' designs also don\'t add a lot to more serious moments when characters are in pain. Don\'t get me wrong, when Chitose is going through her growth period, the art did a great job bringing those emotions to her face. It\'s just, not the best. A good example of that done right is OreGairu season 2. Season 1 of that show did not have as much drama, and during more serious moments, the art style surprisingly brings out quite a bit of intensity but the colour palette didn\'t help much. Season 2 on the other hand did drama very well thanks to them upgrading the budget and changing the colour tone to be more, movie like? Realistic? Those colours helped elevate the rom com drama\'s emotional heavy moments. In this, it\'s pretty hard to take these characters\' struggles seriously if the colours are so bright and cheerful, the characters design is from cute girls doing cute things animated show number 415.There\'s a fine line to walk with that meta thing, seeing how the opening and the ending of the show is still very formulaic and lacking in any sort of snarky, out of box ideas to make the show more meta. I\'m disappointed, to be honest. It has all the ingredients to be more meta, more revolutionary, more shocking to be out of the box. But in the same way that the plot outlines the failure of the animation industry to bring souls to the work, this, to me, did that very same thing. You might say it\'s intentionally contradicting, kind of like how Madoka characters design is deliberately cutesy and moe and its colour tone is very vibrant. I would say, this is just laziness. If the producers and director is in sync with the author\'s plot, this could have been a lot crazier than this almost opposite of the plot presentation. Did it add to the story? I wouldn\'t know to be honest. I can\'t imagine those who came for the cute girls doing cute things stay for the unlikable main character, and the cynics fully embrace the moment. I think only those who sit on the fence and fans of Watari would not have much trouble swallowing this. For me, however, the art is just not enough.\'Not only the art that\'s troubling me, and I rarely complain about music and sound direction, but I realised how brilliant the composer for OreGairu both seasons did with Watari\'s story tone. Girlish Number\'s mood is watery and bland due to the utterly generic and unmemorable music. When Chitose ran to the studio, I was waiting for something, anything to play to knock that moment out. All I got is something reminiscent of the usual cute girls doing cute things. Bland, generic, uninspired. I\'m not sure if the sound and art directors, as a sign of rebellion to how the author is portraying them, intentionally ignore the tone of the story and go with what is the usual generic direction, masking his work as cute girls doing cute things to hurt its reputation and sales. If you are puzzled by why I am so disturbed by the generic music design. I would point to shows such as K-On, Haruhi no Yuuutsu, Evangelion, Bakemonogatari, Air Gear and everything by Yoko Kanno. Heck, even my arch-nemesis Shinkai has a very capable composer at his side that immediately incurs the mood, the emotion into the scenes, almost instantly. There\'s this very average and nonsensical show called Galilei Donna which is unworthy of its composer, who worked on Shirobako and Final Fantasy. I would have never made it to the end without his composition. Another piece of crap that was elevated by its music is the Deen\'s adaption of Fate Stay Night, who butchered the story and frankenstein it into something, but its music was extremely memorable, especially in contrast to the utterly forgettable Unlimited Blade Works TV series. All of these shows were better because the music is good. When the music is generic like this one, it feels like part of its soul is missing. I don\'t think I have ever been as disappointed in a soundtrack as I am with this. What a joke.That being said, while I have dished out ""cynic"" and ""cynicism"" like Chinese factories producing consumers disposable craps, the entire point of the show is ultimately that while the VA world is full of cynics, the industry is all messed up, the value of individuals and their passion for their work is ever present. When Nanami is introduced and immediately jolts everyone with her infectious enthusiasm, you can see that Watari is ultimately an idealist, much like Nietzsche before him, while being less cryptic. It\'s a nice little lesson not only in the situation of the industry, or a funny depiction of it, but also one in the value of hardwork, professionalism and optimism. If I had more writing talent and time, I should have gone into a few scenes where they depict the ritual of the industry and the human face behind those facade, created to milk money of fans who don\'t really care buy into it anyway to run away from their own trouble. This is a little preview on how the show seems to me, and it\'s a damn surprising one, despite not being extraordinary, and well worth the time of those who are familiar with animation, and are looking for something a little different from the usual power fantasy garbage and more nonsense. Of course, this is not for those who are looking for a slice-of-life or are relatively new, it would just be a bore-fest, or worse, flies right over your head.Small discussion:I have given some thought to the entire package being very misleading. The trailer, poster of the show shows none of its main strengths, such as interesting cynical characters and fun writings. It seems to be a generic, cute girls doing cute things animated series. Combined this with the lacking in animation direction department, sound/music design and poorly throughout mood and tone of the series, it’s almost too meta that a story about making a half-assed animated show with some bright spot was half-assedly animated with some bright spot! Intentional or unintentional, it’s just too interesting not to discuss.', 'Ironically this anime is about the harsh truth of making anime, and that not all of them will be good, but there is a lot of work put into making one.So IMO they kind of had a weird sense of humor by basically making fun of their own anime.IMO this anime is bad.But like i said , since i know the amount of work that was put in, i will give credit where credit is due. I like the Character design and art. The animation was decent. But that is about it. The anime is boring AF. We have to w8 all the...way to the last 2 episodes for something to actually happen, and even that is very short lived.It was very hard for me to go all the way through to the end of the anime, but i made a pact with myself to watch any anime i start all the way to the end, even if it is bad.

Idol anime are typically about the protagonist working their best perfecting their talents to become a successful idol, which in the end, they typically do. But this isn’t always the case, what if the idol isn’t successful in the industry and is crashing? This...occurred with Wataru Watari’s 2016 light novel, Girlish Number. Today I will be talking about the high’s and lows of the anime adaptation of said manga.To begin, I wanted to talk about some of the history behind girlish number, so you could get a feel of it. Girlish Number was originally written by Wataru Watari and was first released as a light novel on January 30, 2016, which would eventually come to an end in 2017. Later on, the light novel would revice two spin-offs by the names Girlish Number: momoka memorial, and Girlish Number Shura. Both of these stories don’t really contribute much to the overall story of girlish number, but can still be a fun read. On october 7, 2016, Watari’s novel was adapted by the anime studio Diomedea to produce an anime series of the same name. Girlish Number aired for 12 episodes and had mediocre feedback, resulting in a grad score of 6.88 on MAL. Was this score deserved? You’ll find out very soon.To begin with the actual talk about the anime, I decided that I should probably begin with the characters to avoid confusion in later segments of the video. Girlish Numbers\' main cast features Chitose Karasuma, Koto Katakura, Kazuha Shibasaki, Momoka Sonou, and Yae Kugayama. Chitose Karasuma is considered the lead of girlish number, she is a college student hoping to make it as an idol, in fact, most of these characters are college students. Chitose is known for her bratty personality and with amazing expressions, she is also known for her lazy, sloth-like personality, making her not really wanting to do any work. Will this come back to bite her? Koto Katakura is the oldest out of all the characters at the age of 26. Koto is known as being the otaku of the group and is also known for speaking in a regional dialect. Yae Kugayama is fairly new to the industry, similarly to chitose, she is known for being far too kind to the point where people say her words “hold no weight”. Momoka and Kazuha are known as the veterans of the group, they both are already famous idols who just happened to end up working on the same project as the other three members of the main cast. I really like the dynamics of the characters as they couldn’t be anymore different.The next essential thing to this anime is its music and animation. I decided to combine the two of them as it\'s probably the part I have the least to talk about. To begin the anime adaptation chose to take a softer approach to its style, allowing some of the best facial expressions to do along with the comedy within the series. Compared to the manga or light novel, the anime seems to look completely different compared to its source material. Another thing to mention is just how different the characters look inside of the anime adaptation, I mean just look at manga chitose versus anime chitose. As for the music of girlish number, considering it\'s an idol anime, you would assume the music is on point, right? Well, you are absolutely correct! The anime adaptation features 6 unique songs featured throughout its 12 episodes, the most prominent being its opening, bloom, and it\'s ending, Ima wa Mijikashi Yume Miyo Otome. Personally, I believe the opening for girlish number couldn’t be any more perfect. The opening, Bloom, is as the title entails, blooming. The song is about wanting to be number one, sprouting the seeds of their career, hoping it will one day bloom into a famous idol.  I guess you could say the same thing about my YouTube channel hehe. All in all, I believe girlish number did have solid animation and music.Story (spoilerless)The story of girlish number is about Chitose Karasuma, a college student aspiring to be an idol. The wikipedia description defines it as “College student Chitose Karasuma is determined not to do boring things as she enters the adult world. To this end, this bad-mannered beauty barges into a facility that trains would-be voice actors and actresses, somehow landing a job at ""Number One Produce,"" a seiyuu agency managed by her older brother, Gojou. In Chitose\'s mind, she\'s poised for greatness, but finds herself at a loss when she continues to only get minor roles.” Essentially, Chitose is very lazy and self-centered, giving no care to the people around her. Since she is so lazy, she barely makes it in the industry relying on her brother to do most of the work, but will this all change? Another thing to mention is that Chitose isn’t really a singing idol, she\'s actually a voice actor, working in the anime industry. The story does take some breaks from Chitose to develop other members of the main cast, but I guess it isn’t essential for a story about Chitose.Story (spoilers)Alright so for those who are still here, let\'s get started. The story begins with Chitose’s debut as a Seiyuu. If I was to be brutally honest this first part wasn’t really my favorite as I thought it was a little bit bland to the point where I almost dropped the whole series. Not too soon after, we are first introduced to chitoses bratty personality, arguing with her brother and complaining about the roles he gets for her. Eventually, Chitose caught her lucky break, she managed to get a role of a main cast as the main heroine, but there was a twist. This was a harem anime, so there were multiple main heroines, so in reality, chitose wasn’t all that special. The other girls of this harem anime where all the girls mentioned within the characters section. In the next episode, we get even more of a glimpse at chitoses bratty personality, she starts flexing her main role to other rookie voice actors, even though we all know her role isn’t special. The main purpose of the episode was to let us get well acquainted with all the characters while also showing us the quality of the anime they\'re working on, which to put it simply, is terrible. So at this point we know that even though chitose has a main role, it\'s one for a low budget harem anime. In episode 3 the recording for the anime starts, which is when the laziness of chitose show. Since chitose put no effort into practicing for the recordings, her acting for them was absolutely horrendous. In this episode, we see Chitose realize how her laziness has affected her, causing her to reach out to her colleague, momoka, to learn how to properly voice act. As of episode 4, the budget for the anime really began to show, they weren’t on time with their production, leaving their fans disappointed. Also in this episode, the anime finally did debut, which ended up having a terrible launch, people hated it. Of course at the end of the day all she cared about was if she lost any followers over it. (also can we beat chitose in follower count, thank you)! As of episode 5, chitoses greed began to show, the anime was started to get sales and all chitose cared about was her paycheck. Meanwhile everyone was concerned about the sales of the series, all Chitose cared about was stuffing her face, showing the gluttonous side of Chitose. The end of this episode gave chitose exactly what was coming for her, a cyber troll attack exposing her for what she really is. The next episode shows how Chitose is still traumatized by her cyber attack to the point where she was too afraid to stare at a camera, although she brushed it off fairly easily. The other important plot in this episode was showing us how everyone was finding new jobs in the industry, meanwhile chitose is still slacking, with no new jobs. Episodes 7 and 8 are mostly development for Suzuka and Momoka, so for the sake of this review I’m gonna brush over it, but these were still some solid episodes. One thing I have failed to mention prior to now was that throughout the past 8 episodes, chitose was constantly reminded that if she keeps on being lazy, she would end up getting replaced in the industry as she was easily replaceable. This occurred when Nanami was added to the mix, namani was cute, kind, dedicated, essentially everything chitose wasn’t. Nanami began to jump in popularity eventually taking some of Chitose’s roles, and eventually even Chitoses manager. Episode 10 is about Chitose realizing the mistakes she\'s made along the way, causing her to become depressed. This goes on throughout episode 11, but in the process we learn that all the idols were dependent on chitose charismatic personality the whole time. It wasn’t until Chitose’s brother came to cheer her up that she returned to the industry. The final episode, episode 12, is about Chitose\'s huge turning point. Chitose decided to change in order to stay in the industry so her seed could bloom. In this episode, Chitose said something I will never forget, essentially, Chitose says she acknowledges that she\'s horrible, easily replaced, and bratty, but even so, she loves the industry and will give it her all no matter what. I can really relate to this, as a small YouTuber, I could easily be replaced by essentially anyone with a bigger subscriber count, but even so, I want to put all my effort into the best videos for you guys so that I can show my passion for this. The anime has a semi-happy ending as the anime they were working on managed to just barely make enough money to produce a second season.Final verdictThe anime adaptation of Girlish Number seemed so different from its source material, but I would certainly say this was for the best. The anime redesigns I believe are far better then the source materials, making the anime even better. Although the story did have its ups and downs, but the quality of the ups makes up for the downs the anime went through. Some of the said ups can get really emotional, improving the watch of girlish number. As said earlier in the video, the music and animation are on point for the direction the anime was going, I don’t really see a way it could be improved one, the vibrant colors the anime has along with the amazing soundtrack, there is just no way it could get any better. All things considered, I decided to give Girlish Number a… 9/10! The only real reason the anime didn’t get a 10/10 was because there are some issues with the story, but nonetheless, this is an amazing anime and you should watch it too. occurred with Wataru Watari’s 2016 light novel, Girlish Number.

The wikipedia description defines it as “College student Chitose Karasuma is determined not to do boring things as she enters the adult world. To this end, this bad-mannered beauty barges into a facility that trains would-be voice actors and actresses, somehow landing a job at ""Number One Produce,"" a seiyuu agency managed by her older brother, Gojou. In Chitose\'s mind, she\'s poised for greatness, but finds herself at a loss when she continues to only get minor roles.” Essentially, Chitose is very lazy and self-centered, giving no care to the people around her. Since she is so lazy, she barely makes it in the industry relying on her brother to do most of the work, but will this all change? Another thing to mention is that Chitose isn’t really a singing idol, she\'s actually a voice actor, working in the anime industry. The story does take some breaks from Chitose to develop other members of the main cast, but I guess it isn’t essential for a story about Chitose.Story (spoilers)Alright so for those who are still here, let\'s get started. The story begins with Chitose’s debut as a Seiyuu. If I was to be brutally honest this first part wasn’t really my favorite as I thought it was a little bit bland to the point where I almost dropped the whole series. Not too soon after, we are first introduced to chitoses bratty personality, arguing with her brother and complaining about the roles he gets for her. Eventually, Chitose caught her lucky break, she managed to get a role of a main cast as the main heroine, but there was a twist. This was a harem anime, so there were multiple main heroines, so in reality, chitose wasn’t all that special. The other girls of this harem anime where all the girls mentioned within the characters section. In the next episode, we get even more of a glimpse at chitoses bratty personality, she starts flexing her main role to other rookie voice actors, even though we all know her role isn’t special. The main purpose of the episode was to let us get well acquainted with all the characters while also showing us the quality of the anime they\'re working on, which to put it simply, is terrible. So at this point we know that even though chitose has a main role, it\'s one for a low budget harem anime. In episode 3 the recording for the anime starts, which is when the laziness of chitose show. Since chitose put no effort into practicing for the recordings, her acting for them was absolutely horrendous. In this episode, we see Chitose realize how her laziness has affected her, causing her to reach out to her colleague, momoka, to learn how to properly voice act. As of episode 4, the budget for the anime really began to show, they weren’t on time with their production, leaving their fans disappointed. Also in this episode, the anime finally did debut, which ended up having a terrible launch, people hated it. Of course at the end of the day all she cared about was if she lost any followers over it. (also can we beat chitose in follower count, thank you)! As of episode 5, chitoses greed began to show, the anime was started to get sales and all chitose cared about was her paycheck. Meanwhile everyone was concerned about the sales of the series, all Chitose cared about was stuffing her face, showing the gluttonous side of Chitose. The end of this episode gave chitose exactly what was coming for her, a cyber troll attack exposing her for what she really is. The next episode shows how Chitose is still traumatized by her cyber attack to the point where she was too afraid to stare at a camera, although she brushed it off fairly easily. The other important plot in this episode was showing us how everyone was finding new jobs in the industry, meanwhile chitose is still slacking, with no new jobs. Episodes 7 and 8 are mostly development for Suzuka and Momoka, so for the sake of this review I’m gonna brush over it, but these were still some solid episodes. One thing I have failed to mention prior to now was that throughout the past 8 episodes, chitose was constantly reminded that if she keeps on being lazy, she would end up getting replaced in the industry as she was easily replaceable. This occurred when Nanami was added to the mix, namani was cute, kind, dedicated, essentially everything chitose wasn’t. Nanami began to jump in popularity eventually taking some of Chitose’s roles, and eventually even Chitoses manager. Episode 10 is about Chitose realizing the mistakes she\'s made along the way, causing her to become depressed. This goes on throughout episode 11, but in the process we learn that all the idols were dependent on chitose charismatic personality the whole time. It wasn’t until Chitose’s brother came to cheer her up that she returned to the industry. The final episode, episode 12, is about Chitose\'s huge turning point. Chitose decided to change in order to stay in the industry so her seed could bloom. In this episode, Chitose said something I will never forget, essentially, Chitose says she acknowledges that she\'s horrible, easily replaced, and bratty, but even so, she loves the industry and will give it her all no matter what. I can really relate to this, as a small YouTuber, I could easily be replaced by essentially anyone with a bigger subscriber count, but even so, I want to put all my effort into the best videos for you guys so that I can show my passion for this. The anime has a semi-happy ending as the anime they were working on managed to just barely make enough money to produce a second season.Final verdictThe anime adaptation of Girlish Number seemed so different from its source material, but I would certainly say this was for the best. The anime redesigns I believe are far better then the source materials, making the anime even better. Although the story did have its ups and downs, but the quality of the ups makes up for the downs the anime went through. Some of the said ups can get really emotional, improving the watch of girlish number. As said earlier in the video, the music and animation are on point for the direction the anime was going, I don’t really see a way it could be improved one, the vibrant colors the anime has along with the amazing soundtrack, there is just no way it could get any better. All things considered, I decided to give Girlish Number a… 9/10! The only real reason the anime didn’t get a 10/10 was because there are some issues with the story, but nonetheless, this is an amazing anime and you should watch it too.', ""Story: so the story is about Chitose who wants to become a actress but she is having a hard time landing a real good role and or a main role and just get stuck with the lesser known roles and what not so she is able to finally land a lead role in a anime but of course that wont come with out some hardships and also with dealing with the voice acting the hate from other people ect. so she pretty much learns to adept to everything while trying to get out of the mob roles and into the spotlight as a lead in...a anime.Art: i don't really knack on the art that much but ill say the art is really well done here nothing else to say here.Sound: sound is really good actually loved both the OP and the ED here and also loved all the Voice actors here.Character: Chitose is the one of the many female lead of the anime and well she is a pretty snobby and pretty much just wants to become popular also she can be pretty much a case to handle sense she just wants to become popular and noticed by everyone that's how i would describe as her in general i loved her she was a really good character even though with everything i listed. Koto i mean i personally could just describe her as happy go lucky and just a friendly face as for her character i didn't mind her that much just meh to me honestly. Yae is pretty much the person gets like really shy when she talks to the others and what not but again is a happy go lucky person in herself when she doesn't get shy like really quick like she does as for her character again like Koto i didn't mind her just meh to me. Kazuha is pretty much the person who doesn't really show much emotion if at all honestly that's the real easy way to describe her (she will show it sometimes though) as for her character again just meh to me. Momoka is honestly almost like Koto and Yae (but to a degree in terms of Yae) as just being happy and go lucky honestly as for her character i mean again meh i didn't mind all the characters i honestly just really loved Chitose in the anime.Enjoyment: What i liked: i mean for the slice of life it does it really damn well and also the comedy in this was just straight up good and most of the characters in this were really enjoyable to me. What i didn't like: only real bad thing for this for me was the some of the characters in this i personally didn't care for but that's my only real gripe with the anime.Overall: ill be giving this a 8 the comedy and the slice of life was done to a tee and just really damn good as to the character (that i liked) being just really well done here and the voice actors being really well here as well a anime that is worth the watch a anime.Art: i don't really knack on the art that much but ill say the art is really well done here nothing else to say here.Sound: sound is really good actually loved both the OP and the ED here and also loved all the Voice actors here.Character: Chitose is the one of the many female lead of the anime and well she is a pretty snobby and pretty much just wants to become popular also she can be pretty much a case to handle sense she just wants to become popular and noticed by everyone that's how i would describe as her in general i loved her she was a really good character even though with everything i listed.

She's constantly ignoring her own faults, overestimating her ability and trash talking others - not just her coworkers, but her seniors, her brother (who's the only reason she has any jobs in the first place, and the only funny character in the show) and the industry in general, considering she's actually terrible at her job. She refuses to put in effort or accept criticism, constantly complains she isn't making money in a career that doesn't pay even the biggest stars all that much, and generally acts like a small child instead of an adult. She never once...seems to be enjoying herself and by episode 3 I was questioning why she bothered trying to be a voice actor in the first place. In fact, everyone seems to hate their jobs for the most part, and while it's understandable that it would be frustrating working on a bad quality and badly managed project, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable to watch. They try to keep you interested by making you feel bad for the cast, but they're all so uninteresting or unlikeable that I literally did not care. The filler episode was just mindless exploitation and complaining. Dropped it halfway though. seems to be enjoying herself and by episode 3 I was questioning why she bothered trying to be a voice actor in the first place.

This doesn't necessarily reflect on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment associated with this show and I have admittedly not touched the source material for this show. I will say, first and foremost, I have no idea why people enjoy the character that is Chitose Karasuma. She is awful, she is disdainful, she is prideful, she is a pain, and worst of all this doesn't really change by the end. They just continue to allow her to be the way she...is because it supposedly makes her a good seiyuu. The supporting cast is alright, but none of them are particularly great as individuals. I think Kazuha and Momoka stand out as well-rounded characters, but we only get a semblance of true depth from these two as the rest of the characters are mostly passed over in favor of a more general plot that targets the shortcomings of the animation industry and the many pitfalls that both source authors and everyone responsible for adaptation.The skeleton for a great series is present, but I found myself frustrated with the lack of enjoyable moments. It felt like I was waiting for a character to grow and possible become a reasonable human being, but instead they double down and continue to be a trash character. Parallel to the producer, Kuzu-san, who just so happens to also be a garbage character. The motivations for these characters to become rich or famous or respected, they're shallow. Is this realistic? Maybe in some ways, but the characters themselves are caricatures or portraits of real-life stereotypes. It could be said that this was intentional on Watari's part, again I have not touched the source material so I can't rightfully say whether this would be more or less clear based on the original work.This series does give a good idea of a story that doesn't necessary fulfill the wishes of the audience, maybe it was never meant to. This series in ways gives me Haruhi vibes. Our main character is a selfish brat who has all the other characters at her whims. What made Haruhi much more interesting, however, is that Haruhi has the other characters on a string and if they do anything adverse to her plans the world could end. Chitose has none of this power and yet still manages to have the others cater to her moods.Story gets a 5. It's right in between really good and really bad, so that means I'm neutral on it. I was able to watch the entire series without having an aneurysm but did I enjoy watching it? It's a question I'm not sure I can answer because I really enjoyed the take on life in the animation industry for all the characters, but the characters we followed made me grit my teeth at times. The heartfelt moments with Chitose, I honestly felt like she deserved to feel like crap. So maybe I got satisfaction from those moments simply for the fact that her brother's opinions were validated. Kazuha's upbringing being displayed was a highlight of the storytelling.Art is good, gets a 7. Some animations were awkward as hell, a great example being the scene right before Chitose completely disrespects Gojo by saying he wasted his time trying to be a seiyuu, he waddles into the frame. A lot of the characters were clean and well-done, Nanami seemed to be a little less focused on in terms of design than the rest of the characters. She's young of course, but not much younger than the rest. Some scenes delivered very well, like Chitose running to the recording studio and falling, breaking the phone and getting soaked.I give the show a 6, which I think is more than reasonable for something that is a subjective score. I don't think this is a great show, but I saw plenty of ways it could be an amazing show. As a viewer, I often look for character development and design as a cornerstone for how well a show is written. Believable characters create a believable story. This show started off with believable characters, but by the end the illusion faded. Chitose's importance was emphasized while her growth was stunted.

I really like the artstyle even tho it was a bit shiny/ The topic is interesting, if we like the job of this show, i can't stop myself from imaginining the voice actresses when they had to do an anime about their job with a studio who do a ot so great anime. Characters are hard to remember we dont even have to remember their name. But i really liked the personality of the main character who is really funny. I'd like to say, yes this is not the best anime of the world but it's still nice to...spend time.The first part of the anime is a little bit boring because it only deals with the development of one char not really useful for me, it wasn't really good to put that for the beginning, at least the second part is more interesting and better.Animé sympa mais oubliable. J'aime beaucoup les graphismes bien que ce soit peut-être un peu brillant. Le sujet est intéressant, du moins si on aime l'univers du doublage, d'ailleurs je peux pas m’empêcher d'imaginer les doubleuses qui font un anime sur leur métier mais sur un studio qui fait un animé moyen. Les personnages sont facilement oubliable, a tel point qu'on retient a peine leur nom, par contre le caractère de l’héroïne est très drôle. Autant prévenir oui ce n'est pas le meilleur animé du monde mais c'est ok pour passer du temps, la première partie de l'animé n'était pas utile pour moi, elle servait qu'a développer surtout un personnage secondaire, la deuxième partie est bien mieux spend time.The first part of the anime is a little bit boring because it only deals with the development of one char not really useful for me, it wasn't really good to put that for the beginning, at least the second part is more interesting and better.Animé sympa mais oubliable.

Grappler Baki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1859/Grappler_Baki,"[""Some of the technics will make you cringe. Good OVA to the series. This was out long before the tv series so animation is a little older looking. Basically, it's a longer episode of the series. The characters are actually the same. I saw this first, and while watching the series, I realized they basically absorbed the OVA into the series. In other words, if you saw the series, you seen this OVA. Still, it's worth a watch, especially if your a Baki fan. "", 'After seeing the baki episodes i wanted to try out this movie. Its not as good as the series but it still makes up if you want a little &quot;shot&quot; of baki. This was made before the episodes and sadly the spisodes did not finish beacuase of finacial problems. But If you l&oslash;iked baki the grappler episodes chances are you will this one too. Defintely a must for baki fans! ', ""Oh boy, another seriously underrated OVA. Truly a shame how so many great OVA from the 90s don't get the praise they deserve on this site.So after watching the first season of Baki I decided to check out the older OVA before continuing with Season Two. But let's review this beautiful piece of art step by step:Story: 9/10 The OVA covers up the Karate tournament which was animated as well in season one of Baki the Grappler (TV). Nothing outstanding but a simple and great tournament setting which I love and in my opinion one of the best ways to present great fights and Baki...is a pure-blooded fighting series.It doesn't show anything from the main overall plot of Baki (one day beating his dad) but it decided to focus solely on this Karate tournament. Good choice.Art: 10/10 As a fan of old school anime I just loved it. It fits way better than the new school animation style. The animation was ON POINT, I was really shocked - in a positive way. Incredibly fluid movements, realistic facial expressions, even minor things like a woman cutting vegetables with a knife; the sharp knife mirrored the cut vegetables. The colors are also perfect, Baki has black hair like his mother in the OVA whereas his hair is red in the TV series like his father. I prefer black hair.All those things I mentioned are things the TV series unfortunately lacked to some extent probably because of a low budget. Not to mention they cut off the blood in Baki for the most part which isn't the case with this OVA.Sound: 10/10 Like the TV series this OVA also has very catchy old school fighting games OSTs which I really appreciate. They fit perfectly into the overall fighting theme. Sound effects were also great and gave out a nice martial arts fighting game vibe. Pure nostalgia for someone whose childhood consisted of playing Tekken and Street Fighter on PlayStation 1&2. What is also mentionable is that Baki screamed Bruce Lee style like in Fist of the North Star which was kinda funny, doesn't happen in the TV series.Character: 10/10 In regards to this OVA alone the character have nothing I can complain about. This is a pure fighting show so there is no incredible plot-twisting character development but rather a beastly Baki who looks so happy when he's fighting. His final opponent is also a very interesting one. Baki doesn't shine in realistic fights but rather in creative over the top martial arts fights.Certainly unnatural yet not supernatural.Enjoyment: 10/10 Nothing more to add, it's just very fun to watch a martial arts tournament with beastly fighters in an underground arena with great animation and sound. Pure enjoyment.Overall 10/10 If you love fighting, martial arts, old school animation style, catchy 90s sound then this is for you! You cannot miss this underrated OVA!

Rewatch-worthy!"", '- Grappler Baki -Let\'s review the 1994 OVA titled ""Grappler Baki: The Ultimate Fighter"".Welcome to the random world of Baki the Grappler.. where and what is going on in terms of development? Your guess is as good as mine. This OVA throws you right into the action with no explanation. Having viewed the English dub of the OVA I can say.. DON\'T. I think most people that wish to go back and watch this will enjoy it much more in Japanese. The 90\'s was a brilliant time for many things.. you name it: Music, Sports, and even Entertainment. Falling into the entertainment...category is anime. Along throughout the 90\'s we received the not so notorious OVA for Grappler Baki. I want to start and say I\'m a huge fan of the TV Series for Grappler Baki. Having watched this after the TV series was a huge help. This OVA throws you right into the action like I said. It\'s setting is based around the Tournament arc. For fans of the franchise this is brilliant. I\'m quite happy to see all characters in place and acting out as they should. Nothing seemed outta place with this OVA. THANKFULLY. Not much is explained about the story but the setting is right. Story: 5. The animation is old school of course and quite fluid (but don\'t take my animation review serious animators) I know not much about the ways of animating. I like what I see and in my eyes that is all that matters. Animation: 8. What would be any anime wouldn\'t the soundtrack? Sound is everything! Captivating ones emotion and deliver the correct feeling at the right time and truly make or break a show. Specially more serious toned shows. The soundtrack will probably differ in both English and Japanese versions. The English version: Suitable to say the least. Sound: 5. Moving on let\'s talk actual characters.. A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT GOING ON HERE. Let me say that is sarcasm.. be it this is text form I don\'t know how many of you could pick that up. In all seriousness Grappler Baki is a strict fighting show. It\'s known for it\'s gruesome yet intensifying fights. Be it characters like Shinogi, Kosho the cord cutter or protagonist Hanma, Baki. Each character is brutal and delivers that pump when fighting. The OVA set itself up nicely.. and even if you haven\'t seen the TV series or read Grappler Baki I believe you will find yourself enjoying the characters and design. Character: 6. Now boiling down to the final bits of this overly extended review due to me being completely bored one night. Come say hello on my page if you read this. Let\'s now talk enjoyment however.. This anime is FIGHTING. If you like fighting animes that focus on the fighting ONLY.. You will enjoy. I fell in love with Grappler Baki for it\'s style and unique approach. It truly does offer something unlike any other in the anime world. Enjoyment: 7.That wraps in my review of Grappler Baki: The Ultimate Fighter. Thanks for reading and for the overall score I give this a: 6.It\'s a good watch. Don\'t pass it up. category is anime.

It\'s known for it\'s gruesome yet intensifying fights. Be it characters like Shinogi, Kosho the cord cutter or protagonist Hanma, Baki. Each character is brutal and delivers that pump when fighting. The OVA set itself up nicely.. and even if you haven\'t seen the TV series or read Grappler Baki I believe you will find yourself enjoying the characters and design. Character: 6. Now boiling down to the final bits of this overly extended review due to me being completely bored one night. Come say hello on my page if you read this. Let\'s now talk enjoyment however.. This anime is FIGHTING. If you like fighting animes that focus on the fighting ONLY.. You will enjoy. I fell in love with Grappler Baki for it\'s style and unique approach. It truly does offer something unlike any other in the anime world. Enjoyment: 7.That wraps in my review of Grappler Baki: The Ultimate Fighter. Thanks for reading and for the overall score I give this a: 6.It\'s a good watch. Don\'t pass it up.', 'I never liked this anime and time really hasn\'t done it any favors at all. I decided to rewatch it only because I recently gave the TV series Baki the Grappler a rewatch. I\'m not normally a fan of remakes, but this is one title that really needed it through the 48 episode TV series, because this anime is so bland to the point it can barely even fall back on its action.Yuji Asada did a very poor job directing this anime. There is pretty much no story and the plot is non existent. Before some crazed fan decides to leap and shout out the...short run time as an excuse. I recommend giving Battle Angel a watch to see what a competent anime director can do in a short time. This anime is all about the fight and nothing more which wouldn\'t be a problem if they were all good.Baki is competing in a Karate tournament for whatever reason. Then he makes his way off to the underground circuit where he\'s champion, which explains why he\'s so tough for people to beat and far beyond black belts in the other tournament he\'s competing in. There\'s no real reason on why he\'s fighting there, these things are all just happening and various characters are making token appearances just to have them. There are at least three characters and a couple of segments that could have been completely removed and the ""story"" wouldn\'t have been effected at all. This is just how bare bones it is. Grappler Baki makes Ayane\'s High Kick look like a masterpiece, and that anime is around the same run time.Baki is an unlikable character. He was even a bit cocky before his final match against Shinogi Kosho, a martial arts master whose main skill is to pierce his enemies skin with his fingers, and then severe arteries and nerves to cripple them. I found myself cheering on Shinogi to outright kill Baki; and Baki is the main character who\'s suppose to be liked. This is something that should never happen.The animation is very grimy. It\'s very low budget with not much attention paid to the backgrounds. There are quite a few static backgrounds during the matches and a small amount of reused cels. Fortunately, there are times when the action stands out. The fight between Baki and Shinogi is very brutal with some gory, deep penetrations and ripping of nerves. The blows are bone chilling with some high impact. Therefore, there is something to like here even though every fight before this isn\'t even worth talking about. The BGM really doesn\'t add much life to this lifeless anime, and I hate the English dub too. Carter Cathcart voices Baki and this guy is annoying. I really hated Baki\'s shrieks and yells. I wish Shinogi would have just strangled him to death. I recommend the sub which is better but doesn\'t really help this anime much.Grappler Baki shouldn\'t have been made for any reason. This short OVA makes me appreciate the TV series even more despite being unfinished. One can tell that this OVA had a story just screaming to be let out. There was potential every where and I remember hoping this anime would get the series treatment when I first saw it back in the 90\'s. Overall, I only recommend this title to hardcore anime fans whom must see them all. If you do not fall into that category then skip this completely for the TV series, because you\'re not missing anything by leaving this alone.Highs: Some brutal action towards the endLows: Nothing else besides the brutal action towards the end short run time as an excuse.

I first saw it after renting it from a hollywood videos in \'08 (I think). I (litteraly) just recently went about rewatching it for the first time in years. Here\'s how I\'ll start this off. Nostalgia is a cruel mistress.When I first came upon this little movie, I was delighted at sight of it. I remembered the cool fighting scenes and the interesting, yet original fighting techniques being used. Most of all, the main characters Goku-like energy and personality was definatly something I loved...when watching it. Problem is, when you watch it with more negative and picky tastes then when your younger, your in for nasty surprises.Character: Since I already made a comment on the subject, I\'ll start with character. To me the characters are a mostly pitiful bunch. The most entertaining characters were Baki, the big fella, and maybe the ""cord cutter"". by the way, thats not saying alot. Everyone else had pretty much hollow backgrounds with very little back story filling in the spaces. Heck, there were character development moments that were completely 180 and random. One painfully obvious example is the family development thats shoe horned for baki\'s case. You could\'ve completely cut out that scene and I would have felt no different towards the movie as a whole. Another example would be how the motorcycle member of the enemy martial arts household from earlier in the film goes from ""I\'mma kick yer butt"" to ""Don\'t give up Baki-kun!"" in a matter of a single match. The main problem was that even though there was devinatly character development opputunity, none of the oppurtinuites were taken.Story: The stories even worse. This branches off what I ended the charater peice on. To clarify, there would be moments where you\'d here a supposedly important tidbit of info, but get zero explanation behind the tidbit. Zilch, nothing, nadda. They almost try to give you a sliver of bait and expect you to be ok with it justing cruising about. It gets to the point where you begin waving off anything serious said by the characters. For petes sake, the history bits were more informative then the main story. I don\'t even fully understand what Bakis fighting for! Is it just to fight? is he trying to prove something? we\'ll never know (within the boundries of the film).Art: Just gonna let you know, I have a soft spot for art. If the style of art appeals to me, thats enough to keep me going for another 30 min. (I\'m talking old school animated anime art and this movie has just that). The character designs of the cast are very easy and sometimes entertaining to look at. This is mostly due to the heavy detail in the character physical design. Its almost comic book-like (not mangas, the american stuff). Well, the body designs at least (the faces would never pass for comic-like). All and all, it was refreshing seeing such wonderfully intricate muscular designs. (the animation was too bad either)Sound: the sound was just horrible in some spots.The worst one was the scene showing the girlfriend. The dub was so bad that I couldn\'t beleive the actors voice was even assosciated woith the character. also, in some parts, the voice acting even gets alittle choppy at ends (It could be the quality of video though)Enjoyment: The main three factors as to why I somewhat enjoyed this work dispite its MANY flaws was Goku-like cockiness, nostalgia, and most important, the anatomy of it. I\'ve never come across an anime that went into so much detail over the human anatomy(not much, but still more then average for anime). It was a educationally thirlling expriance as a kid and still is today (beleive it or not, there is some truth to what is feature during the matches).That is all I have to say for today. I\'m the Script Weaver wishing you all a great evening! when watching it.

I\'m the Script Weaver wishing you all a great evening!', ""What a weird and equally nice change of pace.The first striking change was definitely the art style, this having been an older adaptation of Baki does show its age but never with less character and drive. Something about this old, crusty animation felt more alive and appealing than the TV series, it was clunky but responsive, amateur but full of life, and it definitely had a distinct flair for the action.Given the short airtime, I couldn't be harsher on the mediocrity of the storytelling, it was a queue of fights against some fighters that we see in the main series, one thing I should mention...though is how better and more ominous Shinogi looks here, scarier and intimidating that on the main series. And without forgetting this version of Baki, it's honestly my favorite looking version of him.Overall: 6.4/10, though is how better and more ominous Shinogi looks here, scarier and intimidating that on the main series. And without forgetting this version of Baki, it's honestly my favorite looking version of him.Overall: 6.4/10,"", ""Clocking in at a mere forty-five minutes, Grappler Baki doesn't waste time on building a gripping plot. Instead, it wisely focuses on combat throughout, making it a potential watch for any martial arts enthusiast. Baki Hanma, our protagonist, may only hold a white belt, but he's a force to be reckoned with in the Shinshinkai Karate Championships. His spectacular skills catch the attention of a spectator, leading him to an exclusive underground fighting venue where he truly puts his abilities to the test.This OVA glorifies fighting for the sake of fighting, skipping the lengthy dialogue and explanation of fighting techniques that most other martial arts...anime include. The facial expressions are stretched out to unbelievable proportions, and the fighting itself is fast, exciting, and incredibly unconventional. Baki's biggest adversary is a man with the ability to aim for one's nerves and muscle fibers and pluck them out with his steel-like fingers. Watching him stick his fingers inside of people and rip them apart seriously disturbed me, but in a good way, like how people derive pleasure from watching grossly macabre horror/slasher films. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the testosterone-driven homage to laying the smackdown on anyone who stands in your way—whether that's your cup of tea or not. anime include.

The animation has aged, but it's not awful or anything, and you gotta have that cheesy ass 80s soundtrack. The fight scenes are fairly well done, and the movement is mostly fluid. The main character is likeable enough for sure,and even his main opponent wasn't really a bad guy per say. If you don't count the ripping people's nerves out bit.

I'm always excited for a new episode to come out and I always enjoy it. Now that another season finished airing, it's the time for me to write my review.Story: Young Megumi Aino, age 14, and Hime Shirayuki, age 14, bump into each other unintentionally. They become friends. Soon, Megumi meets Ribbon, her mascot. She is given a Pretty Change Mirror (PreChan Mirror) to transform into the tough Cure Lovely. Hime, who was already a Cure, transforms into Cure Princess. They fight the Saiarks and save the city from destruction.Overall: 9/10Art: This...style is extremely...unique from other anime. The animation makes it look more cartoonish but with an anime feeling to it. Every episode, the art gets better and better. Never has it been a horrible style. Plus the CG was AMAZING. It was like the endings of Pretty Cure, but this time, it was inserted in the middle of the episode.Overall: 10/10Sound: The OST was so beautiful. Each episode had a different sound track and no sound track was the same. The opening and endings (Especially Pretty Cure Memory) are as catchy as burrito. The voice acting was SPLENDID. Back in the beginning of 2014 I was scared because Megumi might have a squeaky voice. NOPE! They made her be voiced by Megumi Nakajima, who was an idol girl.Overall: 10/10Character: Megumi Aino is a young girl who, like every other cure, is energetic and fun. Then there is Hime Shirayuki, a shy, timid princess girl. Then, there is Yuko Oomori, who is the sweetie bell of the season. Lastly, there is Iona Hikawa, the boyish of the season.Overall: 9/10Enjoyment: This was a WONDERFUL season and the second best season out of all. I give this a 10 out of 10!

This time, Happiness charge looks very similar to Heartcatch precure.Story: 8/10The story is the same as always: some evil people attack a kingdom and wants to conquer earth. Only because they hate love, kindness, hope and all that good feelings. But they wont have it easy: precure will save the day!One thing that I like is the new addition of the show: they put international precure: no matter in which country you are. A group of precure will save the day: India, Japan, Texas,...Spain... Because, why only the evil organization attack one city if they can attack at the same time all world?One thing that they used in the first half of the anime is that: if you collect enought precards you can wish something. In the second part this thing was forgotten. At the end its only a cute thing only to collect and use. Why: the cards are clothes and with magic you can change into the clothes that are on the cards.Art. 7/10Art and animation aren\'t good enough. Past season have better animation and character design. But again, a new addition is now on the series: CGI animation on when the precure attack. Yes, its cheap CGI, but is something. For the 10th anniversay of pretty cure the animation is really lame, with episodes that you can say: ""what... where they lazy or don\'t have enough budget to animate this episode.""About the character design its not bad. Its cute but to be honest to childish and ""sweet"". You can say, ""hey, its a kids show"" yes, but I have seen several animated kids shiw and they have better.Character. 9/10The character is one of the best points of the show. They\'re aren\'t perfect ith a lot of cualities and no defects. megimu is a little dumb about love and she doesn\'t have any dream. Iona hate Hime becouse on her own version he has the fault what happened to her. This 3 characters have bad and good feelings.But I really don\'t like too much Yuuko. She is always kind, likes food and thinks all the time about food and honey candy. She sings good and is the perfect lady: knows what she wants, and help others.Talking about other characters, I also ike Blue, the Earth god. He search for kind girls only to become them precures. He has doubts and secrets. And you know that will be problems when the four protagonist know what really happened.Enjoyment. 8/10In overall, I enjoyed the anime.

You will definetly enjoy it!', 'Update, 9/5/2020: Redid my review.Wait, didn\'t I already review this back on my LiveJournal when it first aired? Yes I did. But after rewatching it and doing some thinking, I decided to lower its rating, because out of all the Pretty Cure seasons I\'ve seen, I feel Happiness Charge is by far the weakest. But before I elaborate, I want to explain something: Some people I\'ve talked to a few years ago have gotten the impression that I hate light hearted magical girl shows and only like stuff that\'s dark and gritty, but I\'d like to clarify that that\'s not true. I like Madoka Magica,...but not because it\'s dark. My favorite magical girl anime of all time is Fancy Lala, and some of my other favorites are the Pretty Sammy TV series, Cardcaptor Sakura, Yuki Yuna is a Hero, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, and Princess Tutu. I watched the first episode of Magical Girl Site and I absolutely hated it because of how over-the-top dark and violent it tried to be, and it was clear it was only doing it for the sake of being as violent as possible and nothing else. I don\'t go anywhere near the Nanoha series because of its more fanservicey elements. The point I\'m trying to make is that I like both happy and serious magical girl shows, but I also like my magical girl anime to have substance. I want magical girl anime, nay anime in general, to be more than just a sugar fest or a grimdark violence fest. Magical Girl Site is obviously the latter, but having watched Happiness Charge Precure in its entirety...I won\'t say it\'s the worst show I\'ve seen, nor even the worst Precure series out there, but to put it plainly, Happiness Charge is trite, uninspired, hollow, and superfluous, encapsulating the overall franchise\'s worst problems.The story is about Hime Shirayuki, a princess of the Blue Sky Kingdom. Her kingdom was attacked by the Phantom Empire, and despite becoming a Pretty Cure, she is utterly hopeless at fighting, and has to go to Earth for her own safety, accompanied by her friend Ribbon. Her rival--Cure Fortune--blames her for everything and Hime is at a loss as to what to do. She does, however, find a new friend in a young girl named Megumi Aino, a happy-go-lucky girl who is obsessed with love and making people happy. Megumi actually winds up becoming a Pretty Cure alongside Hime--Cure Lovely. Together, along with two new allies, the girls try to fight the Phantom Empire\'s minions, the Saiarks, and try to stop them from spreading despair. But there\'s a lot more to the Phantom Empire than meets the eye, and there are many secrets to be revealed.The animation...fluctuates a LOT throughout the series. Some episodes, it\'s good, other episodes...are pretty badly animated, with kooky faces with parts out of place, movement being stilted, the animation style being really cloudy and too cartoony for my tastes (but I got used to it), etc. The budget for the episodes is clearly limited, but when they use it, boy do they use it! Hime\'s transformation is the most well animated and visually pleasing transformation in the entire series, and that\'s saying a lot. But other than that, the show\'s animation is sub-par. The music...I don\'t know what to say about this one. The opening theme is too bubblegummy for me, the ending themes more so. The actual soundtrack...ugh, to be honest, I can\'t tell if the show even has its own pieces at all, because since the show has the same composer as Doki Doki Precure before it, the anime reuses pieces from Doki Doki in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE! Now, if the show was a direct sequel to Doki Doki, I wouldn\'t have a problem if they\'re the same series taking place in the same universe, but HapiCha is an entity completely separate from Doki Doki, so the fact that they reuse music from Doki Doki makes the production team really come off as lazy and uninspired. I get that there are budget issues involved, and other series used music from other series too, but at least Suite made sure to not use Heartcatch and Fresh pieces in EVERY episode.The characters...are arguably a mixed bag. However, before I get to the bad, I really need to talk about what I feel is THE best part of the entire show: Hime. She is by far the best main character in any anime I\'ve seen. She\'s well developed, has plenty of flaws and weaknesses, good qualities and strengths, has the best executed character arc in the show, is proactive despite her royal upbringing and occasionally selfish personality, grows as a character throughout the series awesomely, and has more spotlight on her than the pink character. The show seems to be making her out to be the main character, even though it\'s sort of not the case. And seriously, why can\'t Hime be the main character? Because she\'s easily the best character in the entire show even though she\'s made of traits that people would absolutely hate if done wrong, and Hime\'s character is done so right it\'s not even funny. I\'m glad the writers really pulled out all the stops when it came to Hime. Also, Glasan is awesome.Unfortunately, the same can\'t be said for the other characters. Now don\'t get me wrong, they\'re not bad. They\'re all engagingly flawed...except for Yuuko. I\'ll get to that in a bit. One thing I like about the series is that the characters all come off as annoying at first, but when you least expect it, the writers realize it and completely redeem them for you. I used to hate Iona for being a straight up jerk to Hime for plot reasons, but she dropped the act and realized her own faults as well. The other characters all have engaging flaws...except for one: Yuuko. Sorry, guys. I hate to admit it, as I like her too, but there\'s no denying it: Yuuko is woefully underutilized, and because of this, she comes off as extremely perfect. She\'s unfailingly kind and friendly, loves food and rice to insane levels, doesn\'t make any mistakes, all of her potential flaws are presented as cute character quirks instead of realistic flaws, everything she does is praised by everyone, she\'s always in the right, nobody questions what she does (save for a few, but even they change their views later on), and she\'s loved by everyone. Her character writing is one of the show\'s low points, as a character like Yuuko just isn\'t very interesting, and her focus episodes were all poorly executed, especially the cheesy episode 31, with the fact that the entire episode implied she had a love interest that turned out to be something else entirely. Both her character and that episode could have been handled so much better. But I do appreciate that she contributes no more or less than any of the other characters, that her attacks aren\'t foolproof, and that she\'s still on the same level as the girls, so I can give kudos to the creators for that.The villains are pretty much the same. Mirage and Phantom are the only good villains in the show, whereas the bumbling bad trio are the worst. They\'re never developed, their backstories aren\'t elaborated on, and they\'re very bland, one note characters who don\'t do much throughout the entire show. They were the biggest waste of characters ever. Also, I absolutely hate Hosshiwa. Her voice was annoying, her character was annoying, her personality was annoying, her evil laugh was annoying, God everytime she opened her mouth I just wanted to deck her! Another contender is the final villain. I won\'t spoil anything, but he is the whinest, most annoying, most pathetic villain I\'ve ever seen. He constantly whines and moans about how love is bad every five minutes any time he\'s on screen! He doesn\'t even do anything really threatening, just brainwashing people and being annoying, and he REFUSES TO SHUT UP!!! Seriously, I can write a better villain character than him! And the thing is, the show constantly builds him up as being this really dangerous, threatening force, so when it turns out he\'s little more than a whiny simp, the show basically crapped on all of the build-up it used for him and made it all go to waste.That said, the main heroine of this series, Megumi, is also one of the show\'s biggest detriments, especially compared to other leads in Precure shows. Now, Pretty Cure is notorious for being very clingy to its own formula, rehashing the same character archetypes, color schemes, and personalities all throughout their shows, with only a few changes every now and again. There\'s nothing inherently wrong with that, but using the same character type over and over again gets boring. At times, Toei knows this, and one of the reasons seasons like Heartcatch and the original series are so popular is because they had stories and characters that were different from the typical klutzy, cheerful, always happy archetype. Nagisa was tomboyish and could be a brat. Tsubomi was shy and timid. Hana from Hugtto Precure, behind her cheerful facade, was deeply insecure and felt like she couldn\'t keep up with the other girls as a Precure. Even the current series, Healin Good, has Nodoka, who is nice and kind, but also down to earth and frail because of having been sick for most of her life. People love magical girl shows that take risks and give their characters flaws that they have to overcome in order to grow as people. Those make characters interesting and relatable when done well. Watching those particular seasons, you can tell right away there was more to the characters than just one basic trait. The problem with Megumi is that the creators were less concerned about making her interesting and three-dimensional, and more with making her as over-the-top cutesy and nice and sweet as humanly possible, having her say her catchphrase ""Shiawase Happiness"" every other episode and having her talk non-stop about love and kindness and how being nice is good just for the sake of it. Even during episodes where she\'s supposed to experience real character growth and mature as a person, the writers still insist on having her act extremely childish and nauseatingly idealistic, like they\'re convinced children can\'t handle human characters who don\'t spout cutesy catchphrases all the time. Think Charlie from Tim Burton\'s Willy Wonka movie level of overly idealistic. For example, when she finds out Hime is running away after finding out the truth about why the Phantom Empire attacked, what does she do? She magically puts on a cutesy wootsy dog costume and chases after her. She basically comes off as an overly saccharine five-year-old in a 14-year-old girl\'s body, almost a caricature, and kids don\'t like having over-the-top sweetness and sugar shoved down their throats. And no, the show being a giant toy commercial is no excuse, because there are plenty of toy-based shows that actually put in the effort to write nuanced characters when they want to. My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, and hell, even several of the early Precure shows, are great examples of this. And no, this also doesn\'t mean I hate cheerful, perky, happy characters. I just don\'t like it when writers go way over the top with it and have it be their only character trait, and amping it up to ridiculous levels. My point: Have the cheerful characters act like people, not like hyperactive five year olds who do nothing but spout cutesy catchphrases all the damn time! But I know there are people who like Megumi and the rest of the cast as characters, so if you like them, cool! More power to you. This is just how I feel about the cast as a whole, not me dissing anyone who likes them.Which also brings me to the show\'s biggest flaw. Now, let me say this: when it knows what it wants to do, Happiness Charge is great. But when it doesn\'t, it sinks. Hard. What do I mean? Well, some episodes are written well, while others are very poorly executed, like the writers were battling over what the moral of the episode should be and wind up making an episode that\'s a big mess. Unfortunately, Happiness Charge is pretty guilty of this. Episode 17 is one such example. To me it looked like the moral was going to be about Hime learning that it\'s okay to share your friends with other friends, but Megumi and Yuuko force Hime to support Seiji\'s karate tournament, and at one point Hime says ""Curse you, Seiji!"" for no reason at all, implying that she secretly hated him. I won\'t go into detail about other episodes, as it\'d take waaaay too long. But yeah, it\'s like the show is at a fork in the road and it goes on one road, only to constantly zigzag between that road and the other, and in the end it finally decides on a road, only to still have doubts and regrets and the feeling of not having reached their destination. That\'s how Happiness Charge\'s filler episodes are to me. But different strokes for different blokes, I suppose. Plus, all the romance was really forced, and in a way, it didn\'t really need to be there. My mom often says ""don\'t buy the car if you can\'t drive it."" For this series? Don\'t try to write about something if you\'re going to write it badly...or in this case, indecisively. So lack of focus is Happiness Charge\'s biggest problem. But there are shows that did this far worse, and when the show knows what it wants to do, boy does it shine! I only wish it was this focused during its filler episodes, too.That said, even its main plot suffers from lack of proper planning. For one, Happiness Charge establishes that certain items and plot points are important very early on, the PreCards being one of them...but then completely forgets about them by the show\'s end, never doing anything with them. I hear a lot of the show\'s problems are because it\'s meant to celebrate the franchise\'s 10th anniversary, and because the creators knew fans of the franchise love Heartcatch, they tried emulating it in a variety of ways. But that decision really hurt the show\'s quality, as Happiness Charge\'s lack of focus, tendency to forget important plot points or not mention anything until the last minute, uneven character writing, and shallow storytelling make it utterly unable to stand on its own two feet as a Precure series. Thankfully, the creators seem to have realized this, as the next season, Go Princess Precure, was a vast improvement over HapiCha in every way, even though it also reused Doki Doki\'s music at times. Plus, other magical girl shows, and other shows in general, tackled Happiness Charge\'s premise and did them better. Toei, if you really wanted to celebrate the franchise\'s tenth anniversary, this was NOT the way to do it.I don\'t know if I would call this one the worst season, as I haven\'t seen every Precure season. But having seen a good chunk of them in their entirety, this one included, I really didn\'t enjoy Happiness Charge Precure at all. Not only is it overly saccharine and milquetoast compared to other magical girl shows, hell even compared to other seasons of its mother franchise, it simply tries too hard to be something its not. It\'s definitely not one of the better seasons, and I wouldn\'t recommend wasting time on it in any fashion. It\'s still better than Magical Girl Site, though! but not because it\'s dark. My favorite magical girl anime of all time is Fancy Lala, and some of my other favorites are the Pretty Sammy TV series, Cardcaptor Sakura, Yuki Yuna is a Hero, Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, and Princess Tutu. I watched the first episode of Magical Girl Site and I absolutely hated it because of how over-the-top dark and violent it tried to be, and it was clear it was only doing it for the sake of being as violent as possible and nothing else. I don\'t go anywhere near the Nanoha series because of its more fanservicey elements. The point I\'m trying to make is that I like both happy and serious magical girl shows, but I also like my magical girl anime to have substance. I want magical girl anime, nay anime in general, to be more than just a sugar fest or a grimdark violence fest. Magical Girl Site is obviously the latter, but having watched Happiness Charge Precure in its entirety...I won\'t say it\'s the worst show I\'ve seen, nor even the worst Precure series out there, but to put it plainly, Happiness Charge is trite, uninspired, hollow, and superfluous, encapsulating the overall franchise\'s worst problems.The story is about Hime Shirayuki, a princess of the Blue Sky Kingdom. Her kingdom was attacked by the Phantom Empire, and despite becoming a Pretty Cure, she is utterly hopeless at fighting, and has to go to Earth for her own safety, accompanied by her friend Ribbon. Her rival--Cure Fortune--blames her for everything and Hime is at a loss as to what to do. She does, however, find a new friend in a young girl named Megumi Aino, a happy-go-lucky girl who is obsessed with love and making people happy. Megumi actually winds up becoming a Pretty Cure alongside Hime--Cure Lovely. Together, along with two new allies, the girls try to fight the Phantom Empire\'s minions, the Saiarks, and try to stop them from spreading despair. But there\'s a lot more to the Phantom Empire than meets the eye, and there are many secrets to be revealed.The animation...fluctuates a LOT throughout the series. Some episodes, it\'s good, other episodes...are pretty badly animated, with kooky faces with parts out of place, movement being stilted, the animation style being really cloudy and too cartoony for my tastes (but I got used to it), etc. The budget for the episodes is clearly limited, but when they use it, boy do they use it! Hime\'s transformation is the most well animated and visually pleasing transformation in the entire series, and that\'s saying a lot. But other than that, the show\'s animation is sub-par. The music...I don\'t know what to say about this one. The opening theme is too bubblegummy for me, the ending themes more so. The actual soundtrack...ugh, to be honest, I can\'t tell if the show even has its own pieces at all, because since the show has the same composer as Doki Doki Precure before it, the anime reuses pieces from Doki Doki in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE! Now, if the show was a direct sequel to Doki Doki, I wouldn\'t have a problem if they\'re the same series taking place in the same universe, but HapiCha is an entity completely separate from Doki Doki, so the fact that they reuse music from Doki Doki makes the production team really come off as lazy and uninspired. I get that there are budget issues involved, and other series used music from other series too, but at least Suite made sure to not use Heartcatch and Fresh pieces in EVERY episode.The characters...are arguably a mixed bag. However, before I get to the bad, I really need to talk about what I feel is THE best part of the entire show: Hime. She is by far the best main character in any anime I\'ve seen. She\'s well developed, has plenty of flaws and weaknesses, good qualities and strengths, has the best executed character arc in the show, is proactive despite her royal upbringing and occasionally selfish personality, grows as a character throughout the series awesomely, and has more spotlight on her than the pink character. The show seems to be making her out to be the main character, even though it\'s sort of not the case. And seriously, why can\'t Hime be the main character? Because she\'s easily the best character in the entire show even though she\'s made of traits that people would absolutely hate if done wrong, and Hime\'s character is done so right it\'s not even funny. I\'m glad the writers really pulled out all the stops when it came to Hime. Also, Glasan is awesome.Unfortunately, the same can\'t be said for the other characters. Now don\'t get me wrong, they\'re not bad. They\'re all engagingly flawed...except for Yuuko. I\'ll get to that in a bit. One thing I like about the series is that the characters all come off as annoying at first, but when you least expect it, the writers realize it and completely redeem them for you. I used to hate Iona for being a straight up jerk to Hime for plot reasons, but she dropped the act and realized her own faults as well. The other characters all have engaging flaws...except for one: Yuuko. Sorry, guys. I hate to admit it, as I like her too, but there\'s no denying it: Yuuko is woefully underutilized, and because of this, she comes off as extremely perfect. She\'s unfailingly kind and friendly, loves food and rice to insane levels, doesn\'t make any mistakes, all of her potential flaws are presented as cute character quirks instead of realistic flaws, everything she does is praised by everyone, she\'s always in the right, nobody questions what she does (save for a few, but even they change their views later on), and she\'s loved by everyone. Her character writing is one of the show\'s low points, as a character like Yuuko just isn\'t very interesting, and her focus episodes were all poorly executed, especially the cheesy episode 31, with the fact that the entire episode implied she had a love interest that turned out to be something else entirely. Both her character and that episode could have been handled so much better. But I do appreciate that she contributes no more or less than any of the other characters, that her attacks aren\'t foolproof, and that she\'s still on the same level as the girls, so I can give kudos to the creators for that.The villains are pretty much the same. Mirage and Phantom are the only good villains in the show, whereas the bumbling bad trio are the worst.

It\'s definitely not one of the better seasons, and I wouldn\'t recommend wasting time on it in any fashion. It\'s still better than Magical Girl Site, though!', 'If I could use one word to describe Happiness Charge it would be consistent. It\'s pretty much always a fun and entertaining show at the least, while there are parts that are better and worse than others its highs and lows aren\'t particularly extreme ever. I could always count on each episode to be basely enjoyable when I watched it even if I didn\'t expect much else.The characters are fun enough. They have good chemistry with each other and I Hime in particular is great, she\'s definitely the stand out Cure from this season to me. Something of a problem though is that the show...doesn\'t really balance out what it does with each girl. Yuuko feels like a prop for the first 30 episodes of the show and in the second half Hime is just kind of there. Not every Cure needs to have some sort of important side plot or be directly related to the main story in some way like Hime but there is really nothing going on for Yuuko and Hime at large stretches of time. Not only that but Yuuko\'s character is hardly expanded upon at all in the first half. Not counting Cures we have Seiji, Megumi\'s childhood friend. He\'s a pretty good character in his own right, and he becomes a nice support for the group of girls later on.More than any other season Happiness Charge has a big focus on romance and love. It\'s pretty refreshing seeing this as a theme for Precure after so long. But it\'s not exactly done the best. A lot of it just ends up being characters agonizing over feelings and there not being good resolution on most things. Hime\'s potentially burgeoning crush on Seiji is wrapped up in the most disappointing and anti-climactic way possible, and in the worst case a possible love interest for Iona comes out of nowhere to enable a power-up and disappears just as quickly. For a show where love is such a big deal it really drops the ball in a lot of places.In general the show is very quick to finish one thing and then move on to the next. Mostly in the second half. It will do something interesting and shocking for one episode and then it\'s done, time to do something else. The ""Unlovely"" event, which could\'ve been expanded on so much more, and the resolution of Cure Tender are treated this way and it\'s a bit anti-climactic once again.  The show does have a bit of a bad habit of bringing up supposedly important things and then just forgetting about them or seemingly thinking that they never need to bring them up again.For a season where there are many different teams of Cures fighting around the world this wasn\'t really utilized much, they travel once and that\'s it. It\'s just kind of a shame they didn\'t really get to know that many other Cures well.And then there\'s the CGI stock footage transformations. It\'s probably the most unique thing about HapCha compared to other Precure seasons. The girls each get some form changes and when they use them we get CGI stock footage exactly like the ending songs. They\'re very disappointing. The attacks themselves are basically pointless in the first place, very rarely do they even have an affect on anything other than the small monsters the Cures will be fighting. It basically just amounts to a weird cut-scene, ""Oh. That happened."",  and then they get phased out as the show goes on and we never see them again, it\'s basically just a waste of an idea. This only applies to the form changes used for battle though. The regular civilian changes are good, the girls get a wide variety of different outfits like ninja gear. It\'s one of the better realized parts of the show as they\'re always transforming into something cute.The action in the show is overall the best we\'ve had in Precure since Heartcatch. There\'s a lot of energy and excitement in the fights and the Cures are always inventing random attacks and throwing energy blasts and stuff that make the fights more fun. There\'s not really a ton of exceptionally well animated fights though but the show makes up for it I feel.The animation isn\'t the best to be sure but the characters are very expressive and I feel the style and atmosphere of the show balance this out. I never found myself caring much about the general animation outside of fight scenes because  Hime\'s exaggerated motions and such kept me entertained.The villains are quite varied. The minion trio, like we\'ve had every season since Fresh, is not particularly good. They have their fun scenes and are kind of basely entertaining but there\'s nothing else to them. They just kind of get worn out after a while. It doesn\'t feel like they have much of a rivalry with the Cures or anything and they aren\'t given backstories or any real development until much later than necessary. This makes the inevitable final fights with them just feel hollow.Phantom is a better villain but still bland for most of his run. He later gets some development and what we learn about him makes him quite interesting but he\'s still not particularly compelling or fun to watch as a villain. Mirage is also pretty good and interesting herself but she just doesn\'t do much. The fight with her is indeed quite great though.Deep Mirror is easily the best villain of the show. He also ends up as just being one of the most thought out, complex, and well realized villains of the franchise.The finale is good definitely. Relatively well built up, intense, awesome, good villains to deal with, shocking reveals, it pretty much has all you could want. However. Megumi is the only Cure to be even remotely relevant to anything going on in the last part of the show. She does everything important basically. I don\'t know if I should be angrier at Doki for starting this terrible trend or HapCha for blindly following it. At least HapCha doesn\'t go out of its way to make things revolve around Megumi when they shouldn\'t though. She just... happens to be the only important one at the end. It\'s honestly kind of annoying.The show uses a victim of the week format at a very loose level, we don\'t really get to know the people made into Terribads for the most part and they don\'t have to be sad or having a problem of their own like in other seasons. It\'s just a quick way to create a victim and a monster for the show and it\'s kind of nice truthfully, it at least means they never half ass the victim of the weeks story and they can still have important people made into monsters.The normal non-cgi stock footage in the show is pretty good. All the transformations are good, Lovely and Princesse\'s duo attack is awesome, and the final group attack... well it\'s certainly unique I can tell you that much.With all this being said the last thing about HapCha I can say is that there\'s just a feeling of staleness to it. Watching it I can\'t shake that it just all comes off as kind of bland to me. Probably having to do with Megumi\'s character, as fun as she can be, being really typical herself. But it\'s other things too that I can\'t quite describe, just a feeling the show gives off. But perhaps this is only because it\'s been ten years of Precure.I would never rate Happiness Charge as one of the best or worst seasons of Precure. It\'s fine. That\'s it. It never evoked feelings of love or hate. But I could watch it and enjoy it again one day. doesn\'t really balance out what it does with each girl. Yuuko feels like a prop for the first 30 episodes of the show and in the second half Hime is just kind of there. Not every Cure needs to have some sort of important side plot or be directly related to the main story in some way like Hime but there is really nothing going on for Yuuko and Hime at large stretches of time.

The minion trio, like we\'ve had every season since Fresh, is not particularly good. They have their fun scenes and are kind of basely entertaining but there\'s nothing else to them. They just kind of get worn out after a while. It doesn\'t feel like they have much of a rivalry with the Cures or anything and they aren\'t given backstories or any real development until much later than necessary. This makes the inevitable final fights with them just feel hollow.Phantom is a better villain but still bland for most of his run. He later gets some development and what we learn about him makes him quite interesting but he\'s still not particularly compelling or fun to watch as a villain. Mirage is also pretty good and interesting herself but she just doesn\'t do much. The fight with her is indeed quite great though.Deep Mirror is easily the best villain of the show. He also ends up as just being one of the most thought out, complex, and well realized villains of the franchise.The finale is good definitely. Relatively well built up, intense, awesome, good villains to deal with, shocking reveals, it pretty much has all you could want. However. Megumi is the only Cure to be even remotely relevant to anything going on in the last part of the show. She does everything important basically. I don\'t know if I should be angrier at Doki for starting this terrible trend or HapCha for blindly following it. At least HapCha doesn\'t go out of its way to make things revolve around Megumi when they shouldn\'t though. She just... happens to be the only important one at the end. It\'s honestly kind of annoying.The show uses a victim of the week format at a very loose level, we don\'t really get to know the people made into Terribads for the most part and they don\'t have to be sad or having a problem of their own like in other seasons. It\'s just a quick way to create a victim and a monster for the show and it\'s kind of nice truthfully, it at least means they never half ass the victim of the weeks story and they can still have important people made into monsters.The normal non-cgi stock footage in the show is pretty good. All the transformations are good, Lovely and Princesse\'s duo attack is awesome, and the final group attack... well it\'s certainly unique I can tell you that much.With all this being said the last thing about HapCha I can say is that there\'s just a feeling of staleness to it. Watching it I can\'t shake that it just all comes off as kind of bland to me. Probably having to do with Megumi\'s character, as fun as she can be, being really typical herself. But it\'s other things too that I can\'t quite describe, just a feeling the show gives off. But perhaps this is only because it\'s been ten years of Precure.I would never rate Happiness Charge as one of the best or worst seasons of Precure. It\'s fine. That\'s it. It never evoked feelings of love or hate. But I could watch it and enjoy it again one day.', 'If you like the original pretty cure, your bound to love this one. Like the original, it takes a fair time of their lives and the fight.This pretty cure is perfect on keeping the characters in the ""right spot""(by that I mean they never act differently than you\'d expect someone to be. Example: An evil queen giving money to the poor for no apparent reason).I liked how they made part of it in 3-D(I would say specifically what part, but I think that\'d be a spoiler). I also like how it ties all the pretty cures together(again, spoiler). Every single detail makes sense....Whenever there\'s an argument between the characters, it explains why they\'re mad at eachother. Whenever there\'s an argument between the characters, it explains why they\'re mad at eachother.', ""All I'm going to say that this season isn't the best, but not the worst. I think it's meant to take references from the past Precure shows like power-up cards, turning people into monsters to celebrate its 10th anniversary. I enjoy some minutes of it. The characters are passable as far as stories go.The story is more sugar than the previous shows but have some humor, and plot and character development is done well.The characters are OK. Megumi just barely knows what she's doing when she talks about love, even when she fills in as a leader. I don't hate her. Maybe it's because leaders...in the Precure series are intentionally meant to steal the spotlight. Hime is a the best developed character than the Cures in the show. It must have took her 23 episodes for her to get over her mistake of opening Axia. Iona is awesome too, but I find her just pretty harsh towards Hime, even if Hime is partially responsible for what she done. It's really low when she made Hime cry that you'll might hate Cure Fortune. At least that changed when Iona finds out that Hime was tricked into letting evil loose in the world, making Iona feel more ashamed as Hime, which is getting even. Yuko talks nothing about food but not in a same way as Osshiwa.The animation is done well, even some of the CGI in the EDs and attacks. And those self copies that appear inside Hime's and Megumi's mouth is unique as Siren from Suite Precure, like they're screaming on the top of their lungs.Overall, I called this as a promising season of the Precure series that I know you'll like it. If you're a fan of Magical Girl animes that you don't care which of them is you're favorite, you're going to love this. 7.3/10 in the Precure series are intentionally meant to steal the spotlight.

Despite it being the first Precure series that I watched, it is one of the weakest that I’ve seen in terms of narrative and visuals. The only character that was more than a one-dimensional archetype was Hime, who had to evolve from being a spoiled princess and accepts the guilt of disappointing members of her kingdom. It’s a kid’s show, so it didn’t dive much more into that; that and the series’ primary focus is on love, crushes, and advertising new toys.•\tThere are obnoxious, card-based transformations that revolve around dancing, so there might...be an Aloha transformation when one of them is a hula dancer, or a ballet card, etc. In general, I don’t like it when cartoons incorporate a card-based system to a series like Precure, that doesn’t need cards, because it’s just an excuse to sell more things! To the creators: If you make a good enough series, with memorable designs, people will want to buy the trading cards! Having the characters use a transformation device that requires card input is an obvious marketing ploy! I felt that there were so many toys advertised in this series that it distracted from the actual plot!•\tI know the Precure franchise didn’t become an enterprise without shilling and selling tons of toys, but when you make an entire series―Shill: The Animated Series, it’s going too far. It’s like the series didn’t want to pay for television advertisements, so they put them in the series as a means of subliminal messaging. It’s best to go the simplistic route, like the series that aired the following year, Go! Princess Precure, that just has a CG castle that the characters turn a lever on―that’s obviously supposed to be a marketable toy, or the weird Heartcatch Precure spinning wand where they scream to invoke its magical powers and because of the campiness, the scene blended so well with Heartcatch’s obscure, otaku atmosphere.•\tFor those who were fans of Heartcatch’s character designs, this series copies that and creates something with a similar art style, but far less quality. From beginning to end, this series is almost filled entirely with stock CG scenes and product placement. It wasn’t so bad at the beginning, but I can barely remember the plot towards the middle of the series because it was so much of a commercial!•\tThere’s an addition of “international Precure(s),” so I guess even if you’re a child living in the United States, you can still be a Precure? This Precure series commemorated Precure’s 10th anniversary, so if any of you are hardcore Precure fanatics, there are small vignettes before every episode with each of the old Precure(s) introducing themselves and sometimes saying something quirky, like Erika from Heartcatch. If you don’t want to watch Happiness Charge to see these anniversary specials, there’s a compilation of them online!•\tIn a nutshell, the characters in the show, other than Hime can be described as this: Megumi (main girl, tomboy), Yuuko (sweet girl who literally likes making sweets), and Iona (girl looking for revenge, rival with a soft side). If you haven’t seen all of those worn archetypes a million other times in anime, then perhaps, you will enjoy this series more than I did.•\tOverall, some of the animation looked good, but the budget was noticeably frugal. If you want to see good animation in a Precure series, watch Go! Princess Precure or Heartcatch Precure. The romance arc between Megumi and Seiji is the only thing that the series really cares about in the end, though implied Hime and Iona is very close to being a canonical pairing. I thought Queen Mirage was a cool villain who was overshadowed by Phantom; her gothic aesthetic and powers reminded me of Queen Nehellenia from Sailor Moon SuperS, who I thought was one of the best Sailor Moon villains. This series isn’t really worth watching as a whole, there’s far too much filler.

Having said that, this was the most difficult Precure season to watch. I'll do my best to explain why without spoiling things.Visuals: inconsistent and sloppySound:1) legendary seiyuus were cast, along some with very little experience. Usually in Precure this is just a fun fact as everyone delivers their lines quite accurately. However and in this particular season, not every seiyuu can do the range that some scenes demanded2) the soundtrack is bad imoStory and characters:1) unlike previous seasons, none of the main characters are captivating enough. It's the same characters, different visuals...everytime but this time, I just couldn't care less about either of them2) the trope where 14 year old kids fall in love with adults is plain disgusting and it needs to die asap3) Masuko Mika's past with Precure was changed to accomodate the new Precures, which is plain stupid4) each episode is as generic and repetitive as can be. It's like, there's no real effort to bring something new and memorable to each Precure season but this one has been far the worst because it feels that each episode is the same as the previous oneUnfortunately, it's a 3/10 for me everytime but this time, I just couldn't care less about either of them2) the trope where 14 year old kids fall in love with adults is plain disgusting and it needs to die asap3) Masuko Mika's past with Precure was changed to accomodate the new Precures, which is plain stupid4) each episode is as generic and repetitive as can be.

Heroman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4334/Heroman,"['Over the years there have been several attempts at merging Eastern manga and anime with Western comics and cartoons. Batman had two manga outings (Child of Dreams and Death Mask), while the X-Men saw their manga counterparts run straight into a wall. Spiderman and The Hulk made appearances as early as 1970, and many people already know about the promised anime adaptations of several well known titles (Wolverine, X-Men, Iron Man, etc).The problem is that all of the attempts thus far have not been as successful as one might hope or expect. One of the reasons for this is because the titles that have been...adapted to date are already well known, and each has a wealth of existing storyline that makes reinvention more difficult (which some may find odd, but have a think about and you\'ll understand why).It\'s strangely ironic that it has once more fallen to Stan Lee to light the way forward.Originally a manga written by Stan Lee himself and drawn by Ota Tamon, Heroman tells the story of Joey Jones (a true Stan Lee name), an orphan living with his grandmother in Centre City. He spends his days attending school and working part time at a cafe (where Stan is also a regular customer), but all the while he wishes more than anything to be a hero.In all honesty I wasn\'t sure what to expect from Heroman. The name itself is very typically Stan Lee in its simplicity, but one would expect a tad more complexity from the story itself. The plot is very, very straight forward and in true Stan Lee fashion, the story can at times be very ""preachy"". That said, the simplicity of the tale is rather appealing as there aren\'t any of the hang ups typically associated with East-West crossovers.The main reason for this is because Stan Lee decided against using pre-existing material and started from scratch on a totally new idea. He wanted to create ""a hero for the 21st century"", and in a certain sense he managed to achieve part of that goal. The only problem is that while Heroman may be a different take on traditional heroes for the Western world, the whole idea itself is a throwback where Eastern media is concerned.An orphan and a giant robot are nothing new in anime and manga. Giant Robo: The Day The Earth Stood Still showed just how good the format could be given the right setting, story and characters, and that\'s just the tip of the iceberg. Other shows like Tetsujin 28, Gad Guard, Top wo Nerae and even Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann all play around with the concept to a degree. Anime and mange are rife with tales of humans and their super robot counterparts, so it may seem a bit strange that Stan Lee would use the idea to herald a new age of crossovers.Thankfully Stan is a very clever man (I\'ll explain this in a bit).Bones have produced a very good looking show for the most part. The animation is very crisp and fluid, and the numerous actions scenes are choreographed very well. The characters follow Ota\'s original designs for the most part, and are reflective of the shows Western heritage, although one does have to wonder about the patterning on Heroman as it seems a bit too US-centric.One thing that bears mentioning is the palette used throughout the series. Bright, bold colours abound which, together with the distinctly Western characters, give Heroman an air more akin to traditional Western comic book adaptations (the original X-Men cartoon for example).Unfortunately, while the visuals may be very good, the same can\'t be said of the acting. Komatsu Mikako and Kimura Ryohei play the roles of Joey Jones and Simon Kaina fairly well, but the series has one inherent problem when it comes to acting. The whole show is geared towards a Western mentality, a factor which will inevitably cause problems for any seiyuu unfamiliar with the mindset. Because of this there are occasions where the acting in just doesn\'t seem to mesh well with the on screen action, and there are several occasions where the actors  either ham it up too much or become completely wooden.That said, the series will probably receive an English dub at some point, but whether that is better or not remains to be seen.A big plus for Heroman is the quality of the sound effects, almost all of which are crisp, clear, and very well choreographed. The series is littered with great noises, whooshes and explosions, all of which would become a veritable cacophony if they were mixed with music, so it\'s a good thing the majority of the show is relatively unencumbered in that department. The background music is often subtle and varied, and the tracks are used in a very intelligent manner.Like many other anime out there, Heroman makes use of two opening and ending themes to highlight the midway point of the series. The first twelve episodes feature ""Roullette"" by Tetsuya (of L\'Arc-en-Ciel fame) as the OP, and ""Calling"" by Flow as the ED. Both are upbeat, but very typical, J-rock tracks that work quite well with the theme of the series.The OP and ED for the second half of the series, ""Missing"" by Kylee and ""Boku no Te wa Kimi no Tame ni"" (My Hands For You), by Mass Alert, are far less upbeat than the first two tracks. ""Missing"" is more of an emotional rock track, with all that entails, while ""Boku no Te wa Kimi no Tame ni"" has a slight feeling of angst. Strangely though, both tracks are equally well suited to the series, especially given that events become more serious later on.As for the characters themselves, well, anyone who has read a Stan Lee comic will find many things that are familiar, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that they\'re good. Joey develops fairly well over the course of the series, but the main problem is that he is the only character who receives any substantial growth. What is surprising is the lack of attention given to Simon, Lina, Professor Denton, and even William. It would have been nice to have more insight into their respective characters over the course of the show, and while there are some efforts made in that direction, these seem more like afterthoughts than anything else.My main gripe with Heroman is that William Davis, Lina\'s older brother and the guy who keeps tormenting Joey, doesn\'t get anywhere near the attention he deserves. Yes, he starts off as a bully, but his transformation is just as profound as Joey\'s, and it would have been nice to see how his character copes with the change.Now while it\'s pretty obvious that the series possesses a number of issues, that doesn\'t mean I didn\'t enjoy it. The truth is that even with all its flaws, Heroman is a rather entertaining series, especially as it\'s a throwback to the super robot shows of bygone days. Yes it has more cheese than Switzerland (and the plot has about as many holes), but the story is well put together and the whole thing looks good. Granted there are problems with the acting but they\'re mainly from cultural differences rather than a lack of talent.Which brings me back to the reason why Stan Lee is a clever man. When one considers Heroman from a manga and anime perspective, it clearly falls short of the mark set by many other super robot tales. Likewise, when consider from the perspective of Western cartoons and comics the series is nowhere near the level of Stan Lee\'s more popular franchises.Where people get it wrong is in assuming that Heroman is an attempt to cross the East-West divide. It isn\'t, and the proof of that is in the fact that we have a traditionally Japanese super robot show created by an American and set in the US. Heroman isn\'t an attempt to cross the divide, no, it\'s an attempt to bridge it. By choosing this type of show, Stan Lee is sending a message to both DC and Marvel that if they want to crack the Eastern markets then they need stop trying to re-invent existing heroes, and should instead focus on creating new content using existing manga and anime as inspiration.Heroman may not be as good as some of the older super robot shows, but what it heralds may be a new dawn for anime and manga, especially if Marvel and DC get the message. adapted to date are already well known, and each has a wealth of existing storyline that makes reinvention more difficult (which some may find odd, but have a think about and you\'ll understand why).It\'s strangely ironic that it has once more fallen to Stan Lee to light the way forward.Originally a manga written by Stan Lee himself and drawn by Ota Tamon, Heroman tells the story of Joey Jones (a true Stan Lee name), an orphan living with his grandmother in Centre City.

By choosing this type of show, Stan Lee is sending a message to both DC and Marvel that if they want to crack the Eastern markets then they need stop trying to re-invent existing heroes, and should instead focus on creating new content using existing manga and anime as inspiration.Heroman may not be as good as some of the older super robot shows, but what it heralds may be a new dawn for anime and manga, especially if Marvel and DC get the message.', 'Okay guys, let\'s talk about HEROMAN, the current front runner for anime of the goddamned decade.So one day Stan Lee got up and said ""I bet I can put those crazy Japanese to work!""And so he did.The result is HEROMAN, a throwback to old comic books, Saturday morning cartoons, teenage superhero shows and the 90\'s in general with glorious HD Bones animation. This shit is so nostalgic that when the overly elaborate commercial bumpers showed up I literally heard ""Heroman will be right back after these messages!"". This series is also most likely the most American(superior) anime ever produced. Taking place in CENTER CITY, CALIFORNIA,...all the architecture, cars, people and etc are distinctly American. Like 30 seconds into the episode you see a traffic pile up, a Hummer, an oil refinery, several American flags, a garbage truck, a black person, a yellow school bus, Stan Lee having coffee, a most likely crime-ridden suburban neighborhood, a cheerleader, Flash Thompson and capitalistic toy commercials. I shed _tears_ when I saw that fucking school bus.But yeah, basically it\'s about this kid who\'s suspiciously similar to Peter Parker. He gets picked on by jocks. One day he fixes up an action figure, the action figure gets struck by lightning and BAM, there\'s a giant, scowling Captain America knockoff looking at him like ""the hell do you want, kid?"". Then they go save the day after the kid punches his giant wristwatch. This giant guy is the titular HEROMAN, and he basically has one setting: Punch the shit out of stuff. Perfectly fitting for the most American mecha since Megas XLR.Animation\'s obviously great.Music\'s great.The ED for this series is one of the best ever, because I know Stan Lee probably directed it. The whole thing is like a moving American comic book and you see Heroman playing baseball and the drums. It\'s just awesome as hell.Then we come to the one flaw, most likely put in there on purpose by bones to get back at Stan Lee for making them do this. The main character, Joey Jones, is probably the girliest male lead in any robot show ever. Noriko and Nono were infinitely more masculine than this kid. Don\'t know who those people are? Get the hell outta here and watch Gunbuster and Gunbuster 2, and in the mean time cry that you haven\'t already. But yeah, Joey is a woman. He has a girl\'s voice, he dresses like a girl, his body structure is like a girl and all of his mannerisms and movements are those of a girl. It\'s almost creepy to know that this kid is a male. I bet there\'s a collective terabyte of yaoi featuring him already, and that\'s just awful.But that\'s only on the outside.  As of two episodes in, Joey is a competent and almost hotblooded hero. No fear, no whining. Hell, the kid runs at the giant cockroach aliens right aside Heroman like a badass.Oh and his best friend is a cross between Tai Kamiya and Joseph Gribble. That\'s cool.Verdict: Get to watching. And also start watching Night Raid, House of Five Leaves and RAINBOW too. all the architecture, cars, people and etc are distinctly American.

I was utterly disappointed.The characters do NOT react at all realistic....""Oh look! There\'s Joey, this girly teenager, fighting aliens with this weird ass robot! You\'re such a hero, Joey!""It just seemed half assed that the characters would just accept a random alien-fighting robot come out of nowhere. And the stereotypical bully\'s first thought is, ""You better not become a hero! I will become a hero yada yada yada"".Why doesn\'t any one show actual surprise at a mother****ing robot coming out of nowhere?And, how DID that kind of thing come out of lightning hitting some toy? Seriously...Oh, and the characters are so stereotypical. Girly teen protagonist who gets used to having a giant robot at his control and shouts corny catchphrases like \'HEROMAN! ENGAGE!\' and the dude with crazy big hair who just goes along with the protagonist. The girl who likes the protagonist. The guy who dislikes the protagonist. This is not how a good anime should be.Overall, this anime has just been overhyped to seem good when all it is, is just some stereotypical half assed piece of work. ""Oh look!

I'm not talking about the actual content since I always write these opening paragraphs before watching the series or film. No, I'm referring to the fact that it was written by Smiling Stan Lee. Yes, the same one who was President and CEO of the United States' Marvel Comics back before they lost their damn minds and made a lot of insanely stupid decisions like Jubilee becoming a vampire, Nightcrawler becoming half demon, Polaris being retconned as Magneto's daughter, Speedball becoming Penance and if I keep listing these we'll be here for tens of thousands of words. Anyway, Stan Lee...wrote the original manga with illustrations by Ohta Tamon. It picked up an anime adaptation not even a year after the manga started getting released from Bones. The same studio behind Soul Eater, Fullmetal Alchemist and Wolf's Rain. So, have Stan Lee's skills at writing goofy and highly entertaining silver age style stories held up and if so how well do they transition to anime format? Face front, True Believers, let's look at Heroman and find out.Story:Young Joseph Jones is a poor teenager living on the west coast. One day he takes a broken toy robot from the garbage and decides to fix it. But fate has its own plans for young Joey. After a lightning bolt strikes the robot it grows to a massive size, transforming into the titular titan Heroman. Joey finds that he can control the behemoth after helping avert a highway disaster. The two face their great challenge when evil aliens called the Skrugg follow a radio signal to Earth with the intent of destroying the planet. Zounds, how will our heroes handle this situation?The story itself is kind of lacking. The skrugg are evil for the evils and don't really have even slightly developed motivations. There's also a lot about the plot that doesn't make much sense not the least of which is bolts of lightning being magic. Heroman gains new abilities as needed by the plot which can come across as overly convenient. The story is also kind of predictable since it does follow a silver age aesthetic. However, the story is fun and a lot of the goofier elements do work in the context of a silly superhero story and those elements that are pretty predictable are vague enough that you can still enjoy watching it. It just doesn't have much tension since it's less a matter of “will they get through the situation” and more a matter of “how will they do it”. Part of what makes the goofier elements work is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and it does have several very funny moments to show for it.Characters:The series has characters who largely follow tropes. Including the scientist who does all the scientific stuff instead of having a particular field of study. They aren't bad characters by any means and most of the main cast does get some good character moments. They just don't extend very far from their tropal traits, which kind of works for the series. Heroman himself is a really good example since he's largely defined by... well, being heroic. He can't speak, or chooses not to, and rarely does anything besides fight for justice. It works in context since Joey has to initiate his transformation from a toy to a giant and he's a robot. I also appreciate the fact that regular humans largely don't respond to Heroman with hatred and mistrust, which is a bit of a departure from most of Stan Lee's creations.Art:The artwork is pretty good. Not the best I've seen from Bones but still well done. It features really good action sequences, some interesting alien designs and background Stan Lee because that guy's been appearing in his own work and in things based on his work since... he and Jack Kirby showed up in Uncanny X-men 98, I think. The character designs aren't bad, although Spike Spiegel would consider Psy's hair going too far and Lina almost always wears her cheerleading uniform for no good reason. In all fairness, Psy, Joey, Holly and Professor Denton rarely change clothes either, but she's the worst offender just because her regular outfit is a uniform that's supposed to be worn for practices and actual athletic events. Not as a regular thing.Sound:The performances are pretty good. Particularly coming from Komatsu Mikako, Kimura Ryouhei, Obata Mayu & Yasumura Makoto. The music is also well done, overall. It goes well with the aesthetic.Ho-yay:There really isn't any. The ho-yay factor is a 1/10.Final Thoughts:Heroman is a goofy series with under-developed characters and a story that doesn't make a lot of sense in several ways. And I kind of love it. In an age where most super hero comics have gone a darker and stupider route, a series like Heroman that returns to a more fun, exciting, and light-hearted sensibility is very much a welcome change. It blends anime norms with silver age super hero norms and the result is just a very enjoyable experience. It's not deep, but it is unquestioningly and unabashedly fun. Check it out if you're a fan of more light-hearted super hero works or if you just like silly action works. My final rating is going to be an 8/10. Excelsior!

The heroes are very heroic, the villains are very evil, and we never question for a moment which side is in the right. The robots are awesome, the monsters are creepy, and the action is a blast to watch. Ordinary teenagers have ordinary teenage problems, nosy adults worry about their kids, and life gets a...hundred times more complicated when you have to balance out superhero work. They just don\'t make shows like this anymore, which is a shame. I have nothing against complex or innovative storylines, but I hope people never lose their appreciation for simpler pleasures like this.Heroman was made by Bones, which means it has some of the best animation on the market. The visuals are fluid and detailed, and also incredibly stylish, with lots of bright (but never garish) colors, expressive faces, and some increasingly cool and imaginative battles. It\'s also nice to see how much effort went into the design work; it\'s true that a lot of the character designs and outfits fall into basic stereotypes, but they\'re at least American stereotypes instead of Japanese stereotypes of Americans. Some of the characters do suffer from anime hair, though. Everything else, from the layout of Joey\'s hometown to the cars, cafes and even the houses are unmistakably American-looking. We probably have Stan Lee to thank for that authenticity, and it\'s part of the reason a lot of people, myself included, say the show would do well on American television. This is one of the best-looking kid shows I\'ve ever seen.The music score consists primarily of loud electric rock. It\'s intense, fun to listen to, vaguely reminiscent of Soul Eater\'s score and just as effective in setting the mood for all the series\' fun action scenes. The show brings out some softer pieces here and there as needed, but the battle music is what you\'re going to remember.I just have one language track to judge this time. As always, I have a hard time judging the voice acting in a language I don\'t speak, but to my non-fluent ears it sounds like a perfectly comic-booky archetypal cast, which is exactly what the show needs. There\'s not a lot of subtlety, this isn\'t a very nuanced show, but the characters that are meant to be over-the-top sound deliciously so. They shout with passion, laugh heartily and even carry the show through its tender moments. Heroman\'s voice, comprised solely of groans and grunts, is uncredited and possibly synthesized, but man does he sound like a big badass robot. Joey is the only male character voiced by a woman, but he\'s supposed to be a very wide-eyed and boyish character (he even looks androgynous), and Mikaku Komatsu gets this side of him across fine, so I\'m okay with this.As far as teenage superheroes go, Joey Jones is cut from the same cloth as Peter Parker. He\'s not particularly popular, but he still has good friends he can count on. He\'s not particularly intelligent but he does have a clever streak. He\'s at that age between childhood and adulthood, where he has concerns like whether his love is reciprocated but still retains a boyish heart. It\'s a decades-old character archetype, but if executed well it can still make for a likable lead, and that\'s just what Joey is. His friends and relatives all fall into the simple and likable category as well, they can all more or less be summed up in two or three sentences, but when push comes to shove you still find yourself rooting for them. All of them, that is, with the exception of Joey\'s best friend Psy, who is implied to have once been one of ""the cool kids"" and possibly a bully himself before a leg injury got him removed from the football team. It\'s not terribly important to the story, but a little extra effort is always welcome in my book. Joey\'s brash but caring sister Holly, zany mad scientist Professor Denton and mutual crush Lina have their moments to shine as well, creating an all-around lovable core cast.As per the title, though, the real star of the show is Heroman himself. This series is a no-holds action spectacle, plain and simple, to dwell on anything else for too long would be completely missing the point. The Skrugg are definitely a viable threat, aptly modeled after cockroaches with strength and weapons humans can\'t match. They just want to take over the world and kill everyone, and all the other villains have very simple comic book-y motivations for what they do. And you know what? I wouldn\'t have it any other way. It is immensely satisfying to see Heroman beating up the arthropod invaders, discovering more powers he can add to his arsenal, all the while showing off his flashy all-American paint job. Occasional use of stock footage notwithstanding (and the stock footage is actually pretty awesome) the crisply animated fight scenes only get more imaginative as Heroman gains new powers and new enemies.After a little while Joey even gets some powers of his own, thanks to his gauntlet, and actually, I\'d say giving him the chance to fight alongside his giant robot was probably the show\'s biggest stroke of genius. It adds that touch of human involvement to the fights that we just couldn\'t get from the silent, stoic Heroman, who only occasionally shows signs of sentience. By giving Joey a more direct involvement in the fights, which only increases as the story progresses, we\'re given a good look at Joey\'s personal growth, and that\'s handled quite well. The best part is, it never gets too dark or violent or complicated for children to watch and enjoy right along with you.Compelling as it is, Heroman has as many problems as any awkward boy in high school. The show is pretty well-written on a whole, but the pacing isn\'t always up to scratch. I mentioned earlier that this isn\'t a character-driven show, and while they\'re all very likable, their development is nothing we haven\'t seen before. Make no mistake, the show\'s character drama works really well when it\'s used sparingly; it\'s cheesy and often melodramatic, but that\'s the point. During the lulls between battles when the characters have to carry entire episodes on their own, though... well, it\'s still pleasant to watch, but it\'s definitely not the show playing to its greatest strength. Meanwhile, we only get brief snatches of development from Psy, the character that does seem to have some hidden depths.The series\' low point comes in the middle, when Joey finds himself on the run from a government agency and has to hide out in the woods without making too much of a scene. Yeah, the whole ""fugitive evading the authorities"" story gets old really quickly. You can always be sure the show has something more waiting just around the corner, though, and when it\'s all cylinders firing, it\'s an absolute delight. The series concludes with a grand-scale finale that offers a satisfying resolution while still leaving enough openings for a possible second season. Most importantly, even if the characters aren\'t complex enough to carry the show all on their own, you still find yourself rooting for them all the way through. That\'s all I ask of an action show: caring about the characters enough to want to see them make it out alright.That\'s the heart of what makes this show work, actually. Action and cool-factor are nice, but if there\'s no emotional investment, what\'s the point? That might not sound like much, but it\'s something I see people forgetting far too often. It\'s such a simple story that while writing this review, I initially found myself grasping at straws to find something, anything to say about it that isn\'t already obvious. But then I realized that being able to sum this show up in not so many words isn\'t a bad thing. It\'s a typical story we\'ve seen dozens of times before, doubly so if you grew up reading American comic books, but it feels so sincere and passionate that it\'s hard not to cheer for it all the way through. It doesn\'t have to try too hard to be groundbreaking, all that matters is whether it makes the audience want to keep watching. Bring on the aliens, the mad scientists, the mutant plants, the rogue machines and scary weapons, the cool powers and wacky inventions! It\'s a lot of fun, dammit! That\'s all I have to say about Heroman at the end of the day, and it\'s all anyone ever should have to say about it.

The influence from Gigantor is tragically obvious, mixed with some Marvel shenaningans, and you've got something which is close to unbearable.Story - 3:It can be described in one word; yawn.Evil cliché aliens from what could be the C roster of Marvel, invade earth and start fucking up shit because they want to drain the earth of it's natural resources (of course), and...it's up to our unlikable hero and his uncharismatic robot to save the day, which they of course do with record speed, leaving the viewer with an even more uninteresting sub-plot, which instead becomes the main plot.Art - 7:This is where the show shines, Bones rarely disappoints, and such is the case here as well. The animations are fluid, the ether sparks and the fighting scenes, albeit completely uninspired, are visually appealing.Sound - 5No real complaints here either, the effects are fitting for the scenes.The voice actors, aren't terrible with the exception of the main character, who manages to sound even more effeminate than the female lead. When I first heard him, I though it was a joke to be honest. I knew he was a boy, but his voice was absolutely ridiculous. Add him screaming HEROMAN at least five times during every episode, and you've got the recipe for something that will annoy most viewers to no end.Character - 1:Ah yes, and thus, we reach the core of the problem; a cast of the most unappealing characters ever produced. Can you spell cliché?The hero is a young, effeminate boy obsessed with doing the right thing and upholding morals, the typical shonen lead in other words, but without any charm or personality.We also have the cool and tough best friend character, the bossy/bitchy girlfriend who desperately wants to be tsundere except the writer doesn't understand the tsundere character, the good, scattered-brain mad scientist as well as the evil, elitist mad scientist and the obnoxious bad-guy-jock who isn't really evil and his truly evil as well as fat sidekick.Because you know, fat and rich equals evil.The characters is a complete abortion, and make the show close to unwatchable.Enjoyment - 4:Even though the story is boring and the characters are horrible, the show manages to be somewhat entertaining, much thanks to the visual eye-candy present. It's the kind of show where you can turn off your brain and enjoy the action present. If I was five years old, retarded and this was on during Saturday mornings, I would watch the shit out of it. Sadly, if you're not five year old, retarded and watching this on Cartoon Network a saturday morning, there isn't much for you.Overall - 4:This show isn't good, at all.I don't think anybody with half a brain could enjoy this any other way than ironically. The animation saves this from a lower grade, still it gets a 4, because it's [b]bad[/b] no matter how you try to twist it around, since there is no substance; the action, story and characters suck.Watch this as an example of what happens when somebody who watched a few episodes of Gigantor back in the 60s decides to write a script for an anime  that could fit into the Marvel/DC comics universe, as one of it's most generic and uninspired titles. it's up to our unlikable hero and his uncharismatic robot to save the day, which they of course do with record speed, leaving the viewer with an even more uninteresting sub-plot, which instead becomes the main plot.Art - 7:This is where the show shines, Bones rarely disappoints, and such is the case here as well.

I've only seen the first episode but I can already tell the chemistry amongst the characters is ace. The animation is fantastic and the story line does not seem like it will fail. "", 'Heroman....... I gave the show a chance seeing that Stan Lee was behind it watched it for 7 episodes and couldn\'t enjoy it.I found the story to be really mediocre and void of creativity, The protagonist is annoying and when it comes to the battles that Heroman is evolved in he does nothing but yell out the boring name of his robot ""HEROMAN!""over and over while making needless hand gesture to activate some abilities with heroman\'s remote control. the name heroman seems like it came from a that of elementary student. The whole plot seems like it came from a child -.- the villains in...the show the ""Skrugg"" are again mediocre, they are invading alien cockroaches with green goo guns. The battles between the military and aliens are nothing you haven\'t seen from Godzilla stock footage. I expected more from the show but it does seem to be targeted to a audience of 8-10 years of age with a lot of flash to keep the viewer hypnotized while the writers of the show just come up with the plot at the last minute before their deadlines.Pass on this show if you want to see a good marvel show what ""The Spectacular Spiderman"" the show the ""Skrugg"" are again mediocre, they are invading alien cockroaches with green goo guns. The battles between the military and aliens are nothing you haven\'t seen from Godzilla stock footage. I expected more from the show but it does seem to be targeted to a audience of 8-10 years of age with a lot of flash to keep the viewer hypnotized while the writers of the show just come up with the plot at the last minute before their deadlines.Pass on this show if you want to see a good marvel show what ""The Spectacular Spiderman""', 'Heroman is a bit of an odd one to review.Written by the famous Stan Lee it would seem that his writing and studio Bones quality would go hand in hand for a successful series.The first point i would like to make is that Heroman of all things isn\'t bad, it would seem that it had allot to live up two especially when people put this series with the names Bones and Stan Lee.Bones has had a history of great series, of course they had flaws but they were enjoyable especially in their stories. Compared with their previous work this is why Heroman doesn’t seem...to be as good.STORY.this is where the story would seem to fall short. It is a very simple plot, kind of a homage to some of the original comic book concepts. Spiderman was a man bitten by a radioactive spider which created a superhero, simple but effective.This is also the same with Heroman, a simple concept made into a story.The reason why i give Heroman a 5 in story terms is its simplicity, its not bad but i can see why people don’t like it. What seems to really annoy people is its shounen cliché and it does have a lot. School boy, Bullied, orphan, superpower\'s, saving the world and some added school romance; we have seen them all in quite a lot of things.But with this show they seem to work as i said it is a very simple story and it is very Shounen. But i found myself liking it does bring you back to the days where there weren\'t ridiculous plot twists and stupid Mcguffin which will somehow save the day but make you cringe every time you hear it. It also is a very well passed series. it doesn’t spend too much time explaining ""what happened last time"" and it isn’t too quick. However it does move quickly and gets on with what its about which i do very much appreciate and thank the gods too there is nothing more dull then watching a fight that lasts more than an episode and most of it is talking.Overall though i like its story its simple, you don’t have to spend time thinking about how this power works or what not, its easily enjoyable.CHARACTERS.this is where a lot of nerd-rage seems to be going on. The main character Joey Jones is very simple and incredibly Shounen, a orphaned boy who has a aura of good. He works for his money to surport him and his grandmother, He hates fighting and tries to avoid it and of course hes kind, his hole character screams Lawful good, his like an example of it. This makes him incredibly simple which in this series case is a good thing. It means he isnt hard to understand but he doesn\'t seem incredibly deep which leads to some of his actions becoming too predictable. There is some kind of story about his farther being a miner but this and why the bully\'s call him ""useless"" has yet to be explained.Now on to the point which really annoyes people, his voice. Now to me it isn\'t much of a problem mostly because there are far more annoying characters with worse voices out there. But it is quite effeminate and it can be hard on the ear\'s when you keep hearing ""heroman"" being said over and over. It can quickly become a bit tiresome.However though i find him quite a decent main character.Second in main character wise is Heroman a toy robot Joey fixes and is then hit by lighting and turns into a larger more advanced robot..... Haven’t seen that one before. I could see what Stan lee and Bones were going for with this character a silent hero but it’s hard to like Heroman because he never speaks or reacts that much. He is portrayed with some kind of intelligence and he seems to know what Joey\'s thinking and saying.However though i do like him as a hero of a kind, again the word simple comes to mind.Now the other character\'s, Lina the popular cheerleader and love interest in the series. she doesn\'t really have much depth to her and doesn\'t really do much. While she not a bad chracter she doesn\'t have much that is interesting about her. However though it is good to see a romance that isn\'t mind numing in its stupiditly and they do have a bit of chemistry however though she really dosen\'t have that much significance.Psy (atleast thats how i think you spell it) is the bad-ass best friend and support character. He gives moral support to help his friend and does do quite alot overall. He also has a slight back story about how he ended up being crippled or damaging his leg (whichever) which adds a bit but not much.And of course a Science teacher (proff. denton or whatever) who migh as well be labled ""Mad scientist"" an alright character and does contribute and come up with most of the plans but apart from that hes just.... weird.there are more but they dont real have much significance at all and are meer backround characters.What the main problem is for this set of characters is there is very little to no character development. While there are changes and situations the characters don’t seem to be effect that much and get on with their lives.Overall the characters are simple yet effective, while some are incredibly cliché it doesn’t get in the way of their interactions and what not.ART.Just one word ""Bones""You cannot go wrong with Bones\'s animation. it is very well done and as far as i have seen there has been no change in quality especially no changes to style or animation slip-ups. Its animation crisp and its use in colours are bright but not detracting .It\'s quite obvious that they had a large budget for this show probably the Name ""Stan Lee"" was used to get it.Character designs are also well done; some nice attention went into them to give it a American feel without being too ridiculous. Though you still have the Shounen cliché of ""never changing clothes"" and some retarded hair but its not a major issue.Heroman\'s design has also got a lot of flak from the community, and while i admit it is basic and has a patriotic hint of ""American flag"" on it. I don’t find it too much of an issue it isn\'t total stupid.However though there is one quaral i have with this series in animation or ""why put this in"" is Transformation sequence. Once maybe but more than this is just a waste of time. its a stupid decision but thankfully it isnt always the same one.SOUND.no complaints really, opening and ending theme are good but not amazing and back-round music is aright sometimes meh.OVERALL ENJOYMENT?so far i have enjoyed this series. It is one word: simple, non-complex you don’t have to get your head around some random Mcguffin they made up or ridiculous plot twists or even retarded characters its all non complex. You can easily sit down and relax while watching it without going ""wait... What"" or ""oh for...."" or even cringing at every line. so overall i have liked this series. to be as good.STORY.this is where the story would seem to fall short.

"", ""There is a few things that should be pointed out before reading the review:1. This is a Stan Lee work. If you don't recognize him he will feel left out during his numerous cameo appearances... and cry.2. Ratings are a matter of personal preference, so i suggest making judgment by reading the points and not staring at my score.-This is rated PG.This matters on a number of levels. Don't expect any complicated plot; the first half of the show especially requires minimal internalization of what is going on. This also means when an enemy is destroyed they, hilariously, implode into their exoskeleton, as they are...bug men.-Bones animates awesome fight sequences, but leaves out logic.I have to admit that the big showdowns between heroman and his evil foes were enjoyable. Heroman moves slowly as he is a giant tank and gives the impression of a wrestler more than anything else. He even parades in front of your screen and has his own victory sign.Yet, there was always oddities that lacked explanations: How did he repair himself? Why can't missles affect the Skrugg, but his puny fists can? Even in a situation of aliens and toys turning into planetary heros, every story starts of by grounding itself to reality so we can understand it. This is one of the more selective points; you actually have to care about this a lot for this to completely ruin your enjoyment of the show.-The second half attempts to compensate for a weak start.The first segment is cliché as Heroman fights against the army of advanced aliens with their giant spheres, and yes i just said giant spheres. After you infer what happens, the plot thickens, and various encounters with human kind occur. Apparently this proves harder to do as he must keep his secret identity. If you make it through the poor first arc, the second arc will be more worthwhile; unfortunately the third major arc reverts backwards.-Joey is an.. interesting character.One must accept that Joey is not a women. While not bad animation, it lies more in the choice of his hairstyle. Personally, he must be one of the most unintentional ugly characters i have seen, but despite this adversity he makes his sojourn to manhood and becomes the hero he has always wanted to be. If you don't want to go deaf however, watch out for his blood curdling cry for heroman to attack.-Other main characters don't get a lot of development.Denton sensei, and Psy are helpful sidekicks, but don't get any personal attention and are always assisting Joey in his pursuit to save the world. Even Will, Lina's sister, gets no attention at all; If you make it to the end you will realize he is completely forgotten, while the context would be a spoiler i will say that it is odd if you consider how Lina has a brother complex.-Comparing to average anime, it has a good romance.In a world where tsunderes reign, couples can never relax and can never avoid drama, heroman is a breath of fresh air. The local cheerleader expresses interest in our hero from the start and provides a non-frustrating relationship. However, this is not the focus so this never turns for the worst.-Psy gets no character development for a long time.Now, this normally wouldn't bug people so much, and i had a point for development already. However, the fact that we have no explanation to  the event that crippled him paranoid me throughout the series. Awesome character made personally awkward. I also always wanted to know where he got that awesome crippled person motorized skateboard too! bug men.-Bones animates awesome fight sequences, but leaves out logic.I have to admit that the big showdowns between heroman and his evil foes were enjoyable.

And it works really well.And if you add the fact its Stan Lee, it gains a lot of extra points.The plot is about a kid,Joey,who rebuilds a toy, this toy is impacted by a lighting and it becomes in Heroman, very cliche for now. Then the alien attack, the militaries are useless.....we need a hero to save us all......Heroman appears and save the world....but with some consecuences, i liked that, its great that the perfect peace were something hard to get...and it needs more than muscles.

FINISH!!!!', 'I’m kind of surprised that people didn’t like Heroman when it first came out. Ignoring the fact that it came out during a pretty packed season, what’s with all these people saying it’s unambitious and kiddy back when it first came out, and even now? If anything, this was the Bones mecha series that should have been popular. It’s fun. It’s campy. It makes interesting stuff happen rather than cocktease the interesting stuff for more than half the series’ length and not deliver in the end. And it’s AMERICA as all hell.Proof that anime fans suck right here man. But this isn’t a judgment of...them. This is a judgment of Heroman. And there are three main reasons for why it’s so cool.The Retro Setting:I know that people complain about how Captain Earth’s characters are too simplistic and it’s true that the characters in Heroman aren’t much better in theory, but the reason I give Heroman a pass is because of its retro campy tone. When a show has an underlying sense of humor or style to its cliches, I can forgive them easier. And you can’t tell me that the show isn’t purposefully trying to be retro. It has a main kid character named Joey Jones. His love interest is a blonde cheerleader. His best friend has a fro. The robot has the red, white, and blue all over him. And Bones’ animation style looks like a commercial (in a good way). It’s doing all these American cliches on purpose to the point that it creates its own world of weird logic that you just have to run with in the same vein as Scott Pilgrim and Bakemonogatari. I love that sort of thing as long as the world is capitalized on – something Scott Pilgrim did whilst Bakemonogatari didn’t.And believe me, Heroman capitalizes on its setting very well. It never gets to do it in an AWESOME manner equivalent to Eureka Seven’s Beam Arc or anything, but it does it with a good amount of consistency.The Pacing:The show is basically comprised of three or so arcs with each arc tributing a different aspect of comic book history. I’m not that much of a comic book fan, so I can’t really go into detail about them, but basically the first arc is a traditional sort of story, the second is a more edgy story, and the last is more of a grand story along with whatever you describe the type of story that characters like Venom from Spiderman populate. Each arc has its own setup, conflict, and payoff with about two or so episodes of downtime in between them – rather than the 7-20 episodes that makes up those other anime that I’m not going to list on this blog. Said arcs deliver well in terms of delivering the basics of what makes those comic books it’s tributing good, especially with its reveals, its fights, its characterization, and what it means to be a hero. Could really use some of that pacing in Stardust Crusaders right now.The Relationship Between A Boy And His Robot:And what makes said hero story good itself, apart from accomplishing all the basics, is the relationship between Joey and Heroman. Say what you will about how everything else is too kiddy, but this kid show gets the relationship between a boy and his robot better than most other popular “adult” mecha shows.I’m not kidding when I say that this relationship mirrors Giant Robo’s in terms of how much a boy and his robot complement each other – and Giant Robo is the best classic mecha anime of all-time, so that’s a huge compliment. Joey is a weak kid who can’t do much on his own without Heroman. But on the other hand, Heroman can’t do anything unless Joey allows him to. They both depend on each other to get things done, and they both come to appreciate the other for it. It’s a classic old-school relationship that’s nothing too special, but it’s still pretty damn charming when it’s done well. And yeah, Stan Lee knows how to do old-school well. The rest of the relationships are cool too in an old-school fashion – I like Joey’s relationship with Lina and Psy and even Will (hey, a bully character that doesn’t suck) – but it’s the one he has with Heroman that at the end of the day, makes this show for me.Conclusion:Joey’s superpowers come from a toy arm given to him by a bolt of lightning.

How is that not awesome?', 'If you\'ve ever seen a superhero movie or something of the like before, then the premise of Heroman should be fairly familiar to you. A normal, unassuming boy suddenly get\'s granted some sort of superpower, and must use it to to defeat some sort of new evil that has presented itself to destroy the world. This should come as no surprise though, as Heroman is a 2010 anime produced by Studio BONES, with input from Stan Lee himself, creator of such big names as Spiderman and The Fantastic Four. But in this case, instead of the boy getting powers directly, he winds up getting a...toy robot of his shocked by a bolt of lightning one night, causing it to grow to twice his size, and leaving him to command it. Shortly afterwards, an alien invasion begins, and it\'s up to Joey and the newly dubbed ""Heroman"" to save the world from this threat.The premise is very basic, and you can see that Heroman does indeed draw a lot of inspiration from superhero works of the past. In one sense, this is kind of cool. It\'s rare to see an anime that actually takes place in America, and it is actually entertaining to see a simple story of a boy fighting against an evil threat, without any major complications. But ultimately, this simplicity is also one of the show\'s greatest downfalls, because at the end of the day, Heroman simply plays it too safe.The story to defeat the evil aliens (bug-like creatures known as ""Skrugg"") is enjoyable, but has no real depth to it. Simply put, it\'s basically just Joey and his friends walking forward to the Skrugg headquarters, fighting any that they meet along the way. Eventually, this part of the story is actually resolved, and it\'s here that the show starts to get a little more interesting, even if it still is unoriginal and has been done many times before. And while there are some interesting themes brought up at points, most notably the question of what exactly it truly means to be a hero, these themes are usually forgotten shortly after being brought up, despite the fact that a closer examination of this sort of thing could have really brought up the level of the narrative.This simplicity also seeps into the characters. Joey is your generic goody two shoes, who always wants to help people and is willing to put himself into harms way to do so. It\'s fine for him to start out like this, but he never really develops throughout the story, and is basically the same at the end as he was at the beginning. This is also true for most of the other characters. You have Psy, Joey\'s best friend who is much more brash and willing to get things done (who also uses crutches throughout the whole show, which is actually kind of cool), there is Professor Denton, a goofy school teacher who inadvertently starts the invasion by making contact with the aliens, and Lina, the obvious main love interest who Joey doesn\'t seem to ever give enough attention.There are more characters as the show goes on, from the military agent Hughes, to even Joey\'s older sister, but they all share one common flaw, and that is a lack of development in any sort of way. Most of these characters are admittedly amusing and a lot of fun to have on the screen, but they don\'t seem to serve a whole lot of purpose at the end of the day, and could really be replaced by anyone else. The romance that is foreshadowed between Joey and Lina never actually hits it\'s stride, and Joey\'s sister is annoying and antagonistic basically the whole way through. Had we gone a little further into what makes these characters tick, they could have been quite good, but sadly, we are left with just some cliche character\'s that fall nicely into certain tropes and do their job well, but ultimately never go beyond that.So you may wonder, if Heroman is mostly just a glorified superhero movie in anime form, why should you bother with it? Two words: Production values. Heroman was created by Studio BONES, who are well known for their work on other notable projects such as Fullmetal Alchemist and Eureka Seven. They are also known for their high production standards when it comes to animation, and Heroman is no exception. The whole show looks great, going above and beyond what you would expect from a work of it\'s nature. The character designs are all unique, the action is a thrill to watch, and it overall looks incredible, particularly in the final few episodes, where the animation reaches a jaw dropping level.The music is also a high point of the show, using a high number of techno like tracks to really set the mood for a lot of scenes, sometimes enhancing them greatly. In addition, the Opening and Ending themes are all great, with the first ending being particularly interesting, as the whole thing is done in a comic book panel style, an obvious homage to the show\'s roots.So all in all, Heroman is actually a little disappointing. Not because it\'s a bad show per-se, but because it could have been so much more. It looks and sounds great, and is certainly an entertaining watch, but it suffers from an overall lack of ambition, and settles in too nicely with doing what it\'s comfortable with, not willing to take a few more steps forward and provide something deeper and overall more satisfying. That said, Heroman is quite well at doing what it does, and if nothing else, is a fun ride from beginning to end. toy robot of his shocked by a bolt of lightning one night, causing it to grow to twice his size, and leaving him to command it.

The emergence of heroman is not explained at all ( and i has hoping to see how and why he was created ), he basically was born from a lightning, end of explanation...Joey is a character that fully dependent of heroman, i wish he had some kind of attack like a blast from that glove, instead of just a shield and super velocity.However, the storyline is good, you get involved with the characters, wishing everything goes fine and  the fights are also...good (not as good as of naruto and Dragon ball for example, but you can enjoy it as well).Taking everything i said in consideration, i think this is an average anime.

"", ""I just want to start this review by saying that these are all my personal opinion and thoughts. I have not looked at other reviews.Perhaps it's a bit silly, to give this anime series a 10/10 overall score. To be honest, I'm very child-like in personality and I've always enjoyed children's anime like Battle Spirits, Digimon, etc. And this review is six years too late, but I'm glad to have found this anime regardless.With this being said, let's get on with the review! I'll do my best not to drop any major spoilers. If you don't mind a little spoils then go ahead.> STORY -...9/10To be honest, I thought this story was almost perfect. Perhaps from a child's point of view it is. You might be put off by this series because it's labeled PG - Children, but I felt it should have been PG-13 or something because there are some incredibly dark moments for let's say, a eight year old child to understand maybe. It's too violent, but it's definitely up to Digimon Tamer's standards, which I consider to be one of the darkest children anime.I'm not going to lie to protect this story, from my point of view (without looking at other reviews), there are some plot holes. Like we never see one of the main's parents which is strange considering he should be still in middle school and should be freaking out that their son is off doing dangerous activities. There are some Deux Ex Machina moments, but to be honest, I don't really mind the cliches. If executed well and put in an interesting story like Big Hero 6 did, then it's alright with me.I was happy that they decided to go with the episodic three arc style and it didn't feel at all rushed like some anime these days. There are three major arcs, and one mini-arc. I've gone ahead and  given them my own personal titles and I promise not to spoil too much about them. They are (in order of chronology): Skrugg Arc, Fugitive Arc, and Final Arc. The mini-arc I call the Obligated Spooky Episode, although short (spanning over two episodes), is still very enjoyable. Out of all the Arcs, I find that I enjoyed the Fugitive Arc the most because of how surprisingly realistic it was considering the government these days, but find the Final Arc the most emotionally moving. The bit concerning Joey's absent parents was absolutely heartbreaking l learn about. It's like if Uncle Ben's 'With great power comes great responsibility' had a secret meaning, oh my goodness, I couldn't stop crying. I was crying throughout the episode's end, but unfortunately, it didn't give me enough time to cry and the plot had to move forward. I ended up sniffling through the next few. The Skrugg Arc is a bit plain and perhaps a bit generic, but I feel it sets up the characters, environment, and plot up very well. I'm aware that they cut a few things from the manga it was based on and I agree they could have tried setting up the first arc better, but the rest of the arcs are absolute gold in my book.Actually, I just finished this series and I'm planning to rewatch the series starting from the end of the first arc. I'm probably going to be rewatching this for a while, to let the story soak in. I managed to watch this entire 26 episode in around two days and I honestly felt like I rushed it, but I couldn't help it. I can't stand being left on a cliffhanger.Talking about how I hate cliffhangers, did you know the ending of this show *grumble grumble*...I wish they made a Season 2 or some sort of sequel, but it's wrapped up well and I could probably guess what the characters are up to now...> ART - 9/10I personally think the art style to be appropriate for this anime. Most of this anime is 2D animated, but some aspects like the Alien aircrafts and other minor things to be 3D modeled, but some of it is so well that it took me a few glances to make sure that some of them are 3D models and it works to the series advantage. It makes the alien stuff seem so other-worldly and it didn't fit with the 2D animation, but it works so well that I don't feel any need to nitpick on it.There was a scene I remember where the art style suddenly changed and I thought for a moment I was watching Baccano (which I haven't watched past the first episode). It fit the mood, but it was kinda scary for a PG - Children rating.I have nothing much to say about the art. It's not as good as say, Noragami, but very good for it's time I think. It's decent enough to deal with if you're real picky with art style or such.> SOUND - 7/10Honest to goodness, I don't remember much of the soundtracks that much. The ones I do remember is the first two opening songs, the second  super catchy ending song, and the trailer song that plays during epic battles. Although it's no Hans Zimmer, I really like some of the soundtracks, but they aren't as memorable as let's say...the Japanese Instrumental goodness of Natsume Yuujinchou where I remembered most of the soundtrack.Anyways, I will be adding two new songs to my music playlist:- Heroman Trailer Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UInVSerF6Y- Heroman (Ending 2) - Mass Alert - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNgScc_k2MI can't really explain it to you that well. You just have to listen it to yourself, I find both to be the most catchy.> CHARACTERS - 9/10ARGH CHARACTERS. I LOVE THEM. Well almost all of them...For a rather passive person like me, I find myself associating Joey the most. I find Joey to be an excitable middle school student who has trouble in his life because of his absent parents and social life. Your typical hero origin story. Also I would like to point out that I was not aware that in America, middle school students could have part time jobs and I find that kind of depressing in cases similar to Joey's (to support his grandmother). I would also like to point out that Joey looks like a lady, but none of the characters seem to address it...especially since in that one episode... *grumble grumble*...Anyways, I find the way Joey reacts to his situations that he gets in is very realistic. The character development for Joey I find to be supreme. Honestly, Joey reminds me a bit of Natsume from Natsume Yuujinchou if he was much younger and more energetic. Like Natsume, Joey accepts anything thrown his way and is very passive/subtle about his actions. He changed a LOT from the Skrugg Arg and the Final Arc. The reason why I love the Fugitive Arc the most, is how Joey responded in the situations. Joey in the Fugitive Arc was so depressing my heart was in constant pain when I was watching through that arc because it just wasn't fair.I liked Professor Denton, which is the only adult in the team of children and I found him to be hilarious. He's often the butt monkey and sometimes acts younger than the other three children mains which I find to be most pleasing. Also the way he says 'Exactly' is worth pointing out, I couldn't stop laughing. I felt bad for Psy, because of his injury, but he's pretty badass and no injury was going to hold him back from being cool as crap. Although I have to say I like Lina, the obligated female character in the children trio, the least, but I don't dislike her. I do find it hilarious that this is the first time I've seen a the trope 'All Guys want Cheerleaders' turned on it's head. She's infatuated with Joey, but unfortunately Joey's too passive and has a low opinion of himself that Lina had to go out of her way to get his attention, which is absolutely hilarious because it's supposed to go the other way around.  It was a while since I found a team where I liked everyone.However, there are some characters I don't particularly like. Mainly the villains, I hated the evil doctor guy because of just how rotten and manipulative he could be. I hated one character at one point because of the heartbreak he had caused in the fugitive arc, but warmed up to him later on. I actually hate the jock of the story, Will, Lina's older brother. Something about him just irritates me, not because he was a bad character, just the way he acts is annoying. To me, the way he acted in the Skrugg Arc was annoying and perhaps a little unreasonable. I seriously doubt anyone would act that way in the real life.Most of the cast were enjoyable, some didn't develop as much as say, Joey who developed a whole lot, but I think they are all enjoyable.ENJOYMENT - 10/10First, I'm going to talk about the feels of this anime. I really really really enjoyed this series and I wish so badly that there would be a sequel or some continuation. Apparently there's a manga series which has more content, but I couldn't find any chapters past Chapter 3 and that makes me very sad. I started this series, knowing that it would be about a boy and his robot saving the world from aliens. I found it when I was browsing through the action section on AnimePlanet and was attracted to it by the small blurb.I was expecting it to be a bit like Gundam, which I am okay with, but it wasn't really my thing. I was desperate for something to watch after drowning in the horrendous amount of Ecchi, Harems, and anime with way too much fanservice this was definitely a breath of fresh air.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this series doesn't really work like a Mecha up to any standards. In a sense, Heroman reminds me a bit of the Iron Giant he he couldn't talk. Or to be put in a more recent style, Heroman reminds me of Baymax from Big Hero 6 if he couldn't talk and was more aggressive. It's definitely Marvel alright. I actually forgot I was watching an anime because of how it progressed more like a Western Animation rather than anime. It has all the goodness from both Western Animation and Anime and that makes me happy.It's been so long since an anime has given me a sense of thrill. I was literally sweating and felt my heart beating during some of the action scenes. My heart was honestly in pain during some of the Arcs. I loved Joey, Psy, Prof. Denton, Lina, and the rest of the characters. This show made me laugh out loud when I was watching by myself and then as soon as it made me laugh, it brought me to tears. It's been so long I been so emotionally invested in fictional characters. The last time I felt truly like this is when I watched Big Hero 6 for the first time.Maybe it's because I'm so childish that it perhaps clouded my judgement of this anime, but this is the hidden gem I was so desperately searching for.> OVERALL - 10/10Honestly, I hate this anime.I hate it because it's my ideal anime. The one I've been looking for so long. It's nearly perfect to me, maybe not to some others, but it's pefect to me. Something that resonated with me so well that if someone asked me which anime represented me the most it would be this one. I hate it, I hate it so badly because I know that I will probably never find an anime quite like this one and it makes me mad/sad. I hate this anime, I wish I could forget it all so I can watch it again.I'm kinda sad to acknowledge that I may never find an anime series quite like this again, to give me the same amount of enjoyment and happiness. Anime these days are so riddled with fan service or absurdity that I had to resort to watching Children's anime to escape it since I've never been fond of it in the first place.If you made it this far, then thank you for reading. I tried not to drop any major spoilers and I re-read it to make sure of that. If you have yet to watch this series, I highly recommend it regardless if you like mecha or not. If you like things like Digimon, Pokemon, Battle Spirits, etc. this anime is definitely worth looking into. Definitely in my top five anime. Maybe even the top now...Sure it might not be the greatest masterpiece to you, the reader, but to me it was.To me it was a greatest masterpiece. 9/10To be honest, I thought this story was almost perfect.

Out of all the Arcs, I find that I enjoyed the Fugitive Arc the most because of how surprisingly realistic it was considering the government these days, but find the Final Arc the most emotionally moving. The bit concerning Joey's absent parents was absolutely heartbreaking l learn about. It's like if Uncle Ben's 'With great power comes great responsibility' had a secret meaning, oh my goodness, I couldn't stop crying. I was crying throughout the episode's end, but unfortunately, it didn't give me enough time to cry and the plot had to move forward. I ended up sniffling through the next few. The Skrugg Arc is a bit plain and perhaps a bit generic, but I feel it sets up the characters, environment, and plot up very well. I'm aware that they cut a few things from the manga it was based on and I agree they could have tried setting up the first arc better, but the rest of the arcs are absolute gold in my book.Actually, I just finished this series and I'm planning to rewatch the series starting from the end of the first arc. I'm probably going to be rewatching this for a while, to let the story soak in. I managed to watch this entire 26 episode in around two days and I honestly felt like I rushed it, but I couldn't help it. I can't stand being left on a cliffhanger.Talking about how I hate cliffhangers, did you know the ending of this show *grumble grumble*...I wish they made a Season 2 or some sort of sequel, but it's wrapped up well and I could probably guess what the characters are up to now...> ART - 9/10I personally think the art style to be appropriate for this anime. Most of this anime is 2D animated, but some aspects like the Alien aircrafts and other minor things to be 3D modeled, but some of it is so well that it took me a few glances to make sure that some of them are 3D models and it works to the series advantage. It makes the alien stuff seem so other-worldly and it didn't fit with the 2D animation, but it works so well that I don't feel any need to nitpick on it.There was a scene I remember where the art style suddenly changed and I thought for a moment I was watching Baccano (which I haven't watched past the first episode). It fit the mood, but it was kinda scary for a PG - Children rating.I have nothing much to say about the art. It's not as good as say, Noragami, but very good for it's time I think. It's decent enough to deal with if you're real picky with art style or such.> SOUND - 7/10Honest to goodness, I don't remember much of the soundtracks that much. The ones I do remember is the first two opening songs, the second  super catchy ending song, and the trailer song that plays during epic battles. Although it's no Hans Zimmer, I really like some of the soundtracks, but they aren't as memorable as let's say...the Japanese Instrumental goodness of Natsume Yuujinchou where I remembered most of the soundtrack.Anyways, I will be adding two new songs to my music playlist:- Heroman Trailer Song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UInVSerF6Y- Heroman (Ending 2) - Mass Alert - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WNgScc_k2MI can't really explain it to you that well. You just have to listen it to yourself, I find both to be the most catchy.> CHARACTERS - 9/10ARGH CHARACTERS. I LOVE THEM. Well almost all of them...For a rather passive person like me, I find myself associating Joey the most. I find Joey to be an excitable middle school student who has trouble in his life because of his absent parents and social life. Your typical hero origin story. Also I would like to point out that I was not aware that in America, middle school students could have part time jobs and I find that kind of depressing in cases similar to Joey's (to support his grandmother). I would also like to point out that Joey looks like a lady, but none of the characters seem to address it...especially since in that one episode... *grumble grumble*...Anyways, I find the way Joey reacts to his situations that he gets in is very realistic. The character development for Joey I find to be supreme. Honestly, Joey reminds me a bit of Natsume from Natsume Yuujinchou if he was much younger and more energetic. Like Natsume, Joey accepts anything thrown his way and is very passive/subtle about his actions. He changed a LOT from the Skrugg Arg and the Final Arc. The reason why I love the Fugitive Arc the most, is how Joey responded in the situations. Joey in the Fugitive Arc was so depressing my heart was in constant pain when I was watching through that arc because it just wasn't fair.I liked Professor Denton, which is the only adult in the team of children and I found him to be hilarious. He's often the butt monkey and sometimes acts younger than the other three children mains which I find to be most pleasing. Also the way he says 'Exactly' is worth pointing out, I couldn't stop laughing. I felt bad for Psy, because of his injury, but he's pretty badass and no injury was going to hold him back from being cool as crap. Although I have to say I like Lina, the obligated female character in the children trio, the least, but I don't dislike her. I do find it hilarious that this is the first time I've seen a the trope 'All Guys want Cheerleaders' turned on it's head. She's infatuated with Joey, but unfortunately Joey's too passive and has a low opinion of himself that Lina had to go out of her way to get his attention, which is absolutely hilarious because it's supposed to go the other way around.  It was a while since I found a team where I liked everyone.However, there are some characters I don't particularly like. Mainly the villains, I hated the evil doctor guy because of just how rotten and manipulative he could be. I hated one character at one point because of the heartbreak he had caused in the fugitive arc, but warmed up to him later on. I actually hate the jock of the story, Will, Lina's older brother. Something about him just irritates me, not because he was a bad character, just the way he acts is annoying. To me, the way he acted in the Skrugg Arc was annoying and perhaps a little unreasonable. I seriously doubt anyone would act that way in the real life.Most of the cast were enjoyable, some didn't develop as much as say, Joey who developed a whole lot, but I think they are all enjoyable.ENJOYMENT - 10/10First, I'm going to talk about the feels of this anime. I really really really enjoyed this series and I wish so badly that there would be a sequel or some continuation. Apparently there's a manga series which has more content, but I couldn't find any chapters past Chapter 3 and that makes me very sad. I started this series, knowing that it would be about a boy and his robot saving the world from aliens. I found it when I was browsing through the action section on AnimePlanet and was attracted to it by the small blurb.I was expecting it to be a bit like Gundam, which I am okay with, but it wasn't really my thing. I was desperate for something to watch after drowning in the horrendous amount of Ecchi, Harems, and anime with way too much fanservice this was definitely a breath of fresh air.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this series doesn't really work like a Mecha up to any standards. In a sense, Heroman reminds me a bit of the Iron Giant he he couldn't talk. Or to be put in a more recent style, Heroman reminds me of Baymax from Big Hero 6 if he couldn't talk and was more aggressive. It's definitely Marvel alright. I actually forgot I was watching an anime because of how it progressed more like a Western Animation rather than anime. It has all the goodness from both Western Animation and Anime and that makes me happy.It's been so long since an anime has given me a sense of thrill. I was literally sweating and felt my heart beating during some of the action scenes. My heart was honestly in pain during some of the Arcs. I loved Joey, Psy, Prof. Denton, Lina, and the rest of the characters. This show made me laugh out loud when I was watching by myself and then as soon as it made me laugh, it brought me to tears. It's been so long I been so emotionally invested in fictional characters. The last time I felt truly like this is when I watched Big Hero 6 for the first time.Maybe it's because I'm so childish that it perhaps clouded my judgement of this anime, but this is the hidden gem I was so desperately searching for.> OVERALL - 10/10Honestly, I hate this anime.I hate it because it's my ideal anime. The one I've been looking for so long. It's nearly perfect to me, maybe not to some others, but it's pefect to me. Something that resonated with me so well that if someone asked me which anime represented me the most it would be this one. I hate it, I hate it so badly because I know that I will probably never find an anime quite like this one and it makes me mad/sad. I hate this anime, I wish I could forget it all so I can watch it again.I'm kinda sad to acknowledge that I may never find an anime series quite like this again, to give me the same amount of enjoyment and happiness. Anime these days are so riddled with fan service or absurdity that I had to resort to watching Children's anime to escape it since I've never been fond of it in the first place.If you made it this far, then thank you for reading. I tried not to drop any major spoilers and I re-read it to make sure of that. If you have yet to watch this series, I highly recommend it regardless if you like mecha or not. If you like things like Digimon, Pokemon, Battle Spirits, etc. this anime is definitely worth looking into. Definitely in my top five anime.

Gakusen Toshi Asterisk,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30544/Gakusen_Toshi_Asterisk,"['[Spoiler Warning]I\'m not mad. I have only myself to blame for this, really. I tend to be more selective with what I watch. Something will be recommended, I\'ll hear about something popular, or it\'s just on my mind a lot. I\'ve never watched anything expecting it to be bad; usually I have no expectations at all, but often I at least think it\'ll be something that\'s enjoyable enough to pass the time and get a 5 or 6.The Asterisk War is my first exception.I didn\'t watch this because I knew it\'d be good. I watched it because I heard it was almost identical to Rakudai...Kishi no Cavalry, which I\'d just finished, and all I wanted to do was see which is worse. Yes, WORSE. Not better. I mean, that\'s not to say it couldn’t have been surprisingly good, but of course that couldn\'t happen. Of course, this review won’t be spent comparing the two anime together, but I will give a verdict as to which is better at the end. Because that’s what everyone asked me to do!Also, so the mods won’t be unhappy, I must inform you that I will spoil the first episode almost entirely, but spoilers will be toned down to a minor level beyond that episode.Asterisk starts off extremely rocky; honestly just about everything in the first episode is horrible, whether it\'s immediately evident or not. The opening scene is a fight with awkward choreography and absolutely no context at all, even as the scene comes to a close. It sets the tone, I guess, but the reason why this fight was shown at all just seems unclear after watching the whole season, as way too little is revealed in this opening, and its potential context doesn\'t have much weight on the following episodes. But I\'m sure it\'ll be explained later... in another season... that I won\'t watch...Some exposition is given, which is fine I guess, but one very interesting thing stuck with me. ""The people gradually began to alter their sense of morality."" This is apparently due to some event called ""Invertia"", and you really have to give the writer(s) props for making a new term for ""shitty writing"". It\'s a shame they couldn\'t follow up on it, though. There might be some stupid actions, but nothing horrible enough to make you really think that these people are really fucked in the head; these things instead feel forced so that the ""story"" (read: too little) and fanservice (read: too much) can keep going.The first example of characters being idiots instead of morally questionable comes quickly. Icky--oh, sorry, wrong review—Ayato (the main character) catches a falling handkerchief, sees and open window (and/or hears someone\'s voice from it), and sums up the obvious. He jumps into the window to return the handkerchief, only to see a female student only partially dressed. Here\'s everything wrong with this scene:1. He acts apologetic, knowing that it was an accident, despite not considering that he would\'ve been obviously invading someone\'s privacy by jumping through their FUCKING WINDOW, MULTIPLE STORIES HIGH. If some awareness to the obviously horrible idea were present, even if it results in the MC being a massive douchenozzle, it could at least be pinned to people having fucked up morals. Nope, instead he tries playing this off like it’s not just a prank, bro.2. We get a glimpse of someone’s ass before knowing whose ass it even is. But don’t worry, it’s not that important, this is only the female fucking lead. Where are the Japanese tumblrvists when you need them? If the fanservice wasn’t so forced, this could’ve been an OK scene, but god forbid someone has to go three minutes without popping a boner over their new waifu. By the way, you can stop taking the show seriously at this point.3. If your handkerchief is so important, why did you carelessly leave it sitting loosely near an open window? How the hell did the wind even suck a cloth out of a room, anyway? Why was Ayato surprised by seeing a girl in the room when he heard her talking? If he didn’t hear her talking, why did WE hear her talking?This goes into a very laughable fight scene that only exists because Julis’s personality makes absolutely no sense, if she even has one. She thinks Ayato should die or something because he saw her naked (apparently wearing underwear = naked, k), despite being soooo grateful for getting a super-special piece of linen back. Maybe this could be some inverted moral bullshit like the story wants me to believe, but you’ll later see how much of a clusterfuck this character is as the show goes on. The fight itself is full of weird technology and magic we know nothing about, plot armor, and overall poor direction. (Why did Ayato jump through an explosion unharmed? And why did the soundtrack suddenly stop just when a character is thinking, only to go to some mysterious-sounding tune? It’s weird.) It ends with Ayato glomping Julis to avoid some assassination or something, and he later gropes her somehow because fanservice, or awkward comedy, or… I don’t know. Oh, did I say something about an assassination? Who cares? No one else does, so that’s obviously not important. Let’s move on.I could pick apart every scene, but I’d just retrace the same points and conclusions the above have made, more or less: Characters are incredibly stupid, whether the writer made them do stupid things or the writer leaked his stupidity into the plot’s scenarios at various points, and not because of some global event. The art is pretty generic and obviously tries to compensate by being flashy, the music is mostly uninspiring, and just the overall direction seems to be mediocre. All of this is taken from the first ten minutes of the first episode. That’s all.In short, the show quickly establishes how fuckin’ bad it is.So, I’ve been mentioning this “Invertia” thing a few times. It IS pretty important, and you should really pay attention to that scene, because it’s the only time in the whole show that you’ll hear about it! …Wait… oh. Yeah, Invertia is mentioned once, or something. No one talks about it, and there’s no noticeable impact from it (as far as morals go). Why did they bother mentioning this part of it? And you know that fight in the beginning? That kinda hints at some other “major” plot element that gets totally forgotten about after it’s brought up. The first episode is basically spent teaching you things you will never need to know. It’s high school algebra all over again!Beyond this façade of a setup, there’s some sort of plot, or at least there should be. Basically, Ayato comes to this school to kinda learn about his sister and mostly to find some path for himself, so he starts training for these fighting events, and wow I am REALLY bored right now. Along the way, he meets various girls who do all but tear out their reproductive organs and install them into exuberantly-colored fleshlights for his personal satisfaction. It’s honestly hilarious how frequent the fanservice is, and how few reasons the girls have to each fall in love with the MC. Asterisk’s girls come in different shapes so that everyone’s tastes are satisfied, and they’re exploited so commonly that I wonder if Asterisk is trying to trying to appeal to the hentai artists or if the creators are bragging that they have girls in their series. I’m sure you’re all very satisfied with yourselves.If you need to be reminded again that the characters are bad, this is your lucky day! The characters are bad! So here’s my favorite part, the character roast section:Ayato – Things worth saying/making fun of are as follows:Julis – Independent black woman who don’t need no bodyguard. If you ignore the fact that she’s a figure of royalty, a high-ranking student, and that your IQ is lower than that of an earthworm, then it makes a lot of sense.Claudia – You know what? This is the best character in the whole show, and all who disagree can fucking fight me. She’s the most direct with her affection for Ayato to the point where she flat-out says she wants to fuck. At least there’s no bullshit about it, other than her having no reason to like Ayato and Ayato being a scrubmaster about it. (Do I need to bring up Cavalry again? WHAT SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD KID IS GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THIS? DON’T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS, ASSHOLE.) Also, please note that her ending scenes to preview the next episode literally do not exist. Nope.Saya – Hi, I’m a deadpan loli with no real reason for being in this show other than to be the loli in this harem. If the point of her personality was to match the audience’s evident opinion of her, they nailed it on the fucking head.Kirin – Kinda younger-looking girl with big tits. Apparently her dad’s in jail, so she and her big tits need to win these festival things or something, and follow the guidance of her uncle who’s abusive as hell for no reason. So, I guess at least this character and her big tits have some sort of conflict??? And then we can waste a couple episodes on her and her big tits?????? No need to thank A-1, I’m sure they do it because they care. And for the record, the anime tells you at every waking moment that this character has big tits because we can’t shove Claudia into every scene.Lester – I’M A DOUCHEBAG WITH MUSCLES. DISLIKE ME!Irene – Wincest.Did I miss anyone? Probably. Do I care? Probably not.Did I have too much fun with that? Probably. Do I care? Probably not.Kinda going into my next point, what the fuck is with everyone’s hair in this thing? What sort of insane products are these people using that allow their hair to suspend in midair? Like holy hell, does their lack of personality somehow expel a gravitational field from their heads? It’s insane, dude. They also have that wonderful, classic “spot the major character” look; if their hair is the color of something not really found in nature, they’re important. If not, they might exist, but you won’t remember them. Everyone below this line is some overly-generic CG filler person or something.Overall, the art might be dazzling to some, but I only see A-1 trying to compensate for their overall weak animation, and no amount of ass shots will redeem it. Even if you don’t agree that the first episode is bad, you can’t possibly tell me that, say, episode 4 looks good. Beyond the animation, the CG is the compensation part, as I couldn’t ever get behind the flashiness and vibrancy of the magic and weapons. I mean, they’re not bad… but they’re certainly nothing special, especially since fights are so reliant on them.By the way, there’s a lot of this CG technology that’s omnipresent even outside of the fights, so it’s not just a bunch of magic and glowing plastic weapons making lightsaber noises. This might’ve been better to bring up in the setting/plot parts of this review, but whatever. Anyway, what the hell is all of this shit? All this technology and shit is literally omnipresent; everywhere you go, you see holograms of various functions. Where do these things even come from? How do they work? What can you do with this amazing technology besides open doors from across a room and use them as replacements for what we know as computers? Why am I asking questions that I know will NEVER be answered?Last thing about the art; who the FUCK is responsible for the next episode previews? You know, that shit at the very end of each episode where Claudia looks like she’s in some visual novel but is animated like a 5-year-old edited it? Jesus Christ, I don’t think I’ve ever cringed so hard after watching something in an anime. I only watched one of these before deciding that I’d never do it again, so please watch at your own risk.Now, the soundtrack is… actually good. Some of it. I believe just one person (Rasmus Faber) did the entire score (my apologies if this is incorrect), and if that’s the case, his electronic pieces are easily his strong point. (Which makes sense; I hear he’s a DJ or something.) The OP and ED are pretty good as well. But unfortunately, the rest is mediocre at best. The more orchestral pieces don’t quite stand out or are as memorable as the electronic pieces, but I don’t want to seem more negative than positive in this section. I’ll actually admit something was good in this anime.But all those negatives aside, at least it wasn’t as bad as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.…Or was it?You know, it’s hard to decide on which is worse. I couldn’t take either anime seriously, but Cavalry still made some attempt at being serious at one point. At least there’s some sort of reason for the shit that’s happening. Asterisk has nothing going on at all! But even if Asterisk did nothing, playing it safe worked to its advantage, because Cavalry’s serious moments are heavily weighed down by the sheer awful, cringe-inducing scenes that infest it. I mean, Asterisk is bad, but it never made me uncomfortable. But Cavalry still did a couple things right, such as the art (mostly) and the romance (to a small extent). Asterisk has a few good songs, and that’s about it. So my overall verdict as to which is worse…Surprising myself a bit, I’m giving that honor to The Asterisk War, mainly based on the fact that it did fuck all to help itself, while Cavalry at least made some legitimate attempt somewhere. And with that settled, I can walk away from this anime with a strange sense of satisfaction: that I was looking for a good match between two terrible anime, and I walked away with an unexpected, but satisfying result. Great job, Asterisk, you actually succeeded in something, by being the Worst One!And that’s all. Full score is below, thanks for… oh god… I just realized something. Invertia didn’t change the morals of the characters, it changed the morals of the writers! And the producers! And whoever the hell else is responsible for this! Oh man, I think it’s gotten to me as well! I went out of my way to watch a bad anime and I was just thankful for it being so terrible! Holy hell, this show is actually genius!Story – 1/10Art – 4/10Sound – 7/10Characters – 1/10Enjoyment – 1/10Overall – 1/10Favorite character – ClaudiaFavorite episode – noneRecommended to – people who want to lower their MAL average scoreCongratulations are in order, for this is my very first 1/10 score. It was originally a 2/10, but after considering things more for this review, I can’t think of any reason to give this anything higher. What did I like? The art was okay but pretty boring, and the soundtrack was pretty nice, but they’re beside me for the most part. If they were actually great and really memorable, like, say, Guilty Crown, then that’d probably let me raise it to a 2 or a 3. But even if GC is a pile of shit beyond the production, at least it made an honest attempt at writing a story and had some legitimately interesting moments. Asterisk has NOTHING that is interesting, whether it’s due to a lack of explanations or just sheer unoriginality. I mean… well, I already wrote the review, so I won’t go back. I guess all that needs to be said is that this anime is pretty ass.terisk. Kishi no Cavalry, which I\'d just finished, and all I wanted to do was see which is worse. Yes, WORSE. Not better. I mean, that\'s not to say it couldn’t have been surprisingly good, but of course that couldn\'t happen. Of course, this review won’t be spent comparing the two anime together, but I will give a verdict as to which is better at the end.

All of this is taken from the first ten minutes of the first episode. That’s all.In short, the show quickly establishes how fuckin’ bad it is.So, I’ve been mentioning this “Invertia” thing a few times. It IS pretty important, and you should really pay attention to that scene, because it’s the only time in the whole show that you’ll hear about it! …Wait… oh. Yeah, Invertia is mentioned once, or something. No one talks about it, and there’s no noticeable impact from it (as far as morals go). Why did they bother mentioning this part of it? And you know that fight in the beginning? That kinda hints at some other “major” plot element that gets totally forgotten about after it’s brought up. The first episode is basically spent teaching you things you will never need to know. It’s high school algebra all over again!Beyond this façade of a setup, there’s some sort of plot, or at least there should be. Basically, Ayato comes to this school to kinda learn about his sister and mostly to find some path for himself, so he starts training for these fighting events, and wow I am REALLY bored right now. Along the way, he meets various girls who do all but tear out their reproductive organs and install them into exuberantly-colored fleshlights for his personal satisfaction. It’s honestly hilarious how frequent the fanservice is, and how few reasons the girls have to each fall in love with the MC. Asterisk’s girls come in different shapes so that everyone’s tastes are satisfied, and they’re exploited so commonly that I wonder if Asterisk is trying to trying to appeal to the hentai artists or if the creators are bragging that they have girls in their series. I’m sure you’re all very satisfied with yourselves.If you need to be reminded again that the characters are bad, this is your lucky day! The characters are bad! So here’s my favorite part, the character roast section:Ayato – Things worth saying/making fun of are as follows:Julis – Independent black woman who don’t need no bodyguard. If you ignore the fact that she’s a figure of royalty, a high-ranking student, and that your IQ is lower than that of an earthworm, then it makes a lot of sense.Claudia – You know what? This is the best character in the whole show, and all who disagree can fucking fight me. She’s the most direct with her affection for Ayato to the point where she flat-out says she wants to fuck. At least there’s no bullshit about it, other than her having no reason to like Ayato and Ayato being a scrubmaster about it. (Do I need to bring up Cavalry again? WHAT SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD KID IS GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THIS? DON’T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS, ASSHOLE.) Also, please note that her ending scenes to preview the next episode literally do not exist. Nope.Saya – Hi, I’m a deadpan loli with no real reason for being in this show other than to be the loli in this harem. If the point of her personality was to match the audience’s evident opinion of her, they nailed it on the fucking head.Kirin – Kinda younger-looking girl with big tits. Apparently her dad’s in jail, so she and her big tits need to win these festival things or something, and follow the guidance of her uncle who’s abusive as hell for no reason. So, I guess at least this character and her big tits have some sort of conflict??? And then we can waste a couple episodes on her and her big tits?????? No need to thank A-1, I’m sure they do it because they care. And for the record, the anime tells you at every waking moment that this character has big tits because we can’t shove Claudia into every scene.Lester – I’M A DOUCHEBAG WITH MUSCLES. DISLIKE ME!Irene – Wincest.Did I miss anyone? Probably. Do I care? Probably not.Did I have too much fun with that? Probably. Do I care? Probably not.Kinda going into my next point, what the fuck is with everyone’s hair in this thing? What sort of insane products are these people using that allow their hair to suspend in midair? Like holy hell, does their lack of personality somehow expel a gravitational field from their heads? It’s insane, dude. They also have that wonderful, classic “spot the major character” look; if their hair is the color of something not really found in nature, they’re important. If not, they might exist, but you won’t remember them. Everyone below this line is some overly-generic CG filler person or something.Overall, the art might be dazzling to some, but I only see A-1 trying to compensate for their overall weak animation, and no amount of ass shots will redeem it. Even if you don’t agree that the first episode is bad, you can’t possibly tell me that, say, episode 4 looks good. Beyond the animation, the CG is the compensation part, as I couldn’t ever get behind the flashiness and vibrancy of the magic and weapons. I mean, they’re not bad… but they’re certainly nothing special, especially since fights are so reliant on them.By the way, there’s a lot of this CG technology that’s omnipresent even outside of the fights, so it’s not just a bunch of magic and glowing plastic weapons making lightsaber noises. This might’ve been better to bring up in the setting/plot parts of this review, but whatever. Anyway, what the hell is all of this shit? All this technology and shit is literally omnipresent; everywhere you go, you see holograms of various functions. Where do these things even come from? How do they work? What can you do with this amazing technology besides open doors from across a room and use them as replacements for what we know as computers? Why am I asking questions that I know will NEVER be answered?Last thing about the art; who the FUCK is responsible for the next episode previews? You know, that shit at the very end of each episode where Claudia looks like she’s in some visual novel but is animated like a 5-year-old edited it? Jesus Christ, I don’t think I’ve ever cringed so hard after watching something in an anime. I only watched one of these before deciding that I’d never do it again, so please watch at your own risk.Now, the soundtrack is… actually good. Some of it. I believe just one person (Rasmus Faber) did the entire score (my apologies if this is incorrect), and if that’s the case, his electronic pieces are easily his strong point. (Which makes sense; I hear he’s a DJ or something.) The OP and ED are pretty good as well. But unfortunately, the rest is mediocre at best. The more orchestral pieces don’t quite stand out or are as memorable as the electronic pieces, but I don’t want to seem more negative than positive in this section. I’ll actually admit something was good in this anime.But all those negatives aside, at least it wasn’t as bad as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry.…Or was it?You know, it’s hard to decide on which is worse. I couldn’t take either anime seriously, but Cavalry still made some attempt at being serious at one point. At least there’s some sort of reason for the shit that’s happening. Asterisk has nothing going on at all! But even if Asterisk did nothing, playing it safe worked to its advantage, because Cavalry’s serious moments are heavily weighed down by the sheer awful, cringe-inducing scenes that infest it. I mean, Asterisk is bad, but it never made me uncomfortable. But Cavalry still did a couple things right, such as the art (mostly) and the romance (to a small extent). Asterisk has a few good songs, and that’s about it. So my overall verdict as to which is worse…Surprising myself a bit, I’m giving that honor to The Asterisk War, mainly based on the fact that it did fuck all to help itself, while Cavalry at least made some legitimate attempt somewhere. And with that settled, I can walk away from this anime with a strange sense of satisfaction: that I was looking for a good match between two terrible anime, and I walked away with an unexpected, but satisfying result. Great job, Asterisk, you actually succeeded in something, by being the Worst One!And that’s all. Full score is below, thanks for… oh god… I just realized something. Invertia didn’t change the morals of the characters, it changed the morals of the writers! And the producers! And whoever the hell else is responsible for this! Oh man, I think it’s gotten to me as well! I went out of my way to watch a bad anime and I was just thankful for it being so terrible! Holy hell, this show is actually genius!Story – 1/10Art – 4/10Sound – 7/10Characters – 1/10Enjoyment – 1/10Overall – 1/10Favorite character – ClaudiaFavorite episode – noneRecommended to – people who want to lower their MAL average scoreCongratulations are in order, for this is my very first 1/10 score. It was originally a 2/10, but after considering things more for this review, I can’t think of any reason to give this anything higher. What did I like? The art was okay but pretty boring, and the soundtrack was pretty nice, but they’re beside me for the most part. If they were actually great and really memorable, like, say, Guilty Crown, then that’d probably let me raise it to a 2 or a 3. But even if GC is a pile of shit beyond the production, at least it made an honest attempt at writing a story and had some legitimately interesting moments. Asterisk has NOTHING that is interesting, whether it’s due to a lack of explanations or just sheer unoriginality. I mean… well, I already wrote the review, so I won’t go back. I guess all that needs to be said is that this anime is pretty ass.terisk.', 'I have a long-standing fascination with The Asterisk War. To most people, the series has been laid to rest these days, but I was new to anime and the anime community when it came out and was the spicy new topic to discuss. It was one of the first times I got to take a side on a hot-button topic of the day - and the *very* first time I got to take a side on a specific series. I liked The Asterisk War. I was team AssWar > Rakudai. I was all in. We got absolutely annihilated in that battle, mind you. Rakudai picked...up a decisive victory in the war of public perception, but to this day I\'m still that guy in whatever Discord server the topic manages to come up in, sitting in my rocking chair and ranting about how Rakudai wasn\'t all that and how much better The Asterisk War was. It\'s reached a point where people just a few years younger than me don’t know what I\'m talking about anymore. I have become an old coot.So, let\'s rewind. To talk about The Asterisk War in a way that means something, we have to put it in the context of 2015. The landscape was different back then - everything was in the process of changing to resemble the anime community we know today, but the new ways of the community were still in their formative stages and the old ways of the community were just beginning to die off. Conversations surrounding non-seasonal anime were declining but still prominent, and the platforms where most people discussed anime were less centralized compared to 2023. MAL, YouTube comments and r/anime were legitimately the most centralized platforms of the time. AniTwit wasn\'t even a term yet, and Discord hadn\'t taken off yet to become the behemoth that it\'d become.This setup lent itself very well towards one form of anime-centric fan content - reviews. Written and video-form reviews benefitted from the less centralized environment, where it was more common to have to seek out other people\'s opinions to engage with your hobby rather than be bombarded with those opinions on your Twitter feed whenever you weren\'t soliciting them or wanting to hear them. It was billboarding an opinion for other people to read and discuss. They still had to be sought out, but it made it much easier to find and seek out opinions on whatever series they were wanting to read or hear more about.The largest platform with the widest possible audience for reviews was - and is - video-form reviews on YouTube. In the early to mid-\'10s, we had content creators like Digibro, Mother\'s Basement and Gigguk that were making content that - for better or worse - had a visible impact on the discourse surrounding a series outside of the anitube bubble. Threads over the latest videos were getting pages and pages worth of discussion and argument on some nook and cranny subreddit, on anime threads on off-topic boards on My Little Pony fansites, and, most importantly to me, over on MAL\'s Anime Discussion board. I\'m not lying when I said the most engaging and heated discussion you could find in this era was in follow-up threads about the latest Digibro video. This anitubing shit mattered back then. People talked about it, and they talked about it with passion.With visible success creating video-form anime reviews came the flood of high school and uni kids who wanted to eschew having to grow up to work a shitty corporate nine-to-five in favor of chasing a dream of making a living by making videos talking about their favorite hobby. The prime garbage people were eating at the time was Sword Art Online videos. It was a worldwide phenomenon back then that came with a loud fanbase and a loud hatebase alike. This made it into a cash cow for creators wanting to rake in easy numbers.However, the market on SAO content was cornered by 2015. Digibro and Mother\'s Basement talked about it enough by themselves to cover for thousands of up-and-coming anitubers. The SAO video review economy was being flooded by a very select few people, and the people doing so were the ones who already had all of the resources and visibility that came along with having an established platform. Nobody was making themselves off of making reviews on that series anymore outside of the people who had reached the top early.Then the Fall 2015 season hits, and with it comes The Asterisk War. A new property with a lot of traits that made it seem like a marketing dream to some production committee at the time. It was part of the newest domestic LN trend of magic high schools, it had a largely international cast that foreign audiences might be able to relate to and enjoy, and it came with a similar-but-safer writing formula that a lot of people had identified about SAO. If the production committee pulling the strings was going to make the next LN global phenomenon in 2015, they saw AssWar as their ticket.The production committee ran with it. It was made a split-cour before the term ""split-cour"" was even a term seeing common use. To folks at the time, it looked like it was an anime that came with a second season announced before the first one had even aired. It came with a gacha game before AL and FGO had made gacha games a massive thing. It had its own shitty PS Vita arena fighter, again, as part of the marketing package. The light novels were speedran for international release by the standards of the day, the valuable marketing tools of OPs and EDs were not skimped on in the slightest, and the production values behind the bulk of the anime were very strong for a 2015 LN harem anime - albeit they just took a much a less creative form of the Ufotable approach by relying heavily on filters and whatnot to make the visuals pop. It even got its own spinoff series about some girls who attended the doofy idol school that always comes in last place. It got shitcanned pretty fast, but I like to imagine that there\'s an alternate timeline where The Asterisk War Cinematic Universe became a thing.Nobody seemed to consider how audiences would react to writing quality. Maybe they saw SAO selling like hotcakes in spite of the critical backlash, maybe they weren\'t even aware of the critical backlash since that was mainly a foreign thing, or maybe they just didn\'t think that quality was important for these kinds of series. I don\'t know. I just know that the Asterisk War and all of its marketing efforts were absolutely torpedoed by flopping with critics and audiences alike on this front. It just wasn\'t good. It didn\'t have the qualities it needed to make fans of this medium latch onto it and care about it. People didn\'t defend it, they didn\'t buy the LNs or play the gacha, and they didn\'t feel pressed to support it even if they did like it. The character writing and storytelling created a series where the standard reaction to it was the series itself being routinely mocked.These elements combined to create a very visible low-hanging fruit, and every young anituber and reviewer looking for their big break 8 years ago made shitty content on this series where they tried way too hard to make this their Sword Art Online. It was open season, too. This was people\'s chance to break out. This was the next bad LN series getting a big marketing push for its anime adaptation. Standards of quality seemed to collapse, and anything and everything that could be mocked was being grasped at. I\'m still haunted by the audio of some kid laughing for about 20 seconds straight because a character in the series is named ""MacPhail,"" since that kind of sounds like ""McFail."" I don’t know how to follow that up. It happened, it’s out there, and it can never be undone.Yet, the greatest failure of The Asterisk War is that the series made nobody. The series never became the next LN phenomenon, so the production committee wasted a bunch of resources in marketing a failed product. Yuu Miyazaki wasn\'t made into the next Reki Kawahara, let alone made into somebody with more meaning than that. I don\'t know of any content creator who made it - let alone sustained any success - by breaking through with their AssWar content. Unlike SAO, it didn\'t generate enough devotion from its few fans to at least elevate it to ""divisive"" status, meaning the loud hatred it received tended to be met with echoes, causing even the hatred to fall off fast due to a lack of interest. It managed to be lost in the void in a way that\'s not much different than the way some dinky OVAs get lost in the void. It inspired a tsunami of hatred that tapered off after a single wave.To the people who even remember it, this series\' legacy is defined either by an already-established content creator making a 13 video series called ""The Asterisk War Sucks,"" or by making Rakudai Kishi no Calvary seem much better than it was when they both came out. Sword Art Online was a divisive success that just fell off with time. The Asterisk War was never anything more than a resounding failure. It\'s gifted kid burnout: the anime. When it was forming up, it looked like it had all of the marketing tools needed to be a massive success, only to fall apart fast and fall apart hard when it went out on its own.Yet, here I am. I\'m still here, 8 years later. I\'m sitting in a room by myself with what\'s now the dead body of a series. Everyone else has left it to rot to the passing of time, whether they hated it or loved it. I was the one who stayed and watched it die. It’s not an exceptional death to have witnessed - the LN series wound up living as a corpse for several years following a sharp decline in sales after the anime adaptation was panned by pretty much everyone, and it got put out of its misery before reaching the intended conclusion because of said low sales. I entered this room in 2015 and I\'ve never left, though. Eulogizing it to an audience of nobody through a review might be my way of stepping out of the room after all this time.Let\'s get something straight - the storytelling of the Asterisk War is hard to talk about because of how little happens. It begins with a couple of small arcs centered around Ayato building his harem by being Mr. helpful nice guy person, followed by a series of tourney arcs, which start later on in the first season of the anime and run all the way through, until the very end of the LNs. The anime ends on the conclusion of the Phoenix Festa tourney arc, but pretty much everything that happens after the anime ends is different tourney arcs. There\'s all of the politics and intrigue surrounding the tourney arcs that every tourney arc in the history of tourney arcs has ever had in their tourney arcs, but at the end of the day they\'re all fairly routine tourney arcs. I hope I\'ve said tourney arcs enough to drill in the point that this whole fucking series is a bunch of different tourney arcs, storywise. I\'m not being hyperbolic with that.They at least have decisive winners, but that decisive winner is always the protagonists, so whatever. It\'s not interesting, and it gets very repetitive the longer the series goes on. What you see in the anime is pretty much AssWar\'s peak in terms of storytelling quality, and it has the added bonus of featuring the very few and far between non-tourney-based storylines at the start.And in a series defined by being nothing except tourney arcs, the fights are very weak. They\'re not ugly and they don\'t skimp on special effects - instead, they\'re just too clean. It\'s the same logic about why the lightsaber duels in the Star Wars prequels fell short of the ones from the original trilogy. In what\'s supposed to be an emotional fight, it\'s so much more human when a character just starts wailing on someone. You don\'t scream in rage or overcome some obstacle and just go into some beautiful exhibition-style swordplay. There\'s emotion in a fight. A fight is its own story inside of a story. At their best, they\'re bloody and raw, not a fucking well done dance routine. The pristine way that AssWar handles its fights furthers a sense of detachment from the characters on the screen, and the main cast\'s characterization already had been doing enough of that by itself to not need the extra help.Which, yes, there\'s a lot more to be said about the characters, albeit that\'s because they tend to have paper-thin personalities and motivations. They are so bad that without proper context being given they could be misinterpreted as a parody of shitty writing. Julis wants to save an orphanage. She starts off as a tsun, is tsundere for like, a teensy bit, then becomes dere noble mchero mcgoodguy and not a totally McFail mcbadguy. She is disgusting in how pure of heart she is. She is like that dorky \'80s teen movie trope of wanting to save the rec center from the evil big money boss and his douchey son who want to bulldoze it to build...something, except even dumber because instead of a rec center, it\'s a fucking orphanage. Orphans are sad and they are being abused, and Julis wants to save the orphans because she is good. Please like Julis.Any good story manipulates your emotions to some extent to make you feel something genuine for the fictional characters involved, but proper manipulation isn\'t hamfisted. This might sound crazy, but saving the orphanage as a motivation to get you to root for a character might just be a little too hamfisted.Now, Ayato is different. It\'s easy to miss if you don\'t think about it because the series itself treats all of this like it\'s normal, but Ayato is a fucking weirdo. He meets Julis, they have a misunderstanding, then a fight, and then he listens to her sob story about wanting to save the orphanage. Following this incredible reveal, he decides to devote pretty much his entire life and being to supporting this girl he barely knows. Do not try this in actual dating. It is less effective than unsolicited dick pics.It works here in fantasyland, though, and in the end it winds up undermining the closest thing we have to a driving motivation in Julis wanting to save the orphanage. During the last tourney arc in the LNs, we get the epic final showdown of Ayato versus Julis. Ayato throws the fight he was winning to her to prove how much he cares or some shit. It doesn\'t say he intentionally loses to her because he wants to go spelunking in the cavern between her legs, but you know he\'s desperate enough based on his character motivations that this has to be his reason. In the biggest tragedy of the entire series, Ayato still does not get laid after losing the fight for a million billion dollars on purpose to impress the girl he\'s not actually dating.Dude really based his whole life around a girl he barely knew, for fuck\'s sake. Just go watch porn or some shit if you just need to get it out of your system. Have some self-respect. He *does* have like, this quest to find his sister who went missing in Rikka or some shit, but it goes on the back burner for most of the series in favor of orphan-saving, and it winds up resolving itself like, oh hey we found her she was trapped by big evil master racist bad man but she\'s fine now and we have her. Boom. Problem solved.Listen, harems are a sex fantasy at the end of the day, even if they\'re not often outright pornographic. Fantasization is normal and healthy. I also don\'t think the guy in the harem tends to matter a whole lot, because I\'m way more worried about the girls. I don\'t care if he\'s weak or lame. I don\'t care if he\'s massively overpowered. I will get annoyed if his story overtakes that of the girls, but that\'s usually the extent of a response a harem MC can elicit from me. Different genres have different sources of appeal to draw an audience in, and the main draw of harem series is in the genre\'s one word, five letter name. However, the best possible interpretations people could make of Ayato\'s character were the ones during the flood of dull review content from 2015 where they complained about how bland and nothing his character was. If you think about him for too long, though, Ayato just becomes depressing to look at.In a bold stylistic decision to completely misunderstand romance and relationships, Ayato comes across like he\'s some sort of dude who has no confidence with women, and thinks that he can win them over them by making them his everything when in reality their relationship is only at a stage of talking and maybe flirting a bit. This somehow works out for him, sort of. I don\'t really think depression and sex fantasies make a good cocktail, and the way Ayato handles his relationship is very representative of a lot of awkward and unfortunate guys out there who totally jump the gun and think they have to act this way to prove themselves to someone. I kind of just want him to get better, but not in a way that has me rooting for him as much as pitying him.Kirin is the closest thing we have to a main character with a functioning ongoing story rather than just being a tagalong at best or having a lame-ass motivation at worst. Kirin\'s story is a bit about breaking out of a controlling/abusive power dynamic. I\'m glad the abuser is framed as an actual abuser and not as a well-intentioned dickhead like I feel I\'ve seen far too often with dickhead parental figures in anime, but the fact that this is my highest praise for her character story isn\'t a good thing. ""Hey portraying a serious problem normally and without being offensive"" isn\'t a strong statement - it’s the bare minimum. Following her little coming-out-of-her-shell arc, she becomes something closer to a small, cute animal rather than a human in behavior and mannerisms, so it was all for nothing because she goes right into the rubbish bin long term. I also find her gross to look at. Don\'t like the loli-big boobs combo. Never have.The villains are all like, setting-based Nazis or some shit. Racial supremacists, but the race are the people with the super powers. It\'s not interesting. There\'s one dude you see in the anime, Dirk, who doesn\'t have any powers but is still a powers-based racial supremacist. He\'s also ugly but in a way that seems intentional to make you dislike him on a shallow level as well as because he\'s such a rat bastard, but I find him more physically attractive than Kirin. I\'m not into men and I say that with absolute certainty.Other than that, my favorite characters are ones I tend to enjoy for very strong reasons in an ecchi anime, i.e. I usually like them for their tits. However, do not be fooled - AssWar is not an ecchi. It\'s tagged as an ecchi here on MAL, but in implementation it just has a fanservice bit every few episodes during the first season, and by the second season the fanservice gets phased out almost entirely. You cannot watch AssWar as an ecchi. It will disappoint.I want to end the character talk on a good note, though. I think Saya Sasamiya is the high point of characterization in the series, and not just relative to a weak cast, either. She\'s not the hottest character ever - too loli for my taste - but I\'d place her on the strong side of kuudere characters in anime as a whole. The archetype isn\'t my cup of tea, but Saya is the comic relief of the cast in a way that comes off per the character\'s intent rather than as a byproduct of her dull tone and demeanor.The best joke in the series is when this arrogant idol-school chick is talking herself up prior to a duel with Saya, and Saya just blasts her away before she finishes her speech. The second best joke is when Ayato walks in all of them changing, and everyone is flustered, as per the norm. \'Cept Saya, who just takes the most casual, ""yo waddup ayato how\'s it going"" reaction to the situation, seeming to be aware of how this should be an embarrassing situation for everyone involved but instead just treating it like it\'s as normal as bumping into your friend in the hallway. It manages to both defuse the situation and set it apart from other uses of the scenario to have the joke come across as fresh, without coming across like it\'s trying to be self-aware. I can buy into the idea that it\'s just Saya being Saya, and that\'s why she\'s is the bright spot in this cast.It\'s not a type/role match that\'s unique to her, but it\'s the best I\'ve seen it handled in the details. Kuudere humor tends to be either laughing at them for their awkwardness and finding it cute, or them making sarcastic remarks about the absurd situations the rest of the cast is in, but in the glory of monotone. Saya is just a silly, fun person who happens to speak in monotone. She\'s animated, she\'s emotive (for her archetype), her style of humor is hers, and her being a kuudere is just pretty much the way she speaks and the fact she has a thing for Ayato to make her -dere. Her archetype is additive to her comedy as a character and gives her flavor, but it doesn\'t dominate her entire existence. This culminates in making her feel less like the butt of the jokes or like she cannot stand being around these people, but more like she\'s the life of the group and a great enhancement to what\'s otherwise a pretty weak cast dynamic. Sometimes, even writers who cannot write for shit manage to do stuff right. Good job, Yuu Miyazaki.As a whole, though, AssWar doesn\'t understand that heroes need something to make an audience want to cheer for them. The heroes are so strictly good that they feel intangible. I do believe you can get away with bland heroes whenever they go against memorable and interesting villains for an audience to enjoy hating, but AssWar\'s villains are as hardtack as its heroes. The only people I felt any form of investment in were Saya - because Saya is just cool as shit - and any girl with nice tits not named Kirin. I don\'t care about anything else with these characters.Now, this should all seem weird. I\'m ripping on AssWar quite a bit. I opened up talking about how much I like this series and now I\'m mocking the writing. I do like this series, though. I promise. It\'s not an ironic enjoyment, either - I love it.I do think the character writing and storytelling are awful, and because of this it\'s easy to see why it was such a flop. People want great characters and strong stories in this medium. It\'s why they\'re here, and if a story and its characters fail to deliver there is nothing wrong with expressing your dislike for having wasted your time with it. Asterisk War tries to tell a story that it places front and center so you can\'t really argue that the intent isn\'t as much.I am an ecchi fan, though. If my existence as a fan was defined by basing my views on any given series by having a rigid need to weigh those two aspects of a series above everything else, I couldn\'t be an ecchi fan. I\'m very open to disregarding them entirely if there\'s stuff I like a lot more, and AssWar redeems itself to me through the one strength it has - the setting concept.Follow along with me here. If you played videogames when you were younger, did you ever do dumb shit like try to walk around like your character was just one of the people who lived in the setting? I remember when I was a kid and playing Wild Arms on the first Playstation, I\'d stop and do that in the starting village all the time. I\'d stop at bales of hay and act like my character was gathering them and then I\'d take them over to the area with the horses, like I was giving the horses their hay for the day. Then I\'d walk around, talk to people who said the same lines, then head up to the bedroom where it let me save. The sleep song would play, and I\'d get my character out of bed and repeat my task of feeding the village horses the next day. When I revisited Wild Arms as an adult I found that it isn\'t an exceptional game, but when you\'re a little kid everything seems so magical about this fantasy and fiction stuff that you just want to get lost in it all.As people get older, that sense of mysticism and excitement in everything begins to wear off. We get bags under our eyes, we experience a lot more of the negative parts of the world and life, and we deal with bullshit we\'d rather not have to but are forced to just to be able to function on a day-to-day basis. Those feelings fade into this memory that we call nostalgia. It\'s a powerful thing when it gets combined with the stresses of life as an adult. This sense of longing for things to feel that way again, for everything to be exciting and to capture your imagination like it used to.I feel like it\'s very rare, but as adults, I believe we can still interact with media that manages to recreate that sense of wonder and excitement that we felt when we were kids. Media that captures our imagination to the point where we\'re getting caught up in minutiae, not just wondering what\'ll happen next in the story. To date, the only media I\'ve experienced as an adult that has managed to capture my imagination to this extent was The Asterisk War and its worldbuilding.So, a long ass time ago in-setting but well into the future for us real-life lads, Earth was struck with some magical meteor shower or some shit, and these magical meteors caused the next generation to begin experiencing births of super people who could do magic and shit. Blah blah blah, the city of Rikka was built in one of the meteor impact craters to house them and hold super-powered magic techno-fighting tournaments that the rest of the world could watch as a sport.Now, Rikka has six schools that run from middle school through university, and these schools have different ethos attached to them that they expect their students to uphold, kind of like the D&D alignment system or the fucking weird ass Harry Potter Hat with a face - the student\'s personal values being reflected by which school they attend.To give a runthrough of each one, there\'s Seidoukan, which is more or less the protagonist syndrome school for the neutral good characters. This is where the heroes of the main story all attend. There\'s Le Wolfe, which believes in Social Darwinism, and it\'s as edgy as you\'d expect upon hearing that as their ethos. No teamwork, advance at all costs, prove you’re the strongest because survival of the fittest, yadda yadda. This is the school for all of the Shadow the Hedgehog and Sephiroth fans out there.Then there’s St. Galahadsworth, which is the lawful good school where the students are forbidden from dueling and are expected to uphold a strict code of chivalry. Arlequint - my personal favorite - is the mad scientist, always playing-with-syringes school where the students are expected to always foster innovation and stand at the forefront of weapons development, complete with a student section comprising of human guinea pigs to test out the experiments on and do the actual fighting for the nerds in the lab coats. Jie Long, which is somewhat similar to Galahadsworth but without the focus on Western-style chivalry and instead a greater focus on things like self-improvement and martial arts, kind of like the Bruce Lee school or some shit. Jie Long is not as demanding to be lawful good, either, it’s chaotic and all over the spectrum. Last and least there\'s Queensvail, which is an all-girls school focused on producing idols and entertainers above all else, so if you’re a pretty girl who wants to sing or something I guess you can go there and get last in every event.In these schools, they have different disciplines of magic unique to them that students can learn like Jie Long\'s Taoist style magic, and various weapons called Orga Luxes that have mystical properties that can interact with the user that the weapon itself will choose, for better or for worse depending on what weapon it is. It can grant the user new abilities they previously didn\'t have access to, it can damage the users psychological state, so on and so forth - each being different and giving different boons or maluses depending on the weapon’s temperament.It is game world worldbuilding, and that\'s not super distinct in of itself in the world of light novels. What sets it apart is in the details - it\'s not JRPG videogame worldbuilding. It\'s a magic sci-fi city, complete with its own values systems stemming from the strange society that\'s been built up through the lore of the land the series actually takes place in and treats as real, with its own list of things like legendary weapons that\'s left open-ended enough for the viewers to get creative with on their own, rather than having a set of in-game rules that the worldbuilding itself is forced to abide by. Underlying the trite story the series tells is a setting with the potential for a lot to be done, ranging from ideological and ethical conflicts, to treasure seeking, to magical fantasy shit, to sci-fi techno shit. The worldbuilding made a point of incorporating things like personal values and beliefs in tandem with all of this rather than just being another demon king story or something just fucking fascist like Mahouka, too. I felt invited to make my own characters with their own values and come up with special weapons that had unique properties for them to use.The series itself - anime and LNs - does a good job at showcasing its worldbuilding. It doesn’t drop into textbook exposition too often and will take time and care to show certain facets of the worldbuilding through actions. A good example is when we see McFail try to use the Orga Luxe that winds up going to piss boy MC. It’s such a simple sequence - characters are going into the vault to try out Seidoukan’s collection of legendary weapons. Señor McFail walks up and try to use one, but the weapon itself rejects him. Later it becomes piss boy MC’s legendary weapon, but this small sequence showcases the idea that the main weapons all the top folks in this system use accept or reject those who try to wield them. We also get droplets of it through the main storyline, such as when they were trying to deduce which school sent in a spy to infiltrate them. They break it down in ways like “No, it’s not likely that St. Galahadsworth would result to these kinds of tactics, they have a certain image to maintain” to give a rudimentary idea of which schools of magic lie where on the values and ethics spectrum.It’s not some impressive feat of writing as much as it is just good execution, but it does a good job of drip-feeding this kind of info to the viewer without relying *too* much on exposition - it’s not perfect, but relative to the norm in anime it’s a cut above. This is what caused me to get so wrapped up in this series. I wanted to have my own character in this world, and when I watched it for the first time when I was 18, I made one. He was going to be a student at the Renaissance Europe-styled school of St. Galahadsworth whose characterization was going to be inspired by Galileo Galilei\'s conflicts with the church over his contributions to astronomy conflicting with religious doctrine, E pur si muove style. He was going to be so fucking cool and rebellious inside of a heavily controlled and legalistic environment, and he was going to get to bang Shenhua and be a bit of a villain who strays from the path of the super good guy school, and it was going to be awesome. I was so engrossed with thoughts like this that I kept watching the series so I could learn more and more so I could incorporate it into my own little story I was coming up with that\'d use the setting. I\'m not going to pretend like I think it would\'ve been good with the power of hindsight, but give me a break. I was having a lot of fun coming up with this shit.Dorky. Cringey. Fucking awesome. I love how much the Asterisk War was able to engage me on this level. This is one of the best ways to get wrapped up in something to me, where you\'re imagining your own characters and stories and getting to thinking about dumbass little details about what weapons they\'d use, how they\'d look, what their room and social life would be like, so on and so forth. That feeling of imagination and wonderment is a powerful connection to make with a series, and I kept paying attention to little details that were just so inviting to that sense of wonder that I found myself falling into this weird rabbit hole of AssWar lore. I even own physical copies of the volumes of the LNs that’ve been released. I bought them for fucking research at first. I didn\'t sit down and read the LNs until half a decade later. When I was so into this series, I used them for the comprehensive glossary of terms and concepts about the setting the first volume came with, or I skimmed through them to pick up lore tidbits, or just to look at the map of Rikka they came with where it described the schools and their various facets and guiding principles. To me, that’s appreciating something on a level that not many things can succeed in evoking. The Asterisk War, somehow, was the series that did for me.When I did sit down to actually read the LNs cover to cover, I was a proper adult with 5 years of experience in the workforce. This is when it all clicked together. I came to understand that this husk of a series wasn\'t a failed franchise, but someone’s dead dream. The anime was very corporate in its presentation and marketing, sure, and the LNs became a total lazy mess later on in their run before receiving what I can only describe as a mercy-killing cancellation, but what’s stuck with me more than anything about this series is the author’s note in the very first volume of the light novels.In it, Yuu Miyazaki doesn\'t talk about how much he loves animation and storytelling and what anime and manga he was a fan of that inspired him to make AssWar. Instead, he expresses his love of tabletop RPGs. When he was younger and didn\'t have a friend group to play them with yet, he\'d have his parents buy him RPG manuals he could read. He used to love reading Dungeons & Dragons and Warhammer game manuals for the setting details in them, to get lost in their worlds and lore and history, to let his imagination take over and see where things guided him. In this note, Miyazaki claims a wide variety of these game manuals as his inspirations, and states that his goal with Asterisk War was to create a series that people could create their own characters for and become its own tabletop RPG someday.The Asterisk War was never meant to be a light novel. It was meant to be a setting for an RPG people could make their own stories with and go on adventures with their friends in. This is a stated intent dating from before the anime’s release. Yet, somehow - and I don\'t know how - it wound up as a light novel series instead, and a light novel series and its fans demand some sort of a story to get engrossed in rather than one they make themselves. In this case, the story they received was a story written by someone who didn\'t care about and wasn\'t interested writing a story to begin with. Even if effort is expended, if the intent and desire isn\'t there, it\'ll fail to connect with the audience. This was its undoing, and yet aspects about the setting that Yuu Miyazaki had created made it appear to some suits on a production committee like the next big thing they could market to create the next Sword Art Online.This opened its shortcomings up to widespread attention, and those shortcomings caused the series to be met with intense mockery. People online would rip this series apart tooth and nail. They themselves were out for blood in trying to create their own next SAO. I remember back when people still talked about AssWar, I\'d watch randos in threads stoop to petty things like berating the author\'s appearance and ascribing personal faults to him as a human being for having the audacity to write an inoffensive, if dull, story as a vessel for his setting to be published. Years later, I remember thinking about how much Miyazaki was attacked as a person for writing AssWar when I was following the Ruroni Kenshin drama. People were far more accepting of an actual pedophile in Ruroni Kenshin\'s mangaka than they were of some dude who just wrote a bad story that it seems like he didn\'t even want to write, and that\'s just...heartbreaking, really.As the LNs continued beyond the anime, they became less and less energetic. Even if the writing before wasn\'t great, I think it at least tried to highlight the setting as best it could before even that fell away as the series went on deeper into its neverending tourney arcs, and there was even some good character writing at points like I saw with Saya. Hell, even Kirin\'s story with her Uncle tried to do something with familial abuse and pushing children too hard, and even if it wasn\'t much, it at least handled it far more tactfully than I\'d have expected. It was bad, but it wasn\'t lazy.With time, the starry-eyed excitement of that first author\'s note that was hoping it\'d become the tabletop RPG it was always meant to be was depleted, with the author’s notes becoming more and more brief with each passing volume before they stopped all together at a certain point. The story and art inside of the LNs derailed, better exemplifying a lack of motivation in creativity than anything that was adapted into the anime could. It wasn’t good. It wasn’t trying to achieve anything anymore. It was going through the motions as much as that could entail.The Asterisk War died quietly, to no fanfare or mourning, just a little under a year ago as of this review. It was a bad story with bad characters, but it was this way because this wasn\'t what it was supposed to be in the first place. It was in the wrong medium. I don\'t know how it got here and how things wound up this way, but I\'m convinced the AssWar would be better if it was never LN or an anime to begin with. Maybe there\'s a timeline out there where it managed to spread its wings and be the tabletop RPG it was always meant to be, and there’s groups of friends going on adventures with their characters in their little anime magic school game. In our universe, though, it all failed with a short drop and a sudden stop. I can\'t escape the feeling I\'m the last person leaving the room where we watched someone\'s dream die in real time, and that\'s a bitter taste to have to swallow.With that, I leave this room and close the door behind me. For better or worse, I had fun. Shine on, you crazy diamond. I mean it when I say that I wish that it had all gone differently for you. up a decisive victory in the war of public perception, but to this day I\'m still that guy in whatever Discord server the topic manages to come up in, sitting in my rocking chair and ranting about how Rakudai wasn\'t all that and how much better The Asterisk War was. It\'s reached a point where people just a few years younger than me don’t know what I\'m talking about anymore. I have become an old coot.So, let\'s rewind. To talk about The Asterisk War in a way that means something, we have to put it in the context of 2015. The landscape was different back then - everything was in the process of changing to resemble the anime community we know today, but the new ways of the community were still in their formative stages and the old ways of the community were just beginning to die off. Conversations surrounding non-seasonal anime were declining but still prominent, and the platforms where most people discussed anime were less centralized compared to 2023. MAL, YouTube comments and r/anime were legitimately the most centralized platforms of the time. AniTwit wasn\'t even a term yet, and Discord hadn\'t taken off yet to become the behemoth that it\'d become.This setup lent itself very well towards one form of anime-centric fan content - reviews. Written and video-form reviews benefitted from the less centralized environment, where it was more common to have to seek out other people\'s opinions to engage with your hobby rather than be bombarded with those opinions on your Twitter feed whenever you weren\'t soliciting them or wanting to hear them. It was billboarding an opinion for other people to read and discuss. They still had to be sought out, but it made it much easier to find and seek out opinions on whatever series they were wanting to read or hear more about.The largest platform with the widest possible audience for reviews was - and is - video-form reviews on YouTube. In the early to mid-\'10s, we had content creators like Digibro, Mother\'s Basement and Gigguk that were making content that - for better or worse - had a visible impact on the discourse surrounding a series outside of the anitube bubble. Threads over the latest videos were getting pages and pages worth of discussion and argument on some nook and cranny subreddit, on anime threads on off-topic boards on My Little Pony fansites, and, most importantly to me, over on MAL\'s Anime Discussion board. I\'m not lying when I said the most engaging and heated discussion you could find in this era was in follow-up threads about the latest Digibro video. This anitubing shit mattered back then. People talked about it, and they talked about it with passion.With visible success creating video-form anime reviews came the flood of high school and uni kids who wanted to eschew having to grow up to work a shitty corporate nine-to-five in favor of chasing a dream of making a living by making videos talking about their favorite hobby. The prime garbage people were eating at the time was Sword Art Online videos. It was a worldwide phenomenon back then that came with a loud fanbase and a loud hatebase alike. This made it into a cash cow for creators wanting to rake in easy numbers.However, the market on SAO content was cornered by 2015. Digibro and Mother\'s Basement talked about it enough by themselves to cover for thousands of up-and-coming anitubers. The SAO video review economy was being flooded by a very select few people, and the people doing so were the ones who already had all of the resources and visibility that came along with having an established platform. Nobody was making themselves off of making reviews on that series anymore outside of the people who had reached the top early.Then the Fall 2015 season hits, and with it comes The Asterisk War. A new property with a lot of traits that made it seem like a marketing dream to some production committee at the time. It was part of the newest domestic LN trend of magic high schools, it had a largely international cast that foreign audiences might be able to relate to and enjoy, and it came with a similar-but-safer writing formula that a lot of people had identified about SAO. If the production committee pulling the strings was going to make the next LN global phenomenon in 2015, they saw AssWar as their ticket.The production committee ran with it. It was made a split-cour before the term ""split-cour"" was even a term seeing common use. To folks at the time, it looked like it was an anime that came with a second season announced before the first one had even aired. It came with a gacha game before AL and FGO had made gacha games a massive thing. It had its own shitty PS Vita arena fighter, again, as part of the marketing package. The light novels were speedran for international release by the standards of the day, the valuable marketing tools of OPs and EDs were not skimped on in the slightest, and the production values behind the bulk of the anime were very strong for a 2015 LN harem anime - albeit they just took a much a less creative form of the Ufotable approach by relying heavily on filters and whatnot to make the visuals pop. It even got its own spinoff series about some girls who attended the doofy idol school that always comes in last place. It got shitcanned pretty fast, but I like to imagine that there\'s an alternate timeline where The Asterisk War Cinematic Universe became a thing.Nobody seemed to consider how audiences would react to writing quality. Maybe they saw SAO selling like hotcakes in spite of the critical backlash, maybe they weren\'t even aware of the critical backlash since that was mainly a foreign thing, or maybe they just didn\'t think that quality was important for these kinds of series. I don\'t know. I just know that the Asterisk War and all of its marketing efforts were absolutely torpedoed by flopping with critics and audiences alike on this front. It just wasn\'t good. It didn\'t have the qualities it needed to make fans of this medium latch onto it and care about it. People didn\'t defend it, they didn\'t buy the LNs or play the gacha, and they didn\'t feel pressed to support it even if they did like it. The character writing and storytelling created a series where the standard reaction to it was the series itself being routinely mocked.These elements combined to create a very visible low-hanging fruit, and every young anituber and reviewer looking for their big break 8 years ago made shitty content on this series where they tried way too hard to make this their Sword Art Online. It was open season, too. This was people\'s chance to break out. This was the next bad LN series getting a big marketing push for its anime adaptation. Standards of quality seemed to collapse, and anything and everything that could be mocked was being grasped at. I\'m still haunted by the audio of some kid laughing for about 20 seconds straight because a character in the series is named ""MacPhail,"" since that kind of sounds like ""McFail."" I don’t know how to follow that up. It happened, it’s out there, and it can never be undone.Yet, the greatest failure of The Asterisk War is that the series made nobody. The series never became the next LN phenomenon, so the production committee wasted a bunch of resources in marketing a failed product. Yuu Miyazaki wasn\'t made into the next Reki Kawahara, let alone made into somebody with more meaning than that. I don\'t know of any content creator who made it - let alone sustained any success - by breaking through with their AssWar content. Unlike SAO, it didn\'t generate enough devotion from its few fans to at least elevate it to ""divisive"" status, meaning the loud hatred it received tended to be met with echoes, causing even the hatred to fall off fast due to a lack of interest. It managed to be lost in the void in a way that\'s not much different than the way some dinky OVAs get lost in the void. It inspired a tsunami of hatred that tapered off after a single wave.To the people who even remember it, this series\' legacy is defined either by an already-established content creator making a 13 video series called ""The Asterisk War Sucks,"" or by making Rakudai Kishi no Calvary seem much better than it was when they both came out. Sword Art Online was a divisive success that just fell off with time. The Asterisk War was never anything more than a resounding failure. It\'s gifted kid burnout: the anime. When it was forming up, it looked like it had all of the marketing tools needed to be a massive success, only to fall apart fast and fall apart hard when it went out on its own.Yet, here I am. I\'m still here, 8 years later. I\'m sitting in a room by myself with what\'s now the dead body of a series. Everyone else has left it to rot to the passing of time, whether they hated it or loved it. I was the one who stayed and watched it die. It’s not an exceptional death to have witnessed - the LN series wound up living as a corpse for several years following a sharp decline in sales after the anime adaptation was panned by pretty much everyone, and it got put out of its misery before reaching the intended conclusion because of said low sales. I entered this room in 2015 and I\'ve never left, though. Eulogizing it to an audience of nobody through a review might be my way of stepping out of the room after all this time.Let\'s get something straight - the storytelling of the Asterisk War is hard to talk about because of how little happens. It begins with a couple of small arcs centered around Ayato building his harem by being Mr. helpful nice guy person, followed by a series of tourney arcs, which start later on in the first season of the anime and run all the way through, until the very end of the LNs. The anime ends on the conclusion of the Phoenix Festa tourney arc, but pretty much everything that happens after the anime ends is different tourney arcs. There\'s all of the politics and intrigue surrounding the tourney arcs that every tourney arc in the history of tourney arcs has ever had in their tourney arcs, but at the end of the day they\'re all fairly routine tourney arcs. I hope I\'ve said tourney arcs enough to drill in the point that this whole fucking series is a bunch of different tourney arcs, storywise. I\'m not being hyperbolic with that.They at least have decisive winners, but that decisive winner is always the protagonists, so whatever. It\'s not interesting, and it gets very repetitive the longer the series goes on. What you see in the anime is pretty much AssWar\'s peak in terms of storytelling quality, and it has the added bonus of featuring the very few and far between non-tourney-based storylines at the start.And in a series defined by being nothing except tourney arcs, the fights are very weak. They\'re not ugly and they don\'t skimp on special effects - instead, they\'re just too clean. It\'s the same logic about why the lightsaber duels in the Star Wars prequels fell short of the ones from the original trilogy. In what\'s supposed to be an emotional fight, it\'s so much more human when a character just starts wailing on someone. You don\'t scream in rage or overcome some obstacle and just go into some beautiful exhibition-style swordplay. There\'s emotion in a fight. A fight is its own story inside of a story. At their best, they\'re bloody and raw, not a fucking well done dance routine. The pristine way that AssWar handles its fights furthers a sense of detachment from the characters on the screen, and the main cast\'s characterization already had been doing enough of that by itself to not need the extra help.Which, yes, there\'s a lot more to be said about the characters, albeit that\'s because they tend to have paper-thin personalities and motivations. They are so bad that without proper context being given they could be misinterpreted as a parody of shitty writing. Julis wants to save an orphanage. She starts off as a tsun, is tsundere for like, a teensy bit, then becomes dere noble mchero mcgoodguy and not a totally McFail mcbadguy. She is disgusting in how pure of heart she is. She is like that dorky \'80s teen movie trope of wanting to save the rec center from the evil big money boss and his douchey son who want to bulldoze it to build...something, except even dumber because instead of a rec center, it\'s a fucking orphanage. Orphans are sad and they are being abused, and Julis wants to save the orphans because she is good. Please like Julis.Any good story manipulates your emotions to some extent to make you feel something genuine for the fictional characters involved, but proper manipulation isn\'t hamfisted. This might sound crazy, but saving the orphanage as a motivation to get you to root for a character might just be a little too hamfisted.Now, Ayato is different. It\'s easy to miss if you don\'t think about it because the series itself treats all of this like it\'s normal, but Ayato is a fucking weirdo. He meets Julis, they have a misunderstanding, then a fight, and then he listens to her sob story about wanting to save the orphanage. Following this incredible reveal, he decides to devote pretty much his entire life and being to supporting this girl he barely knows. Do not try this in actual dating. It is less effective than unsolicited dick pics.It works here in fantasyland, though, and in the end it winds up undermining the closest thing we have to a driving motivation in Julis wanting to save the orphanage. During the last tourney arc in the LNs, we get the epic final showdown of Ayato versus Julis. Ayato throws the fight he was winning to her to prove how much he cares or some shit. It doesn\'t say he intentionally loses to her because he wants to go spelunking in the cavern between her legs, but you know he\'s desperate enough based on his character motivations that this has to be his reason. In the biggest tragedy of the entire series, Ayato still does not get laid after losing the fight for a million billion dollars on purpose to impress the girl he\'s not actually dating.Dude really based his whole life around a girl he barely knew, for fuck\'s sake. Just go watch porn or some shit if you just need to get it out of your system. Have some self-respect. He *does* have like, this quest to find his sister who went missing in Rikka or some shit, but it goes on the back burner for most of the series in favor of orphan-saving, and it winds up resolving itself like, oh hey we found her she was trapped by big evil master racist bad man but she\'s fine now and we have her. Boom. Problem solved.Listen, harems are a sex fantasy at the end of the day, even if they\'re not often outright pornographic. Fantasization is normal and healthy. I also don\'t think the guy in the harem tends to matter a whole lot, because I\'m way more worried about the girls. I don\'t care if he\'s weak or lame. I don\'t care if he\'s massively overpowered. I will get annoyed if his story overtakes that of the girls, but that\'s usually the extent of a response a harem MC can elicit from me. Different genres have different sources of appeal to draw an audience in, and the main draw of harem series is in the genre\'s one word, five letter name. However, the best possible interpretations people could make of Ayato\'s character were the ones during the flood of dull review content from 2015 where they complained about how bland and nothing his character was. If you think about him for too long, though, Ayato just becomes depressing to look at.In a bold stylistic decision to completely misunderstand romance and relationships, Ayato comes across like he\'s some sort of dude who has no confidence with women, and thinks that he can win them over them by making them his everything when in reality their relationship is only at a stage of talking and maybe flirting a bit. This somehow works out for him, sort of. I don\'t really think depression and sex fantasies make a good cocktail, and the way Ayato handles his relationship is very representative of a lot of awkward and unfortunate guys out there who totally jump the gun and think they have to act this way to prove themselves to someone. I kind of just want him to get better, but not in a way that has me rooting for him as much as pitying him.Kirin is the closest thing we have to a main character with a functioning ongoing story rather than just being a tagalong at best or having a lame-ass motivation at worst. Kirin\'s story is a bit about breaking out of a controlling/abusive power dynamic. I\'m glad the abuser is framed as an actual abuser and not as a well-intentioned dickhead like I feel I\'ve seen far too often with dickhead parental figures in anime, but the fact that this is my highest praise for her character story isn\'t a good thing. ""Hey portraying a serious problem normally and without being offensive"" isn\'t a strong statement - it’s the bare minimum. Following her little coming-out-of-her-shell arc, she becomes something closer to a small, cute animal rather than a human in behavior and mannerisms, so it was all for nothing because she goes right into the rubbish bin long term. I also find her gross to look at. Don\'t like the loli-big boobs combo. Never have.The villains are all like, setting-based Nazis or some shit. Racial supremacists, but the race are the people with the super powers. It\'s not interesting. There\'s one dude you see in the anime, Dirk, who doesn\'t have any powers but is still a powers-based racial supremacist. He\'s also ugly but in a way that seems intentional to make you dislike him on a shallow level as well as because he\'s such a rat bastard, but I find him more physically attractive than Kirin. I\'m not into men and I say that with absolute certainty.Other than that, my favorite characters are ones I tend to enjoy for very strong reasons in an ecchi anime, i.e. I usually like them for their tits. However, do not be fooled - AssWar is not an ecchi. It\'s tagged as an ecchi here on MAL, but in implementation it just has a fanservice bit every few episodes during the first season, and by the second season the fanservice gets phased out almost entirely. You cannot watch AssWar as an ecchi. It will disappoint.I want to end the character talk on a good note, though. I think Saya Sasamiya is the high point of characterization in the series, and not just relative to a weak cast, either. She\'s not the hottest character ever - too loli for my taste - but I\'d place her on the strong side of kuudere characters in anime as a whole. The archetype isn\'t my cup of tea, but Saya is the comic relief of the cast in a way that comes off per the character\'s intent rather than as a byproduct of her dull tone and demeanor.The best joke in the series is when this arrogant idol-school chick is talking herself up prior to a duel with Saya, and Saya just blasts her away before she finishes her speech. The second best joke is when Ayato walks in all of them changing, and everyone is flustered, as per the norm. \'Cept Saya, who just takes the most casual, ""yo waddup ayato how\'s it going"" reaction to the situation, seeming to be aware of how this should be an embarrassing situation for everyone involved but instead just treating it like it\'s as normal as bumping into your friend in the hallway. It manages to both defuse the situation and set it apart from other uses of the scenario to have the joke come across as fresh, without coming across like it\'s trying to be self-aware. I can buy into the idea that it\'s just Saya being Saya, and that\'s why she\'s is the bright spot in this cast.It\'s not a type/role match that\'s unique to her, but it\'s the best I\'ve seen it handled in the details. Kuudere humor tends to be either laughing at them for their awkwardness and finding it cute, or them making sarcastic remarks about the absurd situations the rest of the cast is in, but in the glory of monotone. Saya is just a silly, fun person who happens to speak in monotone. She\'s animated, she\'s emotive (for her archetype), her style of humor is hers, and her being a kuudere is just pretty much the way she speaks and the fact she has a thing for Ayato to make her -dere. Her archetype is additive to her comedy as a character and gives her flavor, but it doesn\'t dominate her entire existence. This culminates in making her feel less like the butt of the jokes or like she cannot stand being around these people, but more like she\'s the life of the group and a great enhancement to what\'s otherwise a pretty weak cast dynamic. Sometimes, even writers who cannot write for shit manage to do stuff right. Good job, Yuu Miyazaki.As a whole, though, AssWar doesn\'t understand that heroes need something to make an audience want to cheer for them. The heroes are so strictly good that they feel intangible. I do believe you can get away with bland heroes whenever they go against memorable and interesting villains for an audience to enjoy hating, but AssWar\'s villains are as hardtack as its heroes. The only people I felt any form of investment in were Saya - because Saya is just cool as shit - and any girl with nice tits not named Kirin. I don\'t care about anything else with these characters.Now, this should all seem weird. I\'m ripping on AssWar quite a bit. I opened up talking about how much I like this series and now I\'m mocking the writing. I do like this series, though. I promise. It\'s not an ironic enjoyment, either - I love it.I do think the character writing and storytelling are awful, and because of this it\'s easy to see why it was such a flop. People want great characters and strong stories in this medium. It\'s why they\'re here, and if a story and its characters fail to deliver there is nothing wrong with expressing your dislike for having wasted your time with it. Asterisk War tries to tell a story that it places front and center so you can\'t really argue that the intent isn\'t as much.I am an ecchi fan, though. If my existence as a fan was defined by basing my views on any given series by having a rigid need to weigh those two aspects of a series above everything else, I couldn\'t be an ecchi fan. I\'m very open to disregarding them entirely if there\'s stuff I like a lot more, and AssWar redeems itself to me through the one strength it has - the setting concept.Follow along with me here. If you played videogames when you were younger, did you ever do dumb shit like try to walk around like your character was just one of the people who lived in the setting? I remember when I was a kid and playing Wild Arms on the first Playstation, I\'d stop and do that in the starting village all the time. I\'d stop at bales of hay and act like my character was gathering them and then I\'d take them over to the area with the horses, like I was giving the horses their hay for the day. Then I\'d walk around, talk to people who said the same lines, then head up to the bedroom where it let me save. The sleep song would play, and I\'d get my character out of bed and repeat my task of feeding the village horses the next day. When I revisited Wild Arms as an adult I found that it isn\'t an exceptional game, but when you\'re a little kid everything seems so magical about this fantasy and fiction stuff that you just want to get lost in it all.As people get older, that sense of mysticism and excitement in everything begins to wear off. We get bags under our eyes, we experience a lot more of the negative parts of the world and life, and we deal with bullshit we\'d rather not have to but are forced to just to be able to function on a day-to-day basis. Those feelings fade into this memory that we call nostalgia. It\'s a powerful thing when it gets combined with the stresses of life as an adult. This sense of longing for things to feel that way again, for everything to be exciting and to capture your imagination like it used to.I feel like it\'s very rare, but as adults, I believe we can still interact with media that manages to recreate that sense of wonder and excitement that we felt when we were kids. Media that captures our imagination to the point where we\'re getting caught up in minutiae, not just wondering what\'ll happen next in the story. To date, the only media I\'ve experienced as an adult that has managed to capture my imagination to this extent was The Asterisk War and its worldbuilding.So, a long ass time ago in-setting but well into the future for us real-life lads, Earth was struck with some magical meteor shower or some shit, and these magical meteors caused the next generation to begin experiencing births of super people who could do magic and shit. Blah blah blah, the city of Rikka was built in one of the meteor impact craters to house them and hold super-powered magic techno-fighting tournaments that the rest of the world could watch as a sport.Now, Rikka has six schools that run from middle school through university, and these schools have different ethos attached to them that they expect their students to uphold, kind of like the D&D alignment system or the fucking weird ass Harry Potter Hat with a face - the student\'s personal values being reflected by which school they attend.To give a runthrough of each one, there\'s Seidoukan, which is more or less the protagonist syndrome school for the neutral good characters. This is where the heroes of the main story all attend. There\'s Le Wolfe, which believes in Social Darwinism, and it\'s as edgy as you\'d expect upon hearing that as their ethos. No teamwork, advance at all costs, prove you’re the strongest because survival of the fittest, yadda yadda. This is the school for all of the Shadow the Hedgehog and Sephiroth fans out there.Then there’s St. Galahadsworth, which is the lawful good school where the students are forbidden from dueling and are expected to uphold a strict code of chivalry. Arlequint - my personal favorite - is the mad scientist, always playing-with-syringes school where the students are expected to always foster innovation and stand at the forefront of weapons development, complete with a student section comprising of human guinea pigs to test out the experiments on and do the actual fighting for the nerds in the lab coats. Jie Long, which is somewhat similar to Galahadsworth but without the focus on Western-style chivalry and instead a greater focus on things like self-improvement and martial arts, kind of like the Bruce Lee school or some shit. Jie Long is not as demanding to be lawful good, either, it’s chaotic and all over the spectrum. Last and least there\'s Queensvail, which is an all-girls school focused on producing idols and entertainers above all else, so if you’re a pretty girl who wants to sing or something I guess you can go there and get last in every event.In these schools, they have different disciplines of magic unique to them that students can learn like Jie Long\'s Taoist style magic, and various weapons called Orga Luxes that have mystical properties that can interact with the user that the weapon itself will choose, for better or for worse depending on what weapon it is. It can grant the user new abilities they previously didn\'t have access to, it can damage the users psychological state, so on and so forth - each being different and giving different boons or maluses depending on the weapon’s temperament.It is game world worldbuilding, and that\'s not super distinct in of itself in the world of light novels. What sets it apart is in the details - it\'s not JRPG videogame worldbuilding. It\'s a magic sci-fi city, complete with its own values systems stemming from the strange society that\'s been built up through the lore of the land the series actually takes place in and treats as real, with its own list of things like legendary weapons that\'s left open-ended enough for the viewers to get creative with on their own, rather than having a set of in-game rules that the worldbuilding itself is forced to abide by. Underlying the trite story the series tells is a setting with the potential for a lot to be done, ranging from ideological and ethical conflicts, to treasure seeking, to magical fantasy shit, to sci-fi techno shit. The worldbuilding made a point of incorporating things like personal values and beliefs in tandem with all of this rather than just being another demon king story or something just fucking fascist like Mahouka, too. I felt invited to make my own characters with their own values and come up with special weapons that had unique properties for them to use.The series itself - anime and LNs - does a good job at showcasing its worldbuilding. It doesn’t drop into textbook exposition too often and will take time and care to show certain facets of the worldbuilding through actions. A good example is when we see McFail try to use the Orga Luxe that winds up going to piss boy MC. It’s such a simple sequence - characters are going into the vault to try out Seidoukan’s collection of legendary weapons. Señor McFail walks up and try to use one, but the weapon itself rejects him. Later it becomes piss boy MC’s legendary weapon, but this small sequence showcases the idea that the main weapons all the top folks in this system use accept or reject those who try to wield them. We also get droplets of it through the main storyline, such as when they were trying to deduce which school sent in a spy to infiltrate them. They break it down in ways like “No, it’s not likely that St. Galahadsworth would result to these kinds of tactics, they have a certain image to maintain” to give a rudimentary idea of which schools of magic lie where on the values and ethics spectrum.It’s not some impressive feat of writing as much as it is just good execution, but it does a good job of drip-feeding this kind of info to the viewer without relying *too* much on exposition - it’s not perfect, but relative to the norm in anime it’s a cut above. This is what caused me to get so wrapped up in this series. I wanted to have my own character in this world, and when I watched it for the first time when I was 18, I made one. He was going to be a student at the Renaissance Europe-styled school of St. Galahadsworth whose characterization was going to be inspired by Galileo Galilei\'s conflicts with the church over his contributions to astronomy conflicting with religious doctrine, E pur si muove style. He was going to be so fucking cool and rebellious inside of a heavily controlled and legalistic environment, and he was going to get to bang Shenhua and be a bit of a villain who strays from the path of the super good guy school, and it was going to be awesome. I was so engrossed with thoughts like this that I kept watching the series so I could learn more and more so I could incorporate it into my own little story I was coming up with that\'d use the setting. I\'m not going to pretend like I think it would\'ve been good with the power of hindsight, but give me a break. I was having a lot of fun coming up with this shit.Dorky. Cringey. Fucking awesome. I love how much the Asterisk War was able to engage me on this level. This is one of the best ways to get wrapped up in something to me, where you\'re imagining your own characters and stories and getting to thinking about dumbass little details about what weapons they\'d use, how they\'d look, what their room and social life would be like, so on and so forth. That feeling of imagination and wonderment is a powerful connection to make with a series, and I kept paying attention to little details that were just so inviting to that sense of wonder that I found myself falling into this weird rabbit hole of AssWar lore. I even own physical copies of the volumes of the LNs that’ve been released. I bought them for fucking research at first. I didn\'t sit down and read the LNs until half a decade later. When I was so into this series, I used them for the comprehensive glossary of terms and concepts about the setting the first volume came with, or I skimmed through them to pick up lore tidbits, or just to look at the map of Rikka they came with where it described the schools and their various facets and guiding principles. To me, that’s appreciating something on a level that not many things can succeed in evoking. The Asterisk War, somehow, was the series that did for me.When I did sit down to actually read the LNs cover to cover, I was a proper adult with 5 years of experience in the workforce. This is when it all clicked together. I came to understand that this husk of a series wasn\'t a failed franchise, but someone’s dead dream. The anime was very corporate in its presentation and marketing, sure, and the LNs became a total lazy mess later on in their run before receiving what I can only describe as a mercy-killing cancellation, but what’s stuck with me more than anything about this series is the author’s note in the very first volume of the light novels.In it, Yuu Miyazaki doesn\'t talk about how much he loves animation and storytelling and what anime and manga he was a fan of that inspired him to make AssWar. Instead, he expresses his love of tabletop RPGs. When he was younger and didn\'t have a friend group to play them with yet, he\'d have his parents buy him RPG manuals he could read. He used to love reading Dungeons & Dragons and Warhammer game manuals for the setting details in them, to get lost in their worlds and lore and history, to let his imagination take over and see where things guided him. In this note, Miyazaki claims a wide variety of these game manuals as his inspirations, and states that his goal with Asterisk War was to create a series that people could create their own characters for and become its own tabletop RPG someday.The Asterisk War was never meant to be a light novel. It was meant to be a setting for an RPG people could make their own stories with and go on adventures with their friends in. This is a stated intent dating from before the anime’s release. Yet, somehow - and I don\'t know how - it wound up as a light novel series instead, and a light novel series and its fans demand some sort of a story to get engrossed in rather than one they make themselves. In this case, the story they received was a story written by someone who didn\'t care about and wasn\'t interested writing a story to begin with. Even if effort is expended, if the intent and desire isn\'t there, it\'ll fail to connect with the audience. This was its undoing, and yet aspects about the setting that Yuu Miyazaki had created made it appear to some suits on a production committee like the next big thing they could market to create the next Sword Art Online.This opened its shortcomings up to widespread attention, and those shortcomings caused the series to be met with intense mockery. People online would rip this series apart tooth and nail. They themselves were out for blood in trying to create their own next SAO. I remember back when people still talked about AssWar, I\'d watch randos in threads stoop to petty things like berating the author\'s appearance and ascribing personal faults to him as a human being for having the audacity to write an inoffensive, if dull, story as a vessel for his setting to be published. Years later, I remember thinking about how much Miyazaki was attacked as a person for writing AssWar when I was following the Ruroni Kenshin drama. People were far more accepting of an actual pedophile in Ruroni Kenshin\'s mangaka than they were of some dude who just wrote a bad story that it seems like he didn\'t even want to write, and that\'s just...heartbreaking, really.As the LNs continued beyond the anime, they became less and less energetic. Even if the writing before wasn\'t great, I think it at least tried to highlight the setting as best it could before even that fell away as the series went on deeper into its neverending tourney arcs, and there was even some good character writing at points like I saw with Saya. Hell, even Kirin\'s story with her Uncle tried to do something with familial abuse and pushing children too hard, and even if it wasn\'t much, it at least handled it far more tactfully than I\'d have expected. It was bad, but it wasn\'t lazy.With time, the starry-eyed excitement of that first author\'s note that was hoping it\'d become the tabletop RPG it was always meant to be was depleted, with the author’s notes becoming more and more brief with each passing volume before they stopped all together at a certain point. The story and art inside of the LNs derailed, better exemplifying a lack of motivation in creativity than anything that was adapted into the anime could. It wasn’t good. It wasn’t trying to achieve anything anymore. It was going through the motions as much as that could entail.The Asterisk War died quietly, to no fanfare or mourning, just a little under a year ago as of this review. It was a bad story with bad characters, but it was this way because this wasn\'t what it was supposed to be in the first place. It was in the wrong medium. I don\'t know how it got here and how things wound up this way, but I\'m convinced the AssWar would be better if it was never LN or an anime to begin with. Maybe there\'s a timeline out there where it managed to spread its wings and be the tabletop RPG it was always meant to be, and there’s groups of friends going on adventures with their characters in their little anime magic school game. In our universe, though, it all failed with a short drop and a sudden stop. I can\'t escape the feeling I\'m the last person leaving the room where we watched someone\'s dream die in real time, and that\'s a bitter taste to have to swallow.With that, I leave this room and close the door behind me. For better or worse, I had fun. Shine on, you crazy diamond. I mean it when I say that I wish that it had all gone differently for you.', ""Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a series which starts off as one of the most uninspiring anime I've ever seen throughout its first few episodes, but past a certain point it starts improving quite rapidly. Granted that doesn't really say very much given how mediocre the opening is, but despite the lackluster start it manages to make a quite impressive comeback and eventually become a pretty enjoyable anime.First things first though, episodes 1-4 of Asterisk didn't exactly give me a very good first impression because they are *painfully* generic. Like if you've seen any typical action/fantasy/ecchi/harem magic academy anime before, you should know roughly what clichés...to expect, and I'll just say that initially Asterisk has effectively all of them. Our protagonist Ayato transfers into a new school and walks in on the tsundere female lead Julis in her underwear within 3 minutes of the first episode and 'accidentally' grabs her breasts, he meets his new classmates and immediately becomes surrounded by a bunch of girls who fall in love with him for whatever reason, he's given a powerful magic sword which he just so happened to be the 'chosen one' to wield and thus becomes super overpowered... you get the idea. Basically it's all been done countless times before and I'm really getting sick of it at this point. As a side note there's also this one scene which blatantly rips off the light sabers from Star Wars for some reason, even the sound effects were completely the same... well whatever.Anyway, then starting from episode 5 (what I presume is the beginning of the second volume of the light novel), something happens to this anime which slowly but surely turns it into something different. And it comes with the introduction of a girl named Kirin; a very shy and nervous girl, yet also the top-ranked student in the school in terms of fighting prowess. The story starts putting a surprising amount of focus on her character and backstory, and in the process it downright sneakily goes *away* from the abundance of overused clichés it had in the first few episodes. Suddenly the amount of fanservice and romcom shenanigans is severely toned down, and instead we actually get some real depth and character development. Sure, it only really involves Kirin herself and our protagonist Ayato, but it was still a breath of fresh air compared to just having content I've already seen a hundred times before in other anime. And plot progression aside, I personally found Kirin to be by far and wide the most likeable girl in Asterisk's character cast anyway so I guess it was a win-win scenario in that sense.Now I haven't read the light novels of Asterisk, but based on the contents of the anime I'm presuming it's covering every volume in 4 episodes each. And thus I was a bit worried that it'd start to get worse again after the anime had finished up on the contents of volume 2 which seemed to be the Kirin-focused one. Fortunately however that didn't turn out to be the case, as starting with episode 9 we finally get into what I guess can be called the 'main' story of this series. Introducing the Festa: a grand series of tournaments where the students of the six different magic academies in the city of Asterisk fight each other to showcase their talent and technological development. The price they're all fighting for is the opportunity to have any one wish of theirs granted. Naturally, Ayato and the girls are competing as well. Normally I'm not a fan of action in ecchi anime since it tends to end up rather incompatible with its own fanservice, but Asterisk does a respectable job at keeping the two sides separate from one another. As a result, the duels in the Festa are actually not that bad, and A-1 Pictures' are not exactly newbies when it comes to creating fancy special effects in shounen battles, so the visuals are pretty decent too.When Gakusen Toshi Asterisk started airing, I considered it one of my least favorite shows of the season. Not that it's finished however; I'd say it's a perfectly acceptable show. Not anything amazing by any means of course, but if you just want an easily enjoyable way to spend 20 minutes every weekend... then this anime pulls it off very well. Discounting the generic and unimpressive opening, it has pretty decent fight scenes and production value, as well as good characterization for at least part of its cast. Oh and for you pervs out there who are just intending to watch this for the ecchi tag, I'd recommend you to look somewhere else; Asterisk really doesn't have very much of that at all.I cannot make a proper evaluation of the story as a whole though for the simple reason that... well this is a split-cour. At the time of writing this we've still only gotten to see half of what the anime has to offer, with the second season airing in Spring 2016. However the Festa is a huge event, and there's plenty of action left to showcase on that front, so the second cour might very well be even better than the first.

Fingers crossed."", 'It\'s totally okay to watch a show with low expectations. Sometimes to balance a great anime, you gotta watch a bad one just to put you back in your place. It\'s a requirement to have watched poorly done shows so you know where your tastes are and also broaden your horizons. The Asterisk War serves as one of those shows that will give you appreciation of shows like High School of The Dead and other shows that have poorly written stories and brick wall characters. This is a must watch if you need to remember that there are really uninspiring anime.Storywise, not much to say....Gary Stu comes to new school, all the ladies fall for him the end. Sounds like the typical harem anime because it IS a typical harem anime. The whole thing is a tease and shows snippets that relate to the protagonist indirectly, but fails to establish a basis for it. What I mean if that sounded pretentious, is the lack of an overarching conflict. We follow young Ayato, but for what? All we see is him turning red at every little female physical contact.Deus Ex Machina phenomena is arguably always going to break a show. I think it works in this show\'s favor just because there weren\'t really any upsides to begin with. It gives a little more excitement in what was a lackluster show. Arguably it isn\'t phenomena but foreshadowed. Ayato\'s power makes zero sense considering the circumstances revolved around him and that the whole show seemed to have miss the point was just bad writing on many levels. But hey, what more to look forward to in a show then a guy\'s head in between breasts?The chemistry between the characters is awful and blame the story telling for that. None of the characters mesh well and there isn\'t any positive to get out of observing their actions and motives. They all suck. If gary stu didn\'t fit the description of the main protagonist, then I don\'t know what to believe. This guy is the most uninteresting (for lack of a better word) fuckboy. Something that works against the show is that it was really trying to take Ayato\'s circumstances seriously. The tropes are quite abundant and make all the female characters seem like cut outs of cariactures placed in an anime. And to munch the very uninteresting main protagonist at that. The Asterisk War really is a tease when it comes to scenes of sexualizing the females. Cuz boobs and butts sell right? I\'m losing brain cells trying to think of anything to write for this show.VOICE ACTING IS VERY BAD. My ear was bleeding due too Saya and Kirin\'s voices oh my goodness. It is awful and to hear baby squeals and ""jealous"" grumbles is reason enough to AVOID this show. I say it\'s a must watch because this might set the bar low enough for anything to come after seem like a masterpiece. We\'re all masochists when it comes to anime though so it\'s okay. Sound is underwhelming but the EDM is a good twist in action scenes.As for animation, it is the Irregular of magic high school esque. Flashy colors and CG stuff. Considering how little action there is, animation isn\'t really great. Lot more exposition than there is fighting and we know how that works out in a harem.I came into this show knowing it was going to be bad so I didn\'t really think of it as anything I haven\'t seen before. It brings nothing new to the table, nothing inspiring, no noteworthy scenes. It\'s just a letdown in all aspects besides I guess teasing if that has any credibility. I\'d surf the internet if I wanted to be uninspired but I guess the one thing the show has going for it is it\'s opening. Its pretty cool, not that cool but its okay.

A typical harem that lacks a resolution is what can best describe The Asterisk War.', 'Towards the end of 2015, two light novel adaptations became notable for sharing startling similarities between them. Chivalry of a Failed Knight was considered somewhat refreshing, occasionally playing around with awful tropes and channeling the power of competent screenplays and exciting directing to turn a school battle LN adaptation into something worth watching. Conversely, The Asterisk War failed to meet even the basic requirements to function as a generic work of fiction. It\'s barely worth the effort it takes to write about it, let alone animate it.Before we start, I dare one of you to make a thread or a blog showcasing the exact amount...of problems each episode has. Don\'t make a drinking game out of it, or you\'ll die of alcohol poisoning by episode 8. The show literally starts with the main puss ass lead walking into our Tsundere in the middle of undress, under the pretenses that she dropped something important to her. After she claims to owe him one, she tries to incinerate him out of nowhere, resenting him for the rest of the episode in the process. This sets a precedent as to how badly this show will execute and contradict everything, like being low enough to over-sexualize a 13-year-old who regularly gets slapped by her uncle and saved by Ayato, whilst simultaneously acting like her asking for a sparring match the main character she fought of her own volition before is in any way indicator of her strength as a person. Just to provide the illusion that broke as hell Ayato isn\'t obscenely powerful, they provide flimsy limiters that only work when he uses a specific weapon for too long, despite that he often goes past the time limit of the limiters with no problem until the match finishes. The show breaks its rules so often that its ravaged narrative arcs become that much worse. Even the interesting ideas this dreck presents aren\'t capitalized, let alone worth capitalizing on in the first place.The world-building is easily the most fractured part of this dumpster fire. The tournament arc has been hinted to be a tournament in which things can get deadly and bloody for competitors, but no one gets remotely injured or killed, aside from that one pointless and awkwardly done flashback scene at the very beginning., if students can summon hovering screens with their hands for no reason, then why do they need to hold them, and why is there actual paper involved? The world-building of this show is some of the worst I\'ve ever seen, as if the narrative wasn\'t already cheap enough with its trite nonsense, missed opportunities, and romantic mood killers designed to preserve a terrible harem.Speaking of which, Ayato is as horribly characterized and intolerable as his harem, which is one of the worst in the mainstream anime hemisphere. Julis is a trash tier Tsundere who plays up that trope to obnoxious degrees, especially when she retardedly blows up her room in an attempt to scorch him alive for the crime of accidentally seeing her in her underwear. Saya is an obnoxiously possessive loli with all the intolerable tropes you\'d expect. Kirin is an annoyingly squeaky pushover with a ridiculously lousy character arc As for Claudia, anything she has going for her can be boiled down to sass, sex appeal, and an insidious and mysterious nature that I guarantee this show won\'t capitalize on. The other characters are either stupid or wasted, with almost no middle ground beyond just being ""there"". Easily the most crushing case of the latter is Irene, who is a dangerous punk with a heart of gold and an interesting design. They go out of their way to do nothing interesting with her when it\'s time for her to fight our unbearable main lead in the finale, and the closest we ever get is how her younger sister keeps her in check, which has also been done a million times. When a character like her is the best character in the show, it speaks volumes of just how worthless this cast is.Visually speaking, this show isn\'t much better. The colors are certainly bright, and some of the character designs can actually be pretty neat and sexy but the artwork is pretty miserable. It\'s a low-budget SAO and Aldnoah.Zero style with even shittier and more incomprehensible choreography, and even more all-encompassing fugly CGI. Much like the show itself, the visuals are bad at even pulling off being generic and mediocre, barring a few relatively dazzling environments. Even the aesthetics are gaudy and nonsensical, and the cuts of actually good animation are few and far between. At least Andloah.Zero had some flourish to make up for generic style and cheap CGI.The OST is a mixed bag of vanilla background noise, awful dubstep, and ill-fitting emotional pieces. Even the OP is a milquetoast pop song, in spite of it being catchy. The ED titled ""Waiting for the rain"" by Maaya Sakamoto and Ramsus Faber is the only stellar bit of music in the show, as it\'s a pretty stellar emotional track to close out each episode with. Even the visuals are interesting, with the show swapping the positions of a bunch of color-coded silhouettes of each harem member, which are accompanied by some actually pleasant techno melodies and Maaya Sakamoto\'s warm, even uplifting voice. Still, if having one good track is all the audio needs to be unquestionably better than every other aspect of this show combined, then I really can\'t find a better way to call this show dogshit.People put themselves through hell slaving away at this, and no one did a remotely good job beyond the musicians. That\'s as sad as the show itself. This anime isn\'t even infuriating or laughable, just annoying and lifeless, which is one of the purest tells that this has no value I can assign to it, let alone any reason to be watched enough to garner a second season. It even fails to live up to its title in any way, shape or form. How this got popular is beyond me, and I\'m glad it\'s dead. of problems each episode has. Don\'t make a drinking game out of it, or you\'ll die of alcohol poisoning by episode 8. The show literally starts with the main puss ass lead walking into our Tsundere in the middle of undress, under the pretenses that she dropped something important to her. After she claims to owe him one, she tries to incinerate him out of nowhere, resenting him for the rest of the episode in the process. This sets a precedent as to how badly this show will execute and contradict everything, like being low enough to over-sexualize a 13-year-old who regularly gets slapped by her uncle and saved by Ayato, whilst simultaneously acting like her asking for a sparring match the main character she fought of her own volition before is in any way indicator of her strength as a person. Just to provide the illusion that broke as hell Ayato isn\'t obscenely powerful, they provide flimsy limiters that only work when he uses a specific weapon for too long, despite that he often goes past the time limit of the limiters with no problem until the match finishes. The show breaks its rules so often that its ravaged narrative arcs become that much worse. Even the interesting ideas this dreck presents aren\'t capitalized, let alone worth capitalizing on in the first place.The world-building is easily the most fractured part of this dumpster fire. The tournament arc has been hinted to be a tournament in which things can get deadly and bloody for competitors, but no one gets remotely injured or killed, aside from that one pointless and awkwardly done flashback scene at the very beginning., if students can summon hovering screens with their hands for no reason, then why do they need to hold them, and why is there actual paper involved? The world-building of this show is some of the worst I\'ve ever seen, as if the narrative wasn\'t already cheap enough with its trite nonsense, missed opportunities, and romantic mood killers designed to preserve a terrible harem.Speaking of which, Ayato is as horribly characterized and intolerable as his harem, which is one of the worst in the mainstream anime hemisphere. Julis is a trash tier Tsundere who plays up that trope to obnoxious degrees, especially when she retardedly blows up her room in an attempt to scorch him alive for the crime of accidentally seeing her in her underwear. Saya is an obnoxiously possessive loli with all the intolerable tropes you\'d expect.

In my opinion, though, the people who pointed out all of this show\'s flaws are pretty much perfectly on track: This show has an unlikeable and generic cast set in an ill-concieved setting with no plot to drive it and poor fights.Lets take it from the top. Our show begins when Ayato Amagiri,...your standard flatbread hero, arrives at one of the six elite fighting schools, Seidoukan Academy, so he can be a fighter, as he is a Genestella which is basically a superhuman. The first action we get to see is him returning a handkerchief to a girl...by leaping through her open window?! What rational person does this, even if they can superjump places? It is a total invasion of privacy and instead of just, say, getting to her door and knocking, or shouting to her, or hell going to the window and saying she dropped it or any number of things, he just leaps into the open window of a total stranger\'s house. Inside is our female lead, Julis, and naturally since this is a harem series, that means we need to walk in on her dressing. Don\'t ask why a beautiful princess would decide to undress with an open, undrawn window where anyone can see, take pictures or so on of her.Unsurprisingly, Julis is upset about this! She is one of the top ranked fighters in the school and so you can guess her reply to this problem. The first few episodes are dedicated to showing off some of the main characters and exposition. Lots and lots of exposition, most of which isn\'t even true exposition, like Claudia telling the main character a bunch of terms and things about the city that the viewer will have no idea about. Right, on that note, the two other main girls introduced now are Claudia and Saya: Saya is one of Ayato\'s old friends and therefor has the hots for him, but we don\'t really get a lot of their history together, and she is your general emotionless girl or ""Dandere"" type. Claudia is the hot, very forwardly sexual student council president who flatout prepositions Ayato for sex multiple times (the first time, in episode 3, being a hilariously bad scene for Ayato\'s reply) and liking him for...really no well explained reason, she just kind of shows up to exposit at him and then wants to fuck him after giving him a strong weapon.A big issue is that all of these characters are pretty generic and have very little chemistry with each other: In fact, they very rarely even interact with people unless Ayato is directly involved and the focus, making them feel like they\'re just gone from the show when not existing, and we get very little insight to anyone\'s private lives aside from Claudia. Ayato is your generically overpowered main character, whose power seems to mostly be hitting really hard and his sword cutting things really well, with a cardboard attitude of ""I don\'t really care but I do"". I should also note that most shows in this fight involve Ayato aaaaand are boring, with most of the first season\'s tournament arc ending dedicated to Ayato/Julis and the other MC teams casually curb stomping their opponents in under a minute.This is NOT how you write an overpowered main character. Overpowered main characters can work fine: For an example of that, Josuke from Part 4 of JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure would usually be considered pretty OP, with his stand Crazy Diamond being very physically powerful, pretty dang fast and having a potent ability to fix things. In fact, Josuke\'s stand for most of the Part 4, would be considered a lot stronger than the main antagonist\'s, but by giving the antagonist actual guile he becomes a menacing threat, and giving minor villains powers which can exploit Crazy Diamond through actual weaknesses, for example its short range, or having specialized abilities, ends up making some pretty great fights. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is practically based around the idea of the heroes being overpowered and weaves it nicely into the plot, taking a weakness and turning it into a plot strength.Ayato is just...generically overpowered. He can move faster than everyone and hit harder to everyone and generically power himself up with yells and special effects to be even strongerer and then he beats up his opponents! Not once does Ayato display any battlefield tactics, special skills (the special attacks he calls are almost all literally a sword slash that doesn\'t seem to be any different than normal) or abilities of note to make his fighting interesting. Its the worst way to write an overpowered MC, especially since naturally in a harem series this means things like beating up the highly ranked female harem members because they are generically not as strong as the AMAZING Ayato Amagiri and now they will fall for him or he will carry them in his arm because they totally couldn\'t do it themselves.Julis is your generic Tsundere girl who will probably be the harem winner. She has very few motivations and is one of the most blush heavy Tsunderes I have ever seen, even when she is going through the heavy Tsun parts, and her power is to control fire, which is never used beyond ""circle of fire trap"", ""shoot fire"" or ""fiery explosion"", and most of the time she shoots fire at people and they just get owned. Saya is small girl with a huge gun, which is only used to fire generic laser blasts. Claudia actually has some neat powers, dual wielding triangle lightsaber blades with an ability to see the future, but she doesn\'t actually get any fight scenes so. Kirin\'s power is ""has a sword"" and gets paired with Saya for some quite boring fights.Oh, right, Kirin. She\'s another main character introduced in a latter pair of episodes, which I hesitate to call a ""mini-arc"" given its anemic lack of plot or advancement, and is a 13 year old with large boobs which get way too much emphasis for her age and is also somewhat weird to have in Ayato\'s harem in the first place. She largely comes off as a superflous character who exists to give Saya a partner but since she is a female on this show she MUST also be added to Ayato\'s harem. Her voice also is very annoying even for the usual archetype and she has the spine of a jellyfish without actually acting abused enough to fit her supposed backstory. Also, she is somehow ranked #1 in the school when Claudia is #2. Kirin wields a normal, non-laser sword, one of the only people to do so in the show. Claudia dual wields lightsabers and can SEE THE FLIPPING FUTURE. The only possible explanation is Claudia does not give a shit.I also want to talk about a character who you would think is minor but frankly feels like he recurs as much, if not more, than Saya and Kirin: Lester MacPhail, whose name is quite literally pronounced MacFail. MacFail here is one of the most anemic attempts at a ""bully"" character I have seen in quite some time, being established as a loser who has lost to Julis 3 times but is itching to fight her and lose again. He is never displayed as a competent threat and nearly gets killed by one of the laser swords getting upset at him and flying around trying to murder him in a...hilariously awkward scene. He loses every fight he gets into, although SOMEHOW he is the one who gets the ""valiantly fights but loses"" fight scene to Irene, which if anything makes Irene look weaker by having to expend any effort on this failure. Its also hilarious because this guy is supposed to be kinda badass, like having built up muscle when Genestella are supposed to have trouble doing so, but he is basically a total loser in the show and one of the most pathetic strong man/bully types I\'ve ever watched. This makes him more endearing than most of the main cast!Finally for characters, I will mention Irene, the only decent character on the entire show: Pretty generic, sure, but her and her younger sister Priscilla are basically the only characters with actual energy or personality to them which helps makes any scenes in the show feel alive. She wields a laser-scyche (basically every weapon but Kirin\'s in the show is lightsaber-esque) which can control gravity and turns its user into a vampire because it requires blood to function. Since Priscilla can regenerate herself rapidly, Irene can feast on her blood to power up without worry, while she tries to just stay out of trouble, a somewhat interesting team dynamic. Their backstories are pretty generic and their powers are ill explained, but they are unique enough and Irene is the only character in the show who uses her power in a variety of interesting ways, making her basically the only character to be remotely competently done in this show, although her boss and essentially loan shark Dirk is decently set up, which naturally means she basically is put on a bus to end the season.Story-wise, there just isn\'t much to comment on. Ayato gets to the school, acclimates to the school a little, gets into some fights, meets Kirin and has some more random fights, then they go to the tournament and fight some jobbers until Irene shows up for a mini-arc to close the season. Ayato gets some very, very light setup for plot involving his sister, Julis and Saya get some weak motivations (help an orphanage she did stuff in as a kid, she wasn\'t an orphan she just hung there, and advertise her father\'s guns respectively) aaaaaaaand that\'s pretty much it. Backstory for the series is vague, with Apocalyptic Event causing super people to show up and a really terrible Megacorp to take the place of nations, which doesn\'t really factor into the show at all. The tournaments are supposed to be gladiatorial, blood filled spectacles to satiate the populace, but less people die in them than the infamous ""Hallway of Running"" from Hunter x Hunter so it reeeally doesn\'t show up.Sound-wise, most effects are dull and forgettable, with literal stock lightsaber sounds being used at times, and most background music is entirely forgettable. Not really good sound effects on the powers, either. The OP is fairly bad and that counts for a lot of the sound design, while the ED is okay, although stylistically even slice of life shows like K-On and Miss Kobayashi\'s Maid Dragon have done this ED style better. Art-wise the show actually usually isn\'t that bad, but it does suffer from not really having a very discernable style and bad looking effects in fights. The reason it goes down to a 2 is actually because of the horrible, Fates end of support style CGIs that are in the post-credits scene (usually involving Claudia), which already looked awkward in that, but here is done with way worse animation and ends up looking laughable and disturbing. This was so bad it dragged the animation score from a 4-5~ to a 2. Enjoyment is a 2 because it is a good show to talk to friends about the issues with and Irene\'s part was ever vaguely entertaining, but is a definitive 1 if you\'re not going to have anyone to go with.Overall, Asterisk Wars has quite little to get people involved and was a pretty miserable experience, if you want a good harem show there are far better options out there and if you want an action show there are far better options out there. However, it can be worth watching if you want to form your own opinion on it (it has ANYONE who likes it, after all) or because of all the analysis done on it, or simply if you like to ocassionally watch bad shows and see what happens. I\'m still going to watch Season Two, after all: I gotta see things through to the end. your standard flatbread hero, arrives at one of the six elite fighting schools, Seidoukan Academy, so he can be a fighter, as he is a Genestella which is basically a superhuman.

The tournaments are supposed to be gladiatorial, blood filled spectacles to satiate the populace, but less people die in them than the infamous ""Hallway of Running"" from Hunter x Hunter so it reeeally doesn\'t show up.Sound-wise, most effects are dull and forgettable, with literal stock lightsaber sounds being used at times, and most background music is entirely forgettable. Not really good sound effects on the powers, either. The OP is fairly bad and that counts for a lot of the sound design, while the ED is okay, although stylistically even slice of life shows like K-On and Miss Kobayashi\'s Maid Dragon have done this ED style better. Art-wise the show actually usually isn\'t that bad, but it does suffer from not really having a very discernable style and bad looking effects in fights. The reason it goes down to a 2 is actually because of the horrible, Fates end of support style CGIs that are in the post-credits scene (usually involving Claudia), which already looked awkward in that, but here is done with way worse animation and ends up looking laughable and disturbing. This was so bad it dragged the animation score from a 4-5~ to a 2. Enjoyment is a 2 because it is a good show to talk to friends about the issues with and Irene\'s part was ever vaguely entertaining, but is a definitive 1 if you\'re not going to have anyone to go with.Overall, Asterisk Wars has quite little to get people involved and was a pretty miserable experience, if you want a good harem show there are far better options out there and if you want an action show there are far better options out there. However, it can be worth watching if you want to form your own opinion on it (it has ANYONE who likes it, after all) or because of all the analysis done on it, or simply if you like to ocassionally watch bad shows and see what happens. I\'m still going to watch Season Two, after all: I gotta see things through to the end.', 'I tried this just to see what a truly terrible anime is. I thought there might be some sort of sick enjoyment out of the complete shittiness.And there is, but it\'s buried deep under an extremely thick layer of pure unabated rage.I\'ll just say right now that I gave TAW exactly 4 minutes of my time. Because in 4 minutes everything was said. I watched Shinsekai Yori from the same studio, an anime I considered to have an excellent story and good characters but generally terrible production values and design. This is the same. Except the story and characters are shit too.So why am I...writing a ""review"" from 4 minutes of observation? Because it was, and I\'m not being ironic, enough to be sure of a number of things:-This anime is godawful stupid-This anime is godawful lazy-This anime is just godawful, but with a special taste for mixing pretentious hardcore with stupidly stupid(I would have said lighthearted but come on, it\'s more stupid than anything)Story: A bunch of teenagers fight with swords because plot and the hero gets every girl on his penis. Think it\'s not enough? It\'s literally the entire plot of season 1. I checked. 1/10Art: In less than 4 minutes I saw a bunch of random 3D models in a generic blurred background. More than that the art in general is generic and lazy, the characters look nothing fantastic, they have a pink-haired girl with long hair in there and they manage to make her look sort of ugly. Considering that long pink hair is pretty much my exact taste in anime girls, I don\'t even get how they managed that. 3/10I was told the soundtrack is good and I want to believe it because less than 3 mins in I heard a super happy theme that was the most misfit and tone-shifting thing I heard in years. At 0:00 you\'re in a fight, at 0:05 the girl is crying in happiness and thankfulness, at 0:10 she\'s about to launch a fireball at the protagonist, and at 0:15 you\'re hearing the happiest theme there is. Was this even made by humans or computer generated by a first version AI attempting to appeal to us? So yeah it\'s a good soundtrack but if this is how they\'re going to use it, then 2/10 and holy god will anything about this not be completely lazy and sucky?Characters: In 3 minutes I met:-The teenager girl who is into a fight against a masked guy and says ""sorry x"" after she loses and dies-The teenager guy who x was, who is the most generic here-to-help-all guy who\'s also crazy strong and is flustered everytime a boob is even hinted at-Teenager tsundere girl with pink hair who manages to go from tsun to dere in less than 10 seconds then back to tsun then pulls a magic blast and destroys everything. And who could look a lot less shit.-The teenager director(?) of the school who\'s as smily as her tits and sex drive are huge.I would put 0/10 if possible, but I guess it\'ll be one. Pathetic is certainly a good definition, there is NO EFFORT at all. I won\'t even dignify this schlock with the word ""characterisation"", but at the very least, if your characters are shallow, make them fun. Here the production values are so low, the story is told in such a slingshot way, that even something as simple as a tsundere character comes off as false, and as not fun. I mean come on, could you get any lower for a professional studio? Actually don\'t answer that, I\'m afraid of the answer.Enjoyment: 10/10 without irony again. If I could swallow this inane schlock for more than a few minutes I would probably find an extremely powerful sick enjoyment out of hating this with every cell of my body. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, I can\'t, and I have less terrible things to watch.Overall: I didn\'t stop 3 minutes in because it was shit. If that was it, I\'d have stood it to at least the end of the episode. No. My mind refused to carry along with this tremendous piece of lazy, barely shoved out crap, after two lines:-After this event(the genostella children), the world was changed and a new order was made by [insert organisation whose name I can\'t even remember and who controls Asterisk Island]-Due to the changes, a new morality was born in the world-And now, pantiesWHAT? ARE YOU ACTIVELY TRYING TO FUCK WITH MY REMAINING BRAIN CELLS?You literally took 3 sentences to go from ""a new world order"" to ""a new morality and set of social values"" to ""PANTIES""!Do the people who put this mindless crap on the market even know that you can\'t throw stuff like ""new world order/new morality"" without actually showing how or what? That\'s like saying ""and thus the greatest soldier ever was born"". But then we don\'t see the soldier, we don\'t know how he fights, or even for whom.I have never seen such a sharp, poorly done storytelling in my entire life. I literally dropped it right then and there, paused the video, tried some more but the damage was done. In less than 4 minutes I was convinced that this wasn\'t just generic and poor, it was also horribly told and had absolutely no idea of what it was talking about. And lots of shows are generic and mindless, but this one is lazy and veeeeery poorly made to boot.If I ever want to hate anime, I\'ll be sure to come back to this. writing a ""review"" from 4 minutes of observation?

Oh yeah, there's also something about a magical school and a competition. The world in not very well presented.The characters are simply walking, talking stereotypes. You probably won't even remember their names, only the character tropes. There's the very naive and powerful main character who doesn't get that ALL the girls are in love with him. There's the main...female lead who's a tsundere (not even a good one at that), there is the loli dandere (she is also not very well made cause she looks and sounds like the supercritical dandere, but she's very active and not at all shy nor quiet), there's the big boob loli girl who is completely depended on the main character and etc.The only reason why i'm not giving this  the worst score is because the animation and the look isn't all that bad, even if the fight scenes are terrible. Ah yes, the fight scenes. The genre of this anime is ACTION! But the creators idea of action/fights is apparently flashing colourful lights really, really fast and hoping that you won't notice.But I must give credit where credit is due: the music isn't all that bad.

The genre that I mostly find myself gravitating towards is the one that has to do with lots of girls and only one guy.  (Don\'t judge me.  We all have our favorite genre.)  So, with Fall 2015 coming to a close, we have Asterisk, a show that...really isn\'t much different from the rest of the harem shows out there to be honest.Story: The age of Genestella came when meteors rained down and sent the world into near extinction, but surprisingly, not as many people as you think died.  As a result of the fallout, a new society was...formed, one where people now possessed magical powers and were able to wield weapons made from the stones in these meteors called \'Luxes\'.  And here, we follow the story of Amagiri Ayato, a boy who enters one of 6 schools (Seidoukan specifically) and enters the Phoenix Festa in order to find out what happened to his missing sister several years back.  Then he comes across a girl named Julis who starts to snap at him because of no fault of his own and  well, you get the idea.Asterisk is generic.  There\'s no way around that fact.  The show focuses on Ayato as he progresses through his life at Seidoukan, entering the Festa, and coming across various characters along the way.  Most notably, harem members.  And really, that\'s about it.  He meets someone new (or old, since Saya is childhood friend), helps them, moves on.  Even during the fighting festival, he manages to help other girls in that.  Because of this, there really isn\'t much to say about the show.  The fact that it\'s generic makes it so that a lot of the plot points are very predictable, a lot of what happens doesn\'t really add much tension, and nothing really stands out as extraordinary or noteworthy to talk about.  It\'s not really bad, but at the same time it\'s not really good.  It\'s rather bland and I really can\'t express that any more.Overview:-  Generic-  Nothing really noteworthy to say about this show-  This is just filler text.  Because there\'s nothing interesting to really say about Asterisk\'s story, I thought just add in this little bit so I could have three things in this section of the review.Characters:  The characters in Asterisk reflect its story, by being as uninteresting as they can be.  (Because we all love anime tropes, right?)Amagiri Ayato is...well, what\'d you expect in an anime like this.  He\'s a harem protag who\'s entire purpose in this show is to seek vengeance (or something) and help out any female human he possibly can before converting them to the Ayato religion where they worship his holy D.  (Sigh.  We\'ve seen this a million times.)  As such, he doesn\'t really have anything unique about him to talk about.  Maybe the fact that he\'s not as OP as other harem protags that fit this category, but I don\'t think that deserves mention.Then the girls.  Let me line them up for you.Julis = Token TsundereSaya = Kuudere Osananajimi (childhood friend)Kirin = Dandere ImoutoClaudia = Sexy Onee-sanI don\'t think I really need to elaborate more, do I?  Ok.  Moving on then.As for other characters, well, they\'re not really all that important, according to the plot.  Most of the characters really serve to be plot-based and move what is happening in this series behind the scenes.  Others on the other hand are meant to be the main focus of the show, (aka, the harem girls), and as such are treated with a little bit more screentime.  Don\'t expect a lot from these people.  Most of them aren\'t really that interesting aside from a tiny handful.Overview:-  Bland characters-  Most of the side cast is meant to move along the plot-  So, how\'s your day going?  (I ran out of things to talk about again.)Art: The art for Asterisk is something that I would say has more worth on it than its story and characters combined, and then some.  While the artstyle isn\'t really all that fantastic in terms of originality since it all pretty much looks the same as a lot of anime these days, the fighting scenes and its effects look pretty, so I\'ll give it that much.  Everything else, pretty standard.Overview:+ Nice fight scenes+/- Pretty standard animationSound: The sound for Asterisk is also something that has a little bit more worth to the show as a whole.  Its OP ""Brave New World"" has a very techno and fast-paced feel that actually sounds rather good and fits with the show.The ED on the other hand is another track that is rather nice to listen to.  It\'s quite somber and has a mellow tone to it that\'s relaxing and calm to listen to.  It\'s a good set of tracks to a not so very good show.Overview:+  Good tracksPersonal Enjoyment:  It\'s a harem; I tolerated it because of that, so there.  I\'m not going to do my usual stuff because there really isn\'t anything good or bad to say about this show.  It\'s generic, and that enough should say enough about it.  It\'s a rather bland experience that doesn\'t leave too much to think about, and as such, isn\'t really worth talking about.  I don\'t hate it, I don\'t love it, I\'m just indifferent to it.

Well, one can\'t make a review of this anime without compering to another anime namely ""Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry"" or at least on the story (up) side, since it both features the same plot where it involves the female MC who met the male MC in a very awkward situation and plot wise, both partners have to compete in a contest that would pit their skills against another opponent . I mean if one where watching...both animes their is at 70% similarities, where I rather not discuss anymore details and both climaxes where focus on fighting the strongest female contender, which is why I gave this anime\'s category a 5. About this anime\'s art(up) thought there where some fanservice involve, it didn\'t focus much on it to sell, thought they did made Claudia and Violet\'s  bikini fanservice  a little bit bitchy, but the good thing was that it only appeared briefly, so that is why I gave it a 6 for this anime\'s art. Sound (up), actually I just have nothing much to comment on this anime\'s sound pertaiting to the VA who did the character\'s voices, but I don\'t have much love for both the opening and closing themes of this anime, so I just limit it to a 6. Charcter (up) ok, the relationship between Ayato and Julis maybe a bit in the ambiguous side given that Julis was just too pridish to admit that she like Ayato and Ayato was just this garden variety harem guy , it was still good enough to see the two being together and supporting one another so for that this category should be ""GOOD enough. Unfortunately this anime has introduced too many support characters that they\'re not given enough aired time let alone that those from diffrent school weren\'t that much of climatic when it comes to the competition, but still, it\'s ""Good.""

The competition is about some Magical Fantasy Fighting Competition which up till now I still do not understand their powers and stuff relating to it.

I liked this anime because i think they animated the battles in a great way, some characters are funny but i must say that some of its characters are awkward....The opening and ending theme are just amazing, favorites of this season.

He enrolls in a magical sword school in a city on an island identical to those of previous incarnations of the light novel fantasy genre.The writer of this series followed his Light Novel Adaptation Guidebook PERFECTLY.Kirito ku-- Excuse me... Ayato walks in on a tsundere changing on the first day of school.  She gets pissed and challenges him to...a fight.  She gets her ass spanked in the fight.  Harem consisting of Tsundere girl, big boobs girl, childhood friend girl, and loli girl forms between episodes 1-3.  Ayato ignores sexual advances of girls, romantic subplot never goes anywhere.  He remains an unbeatable god for the duration of the series.

It's to short for it's own good. It tries to give a good and a little complicated story and plot, but because of it's short run time (will change when the new season comes out in april 2016 hopefully) the goal of the plot becomes unknow.

That\'s character development for you, I guess.I didn\'t exactly expect this anime to be any good. There are many red flags before getting into this, and the first episode alone is a good indicator of what\'s about to come: nice guy transfer student, tsundere second lead, obligatory ecchi scene, 99% female cast, A-1 studios... yep, they\'re all there. Asterisk War can force a light smile here and there, but otherwise, it\'s such a smudge. Painful to watch at times. This review takes into consideration the second season too, I watched a couple...of its episodes. It\'s basically the same show.Asterisk War generally suffers from bad writing, but the one factor really standing out is our MC, Kazuto Kirig- I mean, Amagiri Ayato. This man is so empty that dirt and gravel would shine with more personality in his place than he does. In fact, I believe most of the main cast has more to offer than this guy. Even by the end of this show, the only goal in Ayato\'s life is literally being a simp, and not a good one at that. Whoever wrote this, though, believed it\'d be pretty cool for him to be the most overpowered bozo on the planet, reaching rank #1 in his academy only after two or three duels. This anime doesn\'t even hide the silliness of trying to present his strength as something genuine, so it can be unintentionally funny watching him at times...The rest of the characters are fine at best. Saya is best girl. I also kind of liked Julis in that, in spite of being leagues inferior to Mr. MC, she was nonetheless a fighter, had a purpose unlike him, made crucial contributions to their fights, and really took it like a champ at times. Basically what SAO Asuna ever wanted to be. But well, she isn\'t acknowledged at all, because despite being the poster girl, the spotlight shines solely for Ayato. It\'s criminal having the two of them come out of a hard duel, where they both gave their absolute best, only for Ayato to receive all the praise and pussy. In fact, Julis too is obligated by her writing to ignore this, unconditionally fall in love with him, and say ""baka"" every three minutes. It is what it is, lol.As for the ecchi scenes in Asterisk War: they render this anime unwatchable. Horribly forced and cringe-worthy. And when I mean cringe-worthy, I mean putting away your headphones and running outside your room screaming in horror levels of cringe. Moreover unnecessary; nothing changes without them. They stick out so much in their idiocy that it becomes obvious: they\'re aggressively lodged inside character interactions to appease the fourteen year-olds, there just to be there, to fill the screen with boobs, red faces, and childish comedy - it\'s free fan service, so why not take it? Oh, and yes, one of them is a thirteen year-old. Enjoy yourself.Considering that the entire plot of Asterisk War is the Phoenix Festa (2vs2 arena duels), and its world is... well, shaped with that and that alone in mind, it would be wiser to watch this show just for the action and the fillers that predominate it. Question being, are they worthwhile? Not really. Action in Asterisk War is uninspiring and emanating with boredom. There are some exceptions, but action choreography, especially for Ayato, is just... plain nothingness. Supposedly powerful attacks never happen on screen. One frame is Ayato charging, with the next one screaming ""quickly! Everyone fall to the ground or get chopped in half!"" Julis casting flame spells is seriously more satisfying than watching Ayato. His action scenes are ridiculous.I could go on ranting about how flawed dialogue, characters, and the world are in Asterisk War, but honestly, who cares. All in all, it\'s a mediocre anime with poor presentation. There is some tiny value to it, some effort to adhere to logic in story decisions, some ""meh, that\'s awfully nice"" moments, in light of how underwhelming everything else is. For a newcomer in anime or media in general, this could even be enjoyable. Still, the matter of the fact is, there are better shows out there. Asterisk War is twenty four episodes long, and believe me, it is not worth that much of your time.In conclusion: Asterisk War might be watchable without sound. Rejoice, oh deaf ones! of its episodes.

He forms an early friendship with a new student who happens to be highly rated, with minor romantic elements. The setting however is interesting and is similar to Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei with a mix of technology powering somewhat magical powers (note that the director is the same as Mahouka - Manobu Ono)Art - The character design is par for the course for 2015. I did enjoy the few fight scenes.Sound - I think the OP and ED sequences...are done well but the soundtrack doesnt stick in my mind.Character/Enjoyment - after 5 episodes the series is at a crossroads in my mind. For the current season, it is being compared heavily with Rakudai Kishi no Calvary, since both started in similar fashion. However currently Gakusen is falling behind the former in that development is slow and the absence of significant 'hooks' in the story, either comedy, romance or tension is quite noticeable, compared to Rakudai which after episode 3 is really powering on.Overall - I will probably keep going for at least 2 more episodes and will post an update. The story is run of the mill, but the show has good production values and an interesting setting so I'm hoping that they do something with it. Above all, there needs to be some sort of viewer involvement in the story, so I'm hoping they at least advance either romance, more twists or some character development.

Yes I have.This is one of the WORST anime I've seen, worse than SAO. That's a big achievement.Let's get right into this.Story 2/10Let me say, the plot is not the worst thing in existence, but how it was executed, was HORRIBLE. This plot has many, MANY plot holes, dumb coincidences, unneeded fanservice to the point where it was cringeworthy and even PREDICTABLE most of the time, and a very unstable pace of plot, usually sloooooooow. Oh, and also, it ends in the most unsensical place I've seen in an anime. The story is a...huge mess.Art and Sound 8/10They were the only good points to this anime, and you know what? It's decent, both of them. But here's the thing. I DON'T GIVE A CRAP. The animation and sound, if it's good, good for the anime. I don't like a good anime with mediocre animation and sound as much as I do a good anime with good animation and sound. I think 100% of people will agree with me on that. But can it change the rating of a show? To me, no. So I don't give a crap, even though the art and sound is actually pretty good.Characters 1/10The Characters. Ah, the characters. What is this, a copy of SAO? SAO is a horrid anime. This anime copied SAO, and somehow made it even WORSE. Super op character? Check. Badass into Tsundere? Check. All the girls like the main, super op character? Double check. I don't get it. What's so good about Ayato? He's strong? He has purple hair? He looks EXACTLY like Kirito? All the characters are clićhe cardboard cutouts that have absolutely NOTHING interesting going for them.Enjoyment 1/10Why? WHY is this anime ranked higher and rated better than animes like Black★Rock Shooter? Why is it rated so goddamn HIGH? How does ANYONE see good in this anime, so much so that they give it a goddamn 10!? This anime had GLARING issues, and I wish I'd dropped it before I reached the end. Why did I think it was gonna get better during the Festa? (Minor spoiler, but it's revealed in the 1st ep I think.)Overall 1/10Worse than SAO.

Oh how I'm disappointed. This anime is clearly very stereotypical, in all it's choices. How you ask?Let's begin with the characters. I think if they weren't plucked from each stereotypical character trope, and splashed with colourful hair, than I think the Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, would lose many of it's fans. (I persevered, due to my love for Saya.)  First you have your plain, overpowered male protagonist, who attracts all the girls, and gets caught up in a lot of events, as progression for the plot. We have this...in Ayato, who joins Seidokan Academy, the scene for most of the events in the anime. Then we have our tsunderes and lolis coming out. Before you know it, Ayato, and his friends (pretty much girls) are battling for victory in tournaments.These tournaments, are what we are told about early on. This takes up a lot of the plot, besides, the problems, of our main characters. I feel that many there are many plot holes, and unanswered questions, that the viewer wants to learn about, during the anime, which saddened me. These story points, that I felt I'd learn about, I never did, so I'm at the very least pleased Season 2 is coming soon.The art, is bright and attractive, but sometimes, it's lazy, outside of fight scenes.

These story points, that I felt I'd learn about, I never did, so I'm at the very least pleased Season 2 is coming soon.The art, is bright and attractive, but sometimes, it's lazy, outside of fight scenes. The music is half decent, but not memorable. In conclusion, I think Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a shambles. I'd only recommend it, if you are desperate, for your deres, but if you haven't watched it, don't bother."", ""Asterisk War is an adventure that has barely gotta started, because of its slow pacing and no third season in sight. But none the less, it was a fun one to watch and what we have already is good enough to get your fill or thrilling action. Many of the characters though, are your basic archetypes put to the test, but isn't as heavy handed as other action harems like it. The show is more of the same thing we always see, but trust me, it feels different than the others.

First of all, I can safely assume this anime carries its inspiration on its sleeve. The MC, Ayato looks like Kirito in second season of Sword Art Online. He even has a same color laser sword or whatever. Though this anime has original concepts in it, its not exactly ""trying"" to be original.There is nothing original about the MC or the other characters. Its like any action harem ecchi anime you\'ve seen a thousand times till now. I feel like this was a quick-buck maker for...whoever made this anime so they copied popular anime stuff and called it a day.The art is pretty good and so is the sound. The story is meh, something something battle stadium let\'s fighting love! Lol.Its an anime I wouldn\'t recommend because there is nothing memorable in it, but its okay for a casual watch as long as you don\'t expect much. whoever made this anime so they copied popular anime stuff and called it a day.The art is pretty good and so is the sound.

A school for people with magical powers. In order to help the students control their powers and to train them for a tournament, the school allows them to duel each other.The setup is really nothing. It’s just a way to have the characters fight each other. The fight themselves aren’t really entertaining to watch. This is because Ayato is just overpowered. They use an excuse of why Ayato can’t fight at full power, his...sister put a limiter on him, which only allows him to fight for five minutes, then he needs a day to rest. This doesn’t work because it just feels it’s there to create tension, which it completely fails at.The characters in the story are just what you expect to be in a battle harem. Ayato, the overpowered lead who ends up gathering women around him. Julis, the tsundere love interest. Saya, the flat childhood friend. Claudia, the mysterious beauty. And Kirin, the oppai loli.I feel the show thought it was being mysterious. It kept introducing characters, and new subplots. Every character who wasn’t the main group, were all working in the shadows, or doing shady things.Everything else about the show - the art and sound were just average. They weren’t bad, but they were also not anything special.I didn’t enjoy this anime at all. I felt it was below average, and not worth a watch.

Many people have mentioned their obvious similarity, and the funny thing is I enjoyed both and watch almost the same time. Man.. I might have too much tolerance for this kind of anime. There\'s no outstanding aspect from this show. Almost everything is generic, some that I find interesting:- various weapons (Ogre Lux) with it\'s own personality and ability, I\'m itching to find more of them in 2nd season- little ""extra"" they put at the end of each episode, and it\'s hosted by my favorite character,...Claudia!! okay, sometimes she\'s interfered or replaced by someone..- the OP and ED are great, the OP sets the mood, and the ED just.. beautiful- and lastly, the story is not that bad, I want to find out how the MC overcome his ""limitation"" and where is the person he\'s seeking, hope they\'ll show it well in 2nd season Claudia!! okay, sometimes she\'s interfered or replaced by someone..- the OP and ED are great, the OP sets the mood, and the ED just.. beautiful- and lastly, the story is not that bad, I want to find out how the MC overcome his ""limitation"" and where is the person he\'s seeking, hope they\'ll show it well in 2nd season', ""The story centers on a guy who is secretly more powerful than he lets on and his harem of girls who use magical weapons to battle...wait, that describes three different shows from this & last season. This review is for The Asterisk War but there may be some comparison to the other two shows, Anti-Magic Academy: The 35th Test Platoon & Hundred. It's inevitable given all the similarities between all three shows. Of the three The Asterisk War is the best, because it lacks the cringe worthy flaws of the other two shows. Though it’s clear they all have feelings for Ayato it’s not to...the point where they are throwing their panties at him. Or themselves. They actually take the time to build the relationships between the characters. Also the enemy is clearly defined, though there are some shadowy machinations behind the scenes. And the battles are energetic and entertaining. Something else praise worthy is the fact that Julis can stand on her own. She’s not dependent on Ayato to save the day. They are more of partners than anything else.  It’s not truly a harem show, or a school show. In fact I’m not sure how to classify this show. It’s set in a high school, yet I don’t ever recall seeing them in a classroom. The thing is, it’s also quite cliche. The characters are...how you say cookie cutter, sure to remind you of characters from other series. Sure we take a moment to explore them and their motivations but these come straight out of the “How To Create Characters” textbook. And nothing relating to their powers their relation to their weapons is explained (NOTE: It might be and I’ve just forgotten, but that just means it’s unmemorable). It doesn’t excel in any department except the fight scenes. In all honesty it’s a mediocre show at best but it gets bonus points because it’s better than the other two aforementioned shows. Hence why it got a second season. Normally I review anime objectively, but the three shows are so similar I thought I’d mention the other two. So in conclusion I say watch The Asterisk War and skip the other two. the point where they are throwing their panties at him. Or themselves.

Spoilers ahead!)When I went to Disney World – that is the one in Florida (the good one) and not the one in California – for the first time, it was around my birthday. If you do not know, at Disney, they pamper you to no end. They make sure that every move you make and every event you experience fills you with nothing but happiness. It is pretty scary how good they are at keeping you smiling.So there I was, at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth, and it was my birthday. True to Disney...form, they made me happy by giving me a special, green badge to wear. Wearing it around the parks meant skipping the long lines, extra signatures from the characters, and the regular restaurant staff giving me kind words and free desserts. Needless to say, I was a supremely happy kid.I speak of badges because Gakusen Toshi Asterisk gives badges to its characters, too. (Also, finding a tangentially relevant anecdote was pretty difficult for this one.) But Asterisk could learn a thing or two from Disney about how to make its audience happy.STORYOne of the biggest issues with Asterisk is that the anime does not have an established plot to speak of.This is a split-cour anime, meaning the second season is realistically the second half, the direct continuation as opposed to a whole new set of ideas. What this means is that a lot of the events revolve around just introducing characters and establishing setting instead of actually having worthwhile events.For example, Julis gets the first couple of episodes which are shared somewhat with Saya and Claudia. Kirin gets a couple of episodes for herself, too. Then Kirin shares one episode with Saya, and then the last few episodes are (strangely) about two new characters that showed up at the end of the season.Again, this is all character-oriented material. Nothing that occurs within these separate scenarios – like Julis confronting an evildoer who sent her a letter or Kirin fighting off some monsters with Ayato helping her – affect the larger, overarching narrative.What is this narrative? A lot of it involves unnecessary sexual, harem-based content. It is almost certain that Julis is the one he will choose in the end, considering their partnership and main character statuses. Meaning, the other characters fawning over Ayato seems rather pointless. Furthermore, any and all advances are met with Ayato being too flustered to do anything or with Ayato too afraid to make a move, highlighting said pointlessness.The biggest driving force for the narrative is the “Fenix Festa,” a tournament where the best students of the different academies duel one another. The issue here is that the tournament does not start until later on in the season. That is, for roughly three-quarters of the show, the most important driving force is ignored. Yes, the characters are constantly training for the tournament, but it is never a conflict that they have to directly deal with until much later.Then, once the tournament starts, the anime spends an inordinate amount of time on those aforementioned side characters, Irene and Priscilla. Not only do these side characters come too late into the season but also they divert attention away from Ayato, Julis, and the other characters who are easily more important.Worse still is the lack of world building. Very little information is given on the different factions throughout the city; only random snippets from conversations or quick rundowns let the audience understand how this society functions. Thus, the different fighters and weapons and groups have no basis and therefore no relevance.Narrowing the scope, Asterisk still has problems. A number of subplots go unexplained, like the Cat guardians, the backstory about Ayato’s sister, and the behind-the-scenes dealings with Clauida to name a few. The idea is that these separate subplots will be resolved later on in the second half of the anime, but so little was given about them that they feel more like tacked-on inclusions rather than important pieces of the plot.Even on a thematic level, the anime has trouble. Asterisk focuses on the theme of what it is that motivates people. Or as the characters phrase it, “what it is I’m supposed to do.” Protecting another, upholding tenets, and righting wrongs are all valid motivators, motivators that the different members of the cast hold fast.However, the extra aspects – namely the comedy and the sex – of Asterisk make it difficult to take its serious thoughts seriously. For example, Ayato (and the audience) seeing Julis and Saya’s undergarments after getting splashed by a fountain is unnecessary. And when Irene sucks blood from Priscilla’s neck, the action can only be described as sensual and thus distracting.But to be as fair as possible, there is a second half to Asterisk, a half that presumably will sort out all of these narrative conflicts and inherent problems. So even though the show looks rough now, there is still an entire season left to go.ANIMATIONAsterisk’s art and animation is a mixture of both solid and subpar offerings.The cinematography is often standard, except for rare perspectives such as a shot taken from Ayato’s point-of-view when Julis’s hands are covering his face or when bullets are shown hitting other bullets in slow motion. Lighting likewise remains relatively standard. And the same can be said for the art itself. Locations feel “the same”: an arena for fighting, a nice-looking room, and small parts of the city are as adventurous as the show gets. The lack of diversity can be attributed to the lack of world building – since the anime decided not to flesh out its world, the anime’s art suffers, too.Asterisk also likes to use CG for many of its effects. The materialization of guns, the smaller particles, and the robots that Ernesta developed are a few examples where CG makes an appearance. The CG is not groundbreaking, but it is used in such a way that the scenes and effects are bolstered, not hampered, by its inclusion.Bolstering occurs with the actual animation as well, remaining at an above average level throughout the season. Hair swaying and faces contorting are present as well as other nuanced effects such as sparkling eyes and moving limbs. The animation even keeps up during the numerous duels: swords swing, flames bloom, and characters run. Even Ayato’s abilities – which more often than not devolve into a quick cut of him flashing across the screen – have their moments, like when he grapples Kirin or when he uses a massive attack in the final battle.As for the character designs, their inclusion of color symbolism is nice to see. Julis’s pink symbolizes hotness, Kirin’s lavender symbolizes sweetness, Saya’s blue symbolizes calmness, Claudia’s yellow symbolizes happiness, and Ayato’s purple symbolizes respectfulness.But the colors are, unfortunately, all that distinguish them. Their hair is not gaudy and their eyes are pretty, yet they each wear more or less the same school outfit. And since they rarely switch out of their school outfits, they look less like their own characters and more like a specific color moving around on the screen.CHARACTERSAsterisk has a fair amount of problems with its cast, problems caused by the anime splitting itself up. Still, the cast partially holds its own.On a thematic level, they represent the idea that everyone fights for someone. Ayato fights for Julis. Julis fights for the kids in the orphanage. And Kirin and Saya fight for their respective fathers. Claudia may be fighting for Ayato, but technically the audience does not know quite yet where her true thoughts lay. (Hopefully the second season will clear this confusion up.)Regardless, it is this need to protect another that pushes the characters forward. They take action not for themselves but for the person (or people) they hold dear. This theme is not explored outright, but having this commonality exist between each member of the cast proves that they were given at least a modicum of attention.Moving to an individual basis, perhaps it is best to start with the best. The strongest character of Asterisk is Kirin and rightly so – she was given three whole episodes to flesh out her character. She starts out in a rough spot: Her menacing uncle physically abuses her and, for some reason unbeknownst to the audience, she accepts said abuse. Ayato fights for her honor, but he surprisingly loses.But that is not the end for Kirin. She speaks with Ayato afterwards, expressing how grateful she is to have Ayato even attempt to stick up for her. The two quickly become friends (Kirin seems to have a crush on the boy), and their morning practices become a ritual.It is not until Kirin and Ayato are attacked by a bunch of regenerating dragons (and while half naked) that she recounts her reason for suffering under her uncle. She has been, for years now, fighting to prove the innocence of her father who was accused unjustly. Ayato hears her words, encouraging her to take her own path.She agrees, confronting her uncle and getting (backhand) slapped in the process. But she does not waver. Instead, she decides to fight Ayato once more, losing but realizing that this new path – her path – is the one that she wants to follow. And when her uncle confronts her again, Kirin sees that just because she has taken a path of her own volition that does not mean that she will be left to fight by her lonesome.This whole character arc for Kirin is technically small, but she goes from introducing her traits, to dealing with her conflict, and then finally wrapping up said conflict, developing her character as best as the show could with the time constraints and the size of the cast. The rest of the cast, however, is not as lucky as Kirin.Julis is next on the totem pole. She pushes others away, believing that she can and should fight using only her own strength. When Ayato arrives, she comes to understand the value of camaraderie, placing her trust in the boy who vows to help her. She has a backstory with an orphanage that has yet to be used directly (hopefully in the second season), yet the biggest mistake is the part of her past relating to a girl named Elenshquigall Ophélia (what a name) shown for not even five seconds before it is brushed over. (Again, hopefully the second season addresses this tidbit.)Next would be Saya. She is aimless to the point of getting lost while out and about, she is evidently in love with Ayato, and she is a fan of saying “Kaboom” nonchalantly. Her listlessness only drops whenever the subject of her father is brought up. He was ostracized by his peers for his unorthodox methods in gun creation. She is mostly there for comedic relief, but she does form a connection with Kirin. For now, as a main-but-really-a-side character, Saya does what she has to; her time will come later on.At the bottom of the totem pole rests both Ayato and Claudia. Ayato suffers from being a self-insert character: he is incredibly powerful, he is surrounded by beautiful women, and he is just the nicest guy ever. To be fair, his power is more a curse than a blessing since it hurts him and saps his strength. As for why this is, it has yet to be explained (more next-season knowledge). And as such, Ayato’s character remains relatively static throughout the season.Claudia is, surprisingly, the worst of the bunch. About halfway through the season, she, like Julis, very briefly mentions a trouble she is carrying: Her mother in the Integrated Enterprise Foundation is apparently someone who has no “irrational sense of self-interest” and has no “personal desires.” And, like Julis, this trouble is forgotten about entirely. It is not until the end of the season when she reveals her first important trait: Her weapon, Pan-Dora, forces her to view her “eventual death,” indicating her immense mental fortitude. The rest of the time, Claudia is relegated to sexual relief and not much more.Collectively, and given that this is a split-cour anime, Asterisk did not create a strong group of characters, but it did not create a weak group of characters either.SOUNDThe ending track is undoubtedly the best part of the anime. It starts off slow and soft, lulling the listener into a peaceful mood. The piano and violins are gentle and beautiful, boosting the peacefulness further. But the track does not keep this tone for long; the halfway marker transitions the track into techno land. Here, the space-like effects fall more in-line with Asterisk’s futuristic motif. All the while, the vocalist uses nothing but English lyrics, giving the track a unique feel. Overall, the ED is a powerhouse that should not go unheard.The opening track is nowhere near the strength of the ED, but it does deserve some credit. The OP sticks more to the techno and space-like effects that the ED adopted, and it is certainly more intense, contrasting well with the ED. The track itself is nothing special, however, since it is a lot of beats and instruments crammed together. At the minimum, the vocalist sings wonderfully in terms of range and emotion, keeping the OP from being completely forgettable.The rest of the original soundtrack is akin to the OP in that many of the tracks are fine for what they are but not much more. Flutes and bongos fill the slice-of-life moments. Dubstep and fast tracks make up the action-heavy moments. And a melancholic and mysterious piano track accompanies the equally sad and ominous moments. This last track is the only one that particularly stands out.As far as voice acting performances are concerned, they are about average in their execution. Ari Ozawa as Kirin gives the young girl quite the cute voice, but the voice is almost too high-pitched. Ai Kakuma as Julis gives the short-tempered girl a fiery disposition. And Nao Touyama as Claudia provides a mature, sexy voice that is nice on the ears. And a (negative) shout out to Yuuko Gotou for using an annoying voice as an announcer for Kirin and Saya’s duel, hurting their whole scene.ENJOYMENTDespite the problems I have with the anime, I still find it pretty fun at times.Especially all of the romance asides. Kirin sidling closer to Ayato when she realizes she still has a shot. Saya calling Ernesta a “thieving cat” when Ernesta pecked Ayato’s cheek with a kiss. And Julis acting like the stereotypical tsundere on a consistent basis. Then there is Claudia whose sexually aggressive nature is always a treat.I really do not care for the battles, though. Not too much is at stake and Ayato (inevitably) always wins. I would much rather the anime stick to the previous material: flirting, blushing, and romancing. Even then, there are certain moments – like Ayato and Julis’s first match where he falls on her and grabs her breast (way too overdone by now) and Kirin and Saya taking a shower after their match (not very tactful) – that I can do without.Thinking on it more, I like all of the members of the cast besides Ayato. The girls are some combination of cute, sexy, and funny. Kirin is beyond adorable, Saya is hilarious in her unemotional responses, and Julis wanting to get her head rubbed because the other girls got the same treatment is amazing. Of course, Claudia in nothing but a bathrobe or a bathing suit is more than welcomed. Ayato, however, is just not interesting. Obviously that is the point, but I wish he had more of a personality besides “that super-nice dude.”Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a split-cour anime that stumbles from the get-go. The narrative has major issues, and while the characters, the visuals, and the music avoid similar mistakes, they are not without their own. Disney levels of happiness are impossible to reach, but hopefully the second half of the show can give its audience their very own green, happy-birthday badge.SUMMARYStory: Bad, lack of a driving force, improper world building, and thematic troubles each harm the narrative, but the knowledge that a second half is on the horizon helps to explain some of the misgivingsAnimation: Fine, average art, cinematography, and lighting, with nice CG, above average actual animation, and okay character designsCharacters: Fine, besides Kirin, the rest of the cast is either just primed for the second half or just not focused on enoughSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, about average VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Claudia, Kirin, Saya, and Julis are fun, but Ayato is lame and the battles are lamerFinal Score: 4/10 form, they made me happy by giving me a special, green badge to wear. Wearing it around the parks meant skipping the long lines, extra signatures from the characters, and the regular restaurant staff giving me kind words and free desserts. Needless to say, I was a supremely happy kid.I speak of badges because Gakusen Toshi Asterisk gives badges to its characters, too.

She has a backstory with an orphanage that has yet to be used directly (hopefully in the second season), yet the biggest mistake is the part of her past relating to a girl named Elenshquigall Ophélia (what a name) shown for not even five seconds before it is brushed over. (Again, hopefully the second season addresses this tidbit.)Next would be Saya. She is aimless to the point of getting lost while out and about, she is evidently in love with Ayato, and she is a fan of saying “Kaboom” nonchalantly. Her listlessness only drops whenever the subject of her father is brought up. He was ostracized by his peers for his unorthodox methods in gun creation. She is mostly there for comedic relief, but she does form a connection with Kirin. For now, as a main-but-really-a-side character, Saya does what she has to; her time will come later on.At the bottom of the totem pole rests both Ayato and Claudia. Ayato suffers from being a self-insert character: he is incredibly powerful, he is surrounded by beautiful women, and he is just the nicest guy ever. To be fair, his power is more a curse than a blessing since it hurts him and saps his strength. As for why this is, it has yet to be explained (more next-season knowledge). And as such, Ayato’s character remains relatively static throughout the season.Claudia is, surprisingly, the worst of the bunch. About halfway through the season, she, like Julis, very briefly mentions a trouble she is carrying: Her mother in the Integrated Enterprise Foundation is apparently someone who has no “irrational sense of self-interest” and has no “personal desires.” And, like Julis, this trouble is forgotten about entirely. It is not until the end of the season when she reveals her first important trait: Her weapon, Pan-Dora, forces her to view her “eventual death,” indicating her immense mental fortitude. The rest of the time, Claudia is relegated to sexual relief and not much more.Collectively, and given that this is a split-cour anime, Asterisk did not create a strong group of characters, but it did not create a weak group of characters either.SOUNDThe ending track is undoubtedly the best part of the anime. It starts off slow and soft, lulling the listener into a peaceful mood. The piano and violins are gentle and beautiful, boosting the peacefulness further. But the track does not keep this tone for long; the halfway marker transitions the track into techno land. Here, the space-like effects fall more in-line with Asterisk’s futuristic motif. All the while, the vocalist uses nothing but English lyrics, giving the track a unique feel. Overall, the ED is a powerhouse that should not go unheard.The opening track is nowhere near the strength of the ED, but it does deserve some credit. The OP sticks more to the techno and space-like effects that the ED adopted, and it is certainly more intense, contrasting well with the ED. The track itself is nothing special, however, since it is a lot of beats and instruments crammed together. At the minimum, the vocalist sings wonderfully in terms of range and emotion, keeping the OP from being completely forgettable.The rest of the original soundtrack is akin to the OP in that many of the tracks are fine for what they are but not much more. Flutes and bongos fill the slice-of-life moments. Dubstep and fast tracks make up the action-heavy moments. And a melancholic and mysterious piano track accompanies the equally sad and ominous moments. This last track is the only one that particularly stands out.As far as voice acting performances are concerned, they are about average in their execution. Ari Ozawa as Kirin gives the young girl quite the cute voice, but the voice is almost too high-pitched. Ai Kakuma as Julis gives the short-tempered girl a fiery disposition. And Nao Touyama as Claudia provides a mature, sexy voice that is nice on the ears. And a (negative) shout out to Yuuko Gotou for using an annoying voice as an announcer for Kirin and Saya’s duel, hurting their whole scene.ENJOYMENTDespite the problems I have with the anime, I still find it pretty fun at times.Especially all of the romance asides. Kirin sidling closer to Ayato when she realizes she still has a shot. Saya calling Ernesta a “thieving cat” when Ernesta pecked Ayato’s cheek with a kiss. And Julis acting like the stereotypical tsundere on a consistent basis. Then there is Claudia whose sexually aggressive nature is always a treat.I really do not care for the battles, though. Not too much is at stake and Ayato (inevitably) always wins. I would much rather the anime stick to the previous material: flirting, blushing, and romancing. Even then, there are certain moments – like Ayato and Julis’s first match where he falls on her and grabs her breast (way too overdone by now) and Kirin and Saya taking a shower after their match (not very tactful) – that I can do without.Thinking on it more, I like all of the members of the cast besides Ayato. The girls are some combination of cute, sexy, and funny. Kirin is beyond adorable, Saya is hilarious in her unemotional responses, and Julis wanting to get her head rubbed because the other girls got the same treatment is amazing. Of course, Claudia in nothing but a bathrobe or a bathing suit is more than welcomed. Ayato, however, is just not interesting. Obviously that is the point, but I wish he had more of a personality besides “that super-nice dude.”Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a split-cour anime that stumbles from the get-go. The narrative has major issues, and while the characters, the visuals, and the music avoid similar mistakes, they are not without their own. Disney levels of happiness are impossible to reach, but hopefully the second half of the show can give its audience their very own green, happy-birthday badge.SUMMARYStory: Bad, lack of a driving force, improper world building, and thematic troubles each harm the narrative, but the knowledge that a second half is on the horizon helps to explain some of the misgivingsAnimation: Fine, average art, cinematography, and lighting, with nice CG, above average actual animation, and okay character designsCharacters: Fine, besides Kirin, the rest of the cast is either just primed for the second half or just not focused on enoughSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, about average VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Claudia, Kirin, Saya, and Julis are fun, but Ayato is lame and the battles are lamerFinal Score: 4/10', 'The Asterisk War is one of those shows that at first glance seems like every other show but ends up being something special as far as battle harems are considered.That\'s not to say that the show is unique because its not but at the same time its not as generic as its competition either.It has just enough to stand out but not enough to be remembered as a masterpiece of the genre.Sort of like when your in school and you get a passing grade but cant be arsed enough to do anything else.The series takes place in a relatively advanced world with not only great...advances in technology but advances in genetic modifications as well.One thing i do like is how the genetic modifications are all subtle increases in our natural abilities such as speed and strength.Its not flashy abilities like throwing fire balls, well some people can do that but not on their own they need special weapons for those kind of abilities.In this setting are several schools who train students in ...... well to be honest we don\'t really know.supposedly each school works differently but the purpose of the schools isn\'t really expanded on aside from it being there for plot purposes.These schools however do compete with each other in a series of duels or atleast that\'s what we are led to believe seeing as how the big tournament the shows builds up isn\'t exactly a school event but all the schools have a stake in.As you can tell the plot isn\'t all that thought out and we end up with several unanswered questions but hopefully we will get more explained in the upcoming 2nd season.One thing that did stand out a little bit to me was the art-style that seemed reminiscent of the game ""Phantasy Star Universe"" which i wasted a unbelievable amount of hours on in the past so this was a good thing in my eyes.The animation is actually alot better than you would think, now its not Ufotable tier animation but still pretty good.Well aside from a section in the final episode that looked like they were trying to experiment on which i respect trying something new but it did feel unnatural.What is probably the best part of this show is the soundtrack and it is certainly one of the better ones of winter 2015.The background music does its job perfectly and gets the audience hyped up for the current and upcoming scenes and the opening/ending is probably my favorite part of each episode.Now the characters on the other hand are fairly mediocre with a few exceptions.Just like with the setting the characters arnt really expanded on too much  and seem to be there just to push the story along.Lets start off with the biggest complaint, that would be our protagonist Ayato who alot of people have referred to him as being worst than Kirito in terms of plot convenience.I however don\'t really see it that way, i mean yes he is pretty generic and pulls his abilities out of his ass when he is losing however lets take a second and compare him to another battle harem protagonist from the same anime season.Lets compare Ayato to Ikki from Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, both are fairly generic and pull off random abilities when losing but i would like to give Ayato a little bit of credit from where Ikki falls painfully short.First off Ayato has a reason to pull off his abilities when in trouble seeing as how his sister sealed most of his power away when he was a child making it painful for him to draw on it for fairly short periods of time.In a tactical sense lets compare it to Ichigo\'s Vizard mask where he could only maintain it for 30 seconds to gain a slight advantage.However with Ikki he pulls wins out of nowhere from pure determination because of sloppy writing, what i mean is that he should not be winning every single fight when prior to the series starting he had never won a fight in his entire life.This is why i preferred Ayato over Ikki because it felt more realistic to have someone draw on hidden power and win than for someone to win because the plot called for it.The other thing i prefer about Ayato is he has a goal to try to accomplish where as Ikki just wants to get stronger, and yes i know all characters want to get stronger but Ayato has a reason to get stronger where Ikki on the other hand does not.Ikki just wants to be stronger because that\'s what the plot calls for not because he has some goal to achieve.As for the rest of the cast most of it is just a bunch of anime tropes aside from one character in the end which serves to be the polar opposite of Ayato.Where Ayato wants to get stronger in order to find and protect his sister while still being a good and honorable person, This character Also wants to protect her sister but is willing to go to any length to do this even if it means hurting people who probably didn\'t deserve it.Overall the show is fairly generic but it was still enjoyable to watch each week and was far superior to that other battle harem we were introduced to in the same anime season.Its not exactly something i would recommend of the top of my head but if i was asked what a good battle harem show would be then this would probably come to mind first......well this or

I TRIED TO REVEAL AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, WHILE STILL COMMENTING ON CERTAIN PARTS OF THE SHOWI don\'t write many reviews. When I finish a show I usually just give it a score and move on to the next one.HOWEVERSometimes a show comes up that I just need to rant about, for good or bad reasons. I would consider the scores I give out very generous. I have seen complaints about ""inflated"" scores on MAL where people give out scores on a scale similar to a school grading system where a 5 or 6 is the lowest they...will give a show, however I consider my scores generous because I rate them on the 1-10 scale but tend to give a lot of shows an extra point or two. I don\'t like giving out low scores and I try to find something good or something I liked in everything I watch. So naturally if give out a score of 1, it means I wasn\'t able to find anything I enjoyed in it. I rarely give out a score like this and I really just wanted rant about this show and why I gave it this score. Now after this really long introduction I present the meaningless opinion of a random anime fan on the internet about The Asterisk War.Story : 1This is probably one of the reasons I tend to be generous with scores. I usually don\'t notice any problems with the story of a show unless I find it confusing, boring, or has very obvious flaws. The Asterisk War was all three of these for me. I was confused, because I had no clue what the point of this show was. Ayato shows up at the school for no good reason and with no objective in mind. The show introduces a huge upcoming tournament between the other schools in Asterisk, so we are made to assume that the point is going to be to win this tournament BUT WHY. Ayato did not know about this tournament before coming to the school so he was not planning on participating in it at all, and also we don\'t know what winning this tournament will do for any of the characters or what the consequences of them losing are. There are also parts in the show where these ""antagonists"" say ambiguous things about needing to win the tournament (which it is still not clear what winning accomplishes) and about how Ayato needs to be eliminated. Why does Ayato (I will talk about what I think of his character later) have to be eliminated? He is shown to be completely overpowered, but he is also shown to know just as much about what is going on in this story as we do. How is Ayato going to get in their way if he has no goal he is trying to accomplish, and has no clue who you even are. We don\'t know why Ayoto is even here or why he does anything he does, we don\'t know what these ""antagonists"" are trying to accomplish, so basically THERE IS NO STORY. Over the course of an entire series we learn NOTHING about the goals of any of the characters, or what the point of story is. I also found this story very boring as well. I am a sucker for good action and you would think that one of the generic school battle light novel adaptations would at least have some good action, but many of the action scenes were boring and unmemorable. The only fight I really remember is the fight between Ayato and Harem Girl #4, because it was one of the only even fights in the entire show. Characters in this show are so overpowered a lot of fights tend to be completely one sided and will either end in a matter of seconds, or feature characters getting the shit beaten out of them for way too long. There are also a plethora of plot holes and contrivances that I noticed on my own, and noticed even more of after reading some other reviews of the show. I don\' want to get into spoiler territory so I\'ll only mention the stupid moment from the first episode where Ayato saves Harem Girl #1 from being shot and HER ATTEMPTED MURDER IS COMPLETELY IGNORED. I wish I was joking, Harem Girl #1 was SHOT AT and after a cringeworthy boob grab the incident is never brought up again. The story (if you can even call it a story) is so bad I can\'t even think of a word that can describe how bad I think it is. There does not seem to be any point to this story, combined with the fact that it is just plain boring for 90% of the show, and all the blatant plot holes that are ever present I award the story with a score of 1. I honestly would give it a 0 if I could, because in my opinion a show needs to actually have a story to be given a score for one.Art & Sound : 7This show was done by A-1 Pictures, and A-1 Pictures shows tend to be 50-50 with me. Half of the things A-1 releases I will like and the other half I will despise, however one thing I always usually like about A-1 shows is the Art and Sound. I found the art in this show to be at their usual quality, the show was very colorful and had some decent animation. The only complaint I have is that there wasn\'t really anything that stood out to me, it was just the A-1 Pictures standard which isn\'t bad, but nothing worthy of praise. I feel the same way about the sound as well. The only track from the show that really stood out was the ending. (The ending song is one of my favorite endings of all time) Aside from the ending there wasn\'t really anything to praise about the sound. Even if I did find the Art and Sound to be okay it is not enough to save the show, and had very little impact on my overall score.Characters : 1I forgive bad characters in shows a lot, because some of the shows I enjoyed the most didn\'t have the best characters, but I have never come across a show where I hated EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER. Earlier I said I would talk about what I think of Ayato, but it is hard to talk about Ayatos character, as he has almost no character traits. Does he have likes, dislikes, goals, motivation, strengths, weaknesses, emotions, or anything that makes it seem like he has a fraction of a personality? NO! I thought I had seen the rock bottom of generic protagonists, because I didn\'t think it was possible to make a ""character"" without any character traits whatsoever. I would mention the rest of the main cast one by one, but I honestly don\' think I can write more than a sentence about each of them. So the rest of the main cast or as I like to call them ""Harem Girls 1-4"" are nothing more than than the standard harem cast. They at least have some personality, unlike the protagonist, however only Harem Girl #1 and Harem Girl #2 seem like they are going to be important. Many of the characters just feel pointless, even members of the main cast. I just plain hated every character in the show and I don\'t know what else to say, because there isn\'t much character to talk about for the character section.Enjoyment : 1What can I say that I didn\'t already say? I found no entertainment in this show, I don\'t know I didn\'t drop this show. The only reason I decided to write this review is because this was the only anime I have ever felt contains no entertainment value at all.ConclusionUnless you are looking to watch something bad, I would not recommend this to anybody. Even if you are a fan of school battle light novels I wouldn\'t recommend this. This show is just plain bad, its not even the type of bad where its unintentionally funny, it has no redeeming qualities or anything that makes it worth watching. If you want to see just how bad a show can be then you can force yourself to suffer through this show, if you want entertainment then you are in the wrong place. To sum up my opinion of this show in one word ""DON\'T"" will give a show, however I consider my scores generous because I rate them on the 1-10 scale but tend to give a lot of shows an extra point or two. I don\'t like giving out low scores and I try to find something good or something I liked in everything I watch.

If you want to see just how bad a show can be then you can force yourself to suffer through this show, if you want entertainment then you are in the wrong place. To sum up my opinion of this show in one word ""DON\'T""', 'So, how do I begin with? As I am writing this, the LN series has over for a year. Since this is one of my first anime I really adore so mostly this post for making my soul move on once and for all.This is, Fall of 2015, where you have big series like Noragami, One Punch Man and Haikyuu. They somewhat had been blown up and still be very memorable to recent date. And then, you have the three similar anime: Asterisk War, Failed Knight and Team 35. Let\'s put 35 aside and comparing the rest two, and I have to tell you, they...are VERY similar on the first episode. And, throughout of that time, there were having battle between fandom of these two and not surprisingly, Asterisk was the worse one.Story and Characters:Believe me or not, the concept of the story is great and have many way to utilize. You have the world after the apocalypse, the superpowers and the element that runs in your vein that will be unleased, that is cool.But... Somehow all of the characters are having the mind of 12 with great flatness so it completely destroyed the series. Surely, there are plenty of way to asking where is your sister, Ayato (the MC), not just have to joining battle and win the meaningless tournament??The MC only have two mission to join the academy: Finding sister and purposes of his life. Sure, maybe the only way is to winning it but at LEAST make it more difficult like asking: ""Is there any way else?"" But, no, he is so braindead that still that flat asf.Also, it is completely pointless to helping Julis to win though. And with the cheery on top, the MC want to make Julis is his own purpose of life. Excuse me? That\'s not romantic, that is creepy.With the rest of the harem, you can find its trope on any R18 sites, thank you.No character development for them (and for the MC too).If only the author was attention to his pieces and giving the MC more thoughts and more decision than just bring out your sword everywhere on the map, this can be a great anime.Surely, this utterly making this high school fantasy powers with OP transferring male student having ultimate aura which catching some girls type disappeared from the anime map forever. (No, please don\'t bring Bahamut shit into this.)Music:This is the only reason I will ever watch it again, so good in composing and executing. The vibes of making the city on water with high-tech is so on point, giving you really live in that world.Art and Visual:A-1 and LN adaptation, name more of a destructive duo at that time. Yet, still delivering the worst AI model. Were they lacking of funds or what? Sorry, the cheap harem trope doesn\'t work. At least the main drawing is good enough.Enjoyment:I like futuristic cites battle like this. Hell, the concept of batting is also great too. It\'s just, everywhere is not good enough to be adequate. The only character I like is Jullis and her relationship with the MC.Sadly, it was a huge boo. A huge mistake to make an anime to even compete with the one with the same genre. Failed Knights only takes 12 episodes to complete the journey, making huge steps, and completes its simple story, while their 12th episode doesn\'t finish the tournament. If it\'s just, just take it longer to patch out some obvious hole, wait for its time, then maybe, it will shine.Thank you for the great memories, goodbye. are VERY similar on the first episode.

But, no, he is so braindead that still that flat asf.Also, it is completely pointless to helping Julis to win though. And with the cheery on top, the MC want to make Julis is his own purpose of life. Excuse me? That\'s not romantic, that is creepy.With the rest of the harem, you can find its trope on any R18 sites, thank you.No character development for them (and for the MC too).If only the author was attention to his pieces and giving the MC more thoughts and more decision than just bring out your sword everywhere on the map, this can be a great anime.Surely, this utterly making this high school fantasy powers with OP transferring male student having ultimate aura which catching some girls type disappeared from the anime map forever. (No, please don\'t bring Bahamut shit into this.)Music:This is the only reason I will ever watch it again, so good in composing and executing. The vibes of making the city on water with high-tech is so on point, giving you really live in that world.Art and Visual:A-1 and LN adaptation, name more of a destructive duo at that time. Yet, still delivering the worst AI model. Were they lacking of funds or what? Sorry, the cheap harem trope doesn\'t work. At least the main drawing is good enough.Enjoyment:I like futuristic cites battle like this. Hell, the concept of batting is also great too. It\'s just, everywhere is not good enough to be adequate. The only character I like is Jullis and her relationship with the MC.Sadly, it was a huge boo. A huge mistake to make an anime to even compete with the one with the same genre. Failed Knights only takes 12 episodes to complete the journey, making huge steps, and completes its simple story, while their 12th episode doesn\'t finish the tournament. If it\'s just, just take it longer to patch out some obvious hole, wait for its time, then maybe, it will shine.Thank you for the great memories, goodbye.', ""Spoiler free review:Oh, I wanna cry! :( The beginning of the anime was so amazing and it looked really promising. BUT, when you find yourself checking your phone and constantly get an overview of how many episodes it is left before the anime ends then there was just one solution.... I just had to drop it.Now, I didn't really expect anything from this series. In a way, maybe that was a good thing. I think that the sad thing is that the main characters, Ayato and Julis both had good background stories for this anime to become something reaaaally good. Let's also look at...the art style, I gave it a 10 because LOOK AT THE ART STYLE! :O Originally that was what made me watch this anime in the first place.However the story progressed from outstanding in the 2 first episodes to just fading away. I watched 8 out of 12 episodes of this and I have to say I didn't really see where the whole series was going at this point. It's a shame it had to be in a harem setting because if there had been some more male characters and they had more duels the potential for this anime story line would have been endless.I put the second season on my to watch list as well but now that i dropped the first one i really don't think I will enjoy the second one either.If you are looking for a series you don't have to put your mind into that much and you DON'T have other animes that you have to watch then I would say you could give this anime a try. Otherwise, save yourself the hours of watching this anime and go watch an anime that is more interesting. the art style, I gave it a 10 because LOOK AT THE ART STYLE! :O Originally that was what made me watch this anime in the first place.However the story progressed from outstanding in the 2 first episodes to just fading away.

So firstly I know people tend to hate on it due to the severe lack of any real character progression or depth.In my opinion the anime redeems itself:...1 - with its stellar visuals and sound,2 - with its likeable, fun and caricatured (although often 2 -dimensional) characters3 - by being fun to watch.(keep in mind  this is far from a masterpiece, but if you're looking for such, you are looking in the wrong place my friend)However, it does leave the plot as an afterthought, but it is kinda there. I hope the second season addresses this.It has great action and the premise/setting is quite interesting.If you are an SAO fangirl/boy - bless your soul - this anime will probably fill that Kirito shaped whole in your heart if you're unable to find another anime that quenches your thirst for too nice OP harem dudes with swords and scruffy hair.I think this review covered most of the bases...

Fanservice realization is shitty,ecci elements are presented too bad at all.After several of watched episodes, relations between Ayato and girls ,who are always surrounding him, are becoming too boring to you.Major time of that anime(75-80%) you can see only THESE simple romantic relations.It is a copy of other anime with similar genre.The plot(can contain spoilers)Beginning is looking like: ""main hero accidentally running into girl and see her without any clothes.Then she is suggesting him to take...part in duel,cause she wanna revenge for that accident.Of course,Ayato accepts it and wins.And relations between Ayato and Julis begin...""And so on...So typical for harems.The plot is predictable and very simple.

Soon.', 'Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is one of the shows you really hope would be good especially because how awesome the premise of the show was but after watching about six episodes, you will wonder if the show is ever going to get better, but then you realize the sad fact it’s not and you really question if you will ever get that free time you had back from watching this show.The story 3/10The story to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is students in six different academies fighting each other in tournaments to see who’s the best in the district is, also the winners can acquire money and...become famous if they get first place in these tournaments. This sounded awesome to me because I thought it was going to be a competitive show with some amazing fight scenes, but the show didn’t do that at all and went a completely different direction. What the show does focuses on is having the main character Ayato Amagiri save everyone time and time again to add more people to his harem which can get really repetitive and boring, this show also focuses on a lot on clichés and you will start to question if you are watching something you seen before in the past. When the show does progress through the story you will feel like at times it doesn’t really know where it wants to go so it tries to add new stuff without explaining where anything comes from, which can get really hard to follow and it sucks because I wanted to know what they were talking about. The show also feels like they rushed a lot of parts dealing with the main story, when they didn’t need to do that because they had two filler episodes that didn’t need to happen.The characters 2/10The characters are probably the worst part of the show because there generic, boring and not very relatable. The main character Ayato is probably the most generic character out of all them, he’s that character that’s way to strong and has nothing to him that makes him interesting as a character. For the other four main characters there’s not much to explain but hear it goes. For the main female lead Julis, she is just one of those characters that gets angry at everything the main character does for no reason. For the second leading female Saya, she is just the character that’s clueless most of the time and makes those repetitive jokes where she wants a bigger chest. The third leading female Kirin, she is the character that’s really shy and gets nervous pretty easily from pretty much anything and for the last female lead Claudia she is the character that’s just there for fan service, there is nothing to her that’s unique. They did offer little things about their past for each character on why they wanted to fight in the tournaments and why they needed the prize money but surprisingly gave us nothing about the characters that was all that interesting or helping the characters grow from that experience and they were also way too short and some characters didn’t have them at all, which was disappointing.The art 5/10The art design on the characters were okay but it felt like they were very generic. The backgrounds were decent, there wasn’t much to complain about. For the fight scenes though I felt like some were decent but then some focus way too much on these huge effects and made the fights feel poorly down which I felt they could have left out by not doing them or just doing them right.Sound 5/10The opening song really didn’t do it for me, it felt like every other opening song to any other show, which isn’t bad but isn’t good either but the ending song to me was really good and was the thing I was looking forward to for each episode. The voice actors to me weren’t the greatest and some of them could be very annoying sometimes well watching the show, but mainly for the supporting cast not the main characters.Enjoyment 2/10I didn’t enjoy this at all and it’s frustrating because the only thing I enjoyed was the ending song which to me isn’t a good thing, but I guess it could have been worse.Overall 3/10This show is terrible and it’s not because it’s a harem anime, it’s not good because of the story, the clichés and the terrible characters.

I wonder how many times had this premise been used...?The story doesn\'t delve into any of the world building, instead focusing on the interactions of Ayato between his fellow schoolmates and acquaintances. I find that this is an incredibly lazy way to introduce the viewer to the world of Asterisk and in all honesty, it feels like the story is expressly trying to skirt the effort needed to establish a solid scifi/magic world, going even as far as to completely leave out the basic workings of magic and the ""disaster"" that had caused the aforementioned magic to manifest in some humans.After watching through halfway of the show, there was still no sign of the world being established and the rules that supposedly binded the way everything worked were quickly broken seconds after being introduced.2) CharactersThe characters are walking tropes, I\'m not kidding. That\'s how little they even stand to pass as generic characters. It\'s as if the author just pulled up the TV tropes page and started copying traits that they liked onto the character creation notes.Ayato is the generic cool, strong and flat self-insert protagonist that has a conveniently tragic past that holds ties with the city he is currently inhabiting. He is literally brimming with shounen spirit, from his ""hidden power"" to the fact that his personality is as rich as a drab card of wet cardboard.Since Ayato is a run-of-the-mill shounen lead, it is natural for him to be surrounded on all sides by hungry hungry women out to get his man meat. The girls that fawn over him are red haired tsundere, big tits blondie, deadpan loli and the shy girl that can never stop blushing and/or stuttering.While Ayato does possess some form of flimsy evidence and motivation for his actions in the pursuit for his missing sister, most of the time his sister is never mentioned until the plot absolutely demands it. For the girls... their character motivations are hard to follow and most of the time they sit there waiting for Ayato to come save them.3) ArtThe art of the show feature a myriad of warm colors and solid animations. Just don\'t expect the show to live up to the hype it\'s getting.4) SoundThe soundtrack for the show was decent, but nothing to write home about.As for the VAs, they did their job well enough as a team.5) EnjoymentI did not manage to find enjoyment in watching this show. For me, it was a mess of cliches and ideas that were hastily stuck together with duct tape and superglue.6) OverallI wouldn\'t want to recommend this to anyone, as the show had very poor writing and had little to no useful information. I would suggest checking out the other shows under this category as they likely have more entertainment value compared to Gakusen. Hell, Gakusen can\'t even serve as a good time-killer.But who am I to tell you what shows to watch? Take this review seriously or with a pinch of salt, I don\'t really care. Cheers.

Cheers.', 'I decided to write a review for this show because it\'s actually rather easy to.This might even be the shortest review you will ever need that makes sense.*Some spoilers ahead*This season, two very similar anime came out namely this one and Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry. While the battle systems may be different, they are in essence almost parallel anime. Both have ""overpowered"" MCs, red headed princess heroines that use fire. Both are in a school setting with a battle tournament going on. Basically when you\'ve seen one, once you see the other you feel like you\'re watching the same anime. Except they aren\'t the same...in which one outperforms the other, namely Rakudai Kishi is better than Asterisk in every aspect. You might think Rakudai kishi will start off as another harem romance anime, but it\'s not. There is a clear romance between the two main characters that actually makes it refreshing to see. They fight for the promise they made to each other, and it\'s a pretty simple yet believable reason to, unlike in Asterisk where typically the guy makes no real love interest and flirts with everyone while being oblivious, albeit choosing to ""fight"" for the red-head princess heroine. No motive, not love, just ""she showed me the reason to fight"" kinda cheesy shit.While the main stories of both animes might be generic or even mediocre, it\'s the subtle differences in their execution that really makes the difference between ""I\'m sick of this same old shit"" and ""that was actually quite nice"".TL;DRGakusen Toshi Asterisk is basically Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, except Asterisk is below mediocre while the latter is better. Watch both if you have the time and like the typical harem/romance/school/overpoweredMC but otherwise watch Rakudai over Asterisk.Plain and Simple. in which one outperforms the other, namely Rakudai Kishi is better than Asterisk in every aspect.

Now I\'m not saying that all of these animes are bad. For example, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry didn\'t seem special at first but it did a good job. Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is an example of the opposite. The plot could\'ve been better, the storyline was ehhh, the development was crap, the... okay I\'ll just show everything I say in each category.Story: 3/10Since it\'s ultra cliche and nothing new, I don\'t have much...to say. For a whole entire season of 12 episodes, it didn\'t really go anywhere much. Honestly I think it might get somewhere in the second season, with all those mysteries they\'ve presented, but I still have my doubts.Also, what I HATE is about how the harem practically takes over the anime and wipes out the point of the story. There should be a balanced ratio between the harem and the actual plot, but there wasn\'t here. :/Art: 7/10Art wouldn\'t really affect how much I like the anime. The art was good, no problems with it, so that\'s that. Doesn\'t suddenly make it a good anime, though, if you were thinking anything like that.Sound: 5/10The ED was nice, but I really didn\'t like the OP and the OST really wasn\'t all that memorable. There wasn\'t even one that left a mark on my brain as ""great"" or anything, so I wouldn\'t call their soundtracks that successful. They did establish the moods well enough during the scenes though, so it\'s not so bad.Character: 1/10Alright so, like I said before, it\'s a harem (which by the way was done wrong). The main character, Ayato, is a boy who is quite strong and is probably the most bland character I\'ve ever seen in anime. You can totally predict his reactions to things, and he\'s just so NOT well-thought. Then there are the girls who are part of the harem itself: Julis, Saya, Claudia, & Kirin. Pretty much all of them want Ayato\'s D, but the annoying part is that right after they meet him, they\'re already part of the freaking harem. They don\'t even have any reasons for liking him. I like the kind of harems where the characters\' love for the MC slowly develops for a certain reason. This one was just adding random characters for the sake of a harem and ecchi moments because Why not? Not to mention that they don\'t even give you a choice about who you should ship with the MC, they make it so obvious who\'s meant to be with him; they just add the other harem characters so we can have more tits in the show. Sometimes that\'s okay if the other characters are still important, but I wouldn\'t call the other characters THAT important.The female lead, Julis, is also one of those cliche pink-haired tsundere girls that is just put with the role of the female lead and the role of being meant to be with Ayato just because she looked ideal. They really were running out of ideas, so they must\'ve thought, ""Well all these types of animes have the pink-haired tsundere female lead!""Also, I barely saw any character development so all the characters were quite boring. The MC being an overpowered yet empty-headed ding-dong, and all the other girls just taking up random roles for the harem, and all the other side characters somehow contributing for the sake of the number of characters... I can\'t even say that the characters were horrible; this was the most pathetic crap I\'ve seen in a while, it\'s like all the way down there. (Not literally *coughs*)Enjoyment: 1/10I tried to be patient with this anime, honestly. At first it didn\'t seem special, but there are a lot of good animes that are based off of light novels so I gave Asterisk several chances to the point I even finished the anime. But I got no satisfaction. Not even ONE part of the anime happened to impress me. There was never enough suspense. I kept waiting, waiting, waiting for it to seem like a good anime for once, but it never happened. I guess you could say the last episode was suspenseful, but it still didn\'t work enough on me. :/ And really? Making it seem suspenseful only on the last episode? That was way too long of a wait for me, and they didn\'t even impress me enough by THEN.Overall: 3/10So yeah, I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to you unless you have literally nothing to do with your life and have watched all of the good animes in the whole world. Or if you want to join us who don\'t like this thing. I REALLY hope it ends up being better in the second season (and oh yes, I\'m giving the second season a chance, because I\'m still trying to be a stubborn and patient anime watcher) but this season was crap whether the second turns out good or not.Oh and also, a list of the cliches that I can think of:-Overpowered bland male MC-Harem for the sake of ecchi-Magic school with magic weapons where you master magic-Magic school has a competition-Pink-haired tsundere female lead-No reason for the girls to like MC... they just do-loli female childhood friend (part of the harem obviously too)-the assertive female! (part of the harem as well!)-the high-pitched tiny cute female! (Oh look another harem character) to say. For a whole entire season of 12 episodes, it didn\'t really go anywhere much. Honestly I think it might get somewhere in the second season, with all those mysteries they\'ve presented, but I still have my doubts.Also, what I HATE is about how the harem practically takes over the anime and wipes out the point of the story.

I like the kind of harems where the characters\' love for the MC slowly develops for a certain reason. This one was just adding random characters for the sake of a harem and ecchi moments because Why not? Not to mention that they don\'t even give you a choice about who you should ship with the MC, they make it so obvious who\'s meant to be with him; they just add the other harem characters so we can have more tits in the show. Sometimes that\'s okay if the other characters are still important, but I wouldn\'t call the other characters THAT important.The female lead, Julis, is also one of those cliche pink-haired tsundere girls that is just put with the role of the female lead and the role of being meant to be with Ayato just because she looked ideal. They really were running out of ideas, so they must\'ve thought, ""Well all these types of animes have the pink-haired tsundere female lead!""Also, I barely saw any character development so all the characters were quite boring. The MC being an overpowered yet empty-headed ding-dong, and all the other girls just taking up random roles for the harem, and all the other side characters somehow contributing for the sake of the number of characters... I can\'t even say that the characters were horrible; this was the most pathetic crap I\'ve seen in a while, it\'s like all the way down there. (Not literally *coughs*)Enjoyment: 1/10I tried to be patient with this anime, honestly. At first it didn\'t seem special, but there are a lot of good animes that are based off of light novels so I gave Asterisk several chances to the point I even finished the anime. But I got no satisfaction. Not even ONE part of the anime happened to impress me. There was never enough suspense. I kept waiting, waiting, waiting for it to seem like a good anime for once, but it never happened. I guess you could say the last episode was suspenseful, but it still didn\'t work enough on me. :/ And really? Making it seem suspenseful only on the last episode? That was way too long of a wait for me, and they didn\'t even impress me enough by THEN.Overall: 3/10So yeah, I wouldn\'t recommend this anime to you unless you have literally nothing to do with your life and have watched all of the good animes in the whole world. Or if you want to join us who don\'t like this thing. I REALLY hope it ends up being better in the second season (and oh yes, I\'m giving the second season a chance, because I\'m still trying to be a stubborn and patient anime watcher) but this season was crap whether the second turns out good or not.Oh and also, a list of the cliches that I can think of:-Overpowered bland male MC-Harem for the sake of ecchi-Magic school with magic weapons where you master magic-Magic school has a competition-Pink-haired tsundere female lead-No reason for the girls to like MC... they just do-loli female childhood friend (part of the harem obviously too)-the assertive female! (part of the harem as well!)-the high-pitched tiny cute female! (Oh look another harem character)', ""Only one time during my entire viewing of this, did I ever think to myself 'that is pretty cool'. That was in episode 11.There is nothing redeeming about this piece of animation. The story is boring: its a rehash of your average tournament plot with harem elements that fails to make any sense. It attempts intrigue through plots and spying. It only achieves ennui as the show fails to explain its own plot points, or even the basic mechanics of how the magic system works. There is no world building here. I can only imagine that the light novel contains the information necessary to understand...the basics of what happens here.This lack of understanding of the system gets to be incredibly frustrating whenever there is a fight scene. The stakes of this show are never set. From the first fight scene there is no explanation of the power level. From the first episode, I had no idea what was an important attack, or what could kill, or if the point of all this fighting was to kill. The fireballs Julis slings seemed to do no damage whatsoever in the beginning of the show. However everyone seems to be afraid of these small yellow arrows that are fired from weird wrist gauntlets, to the point where anyone would think those arrows can kill people with one strike. In later scenes we see bullets are able to hurt the genestella, but when we come to the tournament everyone is using energy guns that, despite their seemingly immense power, rarely hurt other genestella. It leads me to question why this is happening.We know from the first scene of the first episode that these weapons have the capacity to kill. But the tournaments themselves don't require a contestant to murder an opponent to continue. Are the weapons being modulated, so that they only stun people on contact? We know they aren't, because the protagonist is able to slice through weapons like a lightsaber through warm butter. Was it an accident? Or an actual fight to the death? We never find out. It seems like it would be pretty easy to find out, considering all of these duels between the genestella seem to be televised and incredibly popular, despite being incredibly dangerous.In short, the plot is nonsensical and the more you think about it, the more you are left wondering why you are watching.The characters are cliches. I would say only one character has an interesting moment as we learn about her and her weapon. Otherwise the characters make no sense. They were written first to be archetypes and characters much later. Rarely are the characters reasonable. If their actions are supposed to actually make sense in context of the universe, then the show fails to allow the characters to explain, or the explanations fail to justify their actions.The main character himself is honestly the most annoying character there is. He is one of these Genestella, which are this race of supermen that apparently can kill people easily with their hands, and are able to easily survive drops from multi-story buildings. He is probably one of the densest MCs ever. His only redeeming quality is that he is not a jerk. And he is good with his super sword. That's it. I have no clue why he is attractive to any of the women in this show, except maybe the one 13 year old character. She would be, realistically infatuated with him from their interactions. I feel like the only reason this happened however is random chance. Considering how all of the other character motivations are a pit of tangled vipers that make no sense, I would attribute this one realistic interaction to accident rather than any sort of coordinated effort on the writer's part. After all, even a broken clock is right twice a day.To summarize, the characters make no sense. Their motivations are secrets that are usually not revealed, and when they are revealed its either in a ham-fisted manner, or the knowledge does not improve my idea of their previous actions.The animation is alright when the show isn't showing anyone fighting. Otherwise the fight scenes look like hell. It is difficult to tell what is going on at best. At worst the animation reinforces the confusion of the overall magic system.  The animation is also pretty inconsistent. For example, there is a scythe weapon in the show that in almost all scenes seemed to change size. One could argue that this is a result of fluctuating magical power, I would argue that its a result of the animation staff messing up the scale. The CG is also pretty mediocre, as it fails to blend well with the rest of the art on display. Overall, there isn't much to see here. Except for skirts sticking to asses.The music is alright. It was used appropriately to help guide the emotional subject of the various scenes. The songs are pretty good, and they are nice to listen to outside of the context of the show. The end credit song is pretty good. The sound design itself is awful. The weapons all sound like cheap plastic toys when they are being handled. Also, I think the sound that the swords make while slashing through the air was actually stolen from Star Wars, and then slightly modified to prevent law suit.Overall this show bring little to the table. I would honestly question how this anime got made. I would not recommend this show to anyone, except as a way to deconstruct what makes a bad anime. In that regard I think this show would be very educational. Otherwise I had to force myself through the ending of this show. I only did this because I wanted to be able to follow a series of videos put out by a youtuber that I liked.If you are looking for an enjoyable harem show, I recommend My Bride is a Mermaid.

Yes, yes you have, and this anime is nothing special. Hell, there is another anime this season that has a similar premise and presentation. Yet it is able to entertain, even with its “seen this before” premise and its generic tropes used. Though a flawed anime, it’s guilty pleasure anime may please some, though it may disinterest others too. Nevertheless, its high production values are sure to pull in some viewers...in.~{Story}~The plot focuses on Amagiri Ayato and how he transfers to Seidoukan Academy to find his missing sister, or it was supposed to focus on that. The anime quickly crosses out that storyline for the sake of focusing on Ayato teaming with with Julis, a rapier-wielding love interest for the protagonist, and together they compete in the Phoenix Festa. Along the way, Ayato meets other competitors such as Saya and Kirin, who are all just here to be added in Ayato’s harem list. And… that’s it! It’s as generic as it sounds. As obvious as it is, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk’s story isn’t its strong points. It would have been a lot better if the story focused on Ayato’s lost sister rather than the festival, as the festival storyline is filled with “seen this, done that” type of stuff. However it’s not terrible, as it still works. However this is just the first half of what they will present to us, so hopefully its second half ends up breaking its generic storyline in half.Story: 4/10~{Presentation}~As a fantasy action, ecchi, harem, school anime, it does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Main characters competes with skilled opponents, proves he’s the stronger one, gets all the ladies, and rinse and repeat. A-1 Pictures probably didn’t have an issue doing this anime as they have done things like these before. However, as expected from A-1 Pictures, the production value for this anime is splendid. And this anime doesn’t seem like it wants to escape from its generic tropes as its having a fine time standing out because of its quality production values. Those who are fans of the genres this tackles will have a fine time with Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, but those who aren’t aren’t going think differently about these types of anime after watching this; it might just make it worse.Presentation: 4/10~{Character}~Gakusen Toshi Asterisk consists of one main male character and a near-handful of female characters, because it’s a harem, what did you expect! Ayato is your typical fantasy-harem protagonist. He’s an underrated competitor and most of the girls go gaga over him. He is particularly that interesting as he doesn’t stand out much compared to other protagonists of similar series. The main female character, Julis, is also quite typical, cliché-driven too. They try to add a backstory for her to make her seem like a developed character, but it ends up ineffective. There are other female characters such as Claudia (I have no idea why she’s so interested in Ayato) who is your typical “horny-for-protagonist” type of character, Saya, who is your typical emotionless girl who believe she deserved to be with Ayato because she knows hime more, and Kirin is your typical deredere kohai who gained self-esteem and confidence from the protagonist. As I probably mention before repeatedly, the characters feel very typical and their interactions between one another is nothing special considering it is an ecchi-harem. However, since the female characters are attractive, fun-enough, and cute, they end up being likeable, even if there characters you’ve seen before.Character: 6/10~{Art}~,A-1 Pictures doesn’t disappoint again as the art is beautiful in Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. The colors are vivid and a treat to the eye. The backgrounds are well detailed and it’s just gorgeous to look at. The character design is also really good, and they help the characters be a little more interesting than they actually are. However, even the art style is very typical. It’s the same type of art you would expect in a fantasy-school anime, but it works well. The character designs, though great, are still “seen this already” type of character looks. Never has this anime made me think that they could have made the art better here.Art: 7/10~{Animation}~Animation quality is also fantastic. The style is the same as every other fantasy school anime, but it works very well. Everything is very smooth and it looks gorgeous. Fight scenes were also animated really well. Although some fights were cut short in length, that’s not a fault for the animation. A-1 Pictures tends to give all their best when it comes to animating anime and Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is no exception. Production values are top-notch and it’s one of the bigger redeeming points of the anime. If you’re not a fan of these types of anime, at least try it out for the animation quality.Animation: 7/10~{Voice Acting}~The voice acting is good in this anime, though really nothing special. Ayato is voiced by Tamaru Atsushi and he gets the job done. He’s nothing too special, and he isn’t than well know either. Interestingly, he voice acts another ecchi-harem protagonist this season; Kimito from Shomin Sample. Kakuma Ai voices Julis and she does a decent job with the character. For most of the time, she gives a masculine tone to Julis which is nice to see, and is able to make Julis have a deredere tone is a quick second. Claudia is voice acted by Touyama Nao, who happens to be one of the more well-known seiyuu of the cast, does a really good job making Claudia sensual and lusty. Izawa Shiori does Saya, and she also does a very good job being emotionless (it doesn’t really require much skills, does it?). Ozawa Ari does a great job of being cute adorable for Kirin. Overall it’s a decent job from the cast, even if it’s them following tropes to fill in for their characters. Some characters were teased at the end for the second season, so I’m hoping I’ll find some characters I really care about.Voice Acting: 5/10~{Music}~The anime’s opening is pretty good and it built up on me more and more every time I watched it. It’s got some pretty catchy beats, however it’s the type of anime that will be in every other fantasy, school, harem anime. The ending is also really good. Actually, I like it better than the OP. It’s solemn and beautiful. However, it totally doesn’t match the anime much. The background music is okay, nothing too great. The techno beats used during fights are mediocre, nothing that will boost your adrenaline. That is prettt disappointing, considering most of A-1 Pictures anime consists of good OST, especially ones that are similar to Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. Not to mention than A-1 Pictures didn’t do the greatest with Subete ga F ni Naru’s OST either.Music: 5.5/10~{Enjoyment}~The anime is enjoyable at times, but mostly it gets irritating as it feels like as if I’m already seen this before. The cliché-driven presentation, the story being unfocused at time, and characters being rehashes of what we’ve seen before make me disinterested about this anime. However it’s high production value pull me back in. And even if it’s typical, it’s typical for a reason; because people still find these entertaining. Luckily it was well paced, even with some episodes there just do waste time.Enjoyment: 5/10Overall, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk is a decent anime that gets to be entertaining enough, even with its rehashed presentation because of its production values and animation quality. However, we only got to see half of what Gakusen Toshi Asterisk has to offer, we’ll get the rest on spring. And hopefully it will be better, more enjoyable and will make this season look like more of a buildup of what it has to offer.+ Fantastic production values+ Gorgeous art and animations+ Though cliché-driven, it’s still somewhat enjoyable due to a cute cast.+ The OP and ED are great.- Plot is really nothing special at all, and it doesn’t focus on its main plot at all.- The characters are very typical and generic, even if they look good.Overall: 5.4/10 in.~{Story}~The plot focuses on Amagiri Ayato and how he transfers to Seidoukan Academy to find his missing sister, or it was supposed to focus on that.

This anime is filled with cliche. If you are looking for something original go else ware. If you are just here for the enjoyment of a decent battle harem, it is fine to watch. Story is slower paced, moving a bit at a time. The art works well for the theme. Sound is nothing special, but not annoying. Characters and romance are by far its weakest points. In truth, it is the people who we have yet to meat that have captivate our imagination the best. I.E Ayato's sister and the parents of Saya and Kirin.

Very well done art, great backgrounds, very good integration of CG, bit above average characters. Well done music, and above average voice acting.

Well if you can follow what\'s going on in this world, you\'re one or more up on me. Far as I can figure there was some disaster or other that destroyed the current world order, created a variety of superhumans, who attend highschool in an academic city and engage in  bloodsport as mass entertainment and as a means of determining status.

Going into this anime for those will only lead to disappointment. What it does have however are well structured action scenes. Just make sure to treat the relationship of the MC with the female characters as girls who are friends and not much more than that. It does not really fall into the ""so bad it\'s good"" category just treat it as an enjoyable anime. It probably would...have been received better if it had been released before Rakudai no Kishi and not at the same time the characters of the 2 anime are rather similar but the story itself is a completely different beast. Rakudai is all on the romance. Asterisk on the other hand is more about the action. The ""Romance"" doesn\'t exist. It wouldn\'t surprise anyone if it developed bit is doesn\'t make any real appearance in the anime. have been received better if it had been released before Rakudai no Kishi and not at the same time the characters of the 2 anime are rather similar but the story itself is a completely different beast.

However, per a review online, it did feel like the studio took a ""How To Make Popular Anime: 101"" guide book and followed it to the T.It did feel generic, and the main reason it scores below an 8 for me is that I was hard pressed to \'feel\' anything for the characters. Sure, the harem was likeable. But that does not equal being able to really invest in their character designs or personalities. It didn\'t affect me the way ReLIFE, Toradora, or even Infinite Stratos did.The show was good...for sure, but in a very technical way. The animations were great, the music was good, the harem was good, but it all lacked a certain personality, uniqueness, or air about it. It could have improved much more by going deeper into relationship development or even deeper writing. The political aspects were very interesting to watch and I would like more of that backstory. The writing simply did not strike a particular chord with me, despite being decent. Still enjoyable but fell a bit short, especially compared to Chivalry of a Failed Knight which is shorter but emotionally holds together better.I can see why people hate this show, and there are some valid points there. However, this anime wasn\'t particularly ""horrible"" at any aspect, and it gets most of its points of my rating from enjoyment as opposed to execution.

But if you like it...good for you.Story: 1(Sorta spoilers...? I don\'t know when I cross the line, so just a warning.)I gave it a \'1\' because it was very disappointing. I thought that perhaps if A1 took time to flesh out concepts and arcs the story might shine out of all of their shows and get a 6. For example, the holograms are a good idea but the consistency is not there. With consistency and and fleshing out...the concept, I would really get into this world and understand it a lot better. People are holding it AND controlling it with their mine. Wouldn\'t your hands pass through the hologram? I don\'t get it at all.Any foreshadowing in wordplay or symbolism is horrible. When Julis is sewing Ayato\'s jacket, she talks about coming to the academy for money to put into the orphanage where she (sorta) grew up and where her best friends grew up. The camera then zooms into a photo of the kids at the orphanage including Julis.We automatically know a character is going to be important. Why?The girl next to Julis has white hair, (everyone else has brown/black/dull purple hair), is the only one right up next to Julis, is grinning with Julis, and besides Julis has the biggest grin.Why does it matter? She doesn\'t matter until LATE into the second season.So no consistency, generic plot, (which I didn\'t have to point out) horrible foreshadowing, and everything else (that is wrong with the plot) every reviewer has pointed out on every website from MAL to Youtube to Reddit.Visuals: 4There is one pro before I jump into the cons. I love the color theory, which is the incorporation of colors that seem to go together. Julis\'s eyes and hair color contrast each other and a good shot of her face in the first episode shows that well! Also the ending theme kinda shows color theory in some shots.But the animation is average most of the time to horrible in some shots. So I don\'t have much to say about. Lots of things feel unnatural, like Julis\'s hair looking completely still and dry due to hair spray...I guess, and Ayato\'s jumping animation is really, really choppy.Flashing lights and directing is fucking horrible and ruins what could\'ve been okay fight scenes. Props to you A1.Sound: 7I can barely ever hear music when I\'m focusing on the stupidity of the plot and trying to put it together in my mind with no avail. Shit.I bet it\'s even more lack luster than the anime its self.That being said, A1 just wasted (the critically acclaimed) Rasmus Faber\'s time. The ending and opening isn\'t bad though but should\'ve been used in a different, better sci-fi/cyberpunk not high school/romance/harem/ecchi anime.Yet it was great music and if the soundtrack had a better anime to work with I bet the music would\'ve been EPIC!!!Character: 1Being my first review, I think that the rating system is a bit flawed but I shouldn\'t talk about this in my review, to me characters are apart of the plot but I\'m going to talk at all about it.Half these characters are shit and worthless stereotypes. I wanted a yandere character to murder all the bitches in the anime then murder Ayato cause she realized he was an asshole.Ayato is constructed horribly and is a fusion of all harem MCs and all light novel MCs (except Koyomi Araragi, he\'s cool) and becomes a Frankenstein I don\'t wanna read about.Lets go through the bitches\' 2% real personality and 98% stereotype/bad archetype characters!

It\'s called ""The Asterisk War"", But there are no wars whatsoever. Maybe one will appear in season 2 but as far as I\'m concerned it should have been called ""The Academy City on the Water"" because that\'s where its been taken place and there are \'NO\' wars. It\'s terrible series with anime cliches, an annoyingly overpowered main character and forced in fan-service, (BTW, Fan-service is not my cup of tea in general, so that puts more weight into this shit fest of an anime). Even after finishing...Season 1, We are still in the middle of the arc. What kind of series would end a season in the middle of an arc?!  That\'s like Yu Yu Hakusho finishing season 2 at the fourth round of the dark Tournamnet. Ayato is perhaps the worst main character from any anime that I\'ve ever seen. He\'s basically the textbook definition of a Gary-Sue, which I can not stand in storytelling. The supporting characters are also just as bad. We\'ve got Julis, The Typical Tsundere chick. Kirin, The overly cute chick. And Claudia, a psychotic sexual predator, who is probably the worst character in this travesty. They even have the nerve to make the most interesting character a robot. I\'m not even kidding, the best character in this anime isn\'t even a living being... What more can I say... My advice is to stay away from this trash. You\'d get more experience from watching paint dry. Season 1, We are still in the middle of the arc. What kind of series would end a season in the middle of an arc?!

Hasta ahí es pasable, lo que no es aceptable es que este chico se encuentre en varias situaciones en que una chica, aka la amiga de la infancia, la loli esa op, la presi o la pelirroja/rosa tundeare (""algo nunca antes visto"") se le ponen delante invitándole con todas las de la ley a graduarse del club de los vírgenes y el decide salir por patas como si se hubiera dejado el móvil en el autobús.Esto señores, es algo patético y que falla completamente a que simpaticemos con el personaje, ya que cualquiera, y digo cualquiera de los jóvenes adolescentes de quince años que se le ponga a huevo tal oportunidad la desaprovecha voluntariamente, lo que hace que parezca un personaje irreal y difícil de que nos agrade, a parte de que la mayoría de veces concluye en un gag ya mas gastado que el genero de este anime.El torneo es una excusa barata para que los personajes luchen, teniendo un premio mas abstracto que los cuadros de Dalí.Las chicas de la serie, lo que suele destacar de estos animes con ""harem"" para hacerlos algo atractivos, son decepcionantes, no quedando nunca claro de que palo van.Las peleas son un chiste, desde la primera de todas en que son dos rallas de colores chocando, pasando por la que lucha mientras lleva a la chica en brazos y vuela because yes, hasta las finales, cuya tensión radica en que no te metan un flashback con exposición sobre los personajes.En resumen, es un despropósito de anime, el cual gana mucho borracho y viéndolo con amigos, pero que pese a todo no recomiendo mirar.Pd: sigo sin saber a que viene el ""Asterisk"" del titulo.

The best would be mixed feelings. In some ways, I have to admit this show is quite enjoyable, on the other hand, however, some things were implemented so poorly, it was completely wasting the whole watching experience.Firstly, the recommendations for this show are a bit misleading. It is indeed similar to Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, but the plot is completely different (way worse), and later it\'s going into a much different side than Rakudai. If you\'re going to watch it only to experience something similar to Rakudai, there\'s no point. The show...isn\'t written as well as Rakudai. The only similarities are characters, and the ""concept of fights"".The plot is going nowhere. At the beginning of the show, my hopes were high (even though the MAL rating isn\'t really appealing), as the plot was going pretty well. Unfortunately, after a few episodes, everything is hinting to the viewer, that it is going to be another generic, harem anime, with no surprises whatsoever. Firstly, let\'s focus on the relationship between Julis and Ayato. This one is actually the most disappointing, unfortunately. Julis character is written pretty okay (although as generic as possible) - An alienated princess, that doesn\'t even allow people to talk to her, apparently falls into really good relations, with the new student  - our main protagonist. Their whole relationship, at first seemed rushed and forced as hell. They literally, nearly confess their love to each other in episodes 4 or 5(?) But apparently, later on, nothing progresses. Even better, throughout the show, new female characters are introduced, and the majority of them develop romantic feelings for Ayato. This leads to pretty generic, open-ended harem anime, which we saw already a thousand times. From then, the plot lays down on some fights in the arena, mixed with Ayato\'s harem moments. Surprisingly, the story isn\'t as obvious as it seems, which made me pretty excited for the next episodes, while watching this show.Characters aren\'t written really well, especially MC. It\'s your generic, boring male protagonist, that can have every girl he wants, just by staring at her. He\'s a really dull character, with no personality, making many scenes pretty painful to watch. Julis on the other hand, even though written the most generic as possible, is a pretty enjoyable character. She\'s one of those tsundere girls, however, she\'s not as annoying, and unpleasant, as you would expect. Other girls introduced a bit later in the anime, such as Kirin and Saya are just another generic harem girls, trying to bring as much attention of MC, as possible. And their reasoning behind participation in this ""festival"", is nearly almost the same. They have to help their families/friends (by taking the duels to the death?), by raising a significant amount of money (how sweet isn\'t it?), which is pretty cheesy if you ask me.The art and sound are pretty good. I don\'t have high expectations in this aspect usually, nor I\'m not an expert in it. It looks pretty pleasing to me, especially when we talk about the fights. Fighting scenes are done properly, and I was watching them with excitement. The soundtrack was also good. It built the tension properly, and during the fighting scenes, it was implemented properly too.I don\'t know how to classify the Asterisk. It wasn\'t really unpleasant experience to watch it, but also I didn\'t necessarily like it. The show was doing all things wrong compared to Rakudai in my opinion, but I shouldn\'t focus on comparing these two anime. I also think I raised my rating a bit when I thought about the Asterisk as a whole. It isn\'t a top-tier anime, nay it isn\'t even a good anime. I watched it purely because of boredom, and it wasn\'t a bad experience. Overall enjoyment was decent. There was a bit of unknown in the overall story, MC wasn\'t so overpowered as in much similar anime, art was good. I think something between 6 and 7 is a fair rating for this show.When it comes to thinking about watching the 2nd season of the Asterisk, I\'m still uncertain. I\'m kind of invested in the story already, but I\'m also aware there\'s no season 3. If 2nd season is actually better (as indicates MAL rating), then I would be pretty mad, I won\'t know the ending. isn\'t written as well as Rakudai.

I also think I raised my rating a bit when I thought about the Asterisk as a whole. It isn\'t a top-tier anime, nay it isn\'t even a good anime. I watched it purely because of boredom, and it wasn\'t a bad experience. Overall enjoyment was decent. There was a bit of unknown in the overall story, MC wasn\'t so overpowered as in much similar anime, art was good. I think something between 6 and 7 is a fair rating for this show.When it comes to thinking about watching the 2nd season of the Asterisk, I\'m still uncertain. I\'m kind of invested in the story already, but I\'m also aware there\'s no season 3. If 2nd season is actually better (as indicates MAL rating), then I would be pretty mad, I won\'t know the ending.', 'Nearly typical harem anime with strong male protagonist who is clueless when it comes to girls. To be fair, the male protagonist does have to be nearly as strong as he is in order for the story to develop and move along. However, all of the main character development points and interactions with members of his harem are predictable to a ""T\'"".This anime reminded me a lot of Infinite Stratos except here the subplots of the MC\'s enemies were better done - and there were more of them with their own goals.For those that read the light novels, the anime stays pretty true to them...and you really don\'t miss much just watching the show. and you really don\'t miss much just watching the show.', 'Hey folks, lets talk about Gakusen Toshi Asterisk. First let me say it is a generic harem, if that is a turn off then don\'t bother. That being said I feel like we can break down the good and bad and give you a more concise review.Our story starts off with the introduction of the main love interest(Julis Alexia von Riessfelt) and the the male lead(Ayato Amagiri). The viewer is thrown into a transfer student situation. We start off with Ayato walking to school and what does he do on his way? Well our fine young protagonist...picks up a handkerchief and decides to return it to its owner by jumping up and entering its owners room through their window. Our Tsundere female lead doesn\'t take kindly to this as she was currently changing at the time. We get to be thrown into this new world quickly by seeing her rage spill out into magical fire and a duel. This is pretty much the start of our story and the basic information needed to begin our anime.The story from this point forward picks up speed and somehow manages to cover the entire history of this built city, the existence of different factions, Magic, peculiar weapons and the inner workings of the school and the tournaments all in about 2 episodes. Along with the oddly quick pairing of our two leads Ayato, and Julis. This is way too quick and really is the reason this show is not very good. The term ""Generic"" gets thrown around a lot when it comes to Harems and IMO this isn\'t very fair. This show however unfortunate fits the ""Generic"" labeling pretty well. They had a few interesting concepts with the whole arena city, magical weapons with varying degrees of power and options..etc however they decided to blow past everything that could have made their show interesting and different.The last 6 or so episodes begin to slow down and to try and add drama and suspense which unfortunately felt like a slap in the face because once you had gotten used to the speed you expected it to take you to its destination in a single season. However they decide to lead us through their lackluster story and leave us with a most annoying cliffhanger. Though this anime managed to receive a 6 in score, the story wasn\'t good enough to make me overly excited for a season two and I\'m sure a lot of people feel the same way.The characters are pretty ""Generic"" as well. This is truly an unfortunate experience. Having a definable characteristic like Tsundere is what I think people mistake for ""Generic"" which of course is incorrect. However this anime again goes to prove the naysayer\'s correct. The characters have little to no personality, and feel like vessels holding popular characteristic that would grab the attention of those who enjoy them or are new to anime. That being said this again was another chance for the anime to prove its worth. The characters all have goals and dreams and each is obtainable and makes sense. There is no Eren Jaeger here shouting about how he will kill all the Titans as he gets his ass beat. Each character has a selfish, obtainable goal which they hope to obtain through winning these tournaments and getting their wish granted. There were a few frustrating situations with a few characters as they were introduced through a forced drama series of events that didn\'t feel like it had a purpose other than to add in characters that were not introduced properly earlier.I seen a few reviews telling people it was a poorly constructed political battle or regional battle and though the regional battle is technically true this doesn\'t seem to be about politics at all. It is basically a Twisted Metal like story, groups of people fight each other to win the greatest prize of a single wish granted as long as its obtainable on earth.The art and sound were really well done. Art was fairly standard, nothing jumps out as bad or great. The fight scenes were bland which isn\'t good for an anime like this, though they seemed to try and spice it up at the end.The Music and some of the sound effects were really well done. The only negative thing here was the sound effects for the sword were like light sabers. I\'m not mad at this because I like star wars but because it didn\'t fit the weapons.In conclusion this anime isn\'t great, but it isn\'t terrible. The second season or the manga might be able to redeem the things this anime did poorly. It doesn\'t deserve the 1\'s but a solid 5 or 6 I think is fair game. Watch this if you a fan of Harem\'s.

The animation is stiff and awkward, with bland character design, bland scenery, bland backgrounds, bland architecture, bland weapons, bland attacks and flat-out horrendous choreography... it's like a manila envelope taped to a white piece of paper. I have nothing to say about the protagonist, as I honestly cannot even remember his name (To be fair, I quit on the series very quickly, but I have seen scenes from later on and am familiar with the overall plot). He looks generic even...by light novel and harem anime standards. He's a blank post-it note on the manila envelope, if even that. The fanservice is also pretty bad, so don't let that be a motivator. If you're looking for an anime with cute girls and swords, there are tons of alternatives that far exceed this show. Please, do not just mindlessly consume this show and settle for its placid and uninspired characters. I highly recommend avoiding this series and spending your time with something more worthwhile.Music is alright though. A little on the bland side, but still.

After reading reviews describing it as derivative and generic, I had very low expectations and almost didn't watch it at all, but when I decided to give it a try I found it actually managed to achieve being pretty enjoyable in spite of its excessive and oblivious use of sad tired tropes.First things first, in many ways at its heart this show is nothing more than a very very poor imitation of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, although I'm unclear on which actually came first. Everything from the setting and drive, to a large portion of the cast,...right down to the opening scene are virtually indistinguishable (although in this there's somewhat less colour both literally and metaphorically). Where they deviate drastically, however, is in the fact that Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry is self-aware of its own positioning within the genre and uses that to both poignant and comedic effect, while Gakusen Toshi Asterisk takes itself seriously even in its most pitifully uninspired moments. This is not a good thing.That being said, despite this show's depressing lack of self-awareness, judged on its own merits it manages to rise up and deliver an experience that is actually not half bad. The story is uninspired but well executed, and the pacing is spot on, but both are really just padding for the action scenes which absolutely do not disappointment.While it is a harem, it quickly dodges those shackles by establishing a primary romance that is solid and secure and enjoyable to watch, relegating the other women surrounding the main male to the status of thankfully uninvolved side characters: the main male doesn't explicitly make a choice, sadly, but over the short duration of the story that's pretty forgivable.The characters, artwork, music, and voice acting are all at the lower end of utterly average. However, despite their lack of distinguishing features, several of the characters are still pretty enjoyable to watch, and it is easy to be drawn in to their struggles and achievements. Though it is established early and often that the main characters are utterly overpowered, the threats they face still manage to be exciting, and that is quite an achievement. right down to the opening scene are virtually indistinguishable (although in this there's somewhat less colour both literally and metaphorically).

The same reason you watch porn, not for the terrible over used story, the bad music or the inhumanly amount of non personality of the porn stars (in this case characters of this anime) but for the action even if you've seen this same predictable action a thousand times .Look if you're desperate for action, watch it.If you are all about plot and you are looking for a less painful way of self harming ,this is also for you.But seriously the plot is porno level, actually everything about it is.I don't know how to do reviews so... "", 'For a show that gets abbreviated as GTA, it seriously lacked sex, action and guns.Gakusen Toshi Asterisk or Asterisk War is an anime that suffers from the A.S.S. syndrome, also known as Action Sci-fi School syndrome. What is this weird disease, you may ask me. It is a plague that hits dozens of light novels authors every year which forces them to write the exact same story over and over again.If this anime had come out 15 years ago, I could have rated it as ""decent"". However, after having seen over 20 versions of similar plots with similar characters with similar personalities, I cannot help...but feel... tired.However, I dislike spending too much time on comparison so I will start off with the plot.The story in short: In the future, people can use magic and swords (yes this is the future, not medieval fantasy). They can also use guns but for the sake of ""plot"", barely anyone does and blades are considered as more mainstream weapons. There was a war, bla, bla, bla, you read the synopsis. Why do I skip all this important background setting ? Why of course, because no one cares about it : neither the audience nor the anime itself. This is made obvious as all this backstory is dropped onto you in episode 1 and never mentioned in later episodes. This is the way of this anime to say ""Ok, useless information for world creation: done. Now onto the fan service.""Our main protagonist Kirito *cough* *cough* I mean Ayato goes to one of the several academies and enrols to take part into the Festa, basically your usual battle tournament. His reasons to take part in it are pretty unclear, as far as I could understand he is looking for his sister who disappeared and if he wins the Festa, he could potentially find her... but then again this is also useless forgettable stuff explained in episode 1 that everybody forgets after that.So what are we left with here ? Well just 11 other episodes where nothing significant happens. If I had to resume, Ayato gets a harem for no reason whatsoever and he defeats his opponents because he\'s OP.I would go into detail about what makes the tournament battles interesting but even after trying very hard, I still couldn\'t find anything. After all, the female lead clearly states at the very beginning that Ayato is the highest ranked student to take part in this year\'s Festa. Way to rise the stakes.We\'re introduced to a bunch of OP looking possible antagonists but then again, who cares ? They\'re not even going to take part in the tournament so what\'s the point of even introducing them ?Huh ? Oh sorry one second. I just got a report informing me that this anime got the green light for a season two. But that does not really matter because I\'m not so much of a masochist that I would sit through another 12 episodes of the same recycled formula. Or maybe I will, just so I can review it for you here. Who knows ?As you may have guessed by now, the story and characters are very, VERY dull. The show is full of clichés, be it the characters that can be defined with archetypes (tsundere, deadpan loli, big-breasted loli, blonde bimbo), the story that has the exact same synopsis as other shows such as ""Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry"", ""Serei Tsukai no Blade Dance"", ""Infinite Stratos"", etc, or even the situations the main character ends up in (unexplained harem, overused fan service moments...).Don\'t even get me started on the main character. He could be Kirito, he could be Satomi Rentarou, he could basically be just about any high school student from A-1 Pictures and he still would have no personality whatsoever. He is just a massive pushover who does what he does because it\'s what is expected from him as the male lead of a harem show. Another thing that\'s expected from him is to be surrounded by attractive females but when they outright ask him if he wants to have sex with them, he shies away. This must be a curse, for him. The only trait I remember from Ayato I can remember, funnily enough, is that he sighs ALL THE TIME. Especially before and after helping members of his harem, yet he helps them anyway. It makes you wonder why he goes through the trouble if he doesn\'t accept their affection in return.So what does the show have going for it ? My fellow friends from Reddit highly complimented the artwork and animation of the show. Well this is something produced by A-1 Pictures so the quality is regular I guess. But the character design is so poor that if you took the main character and added a filter to turn his purple eyes and hair into black ones, you\'d have Kirito. I\'m not even joking.The animation is... normal too. Nothing out of the ordinary... oh yes ! The very bad timing of the CG is something I have to mention. I have nothing against CG that\'s not noticeable but when it\'s used so badly like that... it lowers the show\'s overall aesthetic.For the OST, nothing major. It\'s not bad but it\'s not good either. It\'s just there. Nothing in particular that I would listen to again but that\'s more of a personal preference than anything else.Now for my personal enjoyment. Truth to be told I did not enjoy this show. I feel like I\'ve watched it 10 times already, and this is definitely not one of the better ones. I definitely think this is one of those anime that is way past its era yet it is still being produced because, well, there is still a market for it. People consume that kind of milked product and as long as there\'s money, there will still be other copycats of that story.But if I can thank A-1 Pictures for anything, it\'d be that they made my job as a reviewer much easier by having Asterisk War air on the same day, at the same time as another show with the exact same setting, the exact same main female lead and the exact same plot. This way, I could compare the two of them much more easily and I clearly know which one to pick as my favourite one out of the two.As previously said, comparing two anime is not something I like to spend too much time on but here we have a situation where it\'s almost impossible not to mention Rakudai when talking about Asterisk.They both suffered from a horrible start. The difference is that Rakudai got better and more original as it went on whereas Asterisk stayed true to itself and just kept increasing its pile of needless clichés and boring turns of events. Rakudai tried its best to animate fight scenes and crowds, Asterisk just threw in lazy CG. Rakudai gave importance to its romantic subplot, Asterisk showed it the middle finger.I could go on all day long about how I enjoyed Rakudai more than Asterisk but that is probably not why you are reading this review. But if you are reading this review wondering whether to watch Asterisk, then I\'d advise you watch Rakudai instead. At least Stella Vermillion might be able to remind you that a good tsundere needs to have a balanced amount of -dere to match the tsun- otherwise the girl just comes out as a bitch (much like Julis). but feel... tired.However, I dislike spending too much time on comparison so I will start off with the plot.The story in short: In the future, people can use magic and swords (yes this is the future, not medieval fantasy).

Here we find our protagonist, Ayato, a purple-haired Genestellar, empowered by some sort of magical rip-off of Charlotte who is looking for purpose in his life after his doting sister vanishes from the island. Here, he soon meets a princess, much like that in Chivalry of a Failed Knight, and is soon subject to having to pay his life for accidentally walking in on her...getting dressed, much like Chivalry as well as Testament.This is one season where deja vu is the norm in the action-based harem genre. Asterisk is ridiculously close in plot progression to what I\'ll call its sister show Chivalry. As I\'m too lazy to list out the enormous list of similarities, I\'ll try to instead point out the few differences as we go through the paces of the review. Overall, as mentioned elsewhere, though the harems of the season are a little too similar for comfort, each is pretty good in its own right and above average in general. That said, this particular is rather weak in the romantic aspect so if that\'s what you want in your harems, look elsewhere.Animation:Whereas Chivalry attempts a unique style and flair, Asterisk utilizes a clean and futuristic setting. The entire show is bathed in light blues, pinks, and purples - nothing stands out as overly-harsh or saturated. Likewise, there is a futuristic feel to everything as holographics pop up everywhere and weapons materialize as lightsaber-like instruments. Backgrounds are often blurred, but when they\'re not they show a super-modern city complete with lots of greenery and cobble-stoned streets. The characters are pretty good, I\'d say even one step up from Chivalry in terms of style and facial animation. The show gets extra props from me as well for making the student uniforms match the feel of the city and for actually drawing robots rather than relying on ugly CGI; though it\'s not entirely free of CGI and some of it is really terrible early on when animating unimportant students. The show also uses visual-novel style episode previews, which is rather unique.There is plenty of fighting in this show, and like Chivalry, you\'ll see a good mix of close ranged melee as well as ranged magic spamming. Effects are nicely done and attacks are varied and well choreographed. Expect a bit of blood though nothing as serious as either Chivalry or Testament. As for ecchi, this is by far the lightest of the genre. There are scenes of accidental exposure but otherwise it\'s all rather innocent. You won\'t even get too much in the kissing department relative to other shows in the season.Sound:The sound is quite good and appropriate for the setting. The show opens with an energetic, electric-infused OP and ends with a mesmerizing and melodic piece by Maaya Sakamoto who unfortunately doesn\'t have a voice role. The show often uses a theatric-style fade in to the ED, which readers of my reviews know is a major weakness of mine. The BGM honestly could be better in terms of theme, but does have a few electronic-infused pieces that fit the bill, some of which are pretty recognizable after a few episodes. Expect a lot of sound effects to go with all the technology in the show, though I do believe the lightsaber sounds are a bit over the top.The voice talent is pretty strong here with Ai Kakuma voicing the lead heroine, a bit more personality compared to her role in Amagi Brilliant Park. Ari Ozawa is still growing in terms of experience but her voice is a great fit for Kirin\'s shy personality. Nao Touyama is probably the most famous of the VAs here though at least for this season she\'s more of a tease character; she demonstrates great range here, a strong departure from her voice as Chitoge in Nisekoi. I do find it funny that she also voices a main role in Chivalry concurrently and wonder if she noticed the plot similarity. Last but not least, Chinatsu Akasaki plays a minor role but as a very playful character, and her interpretation definitely elevates the character above what one would expect. Overall, expect a strong sound presentation from this show.Story:Whereas Chivalry has an almost desperate air with the protagonist at risk of being kicked out at any moment, the pacing in Asterisk is a lot less tense. There\'s ample room for comedic moments as well as very light romantic tension. I do feel that the exposition of the setting is a tad weak compared to the other harems of the season, not much is explained about the Strike The Blood-like island and only hints are given about why the world now revolves around a bunch of teenagers fighting each other in some tournament.In any case, the story is divided roughly into three arcs where Ayato encounters a different adversary. First up is our tsundere princess, who doesn\'t lose outright to Ayato unlike in Chivalry. The second arc revolves around the school\'s number one fighter, Kirin- who happens to still be thirteen despite her ridiculous proportions. The last arc is the actual tournament and focuses on the vampire scythe user Urzaiz. Mixed in with all of this are pieces surrounding Ayato\'s blue-haired childhood friend Yuki Nonaka er... Saya Sasamiya. Each arc has its own rising action and climax and some even have semi-filler episodes to cool off (see the ones titled ""A Holiday for Two""). The final arc\'s tournament climax is a bit too similar to that in Chivalry for my taste; to further the parallel, both shows also don\'t actually finish the tournament. In this case, the show heaps anticipation about the next season with all parties hinting on how to expect great surprises.Compared to Chivalry, I think this story played it rather safe. There isn\'t as much tension with the characters and relationships are pretty bare minimum. The show differentiates itself by building on the technological aspect despite not actually explaining how anything works. Nonetheless, it is still an interesting show in its own right with lots of engaging battles and a few good laughs.Character:This is probably where this show differs the most from Chivalry. Whereas Chivalry had a great primary herione and junk supporting characters, this show has an average protagonist pair with some outstanding additional supporting characters.Let\'s start with our protagonist, Ayato. Unlike Ikki in Chivalry, he is gifted with unfathomable power at the onset and is only restricted by some unexplained curse cast by his sister. He is by far the weakest of the harem protagonists in the season, I mean come on he can\'t even properly turn down the multiple approaches by the student council president. Our princess Riessfeld doesn\'t fare much better either. She\'s proud and arrogant but is virtually unable to make any progress with Ayato throughout the show, a complete disappointment from a romance perspective and a far cry from what you see in the other harems in the season.However, the show does make up some ground with the large yet strong group of supporting characters. Saya is a rather low-energy childhood friend who specializes in weapons, her attacks remind me humorously of Virtue Gundam and its slow yet overwhelming attacks. Kirin is in my mind the strongest character in the show, having both a thorough development and a strong personality. The semi-harem is rounded out by the student council president Claudia, who emits both powerful and mysterious auras that draws the viewer in.The show has a fairly extensive list of supporting characters, not surprising given that there are six separate factions in the tournaments. What makes this show stand out here is its development of these antagonist forces; significant development time is given to antagonists to give encounters deeper meaning. This is a fair improvement over Chivalry and a huge positive over the joke tournament in Testament Burst. This will hopefully pay dividends in the sequel, as they don\'t have to spend as much development time there.Value:Asterisk definitely has a unique style, despite being a virtual mirror image of other harems in terms of certain plot elements. While the plot was a bit too safe to be anything close to innovative, the unique setting, strong sound presentation, and strong supporting characters help to keep the viewer interested. Despite the disappointingly weak protagonist pair, I think the show still came across as entertaining and am looking forwards to the next season. Reiterating from my other reviews for the seasons\' action-based harems, they\'re all similar but all above average, you can\'t go wrong with either of them. Testament is the one for those looking for the greatest ecchi, Chivalry for the strongest heroine and most angst, and Asterisk for strongest supporting cast and most unique setting. getting dressed, much like Chivalry as well as Testament.This is one season where deja vu is the norm in the action-based harem genre. Asterisk is ridiculously close in plot progression to what I\'ll call its sister show Chivalry. As I\'m too lazy to list out the enormous list of similarities, I\'ll try to instead point out the few differences as we go through the paces of the review. Overall, as mentioned elsewhere, though the harems of the season are a little too similar for comfort, each is pretty good in its own right and above average in general. That said, this particular is rather weak in the romantic aspect so if that\'s what you want in your harems, look elsewhere.Animation:Whereas Chivalry attempts a unique style and flair, Asterisk utilizes a clean and futuristic setting. The entire show is bathed in light blues, pinks, and purples - nothing stands out as overly-harsh or saturated. Likewise, there is a futuristic feel to everything as holographics pop up everywhere and weapons materialize as lightsaber-like instruments. Backgrounds are often blurred, but when they\'re not they show a super-modern city complete with lots of greenery and cobble-stoned streets. The characters are pretty good, I\'d say even one step up from Chivalry in terms of style and facial animation. The show gets extra props from me as well for making the student uniforms match the feel of the city and for actually drawing robots rather than relying on ugly CGI; though it\'s not entirely free of CGI and some of it is really terrible early on when animating unimportant students. The show also uses visual-novel style episode previews, which is rather unique.There is plenty of fighting in this show, and like Chivalry, you\'ll see a good mix of close ranged melee as well as ranged magic spamming. Effects are nicely done and attacks are varied and well choreographed. Expect a bit of blood though nothing as serious as either Chivalry or Testament. As for ecchi, this is by far the lightest of the genre. There are scenes of accidental exposure but otherwise it\'s all rather innocent. You won\'t even get too much in the kissing department relative to other shows in the season.Sound:The sound is quite good and appropriate for the setting. The show opens with an energetic, electric-infused OP and ends with a mesmerizing and melodic piece by Maaya Sakamoto who unfortunately doesn\'t have a voice role. The show often uses a theatric-style fade in to the ED, which readers of my reviews know is a major weakness of mine. The BGM honestly could be better in terms of theme, but does have a few electronic-infused pieces that fit the bill, some of which are pretty recognizable after a few episodes. Expect a lot of sound effects to go with all the technology in the show, though I do believe the lightsaber sounds are a bit over the top.The voice talent is pretty strong here with Ai Kakuma voicing the lead heroine, a bit more personality compared to her role in Amagi Brilliant Park. Ari Ozawa is still growing in terms of experience but her voice is a great fit for Kirin\'s shy personality. Nao Touyama is probably the most famous of the VAs here though at least for this season she\'s more of a tease character; she demonstrates great range here, a strong departure from her voice as Chitoge in Nisekoi. I do find it funny that she also voices a main role in Chivalry concurrently and wonder if she noticed the plot similarity. Last but not least, Chinatsu Akasaki plays a minor role but as a very playful character, and her interpretation definitely elevates the character above what one would expect. Overall, expect a strong sound presentation from this show.Story:Whereas Chivalry has an almost desperate air with the protagonist at risk of being kicked out at any moment, the pacing in Asterisk is a lot less tense. There\'s ample room for comedic moments as well as very light romantic tension. I do feel that the exposition of the setting is a tad weak compared to the other harems of the season, not much is explained about the Strike The Blood-like island and only hints are given about why the world now revolves around a bunch of teenagers fighting each other in some tournament.In any case, the story is divided roughly into three arcs where Ayato encounters a different adversary. First up is our tsundere princess, who doesn\'t lose outright to Ayato unlike in Chivalry. The second arc revolves around the school\'s number one fighter, Kirin- who happens to still be thirteen despite her ridiculous proportions. The last arc is the actual tournament and focuses on the vampire scythe user Urzaiz. Mixed in with all of this are pieces surrounding Ayato\'s blue-haired childhood friend Yuki Nonaka er... Saya Sasamiya. Each arc has its own rising action and climax and some even have semi-filler episodes to cool off (see the ones titled ""A Holiday for Two""). The final arc\'s tournament climax is a bit too similar to that in Chivalry for my taste; to further the parallel, both shows also don\'t actually finish the tournament. In this case, the show heaps anticipation about the next season with all parties hinting on how to expect great surprises.Compared to Chivalry, I think this story played it rather safe. There isn\'t as much tension with the characters and relationships are pretty bare minimum. The show differentiates itself by building on the technological aspect despite not actually explaining how anything works. Nonetheless, it is still an interesting show in its own right with lots of engaging battles and a few good laughs.Character:This is probably where this show differs the most from Chivalry.

It's very weak.It started out with a good premise and could have salvaged a 7 or so in my book but... the amount of Loli is too STRONG and definitely not my cup of tea.When you find yourself rewinding the anime to make sure you remember the character who is speaking you know you're in for a bad experience.Add to this villains who make absolutely no sense in what their motives truly are...and this anime leaves you wondering what you're watching.Don't bother watching this one. and this anime leaves you wondering what you're watching.Don't bother watching this one."", ""The Asterisk War was a bit disappointing. It's not that this anime was terrible so much as it was unmemorable. Even though I only finished watching it about a week ago, I can't remember the names of any of the characters; what they were like, what they wanted to accomplish, or why they were even in this anime to begin with. I think the biggest problem for me was that another anime had come out with almost the exact same theme - magical high school - but the other anime was better, which made my enjoyment of this anime wan.The anime starts off stereotypically enough:...New boy comes on campus, a napkin flies from a window, boy finds napkin and uses magic to fly up to the window, where he discovers the half-naked tsundere love interest in the process of changing. The beginning of this anime is so similar to Chivalry of a Failed Knight that I'm astonished they were made at the same time. However, where Chivalry distinguishes itself within the first episode, Asterisk pulls a cliche. Yes, the main character decides to do the Blush & Stutter (patent pending), then the half-naked tsundere decides to do the tsun act. From the moment this anime began to the moment it ended, I could predict everything that would happen with at least 75% accuracy. The only reason my accuracy wasn't 100% was because several side characters were introduced, and even then, most of the side characters were completely predictable after their introduction.What's more, all of the harem members - sorry, I mean, all of the female characters - are so static and boring that I couldn't root for any of them. There was only one character that I liked, and she wasn't introduced until the halfway point. I could pretty much pick out which trope these characters were, too. It's not like the director did anything to distinguish characters in this anime from every other anime of this genre. You've got the tsundere love interest, the kuudere loli who happens to be the harem protagonist's best friend, the himedere, and the flirty blond with hair drills. This is pretty much how I remember these characters, not by their names, but by their tropes. And while I don't normally compare anime in my reviews, I really have to. Compared to Chivalry, where I can remember the names of all the main characters, Asterisk's characters are completely flat and uninteresting.Following what starts off as a typical high school magical harem, we're given more cliche's in the form of an overpowered main character whose power has been sealed so he doesn't seem so overpowered. Supposedly, his sister sealed his power for... reasons. I don't know what those reasons are, as they are never explained in the anime, but I'm guessing they're plot reasons. His sister must have realized that having an overpowered main character would make for an uninteresting story, and so she decided to seal his powers away. What's his face main protagonist can only use his powers for five minutes before he falls unconscious, which happens to be another overpowered character cliche. Yes, I'm being serious. Every overpowered character falls unconscious at the end of every battle so they don't seem as overpowered, like having them fall unconscious afterwards makes the battle seem like it was oh-so-difficult. It's a standard cliche that's done to death in anime like this.Now, while there was a lot that disappointed me in this anime, there are some things that I did like. First, the artwork is very colorful and clean. In terms of art style, I think this is fairly top notch. The animation is also smooth. I never saw any real problems aside from the special effects used for spells. Those seemed a bit out of place, and I could tell they were CG, but I can forgive that. Also, while I think the battles in Chivalry were way better, I don't have any complaints about the fight scenes here. With how fluid the animation was, the sword fights in Asterisk were great fun to watch. It was actually the art and animation that kept me watching this. All that being said, this anime wasn't terrible. I think if it had come out before Chivalry of a Failed Knight did, I would have enjoyed it for what it was. Anyone who's into this genre will certainly enjoy watching it, and I hope that anyone who watches it finds it entertaining.Artwork: 9/10Animation: 9.5/10Sound: 5/10Characters: 2/10Story: 5/10Personal Enjoyment: 3/10 New boy comes on campus, a napkin flies from a window, boy finds napkin and uses magic to fly up to the window, where he discovers the half-naked tsundere love interest in the process of changing.

Combat has been nailed too, giving us a grand, sumptuous-looking envisioning of the age-old ever-present-in-fantasy ""mana"" of this show, also excellently visualising fighting styles and sword arts.The animation is fantastic too, having smooth fight-scenes, even using different art styles to portray the immense force behind attacks.So why isn\'t the show good? Well, much in the vein of a depressing amount of anime that contain a unique idea, the execution ends up being a compliant demonstration of a lack of passion for standing out and being unique, or at least the inability to realising that passion. This leads to boring, uninteresting characters and a very notable focus on breasts and uncontrollably lusting girls, who all take romantic interest in our bland, unremarkable MC. The show ends up taking the much less interesting route of being a typical high-school romance anime, only really giving us shelter from that sad truth within the tournament arc split between the two seasons. A really interesting and clearly pretty fleshed out idea, culminating into a spineless conception, leaving me lamenting over the buried potential of said idea, knowing it\'ll never come into full bloom.Either way, watching this show gives me an undeniable wave of nostalgia, and being a big music nerd, the choice of music for specifically the ending plays a big part in validating my love for- and personal attachment to this era, and the bearing this show has on that.I\'m rarely a fan of the J-pop/J-rock/EDM-blend used for 9 out of 10 anime openings from the last decade, but this opening sticks out a bit with a pretty catchy melody, although it still presents with some of the glaring flaws I see in a lot of anime openings.The ending song however, is much more individual, giving us a warm, melancholic piano section, erupting into a rich, flashy burst of bright synths scuttering about, paired with Maaya Sakamoto\'s catchy vocals complimenting this unforgivingly extravagant auditory lightshow. The song also manages to perfectly exude with a vibe unfound outside of this now decade-old era of fantasy.So, is the show worth it to watch? Not really at all, no, but circumstances have led to it being a very unique thing regardless. The show unfortunately isn\'t good, but the aura that pertrudes out of it is honestly somewhat remarkable. thick facade, covering up the greed-powered society void of ethics, covered in blood and tears of innocent people who\'ve been unknowingly swept up into this big mess, some of which collide with the stories of our characters.

I went into the show with an extremely low expectation since it’s been revered by many as an absolutely horrible series (credited to Digibro’s infamous Asterisk War Sucks series). Due to its reputation, I got curious as to how horrible it could be. Moreover, for some reason, I like to watch bad shows from time to time just to criticize or ridicule them for fun...and this instance is no exception. After having watched the show, I did get what I was expecting, yet it got something that surprised me a tiny bit.Perhaps the most notable flaw of this series you would notice is how generic the premise. In a world with specialized schools for kids with superhuman capabilities and technologically advanced weaponry, our protagonist is a mysterious outsider with a hidden overpowered ability. I can probably name more than a hundred stories with the same synopsis. This wouldn’t be much of a problem if the execution isn’t so unengaging and bland. Everything about the setting’s history, social system, and power system are explained through boring expositions. One of the things I despise the most in any entertainment media ever is constant reliance on exposition to inform the audience. It always feels so forced and shoehorned because you know that they couldn’t integrate the information into the story naturally. Even after we’ve gone through the beginning narration, we still need constant expositions from the characters. The one most guilty of this is Claudia, but I’ll get to her later. This show is unable to engross the audience with its dull worldbuilding, but what about the other aspects?Another aspect of Asterisk War that bugs me is its visuals. God this show looks more life less than a dead mosquito I squashed while typing this review. Everything from the color palette to the character design feels so bland and unimaginative. It’s as if this show wasn’t animated by humans, but instead a bunch of undead corpses who’re pushed to the brink of their existence due to bad scheduling and inhumane work ethics. The whole show uses pale colors with zero saturation to make it look bright or colorful. I’m not saying that the art always has to be bright and colorful, it depends on what kind of atmosphere you’re for. A series with a melancholic tone would need a more pale color palette to fit that tone. Meanwhile, a show that’s supposed to be exciting and fun needs a richer color palette. An example would be a series such as No game no Life though I am not the biggest fan of that show. Still, its color choices are incredible and they fit the series perfectly. Besides the color, Asterisk War’s character design looks so generic that I instinctively know it was animated by A-1 Pictures. Why the hell does every light novel protagonist from this studio have to look the fucking same? Nonetheless, the mc isn’t the only one guilty of this. The only ways I could distinguish characters from one another are hair color and dressing style which aren’t even that varied mind you. Now that we’ve established that the show fails to engage us with both its world and visuals, are the characters any better?I’m honestly impressed at how predictable and tropey these characters are. Our protagonist, Amagiri Ayato, is like any other self-insert, power fantasy protagonist who’s an underdog that has a mysterious overpowered ability. He’s a typical nice guy who loves protecting others and is oblivious to the females’ feelings for him. His reason for protecting others comes from his backstory involving his older sister who went missing. If this sounds familiar to any of you, then congratulations ‘cause you’ve probably watched more than 5 anime series. And again, this sort of characterization isn’t inherently bad, but nothing about Ayato stands out whatsoever. He’s nice, heroic, dense, and overpowered. That’s it. And not like these four adjectives are even uncommon among other anime protagonists out there. I guess the only thing they tried to make him stand out is his hair color which is purple. I guess purple hair is still better than another black hair. Well now we know the main character sucks, but do the supporting characters save this show?Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld is the main heroine of Asterisk War and she’s a tsundere. That’s pretty much it really. Normally I have a soft spot for tsundere characters whether they’re well-written or not. But with Julis, holy shit she’s the most basic, run-of-the-mill tsundere I have ever seen. Her whole character is just acting tsun towards Ayato and showing off her firepower. They tried to flesh out her character by giving her a backstory about how she fights in order to raise money for an orphanage she knew as a young princess. Oh yeah, she’s a princess by the way. It doesn’t really add that much aside from being a part of her background as well as adding on to her tsundere personality. However, if you remove the fact that she’s a princess it wouldn’t have changed much honestly. In fact, if she was instead someone who grew up with the orphanage and wanted to enroll in the tournament for money to save her fellow orphans, that would’ve been more emotionally compelling. Her relationship with Ayato is as unimaginative as you would expect. The only development happens at the climax of the first arc where Ayato saves her from a villain with robots which makes her completely in love with Ayato. This changes nothing about their dynamic except for the fact that they decide to team up for the tournament.Another major character that’s introduced in the second arc of the show is Toudou Kirin. She’s the third or fourth main heroine of the series after Saya is introduced. Her entire character is about overcoming her dependent nature and lack of confidence, but it’s executed in the most on-the-nose way possible. Her main goal is to prove her father’s innocence and her uncle promised to help her achieve that goal if she works under him. The main conflict is that her uncle is abusive and Ayato wants to help her to become more confident in her abilities or whatever. The way Kirin’s conflict with her uncle resolves itself doesn’t really make sense to me. First of all, what does her uncle even do that benefits her? Like they never demonstrate why Kirin needed his help. It’s not like her uncle trains her swordsmanship or anything. The only thing he does is scold her or abuse her physically. Then Ayato hangs out with her and tells her what she needs to do and she gets over it instantly. You could argue that the reason Kirin is so dependent on her uncle is because he’s the only family member left whom she can rely on. This argument would work only on the assumption that her uncle provides something she needs. He’s not emotionally supportive nor does his strict discipline benefit her. It would have been much better if the reason Kirin has to obey her uncle is due to being blackmailed or something. Aside from her lackluster character arc, Kirin’s just a kouhai, loli-bait with big boobs whose sole purpose is to become another part of Ayato’s harem.Here comes the most pointless character out of the main cast, Claudia Enfield. It’s such a shame too when she’s voiced by my favorite seiyuu ever, Touyama Nao, who is most notable for her roles as Kirisaki Chitoge from Nisekoi and Yuigahama Yui from Oregairu. In Asterisk War, she plays an onee-san, “ara ara” type character which is pretty unusual when compared to her other roles. Touyama’s performance itself is pretty decent so the problems only reside within Claudia as a character. She’s literally in the show just to give exposition or give fan service. Besides those, she’s just horny for Ayato 24/7 for no fucking reason. Other series have this trope, but in Asterisk War there’s not even an explanation as to why she’s into him. At least with the other girls there are reasons why they’re in love with Ayato, not good reasons but still reasons. Towards the end, it’s revealed that the weapon she uses gives the user visions on how he/she would die and that’s hard for her I guess. It doesn’t add anything to her character or serves the plot at all so who the hell cares. I mean sure it might come into play in ss2, but who cares enough to watch that far into this series. The only way you can enjoy this character is to turn off subtitles every time she shows up and just listen to Touyama Nao’s soothing “ara ara” voice. If you know Japanese, well I’m sincerely sorry for you.Last but absolutely not least we have Sasamiya Saya who is the sole reason why I didn’t drop this show after episode 2 or 3. She’s the best character in the entire show not because she’s well-written or that her character motivation is interesting. She’s the best character because she’s just so god damn adorable. I like her design quite a bit and her personality is also great. I love her deadpan reactions to everything and her dialogue isn’t as bad as the others’. Her character isn’t anything innovative, but it’s executed adequately enough that it doesn’t bother one bit. In addition, I adore that she’s very blunt and straightforward when it comes to her affection for Ayato. It’s such a nice change of pace compared to Julis and Kirin. My only problem with her is that she’s sidelined a lot in the series and her only major moments are when she meets the girls with strong robots and an episode where she trains with Kirin as partners. The first one sets up her rivalry with one of the robot girls, but it doesn’t amount to anything in this season. The second one develops Saya’s relationship with father and her motivation a little better. Other than her and Kirin’s first fight in the tournament, she barely gets any more significant screen time and this frustrates me to no end. It’s pretty unfair how the secondary heroine doesn’t receive any major story arc, yet Kirin does.Now that I’ve covered the main cast of characters, I would like to address my number one problem with this series, its dialogue. I am aware that on-the-nose writing is prevalent in the anime medium. But in a show where nothing stands out at all, this problem becomes even more blatant. An example of a series with poor dialogue that’s overshadowed by everything else is Demon Slayers. Characters will always just explain what’s literally  happening or what they’re feeling which is already obvious. It’s another case of writing that fails to show instead of tell. Nevertheless, Demon Slayer still manages to elevate itself with likable characters, an interesting world, and beautifully crafted animation. So without any redeeming quality, Asterisk War’s dialogue is a nightmare to sit through if you take it seriously. Characters will prattle on and on about expositional bullshit or explain their entire character arc as if they had a copy of the script beforehand. Another issue with the dialogue is that it’s predictable as hell. There are too many instances of me correctly guessing what the characters are gonna say next. It’s like they copy pasted every generic line that has ever been said and assigned them to the characters based on archetypes. I’m not asking for Oregairu’s subtextual absurdity. I’m only asking for something with even a fraction of subtlety and nuance.Aside from everyone mentioned above, there’s no one else noteworthy since the side characters are all either one-note or outright forgettable. The only exception is the antagonist of the season finale, Irene Uzaiz, even then she’s not that interesting as an antagonist. Her main characteristics are that she’s a badass and wants to protect her sister. I only remember her because every time she needs to power up she has to suck her sister’s blood ‘cause she’s a vampire. For some reason, the first time they did it her sister had to unbutton her shirt even though the next time they did it her sister didn’t need to. I bet it’s only in there to add more fan service which is clearly what the show is in shortage of. If random fan service is all you got to keep my attention, then you might as well just go all out and make Interspecies Reviewers.Asterisk War is as anything one would expect from a light novel adaptation by A1-Pictures: lifeless, unoriginal, and boring as hell. Needless to say, if you’re new to anime, then perhaps the unoriginality isn’t that apparent to you. Still, from a standard storytelling perspective, it’s not even compelling enough to be engaging. Needless to say, if you’re someone who’s into a show about a self-insert, op main character with girls fawning over him like files to a garbage can, Asterisk War is perfect for you.Overall:Story: 4/10Everything is told through boring dialogue and exposition. What’s happening on screen are either characters standing around talking or running around fighting in the lamest way possible.Art: 5/10Dull, pale color all over. Characters look like they are stock character designs, but I guess it doesn’t hurt my eyes and Saya looks good enough.Sound 5/10Serviceable I guess? I don’t remember any of the soundtrack and the openings and ending are generic as hell.Character 3/10Everyone else but Saya all sucks. They manage to be more generic and tropey than I ever anticipated.Enjoyment 5/10The only enjoyment I got was shitting on it while watching or whenever Saya is on screen. Other than that? Nothing.Overall a 4/10 experience. and this instance is no exception. After having watched the show, I did get what I was expecting, yet it got something that surprised me a tiny bit.Perhaps the most notable flaw of this series you would notice is how generic the premise. In a world with specialized schools for kids with superhuman capabilities and technologically advanced weaponry, our protagonist is a mysterious outsider with a hidden overpowered ability. I can probably name more than a hundred stories with the same synopsis. This wouldn’t be much of a problem if the execution isn’t so unengaging and bland. Everything about the setting’s history, social system, and power system are explained through boring expositions. One of the things I despise the most in any entertainment media ever is constant reliance on exposition to inform the audience. It always feels so forced and shoehorned because you know that they couldn’t integrate the information into the story naturally. Even after we’ve gone through the beginning narration, we still need constant expositions from the characters. The one most guilty of this is Claudia, but I’ll get to her later. This show is unable to engross the audience with its dull worldbuilding, but what about the other aspects?Another aspect of Asterisk War that bugs me is its visuals. God this show looks more life less than a dead mosquito I squashed while typing this review. Everything from the color palette to the character design feels so bland and unimaginative. It’s as if this show wasn’t animated by humans, but instead a bunch of undead corpses who’re pushed to the brink of their existence due to bad scheduling and inhumane work ethics. The whole show uses pale colors with zero saturation to make it look bright or colorful. I’m not saying that the art always has to be bright and colorful, it depends on what kind of atmosphere you’re for. A series with a melancholic tone would need a more pale color palette to fit that tone. Meanwhile, a show that’s supposed to be exciting and fun needs a richer color palette. An example would be a series such as No game no Life though I am not the biggest fan of that show. Still, its color choices are incredible and they fit the series perfectly. Besides the color, Asterisk War’s character design looks so generic that I instinctively know it was animated by A-1 Pictures. Why the hell does every light novel protagonist from this studio have to look the fucking same? Nonetheless, the mc isn’t the only one guilty of this. The only ways I could distinguish characters from one another are hair color and dressing style which aren’t even that varied mind you. Now that we’ve established that the show fails to engage us with both its world and visuals, are the characters any better?I’m honestly impressed at how predictable and tropey these characters are. Our protagonist, Amagiri Ayato, is like any other self-insert, power fantasy protagonist who’s an underdog that has a mysterious overpowered ability. He’s a typical nice guy who loves protecting others and is oblivious to the females’ feelings for him. His reason for protecting others comes from his backstory involving his older sister who went missing. If this sounds familiar to any of you, then congratulations ‘cause you’ve probably watched more than 5 anime series. And again, this sort of characterization isn’t inherently bad, but nothing about Ayato stands out whatsoever. He’s nice, heroic, dense, and overpowered. That’s it. And not like these four adjectives are even uncommon among other anime protagonists out there. I guess the only thing they tried to make him stand out is his hair color which is purple. I guess purple hair is still better than another black hair. Well now we know the main character sucks, but do the supporting characters save this show?Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld is the main heroine of Asterisk War and she’s a tsundere. That’s pretty much it really. Normally I have a soft spot for tsundere characters whether they’re well-written or not.

I\'m glad that an anime can bring people enjoyment and this is just my personal opinion. But I just couldn\'t find anyhing good about this show.The Asterisk War is one of the most boring anime I\'ve ever watched. I was constanty scrolling through my phone while the anime played in the background. Yes, it really was that dull.The show believes it is a serious story with chilling plot twists, complex charactes, facinating social commetary and nail-biting action. But it fails to realize it\'s not that, but instead...it\'s a fanfiction written by a middleschooler with no self awareness trying way too hard to sound woke.Nothing happens in this show. Fans would say that there\'s lots of action even in just the first episode, but it\'s all meaningless. The main character is so overpowered that you never feel a shred of fear or think even for a second that anyone relevant would ever be in any actual danger. This is something that I\'ve noticed a lot in A1 shows: during the action scenes the camera moves around like fly being chased. It\'s like the only way the animators could keep you watching these boring predictable fights is having everything move around a lot, like it\'s waving a flashlight in front of your eyes.Even the fanservice scenes are a slog. While the girls are cute, the ecchi scenes don\'t excite me at all, and I just roll my eyes when one appears and wait for the show to move on. The fancervice feels juvenile, like the animators are doing the bare minimum for this to count as ecchi. The girls being cute isn\'t enough, I need to actually like these charactes because if I don\'t like them while their clothes are on, simply shoving some naked tiddies in my face isn\'t going to make me suddenly care about these charactes and their struggles.Which leads me to another point: the characters are terrible. They\'re nothing but walking cliches you\'ve seen a hundred million times. I\'ll focus on the main cast for now. You\'ve got the tsundere who flips between sweet and harsh so often and fast you think she actually has a personality disorder, the big-boobed slutty one who does the mysterious older sister act, the frigid loli childhood friend and the cute shy culmsy kouhai/imouto character. That\'s all they are. The show tries to make them more complex by giving them ""tragic"" backstories, but they never become interesting or anything beyond their cookie-cutter stereotypes.Here\'s a tip for you aspiring authors: give your characters actual goals and motivations. That\'s how you get people invested in characters: you lay out your chracter\'s goals and have them go through struggles so that when the goals are achieved, they feel earned, and not something that just gets handed to them.Then we\'ve got the main character, the elephant in the room. Oh boy. There isn\'t enough time in the day for me to lay out everything that makes him one of - if not the - worst anime protagonists I\'ve ever seen. You caould list off so many characters Ayato reminds you of. He\'s unbelievebly overpowered compared to everyone and wins every fight he gets into (Well, he loses once, but is heavily implied that he only lost because he forgot that the objective of the fight was to protect his badge. Besides, he beats that same character easily soon after). He has a harem of girls following him everywhere and constantly fight with each other over who his dick belongs to. I\'m not even joking when I say that there are three seperate battles in this show (two in season one and one in season two) where Ayato fights while carrying a girl in one of his arms. We\'re not just talking about someone who overpowers their opponent, we\'re talking about someone who completely overwhelmes his opponents. (This is a bit of a spoiler for season 2, but the semi-finalists in the important tournament are taken out in like 5 minutes and are treated like complete chumps! Not to mention it is said in season 1 that Ayato is literally the only Rank 1 fighter in the entire tournament! How can you possibly fuck up a tournament arc this bad?!)The worst part of this show is the pacing. I realize that there is no such thing as ""perfect pacing"", something which feels right for someone might feel glacially slow for someone else. But the way that it is handled here is just awful. The entire first 4 episode arc focuses on this assasination plotline, but it honestly feels like a side plot. Most of the episodes are focusing on either meaningless tedious fights or having the girls fight over who gets to ride the main guy\'s dick. The entire show is like that. They constantly throw around these fantasy terms and never explain them (like in episode 1 it\'s stated that one of the girls is something called a ""Strega"", but they never explain what that actually means other that they\'re rare and can manipule this stuff called ""prana"", which I guess is something like mana or spirit energy). But I guess worldbuilding isn\'t as important as having another ecchi scene where the loli and the imouto-esque character get naked again.I don\'t even want to start unravenling how this world and the character\'s powers work. The limits of these powers are so illdefined that every fight ends up being a light show. It doesn\'t mean anything to the audience and everyone watching is bored, despite the show trying it\'s best to have everything look pretty and flashy.There is one thing I like in this show and that is the OST. I probably won\'t listen to it on its own, but it provided some nice distraction from the dull scenes and sounds nice.Also I would like to point out that the weapons have a really plasticy sound when characters ick them up and I can\'t help but imagine them swinging around plastic toy swords and guns. That\'s the only thing that made me laugh and it wasn\'t even intentional.I watched both seasons of this show, thinking that there was no possible way it could get even worse. And I was kind of right? I really can\'t tell. Either it was so horrendus that it broke my conception of good and bad or it really got better.I honestly could rant on about this show for quite a while longer, but I feel like I got most of my haterd for this pile of rubbish out in a semi-choherent review.Ultimately, The Asterisk war is a nothing show where nothing happens and nothing matters. The worst type of media isn\'t something that offends you, but something that just wastes you time. The entire point of media is to entertain you, so a piece of media that bores you should be ignored.If you really want to see an anime with a simmilar premisse, but better, watch Chivalry of a Failed Kinght. While it\'s still rather generic, it\'s still leagues above the pile of shit that is The Asterisk War. it\'s a fanfiction written by a middleschooler with no self awareness trying way too hard to sound woke.Nothing happens in this show.

The entire point of media is to entertain you, so a piece of media that bores you should be ignored.If you really want to see an anime with a simmilar premisse, but better, watch Chivalry of a Failed Kinght. While it\'s still rather generic, it\'s still leagues above the pile of shit that is The Asterisk War.', ""At first, I didn't think I was going to enjoy this anime. But, as the series progressed I actually found it quite enjoyable. Definitely not a masterpiece but it's a fun series to watch. I only wish they had finished it. Oh well, guess I'll just have to find and read the manga.Overall, the story was fairly interesting and I really enjoyed the battles. I found the music nice to listen to. The artwork was really nice and the colors were really cool to look at but, the CGI was just a bit bland. Reminded a bit of the CGI found in Miria Nikki...and, the previews at the end of each episode were such a bad CGI job that I found myself chuckling a bit every time I watched them. I think that was probably intentional on the part of the animators and I got a laugh out of it so all is well. Didn't really care for the whole harem thing in this particular anime but, that being said, it's not right up in your face like most others are.Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth a watch if you're looking to kill some time and watch a good bit of action. and, the previews at the end of each episode were such a bad CGI job that I found myself chuckling a bit every time I watched them.

But story is for sure weakest part of this anime, every character have somehow their own story, but you will never find their story tho, story of different character, also a main one are just short flashbacks without any strong feelings, so at all this anime is clearly just a decent anime to watch in free time without any drama. ', 'Compared to others...MANY OTHERS i should add, i went into this anime blind. this was the first anime i watched to learn about seasonal anime. before hand i only knew the major or classics ex.(naruto, bleach, one piece, rurouni kenshin, etc.) after i finished it i watched a guy called digibro on youtube rant on this show. And many of the stuff he said was right. but i felt like he really over did it. but once this vid came up everyone started rampaging on this anime. So, here we are 3 years later, does it deserve all the hate its received? well lets look...at it.the story is....uhh...well it sucks. But it IS trying to get your attention. and at CERTAIN points it does that. Not very often, but it does occasionaly, the story felt to me a little rushed and was very predictable. it is a story and the fact that it can be intersting somewhat gives it a 4.Now, if there is one thing i absolutley loved about this anime, it is the next two categories.First off the art is AMAZING! i loved the designs and art of many of the buildings, character designs, weapons, animation, and effects. many of them were beautiful and made my jaw drop a few times. the animation is smooth and fluid, the art is crisp, clear and exciting, the fight scenes were beautiful, and some well executed (some better than others) i guess i should not be suprised on that note since A1 did the art and adaptaion of the light novel. still, for an anime, it\'s pretty awesome!Sound wise i\'m just gonna say it. GODDAMN EPIC AND BEAUTIFUL AND TECHY AND JUST AAAAHHHHHHH all at the same time. I\'m a musician, a drummer, saxophonist, flutist and bassist. i know good music and sound when i hear it. And the opening and ending of this anime represent that better than anything else. the sound effects are also very nice IMO. these are definitly the shows strong points. what isn\'t however, is the characters.The characters in this show are some of the cheesiest, boring, and cliche around. i mean, i can\'t even describe some oof the characters some of em are just awful! look, you have Ayato(overpowered main), Julis(the most bland tsundere on earth) Kirin( loli but i actually kinda like her charecter) and many other non notable ones. the ones who ARE interesting hardly get any screen time and its a bismal.Overall do i think the show deserves all the hate? all the anger it has received?NO ABSOLUTLEY NOT!yes alot of the arguments are valid, and they all have a reason, but i feel like it was handled too much. the show has it\'s flaws and there are plenty, but it does have it\'s ups. the art is beautiful, the sound is superb, the story heck isnt bad in a weird way. if you are one who hates the story, you probably got confused from it. so what did you hate?THE PLOT PROGRESSIONyes the story was mangled and screwed from how the story progressed if they had changed certain aspects or lines in the story...it may have not been that bad. the series has potential it truly does. if it was just slightly edited or saved certain parts for the story later, it would be easier to follow.overall i liked the asterisk war. yes it was cliche ( very cliche) but it doesnt mean it is immidiatley the worst one in exsistance. of course it aint perfect or not for everyone. every anime is like that. there are others far worse than this show. (eromanga sensei, umaru chan, highschool dxd season 4, any hentai with a plot) i hated how this show was turned to a ""harem"" but i don\'t see a harem here. i see a promising anime with tons of potential that was not handled correctly and it paid for it and then received too much hate a show could handle. many of the issues in season 1 get fixed next season and i\'ll review that one too.but in short the asterisk war is an underrated missused anime that suffered from A1\'s greed. the story progression was handled in the wrong way and made many confused, but the art and sound of the show with it\'s combined potential made something rather nice to watch if i was bored. and thats the anime it is for me. i only wish people would stop treating it like it\'s the absolute worst anime when there others IMO out there. it just needs to find it at it.the story is....uhh...well it sucks.

This was my introduction to the ""generic"" harem tropes and what not. Because of this, I enjoyed the show when I watched it, and I even watched the second season, which I enjoyed even more because of the somewhat decent world building. Looking back at the show, I know it\'s bad. I know why it\'s bad, and I know why people don\'t really like it or even hate it.Story and CharactersThe story and characters are quite generic. The story is ok, doing some things that I found to be innovative. The second season did much...better as far as the story goes, and the Pheonix Festa was fun to watch. The characters were the generic as hell. After seeing about two or three more anime with these tropes, I got sick of them. I would much rather see these tropes in the characters I first experienced them in.Animation, Sound, and ToneThe animation was nothing special. It was good, the special effects were great, but nothing stood out. It has that generic A-1 Pictures style. This said, the color palette perfectly matched the tone of the anime, and said tone was the strongest aspect of this show, in fact, I liked it quite a lot. The music was excellent. It did its job brilliantly and added to that aforementioned tone. If not for this tone, I would have dropped my overall score to 3 or 4.Opening and EndingWhile the opening did a good job introducing you to the world and tone, however, it was rather forgettable. The ending, on the other hand, is one of the best endings I have ever heard. The way that the end of an episode seamlessly flowed along into the ending really led to some memorable moments, even if said moments did not have any reason to be memorable.I have not read the light novel, but if the story and characters of the anime are faithful to its source material. Then the biggest problem lies here. As an adaptation, A-1 Pictures did a pretty good job. All the elements that could have only been done in an anime were done quite well, and as an adaptation, I would give this show an easy 8.

It legit took me a 3 day weekend to finish all 24 episodes. I love the trash characters the decent fights, boring characters, relatively interesting story and the harem. I really enjoy the music in the show, and the world that the show takes place in in a-lot. Saying that I like it so much I actually read the light novel now. Since I have watch this show I have watch all the shows that are compared to this and I always end them thinking about how the asterisk war is better...and then I go back and watch it. and then I go back and watch it."", ""If you like fanservice, ecchi, a protagonist so overpowered that no one can possibly defeat him and a bunch of girls who fight over him, then you have gotten yourself an anime you might enjoy.But, for people like me who want actual developement, plot and lovable characters, this anime is trash.So. shall we discuss what makes this show so unbearable to watch?**SPOILER FREE**While I found the plot slightly interesting at first, the story was executed horribly. And I mean very horribly, this show is an insult to even those stories who have almost no plot to work with.Here, we are introduced to our main protagonist,...Ayayto Amagiri, a boy whose mysticle powers are chained, meaning he has a (limited) usage of them, while others can use their own powers freely. He meets a girl named Julis, a violent tsundere whose past I cannot make sense of.Of course, during their first meeting, he witnesses her changing and gets slapped (classic). After this, he fights her, wins, and automatically takes her place. It goes on like this, one by one, a girl is added to the harem, until he reaches the final stage.Basically, that's all there is. OH, and the very irrevelant match between schools.All that talk about his secret in the description is just that his sister is missing and it is never really revealed why.Other than that, the characters are shit, I don't give any shits about the sound. The animation is alright and the art is pretty to look at. And thats it.Do yourself a favor, and don't watch this. It's garbage.

It will only hold you back in the end.So now that that little piece, that only people who watched the show already would understand completely, is out of the way let's think up an opening statement for The Asterisk War......I got nothing. Let's just hit it.Story: 7Lightsaber dueling academies duking it out in a massive tournament. Sounds like my kind of town. This is the scene of our main protagonist Ayato (I-ya-toe). You knew exactly what these guys had in store when the...first thing he does on screen is go to do a gentlemanly act and ends up catching a female lead in the middle of getting dressed and staring for three seconds too long. Said female lead is named Julis (U-lis) and she immediately wants him dead while at the same time owes him for his good deed. One would think the two cancel out but who am I to suggest logic. They have a quick duel that proves they are both strong but get interrupted by the student council prez Claudia. She takes him to her office where to admits there was really no reason to stop the match, but she wanted him alone anyways. Sounds like my kind of chick. From there Ayato plans on partnering with Julis in this big lightsaber, tag-team, duel tournament.I mean there is something to this anime that keep me invested story wise. It may just be me wanting to see this tournament and the aftermath of it all or maybe it is just the characters and how they react to each other, like in most ecchi/harem animes. Either way, I watched most of this show on a binge night of insomnia and came out satisfied thus far so I have no major complaints. One thing that was always on my mind during the whole thing was who the antagonist was since the show just loved playing stage magician and tried to make us guess between the shady characters lined up before us. In the end, in it ended up being weakness itself. I'll let you figure it out from there or just watch the anime. It doesn't really have too much that brings it down but then again it doesn't really break any new ground either. It also re-affirms my earlier statement. As a whole, it is a good story, but not one that really draws people in. I just chose it as a random title selection. I'm sure that's the only way people are finding this show now-a-days.Art and Sound: 6 & 8One thing I appreciate about the art in this anime is how they didn't force down your throat that this is a futuristic anime. You know what I mean, when the detail in how futuristic the world is is panned over more times then the fingers on your hand. When it takes every opportunity to show how the environment is so advanced in comparison to the one the person watching is currently in. They keep it down in terms of future shit. They will show off their nice toys but they don't make it a main focus of the show. They show us early on that A. weapons can condense into simple handles/grips and will materialize when needed and B. the schools, as well as the island city they are attached to, are all connected on one big mainframe and that duels between peers and rival alike can be announced automatically. Aside from that, holographic signs, AI robots, and integrated web and phone usage is now down SAO style. You know the whole wave hand to call up a menu and what not. Everything else is simply normal anime design. Which is good because it looks smooth and doesn't have anything that looks out of place.Sound did better compared to art though. The opening, adequately named A Brand New, is really catchy and has made it's way onto my favorite openings list. It's that pump up jam that gets you excited for the episode to come and that's good. I normally skip over the opening when I binge to save time, but this was one of those times where I didn't care because of how great it was. The ending was also really nice, finishing each episode with what can really only be described as a dream send off. I could fall asleep to it anytime. The song is called Waiting for the Rain and it is so light-hearted it really doesn't matter what happened in the episode, you will feel better about yourself when you listen to it. Voice acting wasn't as good as the OP and ED but they weren't cringe worthy either. Everyone has a voice actor or actress whose voice fit the personality of the character, which is good because it would feel weird otherwise. Sound effects are also good but can we take a moment to talk about how the beam sword on and off sound effect sounds strangely, and almost copy-right worthy, to that of the lightsaber? I not saying we should make a thing out of it, I'm just saying that it is pretty close. It just has that feeling, like when you hear the door opening sound from Doom. In the end, I thought the sound was really good.Character: 6Ah dammit, another mid range score. Yes the archetypes are back once again. Let's rattle them off real quick. Ayato is a dense male who is surrounded by Tsundere Julis, Big chest flirt Claudia, numb feeling flat chest girl, and shy klutz girl. I say that they put a nice twist on them but honestly that would be lying and I honestly don't have the energy to provide enough BS to cover that lie up. To be fair, Ayato does decide by episode 3 who he will stay beside and will be ignorant to the rest. Except for Claudia; he will do the embarrassed run motion every time it gets good. Julis does warm up to the main protagonist quicker than most Tsunderes. Aside from that, pretty typical stuff. I will praise the fact that they gave the AI's personality here. Too many times have I seen AI with the flat tone voice. It honesty gets old and this is a nice change of pace. But main character-wise, you know what you are getting as soon as you see it.Enjoyment: 7I can't say I was totally impressed here, but I will say I was entertained. I would add it onto my list of worlds I would love to take part in, but then again lists like those are already long enough as is. The show does it's best to make the world feel fun as well as intense and does a pretty good job of it. Although the lack in character variety leaves a little bit to be desired and the climax at the end kind of acts like a bottle rocket type of bang. Which is again sad since we were shown many different sets of grand finale packages. At the time of this review, I am watching through season two, so the show is good enough that you will want to finish it completely at least.Overall: 7Author update: I actually didn't go through season 2 after writing this. Kinda stopped because I got really bored. I also have a re-review for this season as well as season 2 in the season 2 review. I correct my thoughts on this season and give it a new score so check it out. first thing he does on screen is go to do a gentlemanly act and ends up catching a female lead in the middle of getting dressed and staring for three seconds too long.

I would add it onto my list of worlds I would love to take part in, but then again lists like those are already long enough as is. The show does it's best to make the world feel fun as well as intense and does a pretty good job of it. Although the lack in character variety leaves a little bit to be desired and the climax at the end kind of acts like a bottle rocket type of bang. Which is again sad since we were shown many different sets of grand finale packages. At the time of this review, I am watching through season two, so the show is good enough that you will want to finish it completely at least.Overall: 7Author update: I actually didn't go through season 2 after writing this. Kinda stopped because I got really bored. I also have a re-review for this season as well as season 2 in the season 2 review. I correct my thoughts on this season and give it a new score so check it out."", 'Its another SAO just in the future. You got one guy who is the protagonist with amazing god like sword skills, a heroin with abit of Tsundere character, a few other characters which are mainly girls. Yep its similar to SAO only with slightly better plot.Overall if you are looking at something similar to SAO which has a good amount of action and some romance here and there then this anime is perfect for you. The action is really good to be honest. The plot is quite interesting and makes you want to know more. The graphics are nice which is expected from A-1 Pictures....Its a good anime that doesnt follow to much of SAO but its still similar to SAO Its a good anime that doesnt follow to much of SAO but its still similar to SAO', ""Yet again, made by the same people that did SAO. This review will contain spoilers so read at your own risk.Story: Highly generic, unoriginal and cliche all the way through. This show's story was the exact same as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry which aired at the same time. Read my review about that for in terms of the story. But this one was much more generic and poorly done.Art: Artwork was the same as SAO, not spectacular or amazing yet not horrible.Sound: The intro to the show has to be one of my favorites. However that is where it ends. Most of the...voice acting makes me regret this show.Characters: Just like SAO the downfall is the characters. I understand after 12 episodes it is hard to develop good characters. But at the same time, the author could have created characters I actually could struggle to give two fucks about. But no you have two overpowered MC (one male and one female) with absolutely zero chemistry between them. The interactions between them is like watching Brittney Spears in 2007; it is a train wreck waiting to happen yet you still watch.Enjoyment: While I have seen much worse, I expected something better from the same people that did SAO. Yet at the same time, I should have expected this piece of shit to come out of that studio. A show with so much potential to be very good ends up getting butchered because the studio gives up halfway through. They poorly develop the characters. The story goes off on random ass, useless, pointless tangents that it can't come back from. And of course the MC has to be Captain Save a Hoe, and he can't even redeem himself from that.When I get around to doing my review for Season 2, expect it to be about the same but more brutal. This show had me at points, when the MC would do something, I would ask myself why is he so stupid? Is this a joke? Let that dumb bitch die. You can't save everyone. Maybe I might die from how terrible this show gets. But that is all season 2. voice acting makes me regret this show.Characters: Just like SAO the downfall is the characters.

And I've watched the Season 2, so...Story: First off, are you okay watching an adaptation of a generic harem LN/manga/whatever? Because this is generic. I didn't expect for a plot at all, but there is... if you look closely enough. I merely watched it for girls, fighting and the harem genre, so I was like, why not? Sadly,the plot lacked so much explanation and background. I didn't read the source for this anime and maybe there's more explanation there. The plot, from what I understand, is that a...group of rich and influential corporations that makes students fight each other for a chance to get what they wish. The 12 episodes don't really tell much plot-wise, so I suggest binge watching this to S2 like I did. There are a lot of weird things in the story like when Lester tries for the same weapon on the same day as Ayato when Lester is a long time student compared to Ayato who just recently transferred. It seems like it was shown just to make fun of him. There are a lot of these things that will just stress you out if you think about it. And it would be best to just take them at face value and enjoy the fights.Art: One of the main factors watched this anime is for the cute female characters, particularly Claudia. The colors are okay. The fights are awesome. There's also a Live2D of Claudia at the end.Sound: Okay as well, not that memorable but not terrible. Oh yeah, I forgot... I DISLIKE Flora's voice. Who's Flora? She's in S2.Character: They're kind of generic. I didn't like Julis as Ayato's partner because tsundere partners are a bit overused plus... CLAUDIA IS BEST GIRL, DON'T @ ME. Claudia likes Ayato and asserts himself ever since the start. SO WHY IS AYATO PICKING JULIS? I have no idea. Plus, she has assets man, unlike Julis. Heck, I'd even pick Kirin over her since she is also adorable, but given that she's 13... we might have problems. I feel neutral with Saya in terms of romance and I see her as a model to advertise her dad's guns. Dirk looks like a mafia boss. Lester is swole, but I hate how they made him look so weak when he could've been a really nice ally after a few episodes.Enjoyment: Girls + fighting + magic/science/ability/whatever = Enjoyable to meOverall: 7.Do you like girls?Do you like fighting?Do you not care much of plot?Do you have spare time to watch generic stuff?Do you want to use your spare time to watch generic stuff?If you say yes to most of those, you would like this. group of rich and influential corporations that makes students fight each other for a chance to get what they wish.

Its a typical harem anime, but the story is a little different from most so its not extraordinary or poor, just plain typical. I went back and forth between fair and good for this show but went with good and I\'ll explain. It doesn\'t really have to much fan service and focuses on telling a story, and the story is actually pretty good and they do a good job of moving it along forward with good timing. Its not choppy or slow or moves away from the plot and the character progression...is pretty good too. Battle scenes are okay and there is sub plots a plenty, I liked it and thought they did a good job of balance and recommend anyone who is on the fence, just go ahead and watch it. is pretty good too. Battle scenes are okay and there is sub plots a plenty, I liked it and thought they did a good job of balance and recommend anyone who is on the fence, just go ahead and watch it.', 'My thoughts on the show were heavily influenced by Digibro\'s ""The Asterisk War Sucks"" videos. I only watched one, but it did help me look at this show much more critically than I would\'ve originally.Story: 5There\'s NOTHING special about Asterisk War\'s story. A generic plot for a generic light novel. There\'s this academy, you see, and there are six factions. They all train people in this super cool magic technology fighting thing, where you have weapons called Luxes and magic called Prana and stuff, and there are races like Strega and Genestella, and you have battle terms and tactical messages like setting-type and-Yeah, it isn\'t...going to cut it.The story of this isn\'t necessarily bad. It\'s incredibly generic, for sure, but I can see potential. A lot of the world was introduced but not gone over, so the watchers are left in confusion about what this item is or what that is, who this group is. That brings me to plot holes and foreshadowing. There is SO. MUCH. FORESHADOWING. In this show. It\'s not even funny. Watching this feels like every couple of minutes a new character or threat or even start of a new arc is put into action, and these things will be completely ignored for the rest of the show or foreshadowed multiple more times without any consistency, leading to a very contrived and seemingly dynamic plot that just has holes and confusion. On a technical aspect the story is a wreck, but this messy, generic, harem does have potential to be fleshed out for a legitimately good story. That\'s about all there is to it.It\'s typical of light novel adaptations though. Look at No Game No Life, they ended on a serious cliffhanger. Asterisk War isn\'t all that different. It wraps up like, half of an arc, but there\'s still too many things left unexplained to be considered acceptable.Art: 7This art also has tons of potential that isn\'t used. Let me just say this, the animation is BEAUTIFUL. The effects are top-notch; they\'re flashy, colorful, fluid, all that. The opening is just a visual orgasm. The 3-D effects are amazing, and it\'s excellent how it zoomed through the bases of each of the six factions. Great job for the opening designers.But anyways, the art has potential that is wasted. I can only explain this feeling as the animators were ""lazy."" The environment wasn\'t breathtaking nor was it abhorrent, but it was just lazy and didn\'t stand out. Another thing was, the art worked too hard to bring focus to one character. Some scenes felt like one character would speak or move around and the others would be frozen until their turn came. It was too linear and sequential.Another thing is the fights were lazily choreographed. Some of the fight moves seem contrived and forced, not to mention illogical. I mean, if you\'re going to block a sword swing, would you block it with the very tip of your weapon when you could be safe and use the main body? If you\'re going to attack, are you going to practically fall forwards if you miss, leaving yourself open for a direct hit on the back? Remind me how long your sword is; not that long, right, so you should probably move a bit closer before you attack if you want to hit anything. And some of the fights defy physics. I get that it\'s like magic and super powers and whatever, but we don\'t get an explanation on the limits of these magi-tech weapons and their users. They can block a lightning fast two-handed overhead strike with an upwards motion using one hand, yet they don\'t know how to redirect a weapon clash and slide forwards to attack?TLDR, too many inconsistencies with combat limitations and physics. Everything just seems like everybody is in god-mode, except for the losers.Sound: 5Hey, I don\'t harp on sound or anything, I usually don\'t care. However, there were some extreeeeemely cringe-worthy voice actors that I realized, SUPER annoying. Kirin, Korona, for example. Everybody else is just a generic voice. Other than that, the music was fine. The sound effects were good- especially when Saya pulls Ayato\'s head into her chest. That was good.Character: 6With a generic light novel plot comes generic light novel characters. Here\'s the roster:-Protagonist-kun Ayato is noble, overpowered, and usually random when it comes to how he behaves. Oh, and he\'s completely oblivious to his harem. Sound familiar?-Tsundere deuteragonist Julis who is extremely predictable and also pretty overpowered.-Deredere sadist Kurodia. She has huge boobs and is flirtatiously aggressive.-Anti-social gun-loving childhood friend Saya. Loli, ahoge, laid-back, calm..-Airhead Kirin. Loli with huge bust, squeaky voice, and vanilla sword skills.-Autonomous robot AR-D. Mechanical, powerful, but still gets his ass kicked by RM-C through sexism.Those are the main characters, protagonist-kun and his harem. AR-D only shows up in like, half of one episode, but he\'s easily my favorite character right after Saya. Everybody else falls under a couple of categories. One is ""mysterious character who isn\'t memorable and has too many ulterior motives."" Two is ""villain with too many ulterior motives."" Three is ""supporting character who shows up randomly."" Four is ""not important generic NPC placeholder.""Characters are generic, nobody special. Gets a 6 because AR-D is funny as hell and needs more screen time, and Saya is my favorite type of girl. But anyways, the most overused archetypes there are.Enjoyment: 8I can\'t say I didn\'t enjoy the first 7 episodes. Until I watched Digibro\'s videos, I happily took in this show for what it was worth. Sure, it was generic and predictable and full of bothersome mysterious plot contrivances and nonsense, but I like that kind of stuff. Of course it was no longer a masterpiece after I started paying attention, but that\'s okay. I don\'t hate this show.Overall: 6It was alright, to be honest. I enjoyed it, but there are problems with the show. Much like Sword Art Online, where the plot jumps around and doesn\'t make sense because nothing is really explained to you, and plot holes are skipped over in favor of random arcs and crap. Much like Sword Art Online, where the protagonist is just overpowered and doesn\'t have much trouble with anything because he\'s just naturally good. Much like Sword Art Online, where the side characters really don\'t have much screentime and personality consistency, and also the second main character is a tsundere. Much like Sword Art Online, where the art and sound weren\'t exactly shit but could have been put to much better use. Much like Sword Art Online, because I fucking loved it until I realized how bad it was.Yeah, I know it\'s a dick move to compare this show to SAO. Everybody does that these days. The two shows just share a lot of issues that led to their downfalls. I should write a recommendation for them.Don\'t take my words for granted. This show has a wide variety of reception: from people rating it complete garbage because of all the errors to people rating it ten because of how cool it was to them.

And folks, this time there\'s even more of a harem!That\'s right. The Asterisk(*) War is, in a nice term, decent at what it tries to accomplish. Personally, I\'m just glad it isn\'t as bad as Magical Warfare (I pity you if you have any idea of what this monstrosity is).Story ~4~:I\'ll say it. The story is mediocre at best. Normally in my reviews I include a summary and ties many useful statements that no one asked for to make my point, but I feel rather lazy with this one, so just read...the provided synopsis . . . Read it? Great! Our main character, Ayato Amagiri (a name you will never forget cause I swear it\'s looped into the soundtrack), has no idea what he wants to do with his life or why he\'s even attending the main setting, Seidoukan Academy. Of course this gets fleshed out during the series, but the reason he finds is annoying and backwards.Enter four pretty girls. They all want Ayato for some reason. Because he saw one in her panties, is a childhood friend with another, is doted on for no particular reason, and save one from child abuse. Okay, the last one is reasonable, but that\'s what makes her best girl (not like I\'m gonna say who cause we don\'t want spoilersss).And off people go to fight at another magical competition to have their wish granted. Only, this season doesn\'t cover the finish of the competition. Thank God for season two, right?! No, I\'m upset I watched it. I ended up scrolling through Instagram while trying to pay attention.Soooo decent story, almost non existent. It\'s kind of just made up as the series goes along.Art ~7~:The art is actually very good. Pretty designs, nice uniforms too. I had a feeling they were practicing with CGI because every preview was animated in that way. For most of the scenes, the 3D animation didn\'t clash too much. One could catch a glimpse of the change and then it would be gone.Sound ~8~:You almost never can go wrong with music. The soundtrack is pretty nice, suits its theme well. You can find the playlist on YouTube and be able to pinpoint which song was played where. It helps add to the anime, as the characters don\'t exactly have much to add for themselves. But hey! ""Waiting For the Rain"" was produced because of this anime, so I will be very grateful.Character ~3~:Yare yare dane~ As most weeaboos will say. And they\'d be right. Or I would be right. Whichever, the cast was very poorly fleshed out.Enter Ayato: The MAL synopsis state he has a secret, and while that may be true, it\'s not the reason he entered the Academy. Actually, Ayato has no idea why he entered the Academy other does ""Finding what it is that I should be doing."" That\'s his whole character. Even after supposedly finding what he should be doing, he still searches for something to do. It was like looking through the eyes of a puppet. His only saving grace? He\'s hot, so I enjoyed looking at him. But really, why would any chick be interested in him for other than that? Oh right. He\'s extremely overpowered. Yay.Princess Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld: She is the standard tsundere character. Well, mix himedere and tsundere together, and that\'s her. She lightens up over time, but watching her scenes become dull and annoying, as that\'s all her personality is.Saya Sasamiya: I actually enjoyed watching this character because she started out as a kuudere, but over time, I found out she\'s not at all. Just very quiet. She has goals and dreams and I have to say, girl. Ayato is not good enough for you.Claudia Enfield: *commence eye roll* Miss Student Council President. She seems kind, but describes herself as cunning and then receives one questionable scene that never gets explained. Her entire character irritated me, and apparently she\'s hungry for Ayato as well.Kirin Toudou: I know earlier I stated that I would not disclose who best girl is, but how could I not? Kirin is absolutely best girl. She has a reason to really like Ayato, and she has a goal of her own throughout the series. My only ONLY qualm with her is that SHE IS 13 YEARS OLD. I just have an immensely hard time being comfortable with the scenes between this child and a 16 year old male. Just yikes.A few characters deserve an honorable mention: Ernesta Kühne and Yabuki Eishirou.Ernesta seriously pissed me off at times, but I swear she\'s the best character in the whole show. She\'s the perfect antagonist where they\'re for sure evil inside, and yet not purposefully antagonistic towards the protagonists simply because that is not her goal in the show.Yabuki is the carefree type that also gets a questionable scene that states his role may not be what the viewer is lead to believe.Enjoyment ~6~:I\'m irritated, but I did enjoy the show. I don\'t hate it like others do, but I can admit it\'s only average at best. Maybe I\'m being too harsh, perhaps I\'m being too lenient, but that\'s my thoughts. If you\'re just kicking back and want a meaningless watch that has magic, action, and boobs, be my guest. If you want intellectual content steer clear.Overall ~6~:Yeah, the real score is 5.6, but eh. I\'ll give the show a break. It was entertaining until it wasn\'t.Favorite Ship: AR-D X RM-C (Yeah they\'re robots, but they make an interesting duo. Kind of like a married couple, I suppose X3)Favorite Character: Ernesta KühneFavorite Song: ""Waiting For The Rain"" by Maaya Sakamoto the provided synopsis . . . Read it? Great!

Just yikes.A few characters deserve an honorable mention: Ernesta Kühne and Yabuki Eishirou.Ernesta seriously pissed me off at times, but I swear she\'s the best character in the whole show. She\'s the perfect antagonist where they\'re for sure evil inside, and yet not purposefully antagonistic towards the protagonists simply because that is not her goal in the show.Yabuki is the carefree type that also gets a questionable scene that states his role may not be what the viewer is lead to believe.Enjoyment ~6~:I\'m irritated, but I did enjoy the show. I don\'t hate it like others do, but I can admit it\'s only average at best. Maybe I\'m being too harsh, perhaps I\'m being too lenient, but that\'s my thoughts. If you\'re just kicking back and want a meaningless watch that has magic, action, and boobs, be my guest. If you want intellectual content steer clear.Overall ~6~:Yeah, the real score is 5.6, but eh. I\'ll give the show a break. It was entertaining until it wasn\'t.Favorite Ship: AR-D X RM-C (Yeah they\'re robots, but they make an interesting duo. Kind of like a married couple, I suppose X3)Favorite Character: Ernesta KühneFavorite Song: ""Waiting For The Rain"" by Maaya Sakamoto', ""Overall:6Gakusen Toshi Asterisk definitely isn't a waste of your time, but that's about what I'll say for it. I might be a bit rough on it, but I was intensely underwhelmed by this anime, so I didn't feel like being nice to it either.Story: 3This anime is a wierd combination of tournaments, a harem, and political intrigue. Despite its attempts, however, it cannot quite manage to succeed at any of these. In order, the tournament is the most put together of the three. The tournament happens, there are fights, and the anime gets through the prelims in the first season. The anime may have done...better if they had spent more time developing the fights, which were more like short clips of the main characters instantly whiping their opponents. Starting the tournament earlier would probably have helped, because the payoff in this season was not very strong.The harem element of this anime was lackluster. There are 4 main members of the harem who are all individually decent, but the harem gets stuck on the oblivious protagonist throughout the season. If the characters were interesting, or trying to win him over in cute scenes, then this would be fine. Alas, this is not the case.The political intrigue in this anime is where a lot of the actual plot comes from, which is unfortunate considering that it's a mess. The basic factions are very rudimentarily explained, but otherwise the viewer must go to incredible lengths to pick up anything useful about the interactions of these factions. The goals of each faction are a mystery, except perhaps that their leaders want to win a tournament eventually. There are vague mentions of secret services and codes of conduct, but none of these are revealed clearly.Art: 6The art is generic, but it's decently done. This is an easy area to succeed in in my opinion if the anime is professionally made. I was tempted to make it a 7, but the severe limitation of character expression and the ability for the art to convey emotions makes it a solid 6.Sound: 5The music was passable, but I never stopped to listen to it or anything. I certainly didn't feel like the ambient music improved the anime to any extraordinary extent. The voice acting wasn't terrible, but it could definitely be a lot better.Character: 5The characters are all archetypical cutouts of other generic characters, sometimes even without any adjustments at all. It's essentially a strong and compassionate main character who is good at fighting, a tsundere that becomes increasingly dere, an awkward quiet girl, a cute junior high girl who's physiscally mature for her age, and one assertive woman who's all over the place character wise. To make matters worse, the character motivations in this anime are essentially nonexistent and are almost totally inconsequential to the plot. Furthermore, the means by which they intend to fulfill their superficial goals is irrelevant to the goal itself (win tournament, get wish, wish for thing). In this case, this makes the motivations seem even more inconsequential and offer little to no character development opportunities.Enjoyment: 7I really like anime, and I was in the mood for an overpowered main character. I didn't get my fix in that regard, but it was flashing lights and terrible pronunciations of European names, so I had fun. Kirin was adorable, so I had extra fun when she was on screen, even if she is not a great character herself (probably the best in this anime though). better if they had spent more time developing the fights, which were more like short clips of the main characters instantly whiping their opponents.

It was a different take on the future. Built on human evolution. The tournament aspect of the show was pretty good too. It added stakes the the fights that were entertaining. Plus, I...liked the combat and how strategic it was.Art:The art was enjoyable. They used 3D graphics well, and did a great job animating the combat scenes. They looked very crisp and colorful.Sound:The voice acting was pretty good, but that was all that really stood out. The music wasn't really memorable either.Character:Easily the worst part of the show. The characters seemed like they were picked out of a hat full of stereotypical anime characters. It was a struggle watching this show at times because the main characters behaved exactly how you expected them to. This show is proof that the tsundere character has been beaten to death, resurrected, and then beaten to death again. It's way overexposed. Every time this show started to gain some ground in being great, it drags you back down with the awful characters.Enjoyment:This show was a rollercoaster. I enjoyed the story development and the action. The setup was fun to watch. But this show is held back by it's bad character design, or lack thereof.Overall:This show is hard to grade. I have to give the show its props for having a good story and world setting.

The characters are as a generic as you could possibly get, main dude who looks mediocre and has a harem of girls around him. Some are creepily underage or look creepily underage. The actual plot is predictable as hell and it\'s annoying that at the end of some episodes they have a \'evil\' person say stuff like ""what am I going to do about this"" or ""ooh this is going to change that"" sort of things. Like those vague hints are just bar writing.Fights are...flashy (and I don\'t mean that in a good way). Just power up a glowing sword or explosions with very little tactics aside from do something stronger. It seemed like it could\'ve had some interesting focus on swordplay but unfortunately not. Female characters get hyped up as amazing but then ultimately disappoint once they join the simping after the main character.Towards the end they rush a bunch of explanations and a villain but it happens so quickly the stakes seem inconsequential. Only positive is that the first opening song is pretty catchy. Save your time, watch something else, get a girlfriend with better taste. flashy (and I don\'t mean that in a good way).

However, in effort of taking itself so seriously it is simply uncomfortable to watch.I I could make a pie chart it would consist of 8% Graphics, 17% Plot, 5% humor, 70% cringing fan service. It's like putting Lisa Ann into an episode of the fucking Teletubbies because they want to reach a mature audience.

It feels like you are watching a generic harem anime.I think it's mainly because of the combination between plot armor and MC's character setting.MC's character setting is he supposed to be one of the strongest character in the series, but due to his lack of control/discipline during the young age his older sister sealed his stronger power. He is still strong thanks to his martial art style but when it comes to battle again stronger opponent this shit doesn't really matter because the finisher that he use to win the match is his lost stronger power. So as you can...see MC potential is already there at the near max waiting to be unlock so what will you get during the battle is not something like other MC where they have to overcome the limit or something similar to achieve victory but it is more like a cheap plot armor that give him boost to win the battle as if there is no weight in that battle.The heroines are OK I guess?, meh, I don't know to be honest. Frankly I don't remember them that much to be honest.. LOL.Also this anime is aired during the same season as Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry so you will ended up comparing these two due to the similar plot. You will notice that the other one is great and the other one is just bland. see MC potential is already there at the near max waiting to be unlock so what will you get during the battle is not something like other MC where they have to overcome the limit or something similar to achieve victory but it is more like a cheap plot armor that give him boost to win the battle as if there is no weight in that battle.The heroines are OK I guess?, meh, I don't know to be honest.

Nothing great or horrible. Characters were really bland, and just generic feeling to me. There were a couple of exceptions, but as a whole, the characters were forgettable. I probably would say that I liked Saya the most, mostly because I like how bad ass she is with her weapons. The majority of the backstories we were given of these characters just left me feeling ""eh"" towards them. They were either not explored enough or I just simply wasn\'t interested. Like if the creator decided...to just kill all them off, I wouldn\'t feel any type of emotion because I wasn\'t invested in them enough.I did like the fight scenes. At times, they were cool and grabbed my attention. Was I at the edge of my seat at anytime? No. Nonetheless, I enjoyed them to an extent. Although the story was ""eh"" to me, it did hold my attention to the end so I guess that\'s a positive. If I had to be honest, I mostly stuck around for the tournament cause I like fighting and tournaments. I feel like a lot of people are being harsh on this anime, but in all honesty it\'s just an average anime to me. I wasn\'t impressed by it but I wasn\'t appalled by it either, so I feel a 5/10 rating feels right to me. to just kill all them off, I wouldn\'t feel any type of emotion because I wasn\'t invested in them enough.I did like the fight scenes.

The potential for this to be great is like asking for syrup for your waffles, and you only fill up 2 or 3 squares worth. Simply put, it's a dead fish flopping around for no good reason. The whole story surrounds this tournament of sorts where the winner get a coveted prize (wow)! And then you basically follow your MC and the harem as they happily work together to defeat the evils standing between them and the prize! (Goodness, this hurts) The characters are bland, uninspiring, and at times just plain annoying. The harem did not interest me in the slightest,...as they appeared to be dead NPC's with the most tropest of tropes possible. Art is decent, especially with some of the battle scenes, but otherwise is standard. I appreciated the OP and ED, but otherwise the soundtrack just detracts from the experience. Avoid if possible. Do not pass Go. Do not watch for the lackluster character backstories that have been done before. Do not watch in the hopes that the battle scenes can carry this series on it's old, ailing back.

I find this quite annoying because it's shown that the battle isn't as good as it says.As for the Harem part, this is very boring because it doesn't have any different elements from other Harem themed anime.Even though there is no sequel, I understand a little about the person who is related to Ayato's older sister, namely the principal himself.Repair if wrong.The point of everything I said, I liked this anime only the first time I watched it and not the second time.No wonder this anime has experienced a decline in its score, even though previously it was still relatively stable with a score of 7. in this case he often gets overwhelmed during matches, so is he actually strong or not?The third flaw is in the battle itself, the fight seems ordinary but the commentators always exaggerate.

Honoo no Mirage: Minagiwa no Hangyakusha,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1020/Honoo_no_Mirage__Minagiwa_no_Hangyakusha,"[""After coming from the main series, I had hoped that the sequel might move the plot forward somehow. Instead, the plot moves sideways and sort of flops. It has glaring flaws that, had I not just watched the main anime, I probably might grimace at. Would I still recommend it? Absolutely.ART: 5/10. This is probably the most disappointing part of the 3-part OVA. You can tell that Madhouse was on an incredibly short budget with the increasing amount of still frames and slow pans. It felt like one of those 5-minute BL videos with the stiff expressions and jerky movements—except it was 1 hr and...30 minutes as opposed to just five. When up close, it feels more like the original with their fluidity and expressions. But scenarios, backgrounds, and transitions are all choppy at best, and there was a good 1-2 minutes of a scene that had no dialogue. Which would feel impactful and deliberate…if the other flaws didn’t creep in literally minutes afterwards.Still, Takaya, Haruie, and Naoe are animated beautifully, and their expressions in this OVA are some of the rawest yet. Especially Takaya and Naoe, who are the shining cast of this OVA. The last episode, too, made up for the other two. Haruie’s animation shines best in the ED and the last episode, which closes her chapter.MUSIC: 6/10. There weren’t many changes from the original. Nothing really stood out to me either. The OP and ED, again, weren’t my cuppa, but the rest of the OSTs still stand strong.STORY: 8/10. Melodramatic at times, the focus splits between Haruie’s past, a race against time to thwart enemy plans, and Takaya/Kagetora and Naoe’s increasingly toxic relationship. A definite weak point is how the OVA tries to do many things—and accomplishes all of those things—but none of them well, leaving the audience feeling placated rather than satisfied. Two of the major points it closes decently, while one—probably the most predictable—is open-ended.Why the rating is high despite the execution being barely average is the lengths the OVA takes concerning Takaya/Kagetora and Naoe’s relationship. Even as it’s labeled a ‘shounen ai,’ the OVA has more graphic (quite literally, as there was implied SA from Kagetora’s past, which might be triggering to some) scenes than all 13 episodes from the main anime combined. The scene in particular where Naoe and Takaya have an extended confrontation proves to illustrate how much Kagetora is breaking Naoe down—and it’s easy to brush off as miscommunication until the very end, where the audience has the misfortune of witnessing exactly what Naoe has been trying to fight against. The ending has a much different tone compared to the ending of the main series, and it might make your heart ache a bit.Compared to that, Haruie’s relationship with her past lover, Shintarou, and the Araki scuffle are like appetizers. They pull the audience to the story, but they won’t be what the audience will be ultimately paying attention to.CHARACTERS: 8/10. Concerning the main cast:Takaya: Still wounded from the main series, he’s grown a sense of maturity and leadership, but his pressure point is still undeniably Naoe, who he shares an unresolved tension with. He switches between being frustrated and wanting to lash out and wanting to completely detach himself, but even with their shared baggage, there’s a hazardous gravitational pull between him and Naoe. Takaya feels like a man trying to run on thin ice, either skating too far or slipping too hard, either way damaging himself or those around him. Unlike before where Takaya was foul-mouthed but bratty, his dialogue to Naoe especially is cutting and caustic, a sharp contrast to the main series and an indication of Kagetora's influence on him. By far, he and Naoe are the most interesting in this OVA.Naoe: The anime opens up with Naoe, which sets the tone for the next two episodes. There hasn’t been much change with him, because Naoe is already a man on his last leg. Halfway into the OVA, a new status quo is established, one where he slowly begins to resign himself even as his heart desperately wars for freedom. Still, there are moments in the OVA where Naoe’s role feels redundant especially with Haruie already there, and there are other moments that illustrate Kagetora and Naoe’s dual nature beautifully. Those moments—and those quiet moments of despair—make up for the occasional lackluster performance during action scenes.Haruie: She’s the most black-and-white of the three characters, the OVA choosing to delve into the finer parts of her personality rather than change/build on it. Considering how little of her was investigated in the main series, this was a very welcome change. This OVA gives a pleasant layer into what makes Haruie her, goes a little bit into her relationship/devotion to Kagetora, and establishes her as a useful, strong-willed character. If for only this alone, I would appreciate this OVA; unfortunately, because Haruie’s part was also balanced by the other plot points, it wasn’t as fleshed out as it could have been.OVERALL: 8/10. By itself, the OVA would be ranked lower, but in conjunction with the main series, it follows up nicely. There are still many plotholes (Yuzuru, who isn’t even a focus in this OVA, Nobunaga, etc.) but what the OVA decides to concentrate on it does decently. Unlike the main series, there aren’t many loose ends and while the pace of the OVA is frequently slow (making you want to lose attention), the dynamics between Takaya and Naoe really shines here. You get the sense that while there may not be a happy ending awaiting them, there’ll be an ending that will bond them together for as many lifetimes as they dare to reincarnate. 30 minutes as opposed to just five.

And before I go further, please watch the main series before reading this review. As knowledge about some characters is probably needed :3----FANSERVICE WARNING---Seriously, I don\'t know why OVAs nowadays contains so much fanservice. Okay, it is cool. Maybe a little eroge as well. But the story is off. However, this OVA did actually a great job following the story....Still, way to much fanservice. You either like it or find it disturbing.As I said earlier. It main focus is Daigo. As known as a hentai, and nothing has changed since then. Some surprises in the story which is always good. And it is a little cosy one as well.I wont complain on the sound. Nothing special, and it inst disturbing. However, I find the art a little bit ""re-drawn"". Eyeshadows aren\'t so much as in the main series. It\'s a positive thing as I found it more natural this way.As I said earlier, Daigo hasn\'t changed, so haven\'t the rest of the characters. Helping characters are still helping, and those who are perverted are still perverted...In short, this OVA is a plus in addition to the series if you enjoyed it. Nonetheless if you did not like it, there\'s no point to move on. Still, way to much fanservice. You either like it or find it disturbing.As I said earlier. It main focus is Daigo.

Even though they weren't very high.Story: 6The story is fairly a simple one, as most are in this genre. Instead of Kazuma taking the spotlight of the lead character, the attention is shifted to Daigo. The entire episode is essentially Daigo looking for a girlfriend. However, this plot line allows for a more comedic approach, and more fanservice, which both appeal to those who were originally interested in the original series.Art: 6The art is that of the quality of the main series. Nothing to extravagant.Sound: 6No new OP or ED in this...OVA, however there is one insert song that some may find appealing.Character: 8This OVA allows for more character expansions on Daigo, which I believe they did a good job with. However, some may not like Daigo as a character. If you're one of those people, this OVA is not for you.Enjoyment: 9I really enjoyed this OVA on a personal level, as I enjoyed the original and only recently found out about this OVA.Overall: 7Overall I would rate Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi OVA as a 7, as it lives up to expectations, but does not however go past that line and impress.

If you are watching this through critical lenses, than you are watching this wrong."", ""Hey guys, so let me give you some advice before watching this anime:If you don't know anything about HypMic, it's pointless to watch this show.So let me tell you a few things before you start this show:If you have no idea at all what HypMic is, it's a Spotify rap project. There are now 6 divisions, each has 3 characters and they basically do rap battles. But that's not all. There's a story told trough drama tracks and manga. But that's still not everything at all. There's also a game, stage play and the official youtube channel. Let's sum this up so you're not so...confused about it:You want to get to know HypMic and find out if it's really a thing for you? You go visit the official channel and try it out. There are some introduction songs and basically all of the songs that are out, but in short ver. You can find full ver. on Spotify but you're trying to get to know HypMic I advice you to give it a shot on youtube first. If you get to like some songs, overall style or some character, you're halfway there. But you probably want to know the characters better because there's a shit ton of characters and you have no idea who you like, unless you instantly fell in love with someone.After that, there're 2 possibilities: either go read manga/drama tracks so you can get to know the story and characters more like a normal person, or do it like me- spend hours on HypMic wikia and read about the characters. I warn you this spoils everything but I was so confused about it I still had to read about everyone at least twice or thrice to finally feel like I know the characters and what the hell's going on.But I strongly advice you to go read manga/translations of drama tracks. I just had noone to tell me what the hell to do.Manga:Follows the same story as drama tracks. Is divided to several titles:-The Dirty Dawg Directory--BB and MTC Directory--FP and M Directory--DH and BAT Directory-You should probably start with TDD manga but then it's up to you. All manga were/are airing simultaneously so it doesn't really matter after the TDD manga.Spotify:Your main spot as a HypMic fan.There are drama tracks (which are translated on HypMic wikia) and full ver. songs. And if you want to support the creators in any way, Spotify is the easiest way to do so.Game:There's a game called HypnosisMic ARB (Alternative Rap Battle). As the name implies - it's a game with alternative story. That's why you won't gen anything from playing the game. Yup, it's fun and feel free to play it, but the game came out in Spring 2020, yet HypMic is a 3 years old project. So the game isn't something that's going to help you get into the story so you shouldn't rely on it.Also it's only in Japanese so be prepared.If you need additional info about something I haven't mentioned you can always look it up on HypMic wikia or ask a fellow HypMic fan, we don't bite :) But please, don't be rude and respect others' opinions. The fandom is pretty chill and we respect each other's opinions. So for example don't go bitchin' about Samatoki for being violent because it just shows you're new or just ignorant and know nothing about him. The same applies to any other character. So please try to refrain from giving your opinions unless you really know 'the HypMic.' It takes some time but if you're really passionate about it you're gonna catch up to us in no time.TLDR: HypMic is a Spotify rap project, go check it out first. It's also on youtube. There's a story told trough drama tracks (on spotify)/manga. There's a game with an alternative story, don't rely on it. At least read characters' introduction. All links are in the text. And be kind to other fans. Be sure to ask us or go to HypMic wikia for more info.There are fonna be fans who maybe won't agree with some stuff I wrote here. But this is just my opinion and I just wrote this on the spot since I noticed the poor score HypMic has. Probably because most of the people know nothing about HypMic and that's not a reason to give a low score. You lack information about anime that's aimed at HypMic fans. If you're not a HypMic fan, then it's obvious who's at fault here.But I don't wanna sound offensive here ^^ The fandom is open to anyone and we'll gladly accept anyone new who wants to join. I just want people to enjoy this show. But to do it you'll need to get to know HypMic at first. And that's basically what I wanted to say here. Thanks to anyone who read it all and hope it helped some of you.But OFC it's totally okay to watch this without knowing anything. I just say you're probably not gonna enjoy it as much as a fan would : )--------------------------------------------------------------------------------And as for my actual opinion on HypMic anime from the first 5 episodes:We're lacking the story but don't worry, it's definitely gonna appear soon. I love people trash-talking HypMic because It dOEsN'T hAvE a StORy, iT's jUsT a FUjosHi bAit. It's like they've never seen any other anime that has many characters so they would like to introduce them first ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Anyway I feel a little confused watching HypMic myself. I feel like the creators weren't really sure if they're aiming at HypMic fans or at new potential fans. And I can feel they decided to aim for both and so the story is going to be a bit rushed due to that... But I still appreciate all the hard work that animators, seiyuus and songwriters put in. Even if the anime turns out to be not that good I'm still gonna give it some love it deserves!I still hope they would animate TDD arc someday... confused about it:You want to get to know HypMic and find out if it's really a thing for you?

But what happens if you try to mesh some of Japan\'s well-known corporations altogether? Take for example:King Records\' (famous for co-producing shitpost anime) Evil Line Records X Idea Factory\'s Otomate label (Fujoshi-bait) X A-1 Pictures (one of the best high-quality anime studios), and you get Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle, more commonly known as HypMic to hardcore fans and fandoms.First spawning hip-hop rap battles of endless hit banger songs in 2018 under the Evil Line Records sub-label, then manga adaptations of its 4 main rap groups and stage plays in 2019, and this year, other than Idea Factory\'s...smartphone game (appealing to Fujoshi fans), HypMic fans have been eagerly waiting for the next notable hit of the mixed-media project: the eventual anime adaptation, produced by none other than A-1 Pictures.I\'d like to preface this as an anime-only: if you like the presentations of the anime, please check out the official Spotify and YouTube channels, along with the other mixed-media iterations, there\'s a hell lot more to the HypMic universe than just pure Fujoshis rap-battling with hip-hop music.Believe it or not; I really want to say this: ""Fuck the story and its plot. Fuck character development. All you absolutely are required to tune into is for the bat-fucking-shit, ""balls to the wall"" ear-rapping insanity of banger songs!"" But hold on, there\'s actually a very simple world-building context for this: Image Beyoncé\'s ""Run the World (Girls)"" song of a weapon-prohibited setting, leaving the Fujoshis left with HypMics for violence tactics.

It\'s not just some mindless circumstances leading up to the eventual musical hip-hop travesty: Fujoshi guys bein\' MA-18 dudes and spittin\' fire bars of bad-ass songs of fiery and burning bridges, because this show is barely worth trying to be serious at all. You might think that ham-fisting this bullshit setting would sound inferior on paper, but bring it to the small screen and let the execution deliver with outstanding levels of lunacy and madness. Combine that with A-1 Pictures\' calibre of exceptional visuals and animation, from the bearable CGI to the high-octane MV-levels of audio-visual rap battles, and you\'re inviting yourself into a marriage of the wackiest, unhinged, yet stylish anime that\'s indeed worthy of the ""one-of-a-kind"" moniker.Oh, that Rhyme Anima opening?

Division Rap Battleで!""', '“And they’re ‘rhymes wack, you hear’?”HypMic.......is a mess. A massive, massive mess. The dialogue is stilted, the tone bafflingly serious despite the premise, the lighting weakly considered, characterization inconsistent with numerous unearned turns, animation mediocre at best and empathetic context missing.Yet, somehow, it manages to be a really funny time.“So Bad It’s Good” is hard to truly quantify, since it depends on what can crack the spectrum to any particular person beyond average, everyday badness. However, most of the time, when applied to anime, it’s used to refer to something that tries to be dark and miserable but comes out as comedic instead; Assassin’s Pride,...Mirai Nikki/Big Order, Ousama Game, Mayoiga and the early episodes of Arifureta as common go-tos. However, those shows tend to operate too much on misery to really hold any likable impressions for my part. Garzey’s Wing is a popular go-to for this category, moreso because of how absurd its entire conceit is than edge falling flat.Hypnosis Mic, though, champions being so bad it’s good for the sheer WTF value nearly every episode. It’s almost impossible to tell how much of the show is merely being an advertisement for music CDs, and how much is the animation team trying to make some sort of grand cohesive tale out of thin air. This push pull between corporate ad and direction vision gives the show a distinct flavor of entertainment.The core idea of the plot is that somehow, in some way, every normal weapon was banned from existing, except for microphones. An all female government is in place, which holds a rap battle tournament that four teams of three, who were once together in a group called “Dirty Dawg”, prepare to join.Any worldbuilding required to make this all happen is borderline nonsensical. The idea of an all-female government taking power, getting normal weapons totally banned (when most people IRL can easily slip illegal marijuana) and standing being asserted by rap dominance naturally only make since by Yu-Gi Oh/Jojo logic, but that just makes things more exciting. The sheer absurdity of these facts plastered onto what’s otherwise a fairly normal setting leads to some hilariously goofy moments.HypMic’s first eight episodes are essentially prep to get viewers to know each of the four teams, titled Buster Bros, Mad Trigger Crew, Fling Posse and Materno. Aside from Buster Bros they aren’t even in careers associated with rap, some being doctors, salarymen or military men. To get the audience to pick favorites among these Sonic Heroes, the show runners decided “let’s throw these pastel colored fujioshi avatars into deafeningly serious plots that’ll have nothing to do with anything else!” The plots tend to have a lot of threats thrown each team’s way, with the power of corny camaraderie to save the day. If nothing else, these episodes do a passable job showing why each team cares about their respective members.But remember, weapons are banned in the world of HypMic, so how are all these conflicts solved! RAP BATTLES! Scenarios where guns and grenades would exist are replaced by microphones because that’s just how the world works and everyone completely accepts it. The sheer power of rap allows teleportation, and it’s a sight to behold.Bank hostage situation? Rap Battle.Yakuza caper? Rap Battle.Mortgage scheme? Rap Battle.Illegal drug deals? Rap BattleMurder framing? Rap Battle.Terrorist bombing specifically to prevent one team from participating in a rap battle? Rap Battle.Only getting a B on my college final?! Rap Battle.These rap battles are the only times the show gets to add flair where there generally IS none. Most scenes have no flair; the animation is choppy, the lighting poorly implemented and garishly bright enough to make you think all the available colors got used on the character designs alone. With realistic backgrounds featuring absurdly costumed characters, you get the type of wacky dissonance that can elicit a chuckle all on its own. That said, the scenes before one of these conflicts get going with flat exposition are some of the only times the show is actively boring, little but basic partnerships to pass the time. Once the conflicts get into full force and get solved with a rap at the end, then it’s a blast.So how about the raps themselves, likely the main reason you’ve checked out this anime?I’m happy to report that they’re absolutely wild. If you’ve watched Epic Rap Battles of History before, they provide a good sense of what to expect; killer beats with over-the-top visual effects in conjunction with mad disses. Given the language barrier, I can’t tell if the animators took influence from them, but it catches a similar vibe. At some points it’s more effects than animation, with different filters thrown about, kanji and battle effects splattering the screen during the rap. 2D characters swap into CGI and back and forth, but the timing of the rap music videos is on POINT. It’s clear this is where the most effort went, for good reason, but it contrasts greatly to everything else in the anime. Props to the translators for creating subtitles that seem to fit into rhyme scheme. It’s hard to tell how well the seiyuu ACTUALLY sing the lyrics as someone who doesn’t understand Japanese, but if I could judge, the Buster Bros have the most amount of oomph and flow to their lyrics while Materno seems like they struggle with nailing lyric flow the most. The raps slap, and when they don’t, they’re so silly it’s hard not to laugh at them.Of course, the galaxy brained writing doesn’t stop once the division rap battles in title begin. If anything, the presentation gets even more bizarre.There’s attempts to add some angsty spice by implying that one character was involved in what happened to another character’s sister. Of course, this drama lacks the punch it needs without proper context. Because there was no time to build that up in the 8 episodic segments before that.Shonen battle mechanics get introduced! Now every character has specialized “traits” that only appear as they rap! Once again it’s spontaneous, poorly built up, and means nothing outside of specific scenes, but it adds to the general madcap nonsense that is this show’s existence.At around the same time, one character rather inexplicably appears to be a twist villain, with a more sinister grin and complicit goals. Yet, before the episode is even over, they’re instantly talked out of it. It’s almost incredible how the show decides to hold off on its conflict. This is then doubled down further by having two morality turns in incredibly quick succession for events the audience never got to see, only to have neither of them mean anything soon after. You can’t make this up.Despite all of these issues, the big conspiracy plot keeps rolling, with a repetitive background score of funky fresh beats even in the serious scenes. It’s fitting at times when things are more lowkey but only makes sillier any attempt outside of that. Like trying to understand its attempts to tell a story and remembering; we’re watching working professionals stuck in the rap circuit.Hypnosis Mic is a respectable anomaly of confused existence and cloudy vision. In this bizarre place where it’s narratively, tonally and structurally nonsense, but it somehow works to be entertaining. What makes the show so bad it’s good for me is that I just can’t tell what they were really going for with this story, beyond an attempt to show off seiyuu vocal range to mixed effect. The characters have light chemistry with their team members, but any attempts to develop anything fall hilariously flat. Its plot goes through every spectrum of tense you can think of under a weak production that gives it no gravitas. It’s a 3/10 for serious merit, but a 7/10 for enjoyment, so 5/10 is a fair way to place it.  You might not find it hilarious, or just be interested to see all of the raps out of context, yet for me it hits the perfect spectrum of unintentionally intentional comedy to make it worth something.

I won\'t talk about the story because there is none. Everything it\'s just an excuse to show men who fall into fujoshi fetishes ""battle rap"".This is probably the worst shit I\'ve ever seen.I can\'t even find words to express how high this pile of trash is, it\'s probably worst then Pastel Memories.It seems they wasted all their money in voice actors and then asked to the cleaning guy to write an script that were appealing to the Fujoshi community.I don\'t even know how an already existent midia about music portraits itself with some of the worst lyrics I\'ve ever seen.Please, if you want to...feel sick there are better ways, don\'t waste your finite time with this, go watch Boku no Pico 10x in arrow.Stay safe feel sick there are better ways, don\'t waste your finite time with this, go watch Boku no Pico 10x in arrow.Stay safe', ""Hypnosis Mic is a prime example of a premise that should not work, but is executed wonderfully. I'm incredibly surprised that this ended up being one of the shows that just blew me away this season, but there are a lot of really great components to it.First thing's first, Hypnosis Mic has what is probably the best usage of CG that I've seen in a 2D anime. The transitions to CG animation feel like you're jumping from the show to a music video, which is a perfect mood for these sequences that keeps the switch from feeling jarring. On top of that a lot of...the music just slaps, not just the rap itself but even the background music goes in hard sometimes.What really makes this a fantastic anime though is just that it's really fun. I'm personally not a fan of yaoi-centric shows like Free or Yuri on Ice, and I see a lot of the criticism against Hypnosis Mic talking about how it appeals to fujoshi similar to those series... and I just don't get that critique at all. This isn't about male-oriented fanservice, this is a show about guys bein' dudes and spittin' some hot fire. For better or for worse, I think HypMic is something truly special. the music just slaps, not just the rap itself but even the background music goes in hard sometimes.What really makes this a fantastic anime though is just that it's really fun.

They ban lethal weapons and force citizens to defend themselves via Hypnosis Microphones by rapping.Our story centers around the 4 teams representing 4 districts of Japan, Ikebukuro, Yokohama, Shinjuku, and Shibuya, as they prepare and compete in a division rap battle. As someone who watched idol anime growing up, I was intrigued by this concept, so I followed this anime during winter 2020.The art style is very bright and colorful, and it brings life to the mildly chaotic world of hypnosis mic. One thing that...I found amusing was how you can tell most characters apart based on hair color. The animation is also pretty solid. This anime used a combination of CGI and 2d animation. The CGI looked great, especially during stages, and the 2d is solid too.The music in this anime also exceeded my expectations. The only ""real songs"" you get are the op and ed tracks, besides that the music is more like verses from the respective rappers. I never really found a song to be bad, I just personally liked some ""songs"" more than others. One cool thing they did was that they gave each team their own version of the ed track, which was fun to see.Now, onto the characters and actual story... It isn\'t that great. The first few episodes were fun, I enjoyed seeing the teams and their day-to-day lives, but as the series progressed and got closer to the final division battle, you notice that a lot was left out.Without spoiling anything - certain characters have past conflict with each other, and besides the occasional insult and flashback, we don\'t get that much information on their past. So, when it comes to the final rap battles, there isn\'t as much tension between the teams as needed for it to be a high-stakes battle.The characters themselves are very distinct, and can be identified by their occupations and hair color. You get to see the contrasting dynamics between teams which also helps for characterization. There isn\'t that much development between the cast, and when it does happen its short and sweet.I started off anime only, and went on to read the manga, and I was shocked by how much was left out from the anime. But, there\'s only so much you can do in 13 episodes.With all this being said, I still really liked this anime. In my opinion, if you watch  hypnosis mic with a critical lens, then you\'re watching it wrong. Not all anime has to have a complex and detailed plot to be worth your time.Overall, Hypnosis mic is a fun, and colorful anime with a diverse set of characters. It\'s a weird concept, and the plot could be better, but these shouldn\'t put you off from watching the show. If you like music in anime, want to watch something fun, or are a simp, I totally recommend. If you want something plot heavy, or are more critical of your media, I say to give this one a skip, or read the manga.This is my first review, Thanks for your time :) I found amusing was how you can tell most characters apart based on hair color.

Spearheaded by the Party of Words, a coup d\'etat has radically transformed the way of living for the Japanese populace, springing up a matriarchal society where women alone are in positions of power and men are segregated to regions called ""divisions"" where they have to settle disputes by lyrical battles through the use of state-issued augmented microphones and with it either gain or lose territory; naturally, any other form...of violence is strictly prohibited, including non-state issues mics. Through this mechanism, women have taken the lead where men has failed since time immemorial, to construct a society wherein peace and order are upheld in the truest sense, curbing of freedoms but a small price to pay for that worthy endeavor, surely. And thus would be the premise to our title. All of this may have sounded very enticing, and Hypnosis Mic too, is quite enticing in some respects. But you might puzzled as to why I\'m phrasing it like my description and the show are two separate entities. And that\'s because, well, they are. The show could not possibly be more dissimilar than its premise would have you believe. I\'m sure you the reader can attest to this, while reading the start of this paragraph, have you honestly thought, even for a second, that I was talking about a different show? Because see, HypMic ARB is hopelessly ordinary, and don\'t get me wrong, some of my favorite shows deal with the mundanities of life, but in a world that is supposed to feel extraordinary, it sticks like a sore thumb. I want the characters to feel the weight of the system under which they live, to have the fangs of tyranny seeping into their corner of the world, and seeing their opposition forming the baseline of their character. Unfortunately, vast majority of the show goes on like nothing abnormal is happening at all, and the last 2 episodes a last ditch effort to get things back on track to what the pilot episode promised, but too little too late...The characters are your usual diverse ensemble cast who share roughly equal screen-time as is the case for idol or idol-like shows. Normally this will result in the cast ending up being tropey and weak, and while I can\'t entirely deny this in the case of HypMic, I argue that it does more than most of its kin. There is some genuine attempt to individualize each character beyond just superficial elements like verbal tics and hair colors, during its runtime all 4 of our division will be facing certain turbulences—some serious and some more light-hearted—that communicate parts of their identity to the viewer in a surprisingly apt manner. Jakurai-sensei\'s comatose patient for whom he blames himself and suspects foul play, the brief moments where Samatoki seems to have concern for his teammates like not wanting to involve them to his familial issues, Rio\'s loyalty to his former Navy general, and yet him opposing his fellow comrades in their Machiavellianistic ways... these sadly do not tie up to some grand narrative, likely due to time limitations, but it shows that it\'s not just about pretty boys dissing each other. A good litmus test for well-put-together characters is, in my view, to read a random part of the script and attempt to identify the speaker, and I believe HypMic fulfills that criterion relatively well.Art and animation are largely inoffensive, but staticity of frames is noticeable in certain parts. The CGI for rap portions are not jarring in the slightest, impressive even, when it\'s at its peak. The tracks are obviously not on par with the franchise\'s discography, but nothing to scoff at all the same. The character design has been a strong point of the franchise since it\'s very inception, and this adaptation is no different.

As a fan of the original multimedia project, the anime pales in comparison and was just not a good show on its own either.What is Hypnosis Mic? It\'s a multimedia project created by King Records with character designs from Otomate (Idea Factory). The premise of HypMic revolves around a fictional Japan run by women where weapons are illegal and men fight for territory using the power of rap. The story follows the relationship between ex-The Dirty Dawg members...Yamada Ichiro, Aohitsugi Samatoki, Amemura Ramuda and Jinguji Jakurai and why they are are all at odds with each other. HypMic has been around since 2017 and has spawned multiple CDs, drama tracks and 5 manga series, each detailing the storylines of the main protagonists and what happened when they were still part of The Dirty Dawg. The so-called rap battles done in the project are an opportunity for fans to interact with the project and directly affect the outcome of the battles. Fans can buy CDs of the respective rap battle and inside each CD is a code that they can use to vote for the winner of the battles. This also affects the story of the universe, as each character faces consequences for winning/losing the rap battles.The anime was hyped up to basically be another adaptation of the first division rap battle arc. Fans from the music and manga were aware of the results of the division rap battle being depicted, but were excited to finally see the rap battles be depicted visually with animation, rather than with static manga panels or audio. The animation itself was pretty standard. The usage of CGI wasn\'t too intrusive/distracting. The character designs are classic fujo bait material, which is the reason why I got into the series in the first place.The raps were very creative and felt true to the original music style. Though they had to compose new raps for the actual rap battle part of the animation, the new songs echoed similar sentiments to the original music. I found myself enjoying a lot of the songs and still listen to them regularly on Spotify.The story is by far the most disappointing part. Though the rap battle tournament was still the same in terms of the results, everything else about the story was a mess. The anime spent way too much time setting up character introductions and very little time on the relationships between the characters outside of their respective divisions. You don\'t really learn why Ichiro and Samatoki hate each other nor why Ramuda and Jakurai are at odds with each other. You don\'t learn about The Dirty Dawg rap group until the very end of the anime, even though the reason for the entire story stems from that rap group and is the central event stressed in the other media. These relationships are explained in the manga and drama tracks but failed to be captured in the anime. The anime introduced new original characters that were never seen in the previous media and they served little to no purpose until the last 2 episodes. The story diverted significantly from the canon that has already been established, which is a major disappointment for those who have been following the HypMic story for so long. Even as a standalone anime, the story makes no sense and suffers from ""13 episode syndrome"". There was just way too much source material for the animation team to condense into a 1 season anime and make it coherent and they did not manage to do that.The HypMic anime is nothing more than a series to get your toes wet and a way for King Records to sell more HypMic merch. If you found yourself intrigued by the premise of the anime, then you will want to go out and seek/buy the music and the manga for more information. If you didn\'t like the anime, you may still find some value in looking up the source material, since the pacing in the manga and drama tracks are much better for telling the story. Overall, this show is just disappointing in terms of being an extension of the HypMic multimedia project and as a standalone show. It\'s just fujo bait without a coherent story and decent J-Rap music. I wouldn\'t waste my time watching this show if you\'re intrigued by the premise; just go read the manga or listen to the drama tracks on Spotify instead.

It's their own style, their own way of expressing their characters' characteristics. Ramuda is so colorful XDI can never say no to the music. I love every part of it.

I'm personally not really a fan of anything 3D related in anime, but HypMic manages to hide it...very well since their models are very on par with their 2D art style.Again, I would recommend this anime for anyone who likes a good laugh and has major brainrot like me.Listen to more of their music and vibe with me~~Amazing/10, very excited for S2 very well since their models are very on par with their 2D art style.Again, I would recommend this anime for anyone who likes a good laugh and has major brainrot like me.Listen to more of their music and vibe with me~~Amazing/10, very excited for S2"", ""So as far as I can tell, this is one of those animes that people either love or hate, and I suspect that the latter is because the story (what there is of it anyway) isn't exactly cohesive.To get into the bare bones of the premise without regurgitating the actual summary: Imagine if a bunch of DnD bards got turned into a pretty anime boys but the only spell they can cast is Vicious Mockery, and that's pretty much Hypnosis Mic in a nutshell.So, why watch it?

If it werent for the characters, animation, and music I would have probably dropped the show.I was very disappointed with the storyline, I honestly got bored in the last few episodes.

I was eager when Hypmic has an anime adaptation, but when anime already airing I was like.. oh well.StoryFirst episode started with all divisions introduced and rapping to random opponents. When they gonna rapping, they have magical girl transformation vibe (I\'m saying this uinronically).Their rapping has special effects (thus called Hypnosis Mic). It\'s usually goes \'boom\' after the divisions defeated the random opponents. Admit it, that moments make you go ""what?""Then from episode 2 to 8, mostly are one division focused (there\'s...also 2 divisions combined in 1 episode). The episode order are Buster Bros, Matenrou, MTC, and Fling Posse.They doing random things which followed with an occurrence and the divisions defeats the opponents who did the occurrence with their rapping.Up to episode 9, plot somewhat gets interesting. The divisions are defeating each other in one place. If you read the manga, it\'s predictable who\'s gonna be win the competition and vice versa.There\'s also 3 anime-only characters, at first they seems like random background characters and interacting some of the division members. Who knows they gonna be impacted to the plot. The plot really confusing to me and the anime ends with cliffhanger ending.ArtThe character designs are pretty similar to Kazui\'s character design. I\'m not getting biased but personally the character designs are memorable. The animation and effects is pretty good.SoundMost of the episodes has brand new songs, the anime didn\'t reused the older songs. Obviously all of the songs are in rap genre. Even the ending song has different divisions who sang it per 3 episodes. The songs is good and it makes me goosebumps when the divisions defeats each other. The voice acting is fine.CharacterIf I remember correctly, there\'s some characters who has a slight flashbacks about what they\'re do in the past and usually the division leaders. Some of the characters seems having a questionable background and probably because limited episodes it\'s couldn\'t be described what they are (more likely Fling Posse members). Buster Bros members are clearly brothers who lives their own. The 3 anime-only trios are foreigners who gonna be defeating the main divisions for Ichijiku\'s intention.There\'s so many HifuDo moments and Rei appeared as a cameo in last episode. More importantly, there\'s no the rest of Dotsutaire Honpo and BAT appearance cameos. Just Rei.OverallIs this anime enjoyable? Ugh.. kind of. I was curious what plot they\'re gonna bring in the anime. I\'m a fan of Hypmic project so I decided to watch the anime until ends.I get it why this anime having a low score, well this anime isn\'t for everyone actually. Even the premise sorta weird, but yeah that\'s Hypmic is.If you liked a music (especially Japanese rap) anime with weird elements in it, maybe you can try watching this. If not, stay away.If you curious about Hypmic project, try their manga, drama tracks, and songs.

Even the ending song has different divisions who sang it per 3 episodes. The songs is good and it makes me goosebumps when the divisions defeats each other. The voice acting is fine.CharacterIf I remember correctly, there\'s some characters who has a slight flashbacks about what they\'re do in the past and usually the division leaders. Some of the characters seems having a questionable background and probably because limited episodes it\'s couldn\'t be described what they are (more likely Fling Posse members). Buster Bros members are clearly brothers who lives their own. The 3 anime-only trios are foreigners who gonna be defeating the main divisions for Ichijiku\'s intention.There\'s so many HifuDo moments and Rei appeared as a cameo in last episode. More importantly, there\'s no the rest of Dotsutaire Honpo and BAT appearance cameos. Just Rei.OverallIs this anime enjoyable? Ugh.. kind of. I was curious what plot they\'re gonna bring in the anime. I\'m a fan of Hypmic project so I decided to watch the anime until ends.I get it why this anime having a low score, well this anime isn\'t for everyone actually. Even the premise sorta weird, but yeah that\'s Hypmic is.If you liked a music (especially Japanese rap) anime with weird elements in it, maybe you can try watching this. If not, stay away.If you curious about Hypmic project, try their manga, drama tracks, and songs. The anime may confusing for newcomers and assume the anime is the alternative story of Hypmic.', '""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""When the rap is happening the show is really entertaining and unique. The raps are quite fun and I like how each character has their own niche and plays off each other. There are some pretty great disses and songs in here which made the episodes entertaining even if the show is a very surface level advertisement with an extremely poor foundation. I am not the target audience for this show and I still had a good experience.The anime’s biggest issues are its writing and the low quality episodic episodes especially in the middle. Most of the episodes are trying to introduce...all of the different rappers however you don’t learn anything really interesting about them. It\'s really superficial elements of the characters that you would have already learned in episode one. What really hurts the show however is that these episodes are extremely boring because they have weak episodic plots that don’t do enough. They don\'t connect to the bigger interesting ideas about the society or even the deeper more engaging plot that happens during the tournament. The first episode of the tournament arc is a huge exposition dump about everyone’s problems with each other, which could easily been covered in more interesting ways during the episodes before it. Hell the Secret Aliens could have been in these episodes as support rappers with a small cameo showing off their style of rapping. It then would make their betrayal and rap group a more interesting twist.The only standalone episode I really liked was the halloween episode with Ramuda because seeing halloween represented and Ramuda getting scared of ghosts was entertaining. I personally liked Ramuda the most since he had the most going for him story wise and made situations interestingThe production qualities of this show while not overly impressive are interesting to look at. The CGI during the rap segments actually worked quite well and is the first thing alongside the raps that made me interested in watching more. It\'s not perfect and the art/animation outside the raps is very boring and cheap. There are a couple instances of okay character animation (outside of the raps) usually involving Ramuda. The music is very good and I like most of it except for the first Secret Aliens song which I felt was too different and not all that great. I am not an expert in rap or fluently japanese however so I can’t totally comment on if it’s “technically good” but I found it enjoyable. The big issues with the show don’t stem from the audio or visuals but from the writing mainly.Once the show gets into its tournament arc the show gets much more interesting. There is more rap per episode and characters start interacting with each other in more fun and interesting ways. The character drama while really rushed was usually adequate to make the rap battles interesting and personal. I really wish the beef between each of the leaders was more fleshed out in earlier episodes. The overall plot is pretty inconsequential and the last episode especially had some annoying messages in it that the show kinda just threw in there. It didn’t build them up thematically and the beef between characters doesn’t have much of a conclusion. It got sidelined pretty hard. I would be interested in watching a sequel to this show but I would be surprised if it got one.I personally was not a big fan of the character designs for this show. Most of them are pretty basic hot guys that you typically see in these types of shows. I think Buster Bros heterochromia makes them looks ridiculous and stupid, and is the only main group I actually dislike. I am not a fan of their brother shtick which is played into the ground. Saburou and Jirou are extremely boring and their interactions with each other and their brother get old fast. The rest of the characters\' designs are okay and your mileage can vary but I personally was never impressed.While this show has plenty of issues I still would recommend at least the first episode. It’s a really unique experience and the first episode really gives you a taste of what the show is about. I really appreciate shows like this that make me feel like I\'m experiencing something new and unique. There\'s nothing truly just like this show that comes to my mind and that\'s something valuable. I would rate it around a mid four. It\'s a flawed show but it\'s still enjoyable especially when there are multiple raps in a single episode. I would recommend it only if the person really likes rap, idol boys, or wants a totally new experience from anime. all of the different rappers however you don’t learn anything really interesting about them.

Finding out the news of Hypnosis Mic being adapted into an anime made me extremely happy that i\'ve never been on my happy switch for so long. BUT now that i\'ve watched every episode of this adaptation, you cannot...even fathom the disappointment i felt after all those 13 episodes. Hypnosis Mic Anime is a Mess. I wish it could\'ve just followed the Manga, or Drama track.  At first, i was extremely enthusiastic with my beloved characters having quality animation, and are finally moving around and talking. Fling Posse is my absolute Favourite group and i was happy i got to see \'em moving. But disappointment came around episode 5. (but to be honest i was already confused and down at episode 2 but i endured all that before actually facepalming.) I mean, we got to see every group that needs attention in the first episode right? so whats the use for 4 episodes focusing on each 4 groups? To make the viewer understand and know them? fine. BUT HYPMIC ANIME DIDNT DO THAT. It just straight up made us watch our boys just rapping on random situations given unto them and revealing vague information about them and their past when they could\'ve just followed the manga or drama track itself to make everything LESS CONFUSING. Even as a broke fangirl like me who loves this franchise, i can still cringe with the fact they fight with mics lmao but i should say that a world ruled by women and no weapons is indeed interesting.(if done wisely and better that is.) Another one of my problems was that the anime adaptation of Hypmic had moments that had this one character act differently from his personality/character. For example, Samatoki who tried to punch Ichijikuand hurt other women offiials which was absolutely out of his  character even if he was angry and pissed at that time.Now, finally i came to the point of forgetting everything disappointing that occurred in this anime just to let myself try to enjoy the battle episodes. Yes, i actually did enjoy them but the problems were of that a lot of characters were out of character in the battles which made them look weak than they originally are. Now, i really want to stop comparing this to the manga as it seems to be of original work, but the source says ""other."" The music used in this was something which i had high expectations from as Hypmic franchise is about all those catchy and sweet music. I could say i enjoyed a lot of the new songs and i am still waiting for the release of all the full version ones. Tho i wished the lyrics stuck to the character more in depth and not just adding lyrics of the character\'s personality that only touched a few certain levels and then added supposedly rhyming words. The 4 groups and that whatever sEcrEt AlieNs(which i surprisingly liked) VS Chuohku episode was definitely the most facepalming and 2nd hand embarrassment episode i\'ve ever seen. Chuohku is a powerful women ruling government system that defeated the previous government with its you know what or not methods, but now it\'s troops or whatever is being busted thru by 4 groups with leaders being from the legendary ""almost started a coup d\'etat"" disbanded group? I expected more of Chuohku man. Chuohku has done more better ways than the ones that they did in the anime. I\'d say Chuohku could\'ve easily handled all those mundane situations with a better solution.I really have not much to say about this anime i guess. My feelings of the ""tried but kind of failed"" adaptation of Hypmic is a mix of Gratefulness, Excitement, or ,Disappointment and Cringe.  Tho im still forever grateful seeing my bois animated and talking once again and Hypmic being a Guilty Pleasure for me, despite its cringey executions and all its flaws, i hope for a second season that will be less confusing and something that will actually be better.Just read the manga or listen to the drama tracks please, its actually more interesting and less cringey.Seriously the Drama tracks/manga, Game, and Anime have different fucking universes and stories.:)) even fathom the disappointment i felt after all those 13 episodes.

I was looking for hardcore rap battles but they wasn\'t that strong or impactful. It was more easy going. It gives the feeling of ""lets go have some fun, while rapping"". Also the battles aren\'t battles that go back and forth. There are one-sided, meaning only side raps. Something else that I didn\'t like about it was that 3 people would rap together, at one side, so it came off like a boy band.About the story, so far none....If it had a good story it could hold the whole thing together and make me ignore the flaws that it had in the rapping scene.The characters aren\'t that interesting and I don\'t really care about them. Probably because of the story. I saw a review saying that the story was going to come, but I have already lost interest before it started and I wont put myself through the ""struggle"" of watching until then.Overall I didn\'t hate it but it wasn\'t good.

There are rap groups and each of them has an unique style, so everybody should find something they may like. Fans can buy CDs and vote for their favourite, while the writers try to write somethingSounds harsh?To be honest, the whole concept of hypmic is a creative mess. There are some enjoyable bits, but overall the plot stand on a weird fundation that creates multiple questions. For example, how people get hypmic? What happened to sellers of illegal weapons? What exactly happened when the Party of Words took control over...Japan? How badly lives of people changed? Why people fight for the territory?Unfortunately, I am only talking about the current plot established by track dramas and anime doesn\'t do anything good to make the wacky plot work. There are many animes with more weird concepts that were well-developed and became logical. Instead we got too many slice of life episodes that only show interactions between members of the same group and hardly contribute to the plot. Only last episodes focused on something else and we get 1000 new facts. Last episodes are nothing like the first half of the show and it\'s hard to lose an impression that the studio doesn\'t know what is time management. In addition to an awful pacing, we get couple cliches and a new group with one of the least creative backstories. The new group only makes the plot messier and doesn\'t do anything special.Now that I mentioned a new group, let\'s talk about characters. There are many interesting characters and it seems there are couple conflicts between different rap groups. However, the anime hardly shows characters as anything deeper than a puddle. Most of the time, their traits are used for comedy and anything related to their backstory is either left unexplained or rushed. Almost no conflict has been solved. By the way, it\'s worth to mention that new anime charactes are embodient of a bad writing. For example, T.Rex is a rapper and he raps about... dinosaurs. His whole personality is based on this fact and it\'s simple as thatThen there is an average animation. There are couple scenes rendered in 3D and they\'re fairly awkward.Finally, the biggest crime of hypmic anime is music. Hypmic has many briliant songs and while watching the anime, I hoped to find couple musical diamonds. Unfortunately, anything outside episode 1 sound good. Most rap battles are as smooth as sandpaper. There are too many weird breaks, screams and talking-no-jutsu.Overall, the whole anime is an ad for CDs with couple relaxing slice of life episodes, which became my guilty pleasure. If you are a fan of the franchise and you want couple slice of life adventures, then go ahead and watch first half of the anime. If you expect a solid plot or high-quality songs, then skip it Japan?

It was a bit disappointing that they did not follow the main plot of the Hypnosis Mic manga, but it was a fun watch once you disregard the sometimes lackluster animation.As someone who is familiar with the Hypnosis Mic project, it was decent and...definitely could've been done better.

What a roller coaster. Hypnosis Mic definitely sits in that ""so bad it\'s good"" category. I ONLY watched it just to laugh at how bad it was, I swear.Okay so an anime about rapping. That\'s already pretty out there. Now what if I told you they used rap battles as a form of combat. And the rap battles are done in CGI. Yep.The characters all look straight out of a yaoi anime, no joke. ALL OF THEM. I\'m still not 100% sure that it\'s not yaoi. On top of that, they\'re all pretty dang forgettable. I can\'t even tell you...a single name of a character, they\'re all kinda the same. Edgy guys who rap each other. Each group has like a serious guy, a tough guy, and a more feminine/wimpy guy (or at least that\'s what it feels like)The actual rapping is so... jarring? It\'s very very strange. Only maybe 2 or 3 of them can actually kinda rap, the rest just sound so awkward.If you want something to laugh at, check it out, otherwise please spare yourself.

It separates itself from it's contemporaries with absurd storylines, memorable art direction, and most importantly, hilarious writing. Almost every character stands on their own within the show's narrative. The interpersonal relationships and history between the divisions leaves me eager to learn more. The music is some of the best in the genre, with solid raps and instrumentals that bring me back to listen over and over again. For fans of idol content, this is a welcome departure from the norm with familiar staples. For those new to musical anime, I find this...to be a great starting point, especially for comedy fans. to be a great starting point, especially for comedy fans."", 'I am someone who knew almost nothing about Hypnosis Microphone (HypMic) before watching this anime series. I had some friends that liked it, but getting into it seems somewhat difficult/tedious to do given the wide range of ways that HypMic tells its story. As someone that\'s basically an anime-only viewer, I think that several people are criticizing this show way too hard for what it is. For me, this is definitely a guilty pleasure kind of show.Story: 3The story is of course, absolutely absurd. From what I can tell, the premise is ""we want groups of guys to have cool rap battles with each other.""...So, they created a plotline that would allow for such a silly concept while still being ""high-stakes."" The result is that women have taken over Japan and eliminated all sources of weapons and violence (including hand-to-hand combat somehow, of course) and replaced those weapons with Hypnosis Microphones, which have the ability to amplify your songs (or raps) into something that can attack your opponents\' psyche. They must have believed that men don\'t sing, so women now control the world! Except that some people figured out you can rap instead, and I\'d argue rapping gets out a lot more lyrics a lot more quickly, so nice try, ladies.So of course the story isn\'t what drives this show. With such a ridiculous plot line, anyone here for a serious show would drop it at episode 1. And that\'s okay, it\'s not for everyone. But, if you want to see some cool guys of different character types duke it out in some rap battles, you\'ve come to the right place.Lastly, the leader of each of the 4 divisions used to be in a group together. Fairly typical ""all-star team has a falling-out and now each of those stars has their own crew"" setup. Reminds me of Kuroko no Basuke. This is fine, as it creates a balance of power in the story.Art: 9Honestly for A-1 pictures, I was very surprised and impressed by the animation quality. I didn\'t notice any wonky key frames, the lines are consistent, colors are nice and vivid, and the use of 3D CGI was used infrequently enough to not really be a problem. Of course it was noticeable, but it was usually brief with minimal camera movement and lots of special effects around it, so it\'s not jarring. The addition of the lyrics being animated onto the screen was a really nice touch, and probably very beneficial to those that understand Japanese watching it raw. I feel like A-1 pictures really stepped up with this one, it was nice to look at.Sound: 8Since most of us are here for the rap battles, the sound is definitely important. I\'m giving it 8 out of 10, 8 points scored by the impressive rap sequences and voice acting, 2 points missed from the non-existent BGM. I couldn\'t even tell you if music was ever playing during the non-rap-battle scenes, it was that underwhelming. But it also wasn\'t distracting from the dialogue, so there\'s that. The opening and ending songs were pretty nice as well, and I think did a fine job conveying the tone of each division and the show overall.Character: 6It\'s not like I\'m expecting a ton from character in a setting like this. This is your classic ""who\'s best boy?"" scenario, so each character is almost stereotypical in their attributes. But, with how many characters there are (12 main characters and some interesting side characters), they did a decent job of putting some diversity in, at least, and it\'s not as if character development was non-existent. You\'ll most likely pick out favorites based on character design, and then maybe some from their personality and some from their voice/rapping style.Though it\'s not the fault of the anime adaptation, I must comment on how... creative the character designs for Buster Bros!!! is. Let\'s name the brothers with 1, 2, and 3 in their names, give them an increasing number of moles, and ALL of them have heterochromia. Yeah, sure. I feel bad that Jiro\'s personality was almost completely distilled to ""I like my older brother more than you,"" while Saburo was given the tech wiz attribute (in addition to ""no I like my older brother more""). Hopefully Jiro has more going for him in the drama CDs/manga/games/etc.The other three groups are diverse enough in characters, and I feel that the show has enough archetypes to appeal to most audiences. While not my favorite, I think that Matenro\'s Doppo is one of the most unique and amusing characters.Enjoyment: 9Despite the ridiculous plotline and somewhat generic characters, the animation and rap sequence quality gave me something to look forward to watching every week or two as this anime was being released. While I can\'t give it higher overall score due to it\'s obvious shortcomings, the enjoyment is a large reason for my overall score choice. This show is definitely a guilty pleasure and I thoroughly enjoyed watching every episode of it. Sometimes it\'s nice to turn on something not plot-heavy and just watch some pretty boys rap.Overall: 7I can\'t give this higher than a 7 because of the obvious story flaws and somewhat bland characters, but I would certainly recommend this show to anyone that wants to see what Japanese rap/hip-hop is like, or devote their life to a new husbando and proceed to spend their entire life savings on merchandise of said boy. As someone that didn\'t indulge in HypMic\'s other lore sources previously, I do believe this anime is a good entryway into the franchise to pique your interest. Maybe now I\'ll go download the phone game and pray to the gatcha gods that they\'ll give me Jakurai cards.

I feel like A-1 pictures really stepped up with this one, it was nice to look at.Sound: 8Since most of us are here for the rap battles, the sound is definitely important. I\'m giving it 8 out of 10, 8 points scored by the impressive rap sequences and voice acting, 2 points missed from the non-existent BGM. I couldn\'t even tell you if music was ever playing during the non-rap-battle scenes, it was that underwhelming. But it also wasn\'t distracting from the dialogue, so there\'s that. The opening and ending songs were pretty nice as well, and I think did a fine job conveying the tone of each division and the show overall.Character: 6It\'s not like I\'m expecting a ton from character in a setting like this. This is your classic ""who\'s best boy?"" scenario, so each character is almost stereotypical in their attributes. But, with how many characters there are (12 main characters and some interesting side characters), they did a decent job of putting some diversity in, at least, and it\'s not as if character development was non-existent. You\'ll most likely pick out favorites based on character design, and then maybe some from their personality and some from their voice/rapping style.Though it\'s not the fault of the anime adaptation, I must comment on how... creative the character designs for Buster Bros!!! is. Let\'s name the brothers with 1, 2, and 3 in their names, give them an increasing number of moles, and ALL of them have heterochromia. Yeah, sure. I feel bad that Jiro\'s personality was almost completely distilled to ""I like my older brother more than you,"" while Saburo was given the tech wiz attribute (in addition to ""no I like my older brother more""). Hopefully Jiro has more going for him in the drama CDs/manga/games/etc.The other three groups are diverse enough in characters, and I feel that the show has enough archetypes to appeal to most audiences. While not my favorite, I think that Matenro\'s Doppo is one of the most unique and amusing characters.Enjoyment: 9Despite the ridiculous plotline and somewhat generic characters, the animation and rap sequence quality gave me something to look forward to watching every week or two as this anime was being released. While I can\'t give it higher overall score due to it\'s obvious shortcomings, the enjoyment is a large reason for my overall score choice. This show is definitely a guilty pleasure and I thoroughly enjoyed watching every episode of it. Sometimes it\'s nice to turn on something not plot-heavy and just watch some pretty boys rap.Overall: 7I can\'t give this higher than a 7 because of the obvious story flaws and somewhat bland characters, but I would certainly recommend this show to anyone that wants to see what Japanese rap/hip-hop is like, or devote their life to a new husbando and proceed to spend their entire life savings on merchandise of said boy. As someone that didn\'t indulge in HypMic\'s other lore sources previously, I do believe this anime is a good entryway into the franchise to pique your interest. Maybe now I\'ll go download the phone game and pray to the gatcha gods that they\'ll give me Jakurai cards.', 'There was so much hope and hype for this anime, and yet it turned out to be mostly a disappointment. It was going great for the first few episodes. The slice of life type episodes were doing great so far until Buster Bros\' confusing, but enjoyable episode. It had the ""problem of the day"" storyline, but was a good way to introduce new people to Hypmic. It was also a good thing to showoff for the new fans. Music was decent, and the characters were fine. It would have been great if it weren\'t for Secret Aliens. They had no reason to be in this...anime. Yes, it would make it more interesting, but they felt SO forced into this. Like, when Tom asked so casually about Ichiro\'s past even though he JUST met him. Or the fact that Tom was like, ""Oh Jakurai, I exist, you just didn\'t see me because I was covered in bandages."" Irys, of course, is hacker friends with Saburo. As for Rex, he was just there to fill the third position. They really tried to make them more important than they actually were. All the problems in the episodes could have been easily solved by the main boys themselves without them. It really was just pointless to have them be seen as like an ally for the boys, but of course they were working with Chuohku. How unsurprising. The first division rap battle was fine to include. It was good for new and current fans to learn about. It should have just ended there with Matenro winning and nothing else, but since they needed more story for the remaining episodes. They gave Secret Aliens a conflict point for them, only for their reason to work with Chuohku and go against the boys, is that they were helping people in other countries and that the government was helping them and that the main boys are the bad ones. And yet, they thought having them involved with the boys in the first half of the anime as good guys was a good idea. Nope, just made current fans confused and making new fans think they are actual important characters when they are not. Secret Aliens are fine as themselves, but trying to make them seem important was not going anywhere. Yes, they are the conflict and including them the whole time would make sense, but there were better ways to do it than this. Either make them side characters or leave them out.

They sadly ruined most of the watching experience for me. I really was hoping the best as a long time hypmic fan.', ""So. I'm going to preface this by saying: I love Hypnosis Mic. I've been into this franchise since the very beginning in 2018 when all we had were jpeg images for official artwork and the only lore we had were the drama tracks. It's one of my favorite things in the whole world and has been for a couple of years now, so believe me when I say: It's so bad that it's good.The story? Horrendous. It's atrocious. The story is just women taking over the government and banning weapons except for government monitored rap battles. That's it.Here's the thing you need to understand about...Hypnosis Mic: The story is not (and never was) it's selling point. What makes it so appealing is the music and the characters. Every character has their own charm and every group has its own unique dynamic that makes you want to know more about their relationship and how they came together in the first place.If you're looking for a well-written story or anything thought-provoking about gender roles in society or anything deep and thoughtful, you're going to be sorely disappointed. You will be 100% valid if you decide to watch this because the characters are appealing, and honestly, that's the way you should approach this. The entire series is beyond absurd and stupid, but the characters have a specific charm to them that make it difficult to say it's terrible.The music ranges through a few different genres related to hip hop and rap and tends to blend the use of pop and rock into its songs. They have pretty high production value, too, and you can tell that the voice actors have a lot of fun with the material they're given and work together incredibly well. The visuals certainly compliment the songs and the rhymes, which is really what the whole selling point of the franchise is about. Despite them being in CG, the animations compliment the characters incredibly well and give them life.So, basically, my advise to you is: go into this with low expectations. If you're here for the story, I suggest you keep the bar in hell because you're not gonna get a good story. However, you might come out of this liking the characters and finding the visuals stunning. The whole point of this is to have fun, and I feel like the anime does a good job of doing just that-- being a fun experience that's amusing in how absurd it all it while also giving us a visually unique show.

Having this prior knowledge meant I personally had a lot of fun with the show, and I already had a favorite going in. If I didn\'t have that, I think I wouldn\'t like this show nearly...as much, which is why I ranked it 6/10 despite the average score of my stats being 7.8/10. Speaking of, let\'s go through the categories:Story: Let\'s be real, it\'s nothing impressive. The premise is really interesting, but you get about 6 episodes to introduce the characters for those who are new to the series and then you get the actual Division Rap Battle before we hit that finale (which was poorly executed, but that\'s for the spoilers section). Because of this format, the pacing is weird and the show winds up being really boring if you go by the 3 episodes rule. Again, having even a mild interest in the characters before going in makes it much more entertaining than it would be otherwise in that first half of the series. 5/10 Good premise, shit pacing, too little story.Art: The character designs for this show are simply amazing, and the visuals during the rap battles are fantastic for the most part. However, the rest of the animation is nothing amazing and isn\'t groundbreaking in any way. 8/10 Solid animation and great visuals but nothing beyond that.Music: This is an anime about rap battles, if the music was bad then this show would be very disappointing. Fortunately, the show delivers on that front, using some pre-existing tracks from the franchise but also including tracks made specifically for the show. However, I highly dislike the decision to write new rap sequences for the DRB instead of using the pre-existing ones, especially when tracks like Battle Battle Battle are considered some of the best in the franchise, so it\'s 9/10 for me.Character: Despite having 6 whole episodes of character introduction, and giving every group their own episode, you can\'t really learn much about the characters past their basic traits, because they\'re introduced via some kind of episodic story that needs to be resolved. Characters like Doppo, Jyuto and Rio got a somewhat proper treatment, but the Yamada trio felt especially underdeveloped to me, since their screen time was more about Jiro and Saburo wanting nii-chan\'s attention and Ichiro kicking ass than characterizing any of the siblings. However, I will give credit where credit is due, the writing on Ramuda and Jakurai was really well-done in the latter half of the series, and even without knowing the full details of what happened between them, you can feel the tension between them, and it makes the viewer curious about what caused their relationship to become so strained. Besides that, the characters are at least entertaining even if some of them are a little too shallow compared to the others. 7/10 Entertaining characters but some are poorly written.Enjoyment: I had fun, but again, that\'s because I already cared for the show. I\'m giving it a 10/10, as I laughed a lot in the early episodes and got attached to my favorites very easily, but like I said it\'s because I already know those characters and so I enjoy their banter more, so realistically the enjoyment level would probably be much lower for the average anime fan.This paragraph spoils the season finale! Skip to the next paragraph for final thoughts.Calling this season finale disappointing would be an understatement. The visuals were extremely boring compared to some of the thing we saw in the last few episodes, the dialogue felt extra corny at times, but by far the most disappointing aspect was the temporary reunion of The Dirty Dawg, if you can even call it that. This group has been hyped up throughout the series as this legendary group of 4 rappers that was so powerful it provided a threat to the government and caused them to have Ramuda force the group to disband. Even in the episode, Ramuda says something among the lines of ""You better watch and learn from the legends"" to Gentaro and Dice who were about to witness the fight between TDD and Secret Aliens. The rapping was underwhelming on most ends, and we didn\'t even get to see TDD rap TOGETHER. The only combo we saw was of Ichiro and Ramuda singing together and then they got knocked down. I feel like adding an additional turn where each team sang as a full group before TDD was down and needed everyone\'s help would make this battle so much cooler and more dramatic, and it pisses me off just how simple the solution here is.Final thoughts: As a Hypnosis Mic fan, this show provides on almost all fronts (besides some disappointing decisions), and I would easily give it an 8 out of 10. As a regular watcher though... It\'s nothing groundbreaking, the pacing is slow, a lot of the characters feel shallow and hard to get attached to, and while it does have a decent production value and is at least somewhat entertaining, the writing is very flawed. 6/10, it\'s a decent show but I wouldn\'t bother watching it unless you\'re into HypMic or plan to consume the franchise in other media. as much, which is why I ranked it 6/10 despite the average score of my stats being 7.8/10.

Usually, anime that gets adopted from gacha idol games ends up being mediocre at best and this was certainly one of those cases.Art and Animation:The moment that the A1 pictures logo popped up I knew exactly what to expect. When the characters are standing still and not moving, the art looks fine, but the moment something moves the quality drops significantly. The characters themselves are quite colourful and flashy, but even that isn´t enough to distract someone from the awful 3D animation that...is mixed in.

In my opinion, all characters have great VAs, the songs that were written for them in the anime just don´t do them any justice. There was maybe one song that stood out to me (Shibuya Ghost Night), and the others were pretty much forgettable and honestly not something I can see myself listening more to than once.

While it works in game form when you only have it written, it turns really weird when it´s accompanied by visuals. Fighting crime and pointing at knife-armed criminals with a microphone just does not look right. It makes the scenes where they talk about criminals and drug use all that more insignificant.

Nothing about the story was interesting; I know I'm not familiar with Japanese hip-hop culture, even though I do listen to a lot of rappers (artists & battle rappers) from that area.  Maybe that's why it didn't jive with me like it should have.The odd hip-hop segment will have 1 character with awesome rap flow but that's it.  The beats are terrible; well written on their own, just not good enough to freestyle or rap to.

There were a few scenes with them but they just weren\'t executed very well, with dialog being very stilted(besides their names being absolutely insane amalgamations of sentences). there clearly was potential but they weren\'t doing anything with it. aside from the stuff surrounding Secret Alien(though i\'ll go back to T.Rex for funsies), i didn\'t enjoy how the anime characterized Ramuda Amemura.. I\'ll need to go on a small tangent to briefly explain this, while it is true that Ramuda has genuine differences in mood and switching on a dime in some situations; its not in the way the anime depicts it(especially in the manga and audio dramas). i won\'t get into spoilers but a lot of how he acts is specific to people prying at his past or due to his other work(not his job designing clothing). Dice also has a similar change but i think it weirdly fits, he acts more bubbly and brotherly with the members of Fling Posse(especially with Ramuda); Gentaro is also more playful and direct; with a larger focus on quick qwipes directed at Dice(on small rare occasions, Ramuda as well). it\'s clear the writers had tons of fun with the dynamics regarding Fling Posse. The Halloween episode especially highlights this, moving onto the other divisions. MAD TRIGGER CREW isn\'t too different from the main timeline so i don\'t have a comment, Buster Bros can be said in the same regard though the exchanges between them and Secret Aliens is.... Something, but I will admit; their focused episodes were admittedly quite boring and not overly entertaining. found myself dying to just skip to the section of the episode focused on the other divisons. Materno is interesting, Dice and Hifumi are much more chaotic and i genuinely like it. Jakurai is also interesting in that we get to see him more at his job and more of how he acts while in public, still the same ol\'Jakurai but with more details and situations in depth. in regards to T. Rex it didn\'t help that many hypmic fans who either used to be or like Ensemble Stars joked about T.Rex being very similar in appearance to Adonis, which still give me a good chuckle. in the end, would i recommend this anime? well, if your a mega fan of hypmic? you might like this or eye roll, especially with how funimation handled Gentaro\'s subtitles(still see people complaining about it to this day). but for newbies to the franchise? eehhhh, maybe? i think it\'d be fun to watch with someone unfamiliar with the story, maybe with a swig of beer. their divison to be under developed and admittedly shoe-horned in.

And honestly, this is just Symphogear with guys. Hell the first episode even begins with a Kirika/Shirabe esque moment with the 2 Buster Bros ""sneaking"" around like idiots.The show is simply stylish. Similar to Ono Katsumi\'s work on Symphogear, the act of singing, or rapping in this case, is given such a bombastic and over-the-top flair that it becomes so engaging...you wouldn\'t want to take your eyes out of the action even for a second. While the action is generally intense, ironically the main draw of the series, the rap battles, which only happen at the end I might add, are the weakest point where each team just takes turns rapping in place without much of the creativity that can be seen in the earlier episodes.Quite possibly the most amazing thing about this show is how it manages to avoid cast bloat despite featuring 12 main characters. The same season this aired, I watched Assault Lily which only had 9 characters but I can only recall about 3 from it as I was watching. In Hypnosis Mic, despite its short run time, the show manages to make the most of it by giving each character a distinct personality that differentiates themselves even within the same group, making each character immensely likable is also no small feat.Unfortunately I wasn\'t too big on the actual music, apart from the OP, some songs by Buster Bros, and that one song by Secret Aliens. Kudos to the translators for making the english lyrics rhyme though.For me, the show has always shined brightest during the slice of life scenes that predate the actual rap battle near the end, and the moments where you follow each group in their daily lives is ultimately much more endearing and memorable than the mangled weird plot they have that doesn\'t even have the courtesy to have a proper conclusion at the very end.Ultimately, if you\'re after some dumb but fun action that\'s confident in its stupidity and embraces it with much passion, you can\'t go wrong with this show. It\'s a fun romp with a great cast, but don\'t expect much from its story.7/10 you wouldn\'t want to take your eyes out of the action even for a second.

The anime on the other hand was a disappointment.I had known Hypnosis Mic prior to the anime release so I know what's up. However, for the people who just saw this anime and franchise for the first time might probably had been turned off by this. There are some moments in the anime that just makes you question why they added that in.The characters are fine. The anime didn't fully show their personalities and interactions with each other. It was just bland. Some characters have...very specific traits that makes them lovable but it wasn't really shown in this adaptation.As a music anime, the opening and ending song are good. The OSTs are forgettable, with exceptions. Was expecting sick beats but, I guess it's alright.The battle scenes were utterly disappointing. In the drama track and manga, more characters used their special ability and went all out during the division battle. They also replaced some scenes that can get you on the edge of your seat with something bland and boring. *cough* Ramuda's final attack *cough* The characters have deepen their bonds with their teammates during the battle and it wasn't shown. In short words, the battle scenes aren't worth the hype.So in conclusion, if you have no clue what Hypnosis Microphone is beforehand, you'll be confused with what's happening. It's not a good introduction to the franchise and you'll probably get turned off by it. I recommend listening to their songs on Youtube or read the manga since it has more plot, and it gets into each character's lore more deeply. Example of this is Jiro being a dumbass, Gentaro's voice acting, Samatoki being a siscon, and Rio being a cinnamon roll. very specific traits that makes them lovable but it wasn't really shown in this adaptation.As a music anime, the opening and ending song are good.

There wasn’t enough information to pieces 2 & 2 together. Toward the end of the series it had a continuous storyline but in the beginning, the characters’ stories were told at different times but they were connected but sometimes I feel like some information is missing. The story was pretty complex but it's not too much for it to be confusing. It was fine.The story was pretty predictable. Every episode ended in the same way but it was pleasing to watch. There wasn’t any filler episode and the pacing was alright. There was some comedic stuff...here and there but it doesn’t give me the sci-fi vibes. The art is standard-fare is the art style that you usually see.The art style does fit well with the story. They both have that edgy vibes. They were some CGI but it wasn’t too bad. The CGI was there where it needed. Sometimes I didn’t notice there was some CGI in there so that tells me that it blended in well.The animation was nice and clean. Not sloppy. The background sometimes was distracting it was kind of hard to focus more on the characters. The character design does of course match well with their personality. The designs are very unique. You can tell who is who.The voice actors do match well, but when it comes to rapping I don’t think so. One voice actor did have to adapt their voice and it didn’t match well with that one character.All of the characters are well-rounded. They all have 1 major strength and some flaws. I did relate to one character since because i’m the oldest sibling and that character is the oldest sibling I can truly understand them. One character became stronger at the end and was able to defeat some people. The antagonist had some motivation but it wasn’t enough info to justify why it's kind of more like the antagonist was there just to be there.The supporting cast was flat not enough uniqueness. They barely did anything well except for one supporting character but that’s it. The characters are not memorable they’re very typical.I think you guys will like it. It’s a show where you don’t have to think a lot about just something you can enjoy. I do think other non-anime fans will like it because it deals with rap and rap is pretty popular in the music industry. I’ll probably not watch this again. It’s not worth rewatching.

(They don't explain the whole story, just some flashbacks of some people, but can't tell what really happened) Then there's the voice acting, I personally didn't like it, It didn't really match the characters, but the music is fine.

This is because there's almost no angst in the anime version. Well, the music and graphics is perfect, but me who've been a fan of Hypmic since it's still manga series is used to angst in the story. But, i just enjoyed it.Someone tell me that Tom is Gentaro's Brother but, hey, he's in coma, right? If Tom is Gentaro's brother, so why Gentaro is go to the hospital everyday if he was healthy?Ok, that's all. I think the longer...i write it, i would write more spoiler. i write it, i would write more spoiler."", 'My initial impression of Hypnosis Mic was that it\'s neither bad nor great. After finishing the series, I realized that while it\'s not the worst anime ever it\'s definitely not the best written of its kind. I\'ve seen and enjoyed anime series that go all out with their over-the-top premises. Whether they be ""Use [this merch] to save the world"" plotlines or logic breaking scenarios, I could enjoy them as long as they are well executed.On paper, Hypnosis Mic\'s worldbuilding was definitely over-the-top. A Japan run by an all-female government (who banned all weapons and violence) where the only way for people to survive and...thrive is to know how to rap and possess the titular hypnosis mic. Watching this show told me to not expect any serious discussion on how a seemingly warless society works from the ethical ramifications behind hacking people\'s brains with raps for the sake of world peace to how no one in the shady side of things thought about smuggling banned weapons such as guns and knives. What really mattered to this series were the raps and characters as the latter ended up in weird situations.Unfortunately those ideas were poorly executed on practice. The writing was definitely not the show\'s strong suit. The way the show was paced made the world of Hypnosis Mic lose its appeal. Nothing was well explained or established. I said it before, but it\'s poor world building if I\'m required to look at other sources just to understand how the world works. The main cast lacked chemistry. They were merely walking archetypes with personalities defined by one to two gimmicks. Their cast management wasn\'t as bad as B-Project\'s, but it lacked the impact it needs to make me care about any of those characters. For instance, when the characters were in grave danger at the climax I could care less.Speaking of the climax, the final episodes of the series felt rushed and incomplete. The Division Rap Battle the show kept on hyping up since the beginning felt lame. In the final moments, it\'s implied that the Party of Words was involved in this conspiracy and was preparing for a new plan since a certain project failed. Though as it is, I could care less.Even the rap battles weren\'t exciting. Aside from the competition, all battles that the main cast have against a couple of thugs turned out one-sided. The thugs didn\'t even rap. When there was an actual match, all I got was people blasting words at each other. Maybe it\'s the language barrier that made me unable to see why person A\'s word play was better than B\'s to justify why he\'s able to wear him down. Another factor is that I\'m not into rap music, so there\'s some bias there.Animation was very static outside the rap battle segments. Characters would barely move during conversations, giving the impression that they were glorified mannequins. The artwork was pretty good. The character designs were colorful and fun. The animation during the rap battles were definitely enjoyable and expressive. The OST was okay, though I\'m not into raps to begin with. The VAs clearly gave it their all to sing all those songs.Overall, I\'m not sure if I should recommend Hypnosis Mic. It\'s not offensive, but I don\'t find it enjoyable either. I guess it\'s another harmless run-of-the-mill series with lack luster writing. If you\'re curious, go right ahead. thrive is to know how to rap and possess the titular hypnosis mic.

Welcome to another review! **Note that this was written at two different 'stages' while I was watching the anime**.This is what I wrote having watched 4 episodes and I believe I will sustain my POV until the end:As a rap battle IRL enjoyer, I actually found this anime immediately disappointing. I expected the bands from the opening to encounter and actually DOING a rap battle but this is rapping against bad guys one-sided; hence where's the battle? If you want to watch this because you like rap battles, then take that into account cause you're not getting anything until the end I guess.The...story is so bad and stupid imo. I really don't care about what happens. I feel it's overly complicated to follow and I sense they made it that way to make it look 'serious' and/or 'cool'.There's no need for a story here, get a bunch of guys rap and that's it. I also don't understand why this anime isn't categorized as comedy because it stars off with a funny premise. Maybe they should have gone that way and it'd be much better imo.I really liked the designs of the speakers, they are really cool, I did enjoy that. The desings of the characters are basic and stereotyped, the only one I found appealing was Ramuda as most people according to the number of favourites/likes it has in this site and also some friends that I know that like the series.Voice Actors make a good job rapping and talking is ok. Ramuda particularly sticks out for obvious reasons and I don't find him annoying tbh.I wish I could have enjoyed the rapping scenes more because it was either choosing to read the lyrics in the subtitles or watching the animation so it was very tiring to have to stop to read the stupid lyrics and miss the visuals. Ah, yes, the lyrics suck most the time, you don't really care or feel the losing side are getting 'owned' and there's no memorable punchline, which is something that rap specially stands out over other genres.I liked the OP and EDs, specially I sometimes sang along the OP when it gets to the part that goes ''Hypnosis action ends corruption...'' till the end. I would cut some bits of the opening song but that's about my taste and all the guys styles had to be shownso I don't mind it.In short, this anime is eye-candy (not a really good one if you ask me) and cool. Just a product to sell merch, promote the Android game, etc, with no real substance and that's very fine. It comes from Japan, after all...If you like this anime, that's perfect, but unfortunately I found other eye-candies with actual stories that are interesting to me so I know it's possible to combine those and make a decent piece of work at the very least (*Kuroshitsuji cough cough*), nor to say a Masterpiece (*Pandora Hearts cough cough*).I will force myself to finish the anime because I believe there's gonna be a rap battle in the end and that's what I'm looking forward rn: a direct confrontation from the bands in the arena (which, very probably, will end as a draw of some kind or be interrupted as for fans not to kill each other over who was the winner).------------------------------------------------------------Now that I finished the anime I have to correct myself that indeed there was a winner in the end. But not that it matters so much.Still the plot was really boring, a lot of lack of info, no sense in the antagonists actions, things that came up of nowhere, no building, no nothing. The only way to enjoy the anime is to watch it completely brainless and not paying attention to what's really happening. Other than that, you'll feel either fatigued after a chapter, or two tops.Anyways, I don't care too much to even discuss aaaalll the details that made this a bad anime.I wish ALL the anime was like episodes from 8 to 11 because that's what I was aiming and I DO like the songs but well, guess they couldn't resist the urge to make an edgy story to this. Man, I even feel bad because this COULD have been a really good anime... T_T.I do not recommend to watch this to be completely honest unless you are very young and didn't watch a lot of animes cause you're gonna get mentally tired when the anime tries to explain itself.If you're interested in the OST or the battles, just watch them on YouTube (I should have done that).4.5 out of 10, extra .5 'cause I'm comparing this to Basquash and it's slightly better just for the songs.Well, that's it! I hope you enjoyed reading my review. Bye-bye~ ^^/ story is so bad and stupid imo. I really don't care about what happens.

Other than that, you'll feel either fatigued after a chapter, or two tops.Anyways, I don't care too much to even discuss aaaalll the details that made this a bad anime.I wish ALL the anime was like episodes from 8 to 11 because that's what I was aiming and I DO like the songs but well, guess they couldn't resist the urge to make an edgy story to this. Man, I even feel bad because this COULD have been a really good anime... T_T.I do not recommend to watch this to be completely honest unless you are very young and didn't watch a lot of animes cause you're gonna get mentally tired when the anime tries to explain itself.If you're interested in the OST or the battles, just watch them on YouTube (I should have done that).4.5 out of 10, extra .5 'cause I'm comparing this to Basquash and it's slightly better just for the songs.Well, that's it! I hope you enjoyed reading my review. Bye-bye~ ^^/"", 'Story-wise, it’s actually kind of lacking. They have these sort of side-stories to sort of show what drives the individual groups and how strong they are. I had the indication that the anime would take perhaps four episodes and show one group per episode, building up the anticipation of the division battle in an appropriate and timely manner. However, slight spoiler, it wasn’t until practically the end of the anime until the division battle took place and even then it was over far too quick. The anime also left so many questions unanswered that you have to wonder if these questions or mysteries should have...been a part of the plot in the first place. Perhaps they’re trying to save some stuff for a second season. But, from what I can tell, that isn’t likely. But, there were a couple of good things that should be pointed out. For one, the art style was beautiful. It was sleek and the main characters were unique, whether it came to hair style, eye color, or even eye structure. The rapping, as one would hope, was actually pretty great too! This is the first music anime in which I’ve heard the characters rap but it was truly an experience. For your sake, I hope you’re a fast reader because they really do be spitting lines. Overall, it was a fine enough anime that I enjoyed for the most part and genuinely did not regret watching. been a part of the plot in the first place.

The characters are silly, overexaggerated , and the rap battles themselves make me curl up into a bowl and laugh my guts out but I got to say I had fun. I couldn't take any of the battles seriously but if you don't mind laughing at the absurdity of an anime , this is the one for you.In terms of story, a lot of mysteries are left unsolved, and the past histories are still barely touched on. Also that last fight 12 people v. 3 talk about unfair, and the opponents...didn't even have a chance to fight back. I also wish they explained more in depth about the skills, how they synergize and work with each other. What are the requirements to gain a skill? Are multiple skills possible, etc. The idea of skills gave it a more tactical approach, but the show just mentioned skills then completely forgot about the explanation.Certain raps and songs, like the op, ed, the Ichiro only one, the secret aliens, one in ep 12, are super good and I would honestly love to buy a copy of those songs. The others are also great but not my taste. Overall the animations to match the raps are absurd and funny. The raps appear to give a physical representation on how the words are hurting the opponents, but half the time the words are utter nonsense, and seeing the opponents fall on their ass makes me laugh, like really, you're hurt by this...really?!Outside of the raps the art is fairly average, as well as animation. So...yeah.The large cast is interesting but there's not enough time for me to actually know the characters and their dynamics well as I wish I could, but the show did the best it could with the amount of time it had. When ever the groups mesh its a million times more interesting then when they're off by themselves. The only individual group episode I liked was Matenro's. The comedic timing on that episode was on point!The show was fun and funny. It genuinely brought tears to my eyes , with its absolute absurdity. Sometimes it was slow and the conflict was boring but the characters are what makes this anime worthwhile. If you have time, and need a good laugh. I think it's worth watching!TLDR: This anime is stupid fun!(Note) Don't expect anything more than that. didn't even have a chance to fight back.
