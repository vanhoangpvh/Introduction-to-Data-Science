Mahou Shoujo Pretty Sammy (1996),https://myanimelist.net/anime/1502/Mahou_Shoujo_Pretty_Sammy_1996,"[""Mahou Shoujo Pretty Sammy is basically a spin-off of the Tenchi Muyu series, its just a shame that this alternate version couldn't have been as good as the latter.Story: We basically follow little Sasami (a seemingly ordinary girl) who is destined to take on the identity of a super heroine called &quot;Pretty Sammy.&quot; She is chosen by Tsunami, that if Pretty Sammy can do enough good deeds, then Tsunami will become the next Queen of their magical world known as Juraihelm. However there is also a rival candidate that makes her own magical girl called &quot;Pixie Misa,&quot; who has the very same goal in mind....Now I know that all this sounds nice, and really it is a good concept for a magical girl story. What brings Mahou Shoujo Pretty Sammy down so much, is its extremely corny content! It's a series that definitely doesn't take itself seriously. Sammy has all your standard magical girl attacks (known as the Codfish bomber, which come in the form of a magical heart style attack) and transformations, they don't really change throughout the series, but are pretty amusing to watch, so again there actual is a good formula here for the series. The kind of corny content that it suffers from as I mentioned however, are as followed: The monsters (which usually are pretty ridiculous to look at, such as a talking Karaoke Machine and a Cowboy Girl), character origins (such as a boy who turns into a bird) and many of its joke lines (such as Sammy singing a song while they show her briefly pick up a house with her bare hands). However, the one thing that does make this series worth a peek at, are the numerous Tenchi Muyu character cameos! All of the cast that you grew to love, or hate, during the Tenchi series all make an appearance here. With the exception of the new characters from the GPX series, since this spin-off came before that one. Most of the characters don't really stay long (Tenchi himself only makes a one episode appearance), so the majority staple characters from the series that you get are: Sasami, Ryo-Okhi, Tsunami and Washu--as they are the only real characters that remain from beginning to end. Ayeka does appear later under the name Romeo, to my recollection she was the only one that had her name changed for the series. So anyway, the bulk of the story has Pretty Sammy stopping Pixie Misa from doing harm to other people, which mostly happens by way of a monster being summoned. The more times she stops her, the more points Tsunami gets, which she needs to be queen. So from beginning to near end it revolves around that plot, all the while having over the top humor and jokes. Which can get very repetitive very fast! The storyline also feels very very blodded at times, like they could have snipped this series down to half as long and it wouldn't have made much difference. Near the end though:a surprise guest appears that turns out to be the real enemy of the series.And I do have to go on par to say that it does actually conclude at the end, so if you do decide to give it a chance, it's nice to know that you will be treated to one at the end.There isn't too much as far as offensive material goes, though there is a scene or two where Sasami ends up taking a bath with her dad. It's done in a innocent way...but is still awkward none the less. So yeah he can be pretty creepy, and honestly--the dude makes me want to retreat into myself sometimes! Is that odd? Ahem...anyway...Art: The art style from the Tenchi series remains here, so you will recognize all of the cast once they appear. The only odd thing I found is that this series was made around the same time as &quot;Tenchi in Tokyo,&quot; yet the color clarity seems to have dropped compared to that one. Not really sure what happened here, its by no means bad--it just fails in comparison to the series that came before it. The character design is indeed the best part though, I mean they are the Tenchi characters after all.Sound: I really liked the soundtrack, even if it was a bit campy at times. The character voices do sound alright, and you do get a catchy opening theme sung by &quot;Yokoyama, Chisa.&quot; Who is the voice of Sasami herself. The ending theme changes twice throughout the series, both are quite enjoyable and varied. (one a soft late night theme, the other a Samba style theme) I think they got the right characters for the right job in each role. Though some (such as Sasami's dad and the monsters) come off as awfully exaggerated.Characters: Well they are the Tenchi characters, so you can expect pretty much that, only this time them being a lot more over the top in their personalities. This is especially true with Washu, who seems to be even more of a wacky inventor now. I mean...there is an episode where she dresses up like Santa in order to help Sasami defeat the monster, yet it's not Christmas...need I say more??? I felt they got  Tsunami's role down perfectly though, she retains her very quiet and mature nature. Sasami acts like she did in the Tenchi series, only now she is much more child-like in her personality. There really is no character development that takes place here, with exception of Sasami and a girl named Misao, they actually do grow closer to one another by the end.Overall: Pretty Sammy is an interesting title to say the least, it may have simply been a desperate attempt to cash in on the Tenchi series, but I don't think it is quite as bad as others would see it as. Because it does have a good magical girl formula down here, it just suffers from its corny (and cheesy) approach in story.  I recommend it to the hardcore Tenchi fans out there, or to viewers who are will to go in with lower expectations. I would consider sampling an episode or two, you'll know by then if it's your cup of tea or not. Now I know that all this sounds nice, and really it is a good concept for a magical girl story.

It got so bad that some companies wanted to take a jab at Sailor Moon's success. Thus, with intent to parody and call the heck out of those magical girl tropes that bordered on overused at the time, Magical Girl Pretty Sammy was born. Actually, this show is an AU spin-off of a popular harem/sci-fi OVA series called Tenchi Muyo, which I haven't seen nor do I ever intend to, as it doesn't seem to appeal to me. But some...people I knew said they liked Pretty Sammy and that I don't need to know anything about Tenchi Muyo to enjoy it. Since I was bored and didn't have much to watch, I decided to track it down and give it a watch. Surprisingly, it's one of the best comedies and parodies I've seen! Sure, it has a LOT of flaws that prevent it from being great, but it's a fun watch all the way through!Seriously, this show parodies every magical girl trope you can imagine. Sasami Kawai is a normal ten-year-old girl who's perfectly happy with her life. She has loving parents, a great best friend in shy girl Misao Amano, enjoys school, and is pretty average...however, one day, a strange woman named Tsunami appears in her house, giving her a strange baton and asking her to become a magical girl named Pretty Sammy. Tsunami is a woman from a magical world called Juraihelm, and she is a candidate to become queen, but she is up against two other candidates, Romio and Ramia. As part of the succession rites, Tsunami has to find someone, a kindred spirit, on Earth to give magical powers to so she can restore Juraihelm's balance. Sasami is in no way happy about this sudden change in her life, and questions why she even has to do this when she's not even the queen-to-be. Things get complicated when another magical girl, Pixy Misa, keeps getting in her way and sending Love-Love Monsters after her. Seeing as there's no way out, Sasami has to deal with being a magical girl and all the baggage that comes with it.For its time, the animations looks quite good. It looks smooth, the characters are well designed most of the time, and it does its job well. The fact that it goes out of its way to make its characters look zany and stupid, especially during the comedic moments in the show, also works for the show's benefit since this is a parody, and we can't have a parody without some humor, right? However, I do have some issues with the magical girl outfits that Sammy and Misa are forced to wear. Do their skirts REALLY have to be so ridiclously short and skimpy? And they're ten years old! Then again, I think the show is trying to make fun of how silly most magical girl outfits were at the time, and the good thing is the show doesn't make any attempts to use them for fanservice (panty shots, anyone?), so I can give it some plus points for that. The soundtrack isn't really particularly memorable. The opening theme...is admittedly very badly sung, like the singer is trying waaaaay too hard to sound cutesy and high pitched, and all it does is grate on my ears. But there are some fun BGMs that really get you in the moment when something's about to happen, and it uses a wide range of music genres like jazz, pop, orchestra, etc.The characters are arguably a mixed bag. The two main characters, Sasami and Misao, are easily the best characters, as they receive the most development throughout the entire series, and the two are just a joy to watch. I wish I could tell you more about them but to do so would make way for spoilers. Sasami's parents are very good parents who love their daughter deeply and even when she gets bad grades, they don't make her feel bad about herself about it and actually spend time with her (Hear that, Sailor Moon?!), even if Sasami's dad, Ginji, is ridiculously overpowered and knows way more about stuff he shouldn't than he should. Washu and some of the other adult characters...I don't really care for. Washu was just overpowered and Mihoshi is a pretty poor excuse of a teacher with a really annoying voice who doesn't do much of anything, and DEAR GOD I hated those two girls Konoha and Eimi, the former because she's an annoying little brat who pesters the heck out of one of the boys (the show even points this out), bullies Misao for stupid reasons, and generally causes trouble for everyone, and Eimi is a stuck-up little prick who freaks out over the littlest things, claiming they're against school rules even when they have nothing to do with school. Every time they opened their mouths I wanted to deck'em! But the worst of them is Tsunami herself: she pretty much does NOTHING throughout the entire series. The whole thing is about her becoming queen of Juraihelm, but she doesn't even do anything to warrant becoming a queen, makes Sasami do everything for her where she could easily do those things herself had she not been put under the restriction not to leave Juraihelm, and is so dense and ditzy that you wonder if she's even aware of anything going on around her. You could replace her with another, much better character, and nothing would be lost. She's pretty much woefully useless, and it really says a lot when the villains are WAY more proactive than she is.But bad supporting characters isn't the only major flaw Pretty Sammy has. When I first began watching it, one aspect almost turned me off to the show entirely: The ridiculously over-the-top voice acting! Some of the actresses try way too hard to make their voices go as high pitched as possible, amping them up to completely unlistenable levels, not only coming off as shrill, but ear-rum blastingly annoying. Sasami, Sasami's mother, Konoha, Eimi, and Mihoshi are the biggest offenders. Sasami's voice actress, Chisa Yokoyama, is trying WAY TOO HARD to sound cute, and when she shouts her transformation phrase, I always turned the volume lower because it was that annoying. It's a shame, because the voice she uses for Tsunami is just fine, and she can do better, more natural sounding voices without needing to go so over-the-top. Sasami's mother also has a thankfully not annoying high pitched voice, but she still sounds like a little girl even when she's a mom, Konoha and Eimi's voices are just shrill and annoying, especially when they yell, and Mihoshi...she has the worst voice of all! She sounds like she inhaled way too much helium, and when she cries and yells she comes off as even more shrill, almost to the point where my eardrums almost exploded! It's especially jarring because her voice actress, Yuko Mizutani, is capable of doing much more mature, natural sounding voices, even more so since this was three years before she got to voice Sora from Digimon, and it really says something when her voice for Sora is MUCH more mature and listenable than Mihoshi's could ever be!There were also some concepts and even individual episodes that didn't make any sense, such as one episode where Sasami and her dad end up in a ninja village and they get into a fight with a Western cowboy faction. There was also one where some kid raises the monsters that Pixy Misa creates even though Pretty Sammy managed to defeat them. Also...Washu is confirmed to be 12 years old yet she's teaching at an elementary school. How does that many any sense whatsoever? And she can create a gigantic rocket controlled by robotic puppets of herself. I won't explain the context, as that would give away spoilers. So yeah, not even a parody series is safe from gigantic plot holes and inconsistencies.Even so, I still really enjoyed this series. It has its flaws, yes, but I found myself invested in almost every episode, even the bad ones. I found most of the jokes and take thats to the genre genuinely funny (especially when the show asks when Sasami's parents will figure out that their daughter is the magical girl they see saving the world all the time), Sasami and Misao are a joy to watch, the battles were funny yet compelling, and...the final villain, who I won't name because of spoilers, is one of the best villains ever. (Red from Happiness Charge, you could learn a thing or two from this villain! Seriously!) Not only that, it does both comedy and drama really well, and because we get time to get to know the characters, we actually care about their plights when bad things happen, and when things get serious, boy, do they ever! Plus...this is the ONLY anime that has a school cultural festival that I actually liked AND cared about, and usually those episodes either bore me to death or annoy me with their flaws (As much as I hate to admit it, Go! Princess Pretty Cure is a pretty bad offender with this one). Not an easy feat to accomplish. So yeah, even if it does have major flaws that keep it from being perfect, I still enjoyed it, and given the choice, I'd watch it again! Seriously, as much as I like Sailor Moon, why couldn't THIS show be the most well known magical girl show of all time?! It doesn't even have an English dub, and it could really benefit from one if done right!Not a perfect magical girl show, but a reasonably fun parody and a genuinely fun show to watch if you're ever bored or want to kill some time. Just jam some ear plugs in if you can't stand many of the annoying high pitched voices. people I knew said they liked Pretty Sammy and that I don't need to know anything about Tenchi Muyo to enjoy it. Since I was bored and didn't have much to watch, I decided to track it down and give it a watch. Surprisingly, it's one of the best comedies and parodies I've seen!

Shadowverse Flame,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50060/Shadowverse_Flame,"['Oh okay, this is strange. While this anime is technically finished, it\'s really only one season of a plot that finished midway, with the continuation scheduled a few months as of the time of writing this review. Therefor, while I can pass judgment for what we have up to this point, keep in mind the anime as it stands isn\'t the whole story, and won\'t be until Seven Shadows releases.But where are my manners? You came here to read some thoughts on Shadowverse Flame and whether it was worth watching or not, yeah? With the usual disclaimer of ""If you can suspend your disbelief on...card games being what drives the plot"" being present, I can say that, yeah, this is a pretty good watch. Compared to the previous show in this continuity, Shadowverse(TV), its shored up a lot of its issues, though not without introducing some new ones. Still; 8/10 ain\'t a bad score at all. I\'ll spend some time comparing the two, and why Flame\'s worth checking out where the original wasn\'t.I\'ll start us off with an easy one; the characters. While the cast of the original wasn\'t completely irredeemable, a lot of them felt very one-note and gimmicky with arcs that went nowhere or resolved in a backwards manner. The cast was bland even if it could be fun at times, with its main offender being a bad protagonist. Flame shores this up by giving more depth to its cast and allowing more screen time to everyone besides just our MC, Light. But while we\'re on the topic of him, while Hiiro was a stock shonen invincible protagonist, Light takes on a different role in the plot. He\'s a complete airhead who came to the main setting, Shadowverse College, because a stranger told him it was his destiny, with Light going ""Yeah, checks out."" and deciding to follow up on this despite never having played a game of Shadowverse in his life. Unlike Hiiro, though, who seemed a natural at the game, Light is a complete goofball. He starts out from scratch, having to learn the basics and even losing his first match on screen, just to drive home he has a lot to learn. Light\'s win record gets shored up a little bit after his first loss, but unlike Hiiro the writers aren\'t afraid of making Light\'s defense drop to 0 when the narrative calls for it. He loses a lot, but aside from one or arguably two matches he has, it never feels like they were matches he particularly deserved or needed to win, and Light always seems to learn a lesson coming out of them. Just on the game sense it would make him a much more realistic protagonist, but there\'s a lot more to him besides just his card game prowess. He\'s an airhead, but has a good read on people. He tries to empathize and understand them, and always does his best to reach out to someone in trouble. Unlike Hiiro who seemed to force his values without listening to others, Light tries to listen and understand before offering a personal rebuttal to each opponent, and everyone both in and out of universe seems to adore him for his earnest straightforwardness and overly blunt personality.While I spent a lot of time on our main character, I\'d be remiss not to mention the side cast as well. Once again we\'re split into having a main representative of each of Shadowverse\'s main 8 crafts, portal excluded, but despite this, each of the main cast has a unique deck that doesn\'t quite play entirely like how their craft clasically would, with the exception of maybe Itsuki. Even if you\'ve no interest or knowledge of Shadowverse as a game, though, there\'s plenty to like about them. Every character feels like they have multiple facets to their personality, such as Subaru\'s social demeanor being undercut by his self-loathing, Shion\'s denying of her desire for friendship and companionship because she doesn\'t know how to not be rude to people, or Itsuki\'s kind and gentle demeanor not getting in the way from his raw determination and willingness to stick up for people. Even the glimpses we get of the old cast returning from Shadowverse(TV), whether they be a side or a main character from that show, seems to be while all of them grew as people and grown beyond their initial gimmicks. Except for Kazuki, but him being static was kind of the point even in the original, so he gets off scot free. For now.To my mind, the plot\'s also improved compared to (TV), though it takes on a radically different turn. While the original snorted several lines of illegal powdery substances and proceeded to speedrun a 150 episode plot in a third of that time, Shadowverse Flame seems to want to take the exact opposite approach. When Light gets to Shadowverse College, he meets an Itsuki handing out flyers on the way to school. Apparently Itsuki\'s club, Seventh Flame, disbanded and he\'s trying to rebuild it. Light promises to help, dragging his new friend Subaru along, and the three of them have about a week to find three more members before the club officially shuts down. With the first episode not even having a battle to check out, Flame decides to take its time slowly introducing both the main and side cast, even going so far as to give Itsuki and Subaru the spotlight within the first 12 episodes and allowing them a focus episode by battling against two recurring side characters. When the club recruits the mysterious virtual rabbit Gentleman, the peppy wannabe hero Ren and the fashionable-yet-slightly-apathetic Tsubasa, our core 6 become assembled. Rather than immediately throw us into a tournament arc, though, the cast first gets to spend several episodes fleshing out their backstories and becoming friends, before then being thrown into a do-or-die tournament to defeat the first half\'s main antagonist, Hazeura Haruma. After he\'s defeated, we\'re thrown into another few episodes of the cast allowing to relax and build friendships. After this, the second arc then takes up the entire back half of the show, but throughout all 50 episodes the show\'s slowly been bubbling up to a greater subplot involving the virtual world and a mysterious figure known as ""Arc Ruler"" who seems to have stolen something from the Genesis corporation, as well as the endgoal of the enigmatic 7 Shadows antagonists. Unfortunately, this isn\'t expanded on within Flame itself, as all of these plot threads are that which is set up to be explored within the next season.While I\'ve high praises for the show, I can\'t say it always executes on everything flawlessly. Some characters feel underutilized and the cast as a whole seems almost too big for its birches, even throwing in some recurring characters from the first season who didn\'t get enough screen time there and got even less now. Recurring characters as a whole are utilized very weakly, even; unless you have actually seen the original, many of them seem to be treated with far more pomp and grandiose than you\'d reasonably expect them to have. You wouldn\'t know what their deal is, or why they\'d be a threat to the main cast. Even the previous show\'s main characters don\'t escape this curse; Mauro shows up briefly for a single episode, acts a bit mysterious, and then vanishes completely. His appearance served little to the plot of Flame and at best acted like a small distraction, but his \'involvement\' seems to only be so far as they could check off everyone of the main cast having been shown once in Flame.While Flame\'s battles are also better than the original, they\'re still not perfect. Some of them fall in the trap of being extremely repetetive. While it\'s not as bad as Hiiro\'s insistence on winning every match with Ignis Dragon, we still get things like three battles of Mikado Vs. Light, which barely differ between themselves, and even end with the same few cards being played for the finishing turns in each of them. Some deck concepts are also much more boring to watch in action than others. While most battles are enjoyable, fresh and fast-paced, it\'s still the weakest part of the writing for me, and I hope the writers can shore up their battle choreography for the upcoming Seven Shadows.Overall despite some minor issues, the pacing and characters make for a wonderfully enjoyable show. Unlike the original I heartily recommend checking this out for anyone who\'s a fan of card game anime like I am, as it\'s up there as one of the better ones in the genre. You could do much worse than Shadowverse Flame, and despite a recurring cast, I don\'t feel one needs to have watched the original to have a good time with this anime. card games being what drives the plot"" being present, I can say that, yeah, this is a pretty good watch. Compared to the previous show in this continuity, Shadowverse(TV), its shored up a lot of its issues, though not without introducing some new ones. Still; 8/10 ain\'t a bad score at all. I\'ll spend some time comparing the two, and why Flame\'s worth checking out where the original wasn\'t.I\'ll start us off with an easy one; the characters. While the cast of the original wasn\'t completely irredeemable, a lot of them felt very one-note and gimmicky with arcs that went nowhere or resolved in a backwards manner. The cast was bland even if it could be fun at times, with its main offender being a bad protagonist. Flame shores this up by giving more depth to its cast and allowing more screen time to everyone besides just our MC, Light. But while we\'re on the topic of him, while Hiiro was a stock shonen invincible protagonist, Light takes on a different role in the plot. He\'s a complete airhead who came to the main setting, Shadowverse College, because a stranger told him it was his destiny, with Light going ""Yeah, checks out."" and deciding to follow up on this despite never having played a game of Shadowverse in his life. Unlike Hiiro, though, who seemed a natural at the game, Light is a complete goofball. He starts out from scratch, having to learn the basics and even losing his first match on screen, just to drive home he has a lot to learn. Light\'s win record gets shored up a little bit after his first loss, but unlike Hiiro the writers aren\'t afraid of making Light\'s defense drop to 0 when the narrative calls for it. He loses a lot, but aside from one or arguably two matches he has, it never feels like they were matches he particularly deserved or needed to win, and Light always seems to learn a lesson coming out of them. Just on the game sense it would make him a much more realistic protagonist, but there\'s a lot more to him besides just his card game prowess. He\'s an airhead, but has a good read on people. He tries to empathize and understand them, and always does his best to reach out to someone in trouble. Unlike Hiiro who seemed to force his values without listening to others, Light tries to listen and understand before offering a personal rebuttal to each opponent, and everyone both in and out of universe seems to adore him for his earnest straightforwardness and overly blunt personality.While I spent a lot of time on our main character, I\'d be remiss not to mention the side cast as well. Once again we\'re split into having a main representative of each of Shadowverse\'s main 8 crafts, portal excluded, but despite this, each of the main cast has a unique deck that doesn\'t quite play entirely like how their craft clasically would, with the exception of maybe Itsuki. Even if you\'ve no interest or knowledge of Shadowverse as a game, though, there\'s plenty to like about them. Every character feels like they have multiple facets to their personality, such as Subaru\'s social demeanor being undercut by his self-loathing, Shion\'s denying of her desire for friendship and companionship because she doesn\'t know how to not be rude to people, or Itsuki\'s kind and gentle demeanor not getting in the way from his raw determination and willingness to stick up for people. Even the glimpses we get of the old cast returning from Shadowverse(TV), whether they be a side or a main character from that show, seems to be while all of them grew as people and grown beyond their initial gimmicks. Except for Kazuki, but him being static was kind of the point even in the original, so he gets off scot free. For now.To my mind, the plot\'s also improved compared to (TV), though it takes on a radically different turn. While the original snorted several lines of illegal powdery substances and proceeded to speedrun a 150 episode plot in a third of that time, Shadowverse Flame seems to want to take the exact opposite approach. When Light gets to Shadowverse College, he meets an Itsuki handing out flyers on the way to school. Apparently Itsuki\'s club, Seventh Flame, disbanded and he\'s trying to rebuild it. Light promises to help, dragging his new friend Subaru along, and the three of them have about a week to find three more members before the club officially shuts down. With the first episode not even having a battle to check out, Flame decides to take its time slowly introducing both the main and side cast, even going so far as to give Itsuki and Subaru the spotlight within the first 12 episodes and allowing them a focus episode by battling against two recurring side characters.

But you aren\'t required to watch Shadowverse to understand it.It follows an MC Light Tenryu who enters a collage which teaches kids how to play the card game the show is based on. Unlike any normal person, he entered there without any knowledge of the game or anything. Just because he was told by some random stranger.Basically the plot is about Light learning to play the game and gather members for the Shadowverse club he is part off which is missing members to become an official club.The plot itself sounds rather stupid but...it is entertaining to watch. The characters have strong personality except the MC and probably the only ones that carry the show.The card game unlike in the predecessor gets properly explained and it is much more understandable. But some duels are a bit too fast paced and certain elements aren\'t as well explained as in Yugioh (at least in the Japanese version where they state the obvious in Arc V).However, it is not well explained if the card game can actually hurt the players since the monsters seem to be solid vision and sometimes characters fly around after being hit by an attack, which makes it awkward why kids are allowed to play these kinds of games if it poses actual harm. And if they don\'t, why are they acting the way they do?The former question can only be answered by watching the previous show. Regarding that, old protagonists appear and battle the new cast members. For people who had enjoyed the previous anime and liked some of the characters, they can see how they grew up to highschoolers and how ""strong"" they have become.The new cast has some stuff too offer too. An older brother who has self-esteem issues because he can\'t live up to his younger brothers legacy. Someone who is very selfish and uses his skills to humiliate weaker players. Another one being traumatized by how her former senpai she looked up too got thrashed in a card game. A girl who tries to move out of her shell and tries to be herself being caught in the mids of stereo types.They aren\'t handled as well it could be but for a kids show it does a decent job. My favorite character being Ren Kazamatsuri but the others are very enjoyable too.The exception is Light who is basically a white piece of toast. The previous Shadowverse had a not very likable protagonist who is a gary stu, but that character had a personality. But Light is one of the most bland characters I have seen. He went to a college by a stranger and is insanely awkward playing things straight. He acts like a robot sometimes and not like how a human normally acts.Despite these issues it is a really fun show to watch. it is entertaining to watch.

Shi Cao Lao Long Bei Guan Yi E Long Zhi Ming,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50421/Shi_Cao_Lao_Long_Bei_Guan_Yi_E_Long_Zhi_Ming,"['Herbivorous dragon is a light-hearted, cute, and feel-good show about a wimpy, kind-hearted dragon and an overpowered cute little girl who follows him. The show does a good job of giving an enjoyable experience with a consistent tone that is silly and endearing and cute. What it lacks is depth. It\'s a show that you can watch and be happy and then move on; you are not going to stop and go, whoa, what did I just watch?The dragon is kind of like King, from One Punch Man, because people think he\'s powerful when he\'s a wimp. And Lingzi (Reiko) is kind of like Saitama,...but subject to the mind warping field and also believes the dragon is powerful (and evil). So, you might imagine some of the antics that follow. It\'s not something you can take seriously, because real people have reasons for their beliefs, but if you let it go, it\'s pretty funny. I said ""antics"" because nothing in the plot feels central to the plot. It\'s sort of slice-of-life-ish in that regard.The animation is simple. Don\'t expect any breathtaking sakuga. It looks low cost, with limited movement. The characters look nice enough though. Somehow, they make it work, without looking bad.I have no qualms with the voice acting. Dragon has a soothing avuncular voice, and Lingzi has a cute but dauntless voice which fit their characters.The ED is a total banger. It\'s no exaggeration to say that it possibly kept me watching the show. I often skip EDs after hearing them a few times, but not this one. I rewind and watch/listen to it several times per episode. The OP is also good. Note that the art style is much simpler but more animated in the OP and ED than the show.It\'s short, so if you consider that it\'s less than three hours, I\'d say it\'s worth the watch. but subject to the mind warping field and also believes the dragon is powerful (and evil).

It's a nice, fun gag story with a simple premise about an innocent dragon who got wrongfully worshipped by a girl for being the evil dragon. The art was decent and the pacing was just enough to keep the humour and the interest going.The same cannot be said about the animated series. This production is not at all bad. The animation style, colouring and drawings are all fine. They look fine. However, for a gag series, I didn't laugh. I might come off as harsh, but its direction felt quite antiquated. It reminded me of...old Chinese gag cartoon like the sheeps or goats and the wolves family thing. It's not that the gags don't work. They worked before in comic form for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the dragon's suffering and the ridiculous situations he got in into. To me, it seems that the director came from another culture and wasn't completely bought into the gags, so he tried to reframed in a way that's familiar to him. The pacing of the jokes, the way they add cartoony reactions to the dragon and the characters are distinctively from their culture sphere. I wasn't a big fan of such humour, and seeing a simple, endearing story being skinned and then having a different skin puts on top is disappointing.I can't be bothered to talk about sound, music or what not. The way the gags are delivered just fall so flat, I was trying to pay attention to the animations to distract myself from having to understand what's taking place.The best I could say about the series, is that I finished it. I probably wouldn't have, if I had not read the comic.I heard it got adapted by Chinese studio because the series was so beloved in China. Why not supporting local artists? I think the ones that needed the most support from their own people are the Chinese artists. Despite having huge creative industry, their best cultural exports are still imitations of foreign culture creation. I'm pretty sure people were enamoured with Hong Kong action films of the 80s and 90s.

Still worth the watch from me."", 'Minor SpoilersThis is the first piece of Chinese media I have ever watched so I had no idea what I would be getting myself into. Thankfully, this show was a delightful - albeit forgettable - experience.Narratively, this donghua is simple yet efficient. Each episode is ten minutes long without the opening and ending, so every second must be used wisely. I liked the fast pacing but was often left wanting more by the episode\'s climax.  I get the sense the original manhua was mostly reliant on gags and one off chapters forcing the writing team to come up with the framework. A young girl...named Lingzhi arrives at the Herbivorous Dragon\'s cave demanding to be sacrificed to him. Since she won\'t believe the Dragon when he tells her who he is, Lingzhi is taken on as a ""pupil"" until the Dragon can figure out what to do with her. Comedy is often used to juxtapose characters\' situations. For example, Lingzhi or the Water Saint will pick up on hidden meanings in the Dragon\'s words when he\'s trying to be upfront about who he is, or a hunter God who needs a pupil to survive can\'t teach the Dragon a single thing to save his life. The comedic elements keep the story from getting stale since without its a generic fantasy. The biggest issue narratively is the ending which happens so there can be a big battle at the end of the season without any actual consequences.Where this donghua shines is with its characters. Herbivore Dragon is a typical fantasy main character in a dragon\'s body. He\'s clowned on for his weakness and simultaneously the moral compass of the show. He gives off big girl dad vibes with how he gently guides Lingzhi through her emotions and trying to reinforce her good deeds. He doesn\'t want to be the evil dragon he\'s mistaken for but takes on the responsibility of Lingzhi believing he is. Lingzhi herself has a surprising amount of layers. Raised to be a sacrifice in place of the child chosen by random draw, she fully embraces her role as sacrifice and later servant of the evil dragon. Despite being a child, Lingzhi is a powerful wizard who is able to protect herself and her master from the demon army. While Lingzhi could have been a boring Mary Sue she has genuine development by the end of the series; while the twist involving her was dumb, the resolution made sense because of her character arc\'s trajectory. The Water Saint is character who could be annoying to some with how whiny she is. I believe she\'s cute and a great antagonist for both the Dragon and Lingzhi. Her backstory is the best and most developed, illuminating why she is the way she is. While these three are the most important, the supporting characters are just as fun and entertaining albeit not memorable. You\'re meant to have light hearted fun and not morally grey, complex characters.Neither the animation or sound are notable so I\'ll lump them together. The art style is generic and plain. There aren\'t any unique locations or elaborate character designs. The characters visit cave, town, river, and forest looking like swordswoman, Dragon, and noble wizard. The music isn\'t remarkable either. The openings and endings are mid in both languages. The score matches the scene and that\'s about it. I watched the series in Chinese as I preferred the original sub to the Japanese dub. The voice actors were fine in both but the Japanese dub felt slightly off to me. The Herbivore Dragon has the most dynamic vocal range and his Chinese voice actor did a pretty good job. Otherwise there was nobody of note.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this series. It\'s brainless fun and only half the commitment of a normal length anime with a fun cast of characters. This definitely isn\'t a must watch, but I\'m happy with it being my first donghua. If you like fantasy but don\'t want to rack your brain trying to keep up with a complicated plot, then give it a go. My suggestion is to watch it in the original sub, not Japanese.Plot: 7/10Characters: 8/10Art: 6/10Sound: 6/10Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 7.0/10 named Lingzhi arrives at the Herbivorous Dragon\'s cave demanding to be sacrificed to him.

Well, arguably you could say he\'s cute too, but our other main character Reiko really carries this show. In a strange twisted way, it reminds me of Pete\'s Dragon, but in some sort of Japanese-manga Chinese-adapted animation point of view with a seemingly complete inverted take of the childhood beloved story of Pete\'s Dragon (or one similar as I cannot recall exactly...). Because in this cute series, our MC Reiko was offered as a sacrifice from her own village to go to and request the ""Evil Dragon"" to revolt against the current Demon Lord.1)...Animation. Is. CLEAN. Surprise, surprise. It\'s 2022 and a lot of animation getting put out there aren\'t often to the standard some would expect, in such cases due to valid reasons... however. This anime seems to be as crisp as it can get on a high-res monitor. Just that alongside the nice character designs makes it a chill anime to put to the back-burner on many people\'s lists.2) The VAs... are surprisingly good. I don\'t know squat about Chinese, but hey it sounds nice, particularly in this anime. Admittedly I still find it hard as such language quite soft on VA males, but hey, that\'s just me. It\'s sounds more expressive than most Chinese VAs I have heard in Chinese-adapted animations. And the kids, sound like actual kids! Even Western animations fail at that, hard to find an animated character nowadays that sounds proper, you know, since they hire adults to imitate such. Not that they hired kids for this... I think. But regardless, they pulled it off! I could understand however why one may dismiss this series simply because of the Chinese language, especially since the light novel source was in Japanese... but I personally find it very fitting in this one.In terms of cons, it is too soon to tell. And if any, these are pretty subjective to the individual, so take it with a grain of salt.1? I have not read the light novel, and I\'m only 3 episodes in, but I feel I could pretty much predict the following episodes to come. I have the sense the story will have a very simple trajectory with some mild bumps along the way.2? The comedy is well, alright I suppose. Some did not land the punch for me, but if we\'re being frank, one would not likely have clicked on this show expecting some humorous takes. Or attempts that is. But I will say, it will likely falter to cuteness if you didn\'t get the punchline or such. That is its safeguard.Uhh. So yea. It\'s cute. It\'s kawaii but like, in Chinese, so.... kě\'ài de? Honestly, I hate Chinese, and China. But you get the point. 6/10. And that\'s a pretty high score in my books, especially for this wholesome-chill genre with no hard-core substantial plot.

Maburaho,https://myanimelist.net/anime/193/Maburaho,"[""Hmmm, as I sit down to write this review, I notice that a lot of other viewers say that this anime is un-original, simple, and all together a decent but under achieving anime. I don't see it that way however, for I think Maburaho embodies exactly what a harem - ecchi anime should be. Now as far as harem animes go, you have over a million and one to choose from, but I think that Maburaho is the one that perfected the formula, the one that got everything just right.Now, people will complain that the story is simple and rather un-original, but what did you...expect. When I watch a harem anime, I expect pure unbridled comedy, not some deep fulfilling story, it'd be like going into a Home Depot and expecting to find a sales associate, it just isn't there!! Anyways... the plot is simple but effective, a boy happens to inherit the genes of some of the strongest wizards in the world, and while he is rather pathetic in that he can only cast 7 spells in his life time, he will apparently give birth to the potentially strongest wizard ever. As such, 3 daughters from 3 prestigious families decide that the best thing to do would be to bear his child. Now... if you can't read that and at least get a little bit of a chuckle (even if it is while you roll your eyes at the sheer stupidity of it), then there is something seriously wrong with you. Its simple, but exactly what the situation calls for and fits the harem perspective perfectly.The characters are also in play, and also work well for the story. Kazuki, our hero, is the epitome of harem leads, in that hes pathetic, stupid, but extremely nice. Its not all bad for him though, as he actually has some deus ex machina powers at his disposal. You see, while he can only cast a spell 7 times, the spells happen to be freaking powerful, and if he willed it, he could destroy the earth 7 times over. But nobody cares, because you watch a Harem anime for the girls, and thus we have Rin, Yuuna, and Kuriko. All somewhat cliched but still powerful characters in their own right, Yuuna (the main) is the only one who is originally in love with Kazuki, and is nice and cutesy, but has a strong jealous side to her. Kuriko's next, and shes the sex appeal girl, with the perfect figure, who at first just wants to get in Kazuki's pants to have his baby, but later figures out she actually kinda likes him... and still wants his baby. Finally, Rin, the sword wielding angry girl, who's absolutely terrible at being a woman, and tries her best to appeal to Kazuki without ripping off his face. Each character slowly but surely will grow on you, and have some of the funniest moments in anime history. And as far as harems go... they actually have some pretty decent growth to them. Most've the growth is just accepting that they love him, but still its not bad.Finally I'm gonna add a end note here before I rap this thing up and say that humor is the main reason to watch maburaho. People seem to find the boring plot a turn off for this series, but really, if thats what turns you off the series, then your watching it wrong! You don't watch Death Note for the humor, you watch it for the epic mystry, the battle between L and Kira as the best each other at ever corner. You don't watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann for the girls (well maybe you do... but you shouldn't), you watch it to get hyped up at how great it is to be a man with manly things to do! So the whole reason you should be watching Maburaho, is so that you can enjoy a fabulous cavalcade of humor. In fact, ill go as far as to say that Maburaho, while not being the funniest anime ever, has the funniest episode of an anime ever. And that is episode 18. Many people will argue with me on that but no other has ever made me laugh so hard.As a harem, I will always consider Maburaho to be one of the, if not THE, best there is. I'll recommend this series for all its worth, and say at least give it a chance to surprise you. expect.

It is good animation for the type of genre it is. You wouldn't want to see Death Note drawn like Maburaho and Maburaho like Death Note would you? It would completely ruin the atmosphere.Sound:The soundtrack is good, nothing outstanding but short of great. Character voices are good as usual, fits the characters perfect....Character:What can I say, I'm a sucker for a person with hidden powers, and when the time comes completely owns. The main character is great, another loser with hidden powers is always a plus. All the girls are like any other harem anime, all different personality's, oh look... There's another girl with a sword...Why did I like this anime?The story wasn't great, but the feeling and the characters themselves make up for it. It is a good breather type anime between series. Hidden power guys surrounded by beautiful girls has it's charms. Anyways this anime gives off a good feeling and that makes up for all it's cons. Why all the characters in the op song but not in the anime? Because the production crew only wanted to focus on the relationship between the main character and all the girls, if you want more substance go read the manga.

It was just bad. I don&rsquo;t even know why it was in AnimeNfo&rsquo;s top 194.The story had its highs and lows. Its highs were average, and its lows were really bad &ndash; catch my drift? Most of the time it was almost unbearable to watch, and there were episodes that almost got me (Just the ones with Rin and Yamase in it) but still came up short. In a word, disappointing. It was bad execution all over again &ndash; the concept was almost acceptable, but the concept was disappeared along the series to who knows where...(Specially during the second half of the show). The realm of bad execution, maybe. It ended up to be a set of really shallow topics. Speaking of end, that was a really bad last episode. It was surprising, sure. No one expected it would end up that way, but the last episode made you go &ldquo;What the f*ck was that? Where did you get that idea?&rdquo;Huge cast of characters? Yeah right. Most of the characters that were shown in the opening theme, roughly 80-85%, didn&rsquo;t even have a speaking role. They had distinct looks, but I never got their name. What was the name of the girl with the glasses, or the guy wearing the Simon Cowell tank top who was flexing? No one will ever know. If the characters didn&rsquo;t speak, they were either useless (like that manager/caretaker person looking all goth-like) or irritating &ndash; specially Yuuna, who did nothing but be jealous and stupid. That Nakamaru guy was equally irritating. He was just insecure and jealous &ndash; of Kazuki, a loser with an irritating voice (By the way, I wanna take note of the bad voice acting. It&rsquo;s just bad, and nothing more can be said about it.) and is just as insecure of himself.The drawing style was good, but something is wrong with it. Can&rsquo;t point out what exactly, but I think there was nothing exciting or new about it. I did notice that the characters heads were bigger than their bodies. Although this is acceptable in anime, I prefer it that the anime characters I watch have proportions that are at least a little close to reality. Everything was just blown out of proportion, specially Kuriko&rsquo;s boobs.Music was ok, but still sub par. Most of the time, I found myself recognizing similarities of Maburaho&rsquo;s music with other series, or other songs in general. For example, the opening song sounds a lot like the third opening of Yakitate!! Japan &ndash; in fact, my brother noticed this too. Then there was this BGM that sounded a lot like lady marmalade. It was used more in the second half of the series, usually in the scenes with Kuriko in it.And now for the part that I hated the most &ndash; the fan service. It was just too all out &ndash; literally, thanks to Kuriko and the other girls unnecessary showing of skin. Maybe I didn&rsquo;t like it too much because I&rsquo;m a girl, but really. Are guys willing to overlook the lack of substance to the stories just so they can ogle at genitals &ndash; lacking bodies? Men..I can&rsquo;t believe J.C.

Yep, its an""ecchi harem anime"". It stays basic, but is still enjoyable.Story: 6/10Well there really isn’t an actual plot going on per-say, it simply revolves around this boy named Kazuki, who has magic that is far beyond anyone else’s. (yeah, its a place where everyone knows magic) Only problem is--he can only use it a limited amount of times. (8 to be precise) So upon hearing this, three female students hear about this and decide to make him their lover, for the sol...reason of having his genes. Well technically not all of them, but a majority of them do. A girl named Yuna however, is the exception. It turns out the this young man made a promise to a female friend of his at a young age, and guess who that little girl is? Hehehe, yup its Yuna. Now I know at this point your probably saying to yourself:  Wow, I have seen this before a million times! And in all honesty you would be correct, Maburaho is nothing new at all to the whole ""harem"" franchise. As the whole story is really not going anywhere with a particular goal in mind, its simply set to see which one of the girls will walk away as Kazuki’s wife. Surprisingly though there are a few plot surprises that take place, as well as new characters that are introduced past the half way point. One thing I found odd though, is that they show a ton of characters at the opening of the anime, yet you never even get to know 75% of them. Heck some are there for only an episode or two. But since this is in fact a echhi harem title, you aren’t technically watching this for any kind involving story. The ending to this is pretty good--though a bit on the weird side. I won’t say what it is so as not to spoil it, but it just seemed a bit odd to me. Still, given the act that many anime titles out there NEVER really conclude, its nice to have one that at least tried. My only other gripe with the storyline was, it tended to drag on a bit towards the end.Artwork: 7/10Maburaho is a pretty darn colorful title, it has some nice character design, even if it is a wee bit basic as far as style goes. The backgrounds though (especially in the foliage areas) seemed to be a bit bland and not very well detailed as the characters. The girls cast magic spells that can be pretty fund to look at. But Maburaho’s greatest asset in this area is its colorful artwork!Soundtrack: 6/10The opening to this anime is so fun to listen to that I downloaded it for my ipod, the ending is also nice, its much more suttle than the high pitched opening, but does add good variety to the mix. I watched both the sub and dub to this, and must say that the dub is awesome, I think ADV really went out to find the appropriate voice actor. With the exception of Kazuki, his voice sounded a bit to old for his character. Either form is pleasant to watch it in.Characters: 8/10The characters were probably the best part of the anime, while some came off more as a cliche depending on your view point. I couldn’t find one that I didn’t like. I especially loved Yuna, she was so sweet and caring--yet definitely had a jealous streak as well! Nobody as comes off as annoying and just seem to mix well with the title. Plus their personalities are quite varied, so you never have to worry about seeing a character’s persona that is recycled.Bottom Line: 7/10Had Maburaho actually done something different with its ""harem"" formula, I probably would have given it a higher score, as it did tend to start dragging on near the end. Perhaps if this anime would have only been half as long, would it have been more memorable. Still, Maburaho is a good choice if you like harem titles, just so long as you keep in mind that its formula stays pretty basic throughout. Yet still remains fun to watch regardless. reason of having his genes. Well technically not all of them, but a majority of them do. A girl named Yuna however, is the exception.

Still, given the act that many anime titles out there NEVER really conclude, its nice to have one that at least tried. My only other gripe with the storyline was, it tended to drag on a bit towards the end.Artwork: 7/10Maburaho is a pretty darn colorful title, it has some nice character design, even if it is a wee bit basic as far as style goes. The backgrounds though (especially in the foliage areas) seemed to be a bit bland and not very well detailed as the characters. The girls cast magic spells that can be pretty fund to look at. But Maburaho’s greatest asset in this area is its colorful artwork!Soundtrack: 6/10The opening to this anime is so fun to listen to that I downloaded it for my ipod, the ending is also nice, its much more suttle than the high pitched opening, but does add good variety to the mix. I watched both the sub and dub to this, and must say that the dub is awesome, I think ADV really went out to find the appropriate voice actor. With the exception of Kazuki, his voice sounded a bit to old for his character. Either form is pleasant to watch it in.Characters: 8/10The characters were probably the best part of the anime, while some came off more as a cliche depending on your view point. I couldn’t find one that I didn’t like. I especially loved Yuna, she was so sweet and caring--yet definitely had a jealous streak as well! Nobody as comes off as annoying and just seem to mix well with the title. Plus their personalities are quite varied, so you never have to worry about seeing a character’s persona that is recycled.Bottom Line: 7/10Had Maburaho actually done something different with its ""harem"" formula, I probably would have given it a higher score, as it did tend to start dragging on near the end. Perhaps if this anime would have only been half as long, would it have been more memorable. Still, Maburaho is a good choice if you like harem titles, just so long as you keep in mind that its formula stays pretty basic throughout. Yet still remains fun to watch regardless.', 'Ok, ok, so now I\'ve just completed watching this classic (since it was released in 2003), time for me to make my review, take note that I\'m yet to read its manga, so my review is only for this anime. So, let\'s get down to business:Story- fair 6.Ok, so this is your typical comedy, set in the school, with magic and a ghost, but this anime is focus on the harem and its comedy revolves around it. However this is one harem that can be considered as a ""TRUE HAREM,"" because unlike other harem this one has all parties having feelings for the muchacho (male...lead) and the muchacho also has feelings for his harem as well, but there is still the typical “who should I pick” thing that any harem genre has.  Another thing about it is that the muchacho (male lead) was able to provide a compromise (sort of) for his chiquitas (female leads) in the end so that none of them (chiquitas) would have any hard feelings for him……..sort of. So, what’s with the rating? Ok, since the comedy thing is only focus on the harem, it is most the funnies part of this anime, the rest of the funny stuff……well not much, though the ecchi part is what makes up for the most common funny part.Art- Mediocre 5.Not much for me to say since, it is not unusual that there is some familiarity with the same art as I found in other animes. However, I don’t see the illustrator giving Yuna a broom stick or having angel wings when she’s levitating in mid air except in the openings, and same goes for the rest of the cast who were also flying.Sound-Mediocre 5.Nothing much here for me to comment. But I do like the opening theme.Characters – Good 7.Well, the role that the characters played really does match up and I feel like wanting to mentioned it:Yuna Miyama – They way she was drawn really match up as a fateful housewife material for the muchacho (Kazuki Shikimori), I like the way in which she takes possession of her so called husband (Kazuki) and protect him not only from her competition but from himself as well (I’m referring to the muchacho). Also, I kind like that she’s portrayed as someone with matching beauty, brains and devotion to family, but she also has a side which one should be aware that she’s not to be trifle with, especially when it involves her so called husband Kazuki.Katzetsubaki Kuriko – This girl has it all, beauty, wits, wealth, influence and born into a family of privilege, at first one might think that she’s the antagonist in this anime, but as this anime goes on, one would find out that she not really a bad girl after all, but she’s still a tease and she’s still after the muchacho’s genes and wouldn’t hesitate to pop the muchacho’s cherries anytime provided that Yuna’s Kazuki Radar won’t get in her way of being alone with the muchacho.Rin Kamishiro – As mentioned in MAL’s info, she brought up in an uptight clan tradition were it disgust her, initially she doesn’t want anything to do with the muchacho, but as orders from her clan she has no choice but to comply, actually killing the muchacho is what she sees as her way out. But as usual in a harem genre, she a tsundere who later on warms up to the muchacho and even competes with everyone else for his affection.Yamase Chihaya – Well, we all know as to what happens to a childhood friends, they get push on the sides, in fact I like that way which she was introduced and the timing she appears in this anime, then again, if not then there’s gonna be a 4 way with the muchacho instead of just a 3 way.As for the rest: I just feel like adding them.Sayumi Morisaki, Kazumi Matsuda and class 2B gang boss Yukihiko Nakamaru are just merely additives that makes up for the comic part of this anime.Also:Kaori Iba and Dr. Akai Haruaki, well I guess we can say that they are friends with benefits.There are also the 2 MILF’s, Shino Akai who also desires to have Kazuki and the dorm manager Karei Hirosaki who does some subtle flirting with the mucahcho.Enjoyment and Overall- Good 7.Well, I guess I’ll just simplify it by saying that this anime, though maybe a bit lame is generally all good. lead) and the muchacho also has feelings for his harem as well, but there is still the typical “who should I pick” thing that any harem genre has.

Staff?The story was partially decent leading up to the first arc if you want to call it such; then comes episode thirteen onwards... just a highway disaster.It would have been a rather touching anime worth at least a 6 or 7 overall if they had left it to end at the mid point.Kazuki went out of his way to gain some manly points with how carefree he sacrificed his limited amount of magical usage on the 4 girls he cared for and loved.Time for...he characters themselves with Kazuki proving to be, at the start of the series, the kind of male protagonist that is a stable point for any harem anime. Kind, dense and easily agitated by situations which might not be to his liking.Moving onto the female cast relies purely on how you prefer your stereotypes; all I can state here.There is nothing to say about the audio as nothing much appealed to me here or even left me with a, ""Oh, this is unique?"" feeling at all.The series itself with the conclusion of the 24th episode earns it:3/10. he characters themselves with Kazuki proving to be, at the start of the series, the kind of male protagonist that is a stable point for any harem anime.

Not everyone’s magic is equal. Everyone has a set number of times that he or she can use their magic. Most normal people can to use magic around hundred times or so, while others can use their magic several thousand times. A person's social status is determined by how many times you are able to use magic. If however you use up all your magic, your body turns to ash and is scattered in the wind. Kazuki however is different from most because his magic count is less than 10. Then one day...three girls Kuriko Kazetsubaki, Yuna Miyama, and Rin Kamishiro show up all wanting one thing...his genes. Although he himself has very little magic it is believed that his genes will one produce the greatest magic user of all time. Though they all want his genes only Yuna proclaims to be his wife after a childhood promise of marriage.Story & Characters (8/10)Okay, I have to start off by saying that although I'm giving the story an 8 only, I still think that it's an extremely well done and fleshed out storyline, considering that they only had such a limited number of episodes to work with. The fact that this isn't just your typical harem anime is quite nice. And the use of magic is what adds a touch of spice to the overall story. Things start off a little slow, with Kazuki needing some time to warm up to the girls presence (ha, wouldn't we all?) but then just as things are getting a little repetitive the show turns out a twist at the end of episode 12 that gives the series a fresh plot to contend with in a lot of ways. Most of the relationships, like the 3 main girls to both each other and Kazuki are fleshed out rather well, but some things that I thought would be explored further weren't and those incidents left me really wanting something more. For example in episode 4 the question of just who summoned the behemoth's is never answered, they were just used as a plot point to allow Kuriko to start to realize that Kazuki might just be worth something more than his genes after all. The same thing happens with the magic virus in episode 11, which I really would have liked to see more elaboration on. As well as the back story that the groundskeeper and Akai's sister. Of course while it would have been nice to see those potential sub-plots delved into a little more throughly, but with only 24 episodes I still think they did quite a good job of making the fullest of what they wanted to.Art (9/10)In my opinion it is both here and in the sound department that Maburaho really shines through. From the get go the artistic style and character animation fit the genre to a tee, and the happy go lucky sense that the series is going for is really boosted by the colourful, charming artwork that is abundant in the world of Maburaho. The magic use, while not the main point often, is still particularly well done. I especially like the touch of each of the main characters having there own style of magical flavour. Kazuki is often snow-related it seems (at least in some cases). Yuuna always has those little sprites helping her out, Kuriko always uses charms (man is that open for a pun of what?) and Rin mostly channels magic through her trusty sword. It is touches like these that help bring up the art level to what has to be one of the best in the genre, if not the best. If I had to have one complaint it would be that sometimes the backgrounds can be a little bland, but the background should never overpower the characters or action, so that can be easily forgiven. Everything else is top notch!Sound (10/10)The sound is yet another high quality work that Maburaho has to offer. From the cheerful and spunky opening, to the various chimes and jingles that accompany the magic effects and facial expressions of the characters, to the way Kazuki often sounds like a chicken when surprised, trust me he tends to squak a lot in oddly intimate situations..., the sound is done masterfully and is never too overpowering or underwhelming. The voice work is especially well done, with all the girls voices fitting their personalities to a tee, and the supporting case is done just as well, from the sleepy headed Iba-Sensai, to the somewhat melancholy Akai, to the always upbeat groundskeeper, all the voices add depth and style to the characters that they accompany. There might not be much else to say, because in my opinion it's all so well done. Even the voices of some of the summoned beasts fit nicely into the motif, although granted they don't show up too often, still it is the little touches that really help a series like this, and Maburaho hits all of them right on the mark.Overall (9/10)The presentation of Maburaho is an extremely well put together, solid work that is a great addition to the harem anime genre. From the artwork, to the music, to the overall plot, everything comes together in a way that few animes can bring it to bare. Also the fact that the characters grow on you, despite being a little on the stereotypical side, is a great testament to the enjoyability of the series. By the end most everyone has a favourite girl, whether it be the spunky Yuuna, the voluptous and over the top Kuriko, the quiet and conserved Rin, or the girl next door Yamase who shows up from time to time. Also, Kazuki uses the average guy who's quietly amazing design very well. Other good touches include such things as Yuuna getting more jealous after the events of episode 12 despite Kazuki's condition, because she realizes that the other girls are actually warming up to Kazuki and aren't just looking for his genes anymore. These sorts of things are what make the series fun to watch, and entertaining for more than one viewing. The last point is that the show doesn't ever get to bogged down or full of itself not to enjoy, the viewer always knows what's going on, and even through the twists they can easily keep pace and continue to enjoy the anime in every regard. I myself have watched the series 4 times in total, and will probably watch it more in the future. It's the kind of happy go lucky anime that can be just the thing after a hard days work. So I would recommend this anime to anyone in my book.Well, thanks for taking the time to read this review, I hope it was okay. But as long as it was helpful than that's good enough for me. Peace! three girls Kuriko Kazetsubaki, Yuna Miyama, and Rin Kamishiro show up all wanting one thing...his genes.

You\'re so indecisive.I start it off like this because if you\'re looking for a harem that goes against the grain and has a distinct, ""I choose [insert girl\'s name here],"" you\'ll be sadly disappointed with this anime. It sticks to the generic harem formula, deviating here and there, but ultimately, it comes out the same product.Story: 7For me, harems\' storylines must be alike and different. This one was an average mix of those two. It pleased me, but didn\'t wow me. I enjoyed the story much more than I thought it would, and I have to say, Yuna\'s over the top...reactions to anything involving Kazuki and any of the other girls later in the story was pretty funny.Read more about the story if you\'re interested in it. But, I will say this: the genes premise is a good way to start it off and I\'ll think most of you who decide to watch this series will be happy when it begins to take a backseat to the girls\' feelings.Art: 6Made a little while ago, so don\'t expect anything mind-blowing.Sound: 8I really liked the voice acting in this one.

Simply, in a world where people can cast spells a certain number of times, Kazuki Shikimori, has a very low count a considers himself worthless. This is until he becomes the target of an unwanted harem when it is revealed to his class, that he has some impressive magical genes. Going in, you get what you asked for. A harem series set in a magical world. At the time, I didn't expect much but now that I had some time to think, I realized a lot of...potential was lost in the making of this series. First of all, the magical world; I believe this is the first time (outside of games with mp) where I've seen magic being in a set number. It wasn't much, but it would have been interesting to see them go into depth about it. Secondly, there's a few character stories that could have been used to show the political side of the world. We will get to that later.Art:Of the things that haven't changed about my opinion of maburaho, the art is one of them. It is nothing special. It does not stand out as breath taking, but it's easy to look at.Sound:The same can be said about the sound. Maburaho's opening theme for one was very enjoyable when I first heard it. So was the slight musical notes played when one of the female characters appeared. A different tune for the three girls of choice. It's not an original touch but an enjoyable one nonetheless.Character:Now to get back to the bad. Maburaho is a harem series with opening video that just doesn't belong. Even during my original viewing of the should, I stared in awe at the reel of characters shown and wondered how they'd be integrated into the story. This left me solely disappointed because they were more background noise than anything. Out of the twenty something characters you see, less than ten of them play major roles. As for the main cast, thinking back, I feel that some of the stories shouldn't have been played for romance. While the love developing wasn't bad, Kuriko's business associated story had some grand attention, and would have worked perfectly as a sort of battle arc. Rin's story, while not getting as much attention as Kuriko, could have worked epically in a drama sort of sense. This is a harem though, and while there are battles in this one, they aren't as great as the aforementioned ones could be, and comedy is valued more than drama.Enjoyment:I gave it an eight because I enjoyed it for what it was. Maburaho was a harem and going in understanding that, you will not be disappointed. Of the anime genres, harem is one of the more generic ones, but maburaho slightly averts this by implementing it's magical elements.Overall:Despite my altered opinion of the series, Maburaho is what it is. If you don't think much about the perfectly good plot that was wasted, you will likely enjoy this series. potential was lost in the making of this series. First of all, the magical world; I believe this is the first time (outside of games with mp) where I've seen magic being in a set number. It wasn't much, but it would have been interesting to see them go into depth about it. Secondly, there's a few character stories that could have been used to show the political side of the world. We will get to that later.Art:Of the things that haven't changed about my opinion of maburaho, the art is one of them. It is nothing special. It does not stand out as breath taking, but it's easy to look at.Sound:The same can be said about the sound. Maburaho's opening theme for one was very enjoyable when I first heard it. So was the slight musical notes played when one of the female characters appeared. A different tune for the three girls of choice. It's not an original touch but an enjoyable one nonetheless.Character:Now to get back to the bad. Maburaho is a harem series with opening video that just doesn't belong. Even during my original viewing of the should, I stared in awe at the reel of characters shown and wondered how they'd be integrated into the story. This left me solely disappointed because they were more background noise than anything. Out of the twenty something characters you see, less than ten of them play major roles. As for the main cast, thinking back, I feel that some of the stories shouldn't have been played for romance. While the love developing wasn't bad, Kuriko's business associated story had some grand attention, and would have worked perfectly as a sort of battle arc. Rin's story, while not getting as much attention as Kuriko, could have worked epically in a drama sort of sense. This is a harem though, and while there are battles in this one, they aren't as great as the aforementioned ones could be, and comedy is valued more than drama.Enjoyment:I gave it an eight because I enjoyed it for what it was. Maburaho was a harem and going in understanding that, you will not be disappointed. Of the anime genres, harem is one of the more generic ones, but maburaho slightly averts this by implementing it's magical elements.Overall:Despite my altered opinion of the series, Maburaho is what it is. If you don't think much about the perfectly good plot that was wasted, you will likely enjoy this series."", ""~ Review ~Anime InformationAnime Production : J.C.StaffDirector: Shinichiro KimuraEpisodes: 24 episodesGenres: Comedy, Drama, Ecchi, Magic, Romance, School, HaremDuration: 24 min. per episodeOriginal Run: October 14, 2003 - April 6, 2004...Synopsis:Kazuki Shikimori is a 17 years old student who attends Aoi Academy, a prestigious school for elite magician. In this world full of magic, each magician has a set limit of spells, and performing more spells than the limit allows will cause the user to turn into dust. Thus normally for many people, their set limit of spells are about around hundreds or thousands but for Kazuki Shikimori, he's got to be the unluckiest guys around. In this case, the number of magic Kazuki can use is far below the average in his school. Then one day, a huge twist of fate come. all of a sudden, three girls: Yuuna Miyama, Kuriko Kazetsubaki and Rin Kamishiro, appear before him. But of all the things that they are after, it is his genes. Why? And for Kazuki, the girls’ appearances may also spell his doom, as he soon realizes that his magic count is decreasing ever steadily due to the fact that he can’t resist using magic to help them. Is it really doom for Kazuki or maybe not?Storyline: [8/10]This is quite a straight forward anime from first episode to middle episode. Well I like an anime with suitable and considerable amount of plot, not always into the main plot but also not many diversion plot from the main plot. I will only touch a sneakpeak of the synopsis but, from the first episode, you will find out about the world and what the story main theme is. It is world of magic thus doing something with magic is regular to use. This a world with a ton of possibilities can be happen.Interesting point is about Kazuki Shikimori's very, very, very low set of spells. Wonder if you became one-of-a-kind person with a limited use of magic spells and you surrounded by many people who can use many magic spells? How do use your limited magic in your life? How do you run your life knowing that your usage of your limited set of magic is as same as decreasing your lifespan?I personally think this is one of my favorite anime because it has a good storyline, great drama and strong main plot and. Not many anime have a great storyline, great drama and strong main plot especially ecchi and harem type. You will get that feeling if you watch through all episodes.As I stated before this is a world of magic where a ton of possibilities can be happen. Frankly this is a world full of miracle. This anime have great main theme and many room to expand and develop into many season.Art: [7/10]Each female character from main character through supporting character have their own characteristic and trademark that makes them become so alluring and eye-catchy. Yuuna with pink hair, Kuriko with blonde hair and huge boobs, Rin with purple hair with a unique miko dress and always carry a sword, and Yamase with brown chocolate hair.Despite all of that, for me this anime didn't give much unique characteristic for male character and focusing only to female character. Supporting character didn't leave a strong impression for my eyes but then again, they have a cute and funny facial expression which can make me laugh and that is a good one.For an anime who release in 2003, this is a good art anime in his time.Sound: [8/10]This anime have a good OST and BGM. I find it fit with certain situation in anime.

It was incredibly entertaining and just loads of fun.  Its as simple as that.This is one of those rare little gems that made me laugh a lot.  There\'s a lot of ecchi, but personally im okay with that.  I mean theres a guy surrounded by a bunch of different girls, so what do you expect? Im not a pervert or anything, but if i was in his situation...this anime would probably have played out the same or a little more to my liking ;).The story is pretty good and is interesting and keeps you occupied, but i loved this for the laughs.  You have your typical pussy of guy as your male lead and some hella hot babes that are outgoing and want his ""genes"" and will do anything for them. Also did i mention that there was magic and i dont mean the bed room kind, but theres a lot of that too.If you dont like a little ecchi and that description that i just got, then you shouldn\'t watch this, but your going to be missing out on some laughs and a really enjoyable anime. this anime would probably have played out the same or a little more to my liking ;).The story is pretty good and is interesting and keeps you occupied, but i loved this for the laughs.

Shikimori Kazuki, a 17-year-old boy, attends a school for elite magicians. However, due to his physique, test scores, and various other things, girls walk right on past him.However, out of the blue, he is &quot;attacked&quot; by three beautiful girls: Kuriko, Rin, and Yuuna.But, they're really only after one thing: his genes (you heard it guys, they wanna *bleep* him =O ).Aside from making the whole male population at the school jealous...and angry, Kazuki has to somehow live his normal life without using magic!If that's so, why do they want his genes?In the anime, everyone has a certain number of times they can use magic before POOF, they turn into dust!The numbers are usually in the thousands, tens of thousands, etc.How many times can Kazuki use magic? 8.Then... why are those three girls so determined to make a baby with Kazuki? It's because of his lineage. He derives from great and ancient magicians.While HE may not be super-powerful (...which he is *cough/spoiler*), his child certainly will be, and with high-ranking, industrial families having at it, who DOESN'T want a super-strong heir?The only reason I docked the story by 1 point was the simple fact that there were a few fillers and a story that was a little drawn-out...Art - (8/10)While the art was like that of any other anime, it has a personal touch that I found quite amusing and played pretty-pretty colors with my eyes (no... seriously, near the end... the colors... *drools*).Sound - (7/10)The sound was... *sigh* let's face it, like every other anime in terms of the amount of originality (...wait for it... wait for it!~...), which means it didn't have anything NEW, but it didn't fail in terms of the quality in which it was displayed.Character - (9/10)The characters were great, I loved Kazuki throughout the entire anime, and there were a few others I was fond of, as well.But, like any romance anime, the 3 types of girls were almost boring and way too typical: busty ego girl, determined childhood lover/promise made girl, and arrogant and too-tough-to-admit-to-love girl.The only thing that saved the character development of those three was Kazuki and how he responded to each of them (yes, that means differently than in most animes).Enjoyment - (10/10)This series was actually quite a tear-jerker near the middle and end. I fell in love with the anime the moment that the series took a twist towards the... &quot;disappearance&quot; of one character (wonder who? watch the anime!).Overall, I had to give this anime a 9/10, and if you don't watch it - to put it simply - you're missing out. and angry, Kazuki has to somehow live his normal life without using magic!If that's so, why do they want his genes?In the anime, everyone has a certain number of times they can use magic before POOF, they turn into dust!The numbers are usually in the thousands, tens of thousands, etc.How many times can Kazuki use magic? 8.Then... why are those three girls so determined to make a baby with Kazuki?

I expected all that; I picked this series to watch solely for the mindless fan service and comedy it appears to offer.There is as much ecchi in this show service as in Naruto. Instead of focusing on girls and ecchi moments, this show leans towards interaction of characters and plot. This would not be so bad if the plot is not paper thin, instead it causes moments to feel stretched, and repetitive.

I had such high hopes for this anime, until the 12th episode that is. When they killed off the MC and made him into a ghost was when this anime died for me. After that he was basically a side character. Most if not all of the characters in the anime were just awful people being far too greedy in terms of money and lust. The highest i'd rate this anime would be a 4/10 because anything higher than that would just be a lie. The writing this anime had was just horrible and the direction...it took after episode 12 was just sad. Throughout the anime all i really felt for the MC was just pity.

This is a great if you like light romantic comedies in anime. I like this ""harem"" style anime because of the humor. There were little sentimental moments as well shared between the main character Kazuki Shikimori, and main three female characters (Yuna Miyama, Kuriko Kazetsubaki, Rin Kamishiro), so it\'s not all chasing after a male. The ending was a lil whack for me and seemed a lil rush as if it was made just to end the series, I was hoping for something...better and more romantic. better and more romantic.', 'I just finished this one last week. In short I felt this story had potential, and had great moments, but by the end just fell short of what it could\'ve been.Story (6):The story is decent. Basically it takes place in a world where everyone can do magic, but everyone has a different amount of spells they can perform in their lifetime. Once someone uses up all their magic, they turn to ash.The main character Kazuki only has eight spells, but because his children may be the most powerful magicians in the world, the three main girls (along with a fourth) all desire him.I do like...that the harem element does have a logical reason for why these girls are interested in him. That sets this apart from others in the genre by giving these characters a reason. Of course over the series all four of them fall in love with him (although Yuna loved him from the very beginning).The story of this anime is broken into two halves. The first half follows Kazuki\'s growing relationships with these girls, and how he uses his magic to overcome obstacles, despite the females begging him not to as he only has a small number left.I enjoyed the first half of this anime quite a bit. I was intrigued by what conflict that episode would concern, and how they would overcome it. Sometimes there were even good twists to how the problem was solved, such as the episode with the tree.However, I feel that the second half of this anime is not as interesting, and drags on for quite some time. I can\'t explain in detail without revealing a huge spoiler. Nonetheless, there are some good episodes in this half, such as the one where Kazuki accompanies Kuriko to her party, or the episode that focuses on Rin\'s relationship with her brother. But overall it\'s not as enjoyable as the first half.Finally, the ending. The last two episodes had great drama. Both characters involved in the conflict had their reasons for their choices, and I was excited to see how the issue would be fixed. However, I feel that the build up led to a let down. I found the overall conclusion to be disappointing.Characters (6):To begin with Kazuki is pretty much your average harem male lead. He\'s kind and sacrifices to make others happy, while letting the girls in his life treat him however they want. He\'s likable, but there were times I wished he had been more outspoken about his resentment for the way the girls treated him.Next is Yuna. She is the girl who truly loves Kazuki and not just the high possibility that he will produce powerful children. In the first half of the anime this is the girl I rooted for. She was very likable and was the most compatible with Kazuki. However, by the second half she had a huge personality change. Suddenly (and without explanation) she became super jealous, possessive, and just annoying to watch. By the end of the anime, I found Yuna to be one of the most annoying anime characters ever.Now onto Kuriko. This is the rich, handsy girl who initially was interested in only Kazuki\'s genes. The exact opposite of what happened with Yuna, happened to Kuriko. In the beginning Kuriko was my least favorite, but by the end she had become my favorite character in the anime. Yes, she is full of herself and demanding, but she\'s also very compassionate as seen mostly in her motherly relationship with the ghost child Elizabeth. In my opinion, she had the most development in the series.The third girl Rin is likable from beginning to end.Shino-the main antagonist of the second half is interesting. She was the only intriguing part of the second half. I like the mystery surrounding her, and her motives make sense.I also like the side characters of Dr. Akai, Elizabeth (the little ghost girl), Karei, and Chiyaha. However, Kazuki\'s other classmates are extremely annoying, and are given way more screen time than they need. Half the time their inclusion isn\'t even relevant to the plot.There are hits and misses when it comes to the characters.Art (7):The art is decent. I like the character designs. All the characters have their own distinct look. I really do like the design of the female school uniforms. I honestly believe the uniforms in this anime is among the prettiest school uniforms in anime.The animation is decent. There are a lot of pretty bright colors. I especially like the way that the action scenes are done.In all the art of this anime looks good.Sound (9):Now onto my favorite part of this anime-the soundtrack. Maburaho has some good songs. I especially love the calm and lovely ending theme. The opening theme is upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.In addition some of the instrumental scores are so pretty-I enjoy listening to them on their own, as they are calming. Especially the one ""Snow Falls,"" it\'s just a pretty piano piece.I watched the English dub of this anime, so I can\'t say anything on the original voice acting. I think the voice acting in the dub is decent.Enjoyment (7):I did enjoy the first half of this anime. Even the second half had its memorable episodes. In all I was pleased with this one. While the second half did lag, I never felt frustrated. It is definitely worth a watch.Conclusion (6):The story is decent. There is an actual reason for the harem elements. Some of the characters are likable, and others just plain annoying or unnecessary. Some episodes are good, and others not so much.The first half is good. The second half doesn\'t hold up as much. The overall ending is disappointing.However, the music is fantastic. Even if skipping the show, I\'d recommend giving the soundtrack a listen.In all I am glad I watched it, but it\'s not high on my rewatch list.6/10. that the harem element does have a logical reason for why these girls are interested in him. That sets this apart from others in the genre by giving these characters a reason. Of course over the series all four of them fall in love with him (although Yuna loved him from the very beginning).The story of this anime is broken into two halves. The first half follows Kazuki\'s growing relationships with these girls, and how he uses his magic to overcome obstacles, despite the females begging him not to as he only has a small number left.I enjoyed the first half of this anime quite a bit. I was intrigued by what conflict that episode would concern, and how they would overcome it. Sometimes there were even good twists to how the problem was solved, such as the episode with the tree.However, I feel that the second half of this anime is not as interesting, and drags on for quite some time. I can\'t explain in detail without revealing a huge spoiler. Nonetheless, there are some good episodes in this half, such as the one where Kazuki accompanies Kuriko to her party, or the episode that focuses on Rin\'s relationship with her brother. But overall it\'s not as enjoyable as the first half.Finally, the ending. The last two episodes had great drama. Both characters involved in the conflict had their reasons for their choices, and I was excited to see how the issue would be fixed. However, I feel that the build up led to a let down. I found the overall conclusion to be disappointing.Characters (6):To begin with Kazuki is pretty much your average harem male lead. He\'s kind and sacrifices to make others happy, while letting the girls in his life treat him however they want. He\'s likable, but there were times I wished he had been more outspoken about his resentment for the way the girls treated him.Next is Yuna. She is the girl who truly loves Kazuki and not just the high possibility that he will produce powerful children. In the first half of the anime this is the girl I rooted for.

You'll get why when you watch it ;)The characters will get on your nerves at first but as the anime goes on you start learning alot about themI love the opeing of the anime I think thats what got me into...at first lolOf course there will be the occasional boob bouncing and funny positions but thats what a harem and ecchi is :DOverall a charming and funny anime to enjoy ;) at first lolOf course there will be the occasional boob bouncing and funny positions but thats what a harem and ecchi is :DOverall a charming and funny anime to enjoy ;)"", ""I am fine with harem and magic anime. However, this magic anime is not fun to watch at all. It is about a Kazuki who is dumb, too kind and always gets picked on by a lot of people. Yuna declares to them that she is Kazuki's wife and the people all started to attack them and things get rough.The English dub was horrendous. The women voices in the dub are like annoying. The syncing of the lip movement was horrendous.The art is ok and the sound is also ok. You know, when I watch anime, I wanted to see good character development but no....The characters all argue and moan at each other for nothing. Like acting cool and stuff like that. They just don't have feelings for each other. I just can't believe this is happening. The characters are so god awfully annoying.And here comes the biggest whiny and crybaby character Chihaya Yamase. She just never do anything in the last episode when Kazuki Shikimori's life is in danger but at least she and Yuna managed to give him a kiss and revived him.Miyama Yuna is also a crybaby.

Every episode mainly just follows Kazuki and his harem going on some wacky adventure....just like in every other harem anime. Disappointingly, this doesn\'t help make Maburaho stand-out from other harem anime.Something I did like about the story, however, was that the anime takes place in a world where everyone is a magician and magic is just like this everyday occurrence. For example, you see students flying to class and in one episode the characters play a game of...magic baseball.Characters 7/10Kazuki is a typical ""nice guy"" protagonist whose kind and honest and does his best to stay optimistic. The thing I like most about Kazuki is how selfless he is; he always uses his magic to help his friends and never uses it for himself. It is heart warming, especially since you know if he uses up all his magic then he\'ll die.My favorite character would be Yuna because I like how devoted she is to Kazuki and some of the funniest moments in the show would have to be watching how insanely jealous she gets if Kazuki even says so much as hello to another girl.As for Kuriko and Rin, they do go through some character development and they\'re both good characters, but I can\'t think of anything particularly memorable about them or any good jokes they made with them.Art 7/10As you\'d expect from an ecchi anime, the animators made sure to sneak in plenty of bouncy boobs and panty flashes. I especially liked Kuriko\'s design with the corset and lingerie underwear.Overall 7/10I like Maburaho, it was definitely a good anime, but there just wasn\'t anything especially amazing that made it stand out from other ecchi harem anime. If you just want to watch an ecchi anime then this will satisfy you, but I\'d recommend either Girl\'s Bravo or Heaven\'s Lost Property before you\'d watch this. magic baseball.Characters 7/10Kazuki is a typical ""nice guy"" protagonist whose kind and honest and does his best to stay optimistic.

I loathe the fact that some anime use a pink haired girl as the second protagonist and think she\'s all that. No, this anime provides some ecchi gold, that is more like a tease, with all the fondling, rubbing, and nudity. What really made this anime interesting for me was the fact that the one samurai girl was more fond of killing him, rather than ""bumping uglies,"" that is until later on. The plot itself was as well interesting, providing small little episodes in which you...see relationships develop with the main character.I give this anime 8/10 mainly because it slowed down a bit when he was turned into a ghost, and some random girl who left early in the season, returns and gives us a very unsatisfying ending. see relationships develop with the main character.I give this anime 8/10 mainly because it slowed down a bit when he was turned into a ghost, and some random girl who left early in the season, returns and gives us a very unsatisfying ending.', ""Story: Yet another harem story but with magic twist in it.

""Kazuki will always be Kazuki.""I\'ve finished Maburaho (officially) for the fourth time.This time, however, was very different. This time, it was with new eyes.Maburaho was the first anime I ever owned.All in all, I can say, without a doubt, that Maburaho is one of the best shows I\'ve ever seen. It is an amazing story disguised as a harem/comedy anime. Even seeing through it all, right to the very end, I couldn\'t hate it. There are flaws, sure. (Example: Seriously? Who throws out two main characters in the final episode, just to let them stand there and do nothing?! One of them...happens to be my #1 female anime character!)Maburaho, compared to other anime, stacks up like so:---The story starts off making you think it will just be a waste of time with a ""girl of the week"" formula. You watch, as a certain counter ticks down one at a time, waiting for what will happen when it reaches zero. You think a million times that it never will, after all it\'s the main character who would suffer. But it does, and quite early. Seeing that, you wonder how the show could possibly go on. I\'ll admit, the plot twist is a head-tilter. But what happens has been seen before in the show, so it\'s not unheard of or out of bounds. The story continues, deepens drastically, and becomes a personal tale with an ending that still makes me tear up and gives me goosebumps.The characters, like the story, start of shallow and predictable by appearance. You think one will always be empty-headed, one will be the object of all fan-service, and one will always be quiet. You even think one is a side character. You think the main character is spineless. You are proven to be sorely mistaken. That empty-headed girl really does care, really does notice, but just chooses to ignore it all in favor of the one she loves. That frumpy girl does have shame, does have a heart, but has been so put down she\'s afraid to ever show how she feels again. That quiet girl is a furious fighter, attentive to her friends, and knows exactly how to say what she thinks. That side character is more important than even two of the main characters, and she knows and has done much more than you think. And the main character? Let\'s just say he mans up when he\'s needed, he stubbornly puts others before himself, and he keeps his promises come hell or high water, and even death itself.The animation is stylized drastically. The magic, explosions OF magic, and ghost effects are very well done. The movement of characters is fluid where it matters and jumpy or cartoony when things get funny. The backgrounds are natural and unintrusive, the lighting can be a bit inconsistent (sunset to afternoon to sunset in one episode, over a few seconds. Just one occasion, I think). Things are a bit shiny, and the anatomy is slightly off in favor of style (eyes, long legs, etc.).The sound is brilliant, and easily a high point of the show. Music doesn\'t distract, but it enhances every moment just as BGM should. More than that, there are many memorable tracks you can listen to on their own (Memory Of A Little Girl, Snow Falls, Secret Of Power, I\'m Here, I Don\'t Wanna Lose You, Memory Of Brother, Power Of Love). The opening is catchy, kinda cheesy, and upbeat, while the ending sends you away with soft tones and philosophical love-goo. Character themes are spot on, and all in all the soundtrack is masterfully done.As for enjoyment, I must say that this show is not for everyone. It IS a harem show, and it there is a lot of joking after all. But this is a harem show with class. No panty shots every thirty seconds and so on. One character absolutely insists on hugging in every scene she appears in, though, and there\'s nothing stopping her, uhh, physique from being thrown around. There\'s also ONE part, more than halfway in, with some sudden, brief, and quite unexpected toplessness. One of the women is getting jealous, and we see her thoughts, basically.I\'ve given the show a 9/10 on my scale. ""Unforgettable as an experience,"" is what that translates to. I can\'t say it\'s completely unforgettable because there\'s always an episode or two I don\'t remember when I rewatch, so no 10/10 here, sadly.---I\'m so glad I saw Maburaho. It\'s near and dear to my heart, and it shows. One of the characters remains my #1 anime girl of all time, despite seeing shows even more focused on character development. Maburaho itself remains as one of my all time favorite anime, and I have a feeling it won\'t be going anywhere anytime soon.Thanks for reading all that, if you did. I mainly did it to vent, I guess. If this motivates you to see the show, I actually recommend the English over the Japanese dub. The Japanese dub takes stylization too far, making the characters a bit unrealistic and more generic. The English localization breathes more life into them, makes them a bit more distinct, and ultimately allows them to be taken more seriously and be made more memorable. happens to be my #1 female anime character!)Maburaho, compared to other anime, stacks up like so:---The story starts off making you think it will just be a waste of time with a ""girl of the week"" formula.

I consider them classics (of course, depending on what series we're talking here).I sometimes see these shows and find things that could possibly fit our current medium. I don't particularly like harems in general, but there is a few exceptions. Maburaho is one of these harems that I like and not today's harem. Sometimes, all the main focus of today's harem are the fan-service bullshitery I rather watch in hentai where it should be done.What this show did was a good mix...between the relationship between the girls, and how the story has carried out. If it weren't a harem, this is how it would turn out:Despite the fact Kazuki has one of the greatest family all-in-one, he is unable to use it in an unlimited range. This causes him to have the lowest grades in terms of competitiveness in magic, not the most athletic guy, and all things considered the most normal individual you will find (which in a world full of magicians, he is considerably the weakest in that aspect). Yet, ladies come after this man because he has the greatest-magician bundle within his crotch. If he were to give offspring, chances are that he would have children with amazing abilities much superior than Kazuki's and his previous family members.The fact that any girl would want this man will give any of them the highest status as their offspring will do great things. Of course, this is met with the other men competing to get with these ladies.Do you see why it could be a good show without harem?If these kinds of aspects were to exist, I would think it be much more interesting as a story. Despite all that, I'm very satisfied with the series (although I don't like it got dragged into 24 episodes).Just think about it: if all his good for are his genes, then as an individual, should he also be treated the same? The guy himself is powerful: just because he is limited to cast magic eight times, by no means can he use it to his strategic advantage. Just like a saying in a book called the Art of War by Sun Tzu:If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.A story like a shonen or a typical underdog story line would something enjoyable (at least for me) to see.Overall, it's a classic I really like to use a reference in my writing hobby. There's a lot that can be derived simply within the components of the anime however minuscule it may be. Rewatching it is something I'd consider always doing. between the relationship between the girls, and how the story has carried out.

Along the way, he meets several girls who are romantically interested in him, but their reasons are somewhat selfish -- there were rumors that any child Kazuki fathered would also have super-magical powers. Unfortunately, each time he uses his magic power, he weakens physically.  Being a selfless person, he ignores the harm to himself and continues rescuing with the help of his...magic, until tragedy strikes.  A good portion of the series revolves around his girlfriends' attempts to undo that tragedy, and overall the dialog and story line is quite captivating and entertaining.The one complaint I had was that the protagonist Kazuki's personality is only minimally developed and he is portrayed as saint-like and one-dimensional -- which makes the story suffer due to the difficulty of a viewer to have true empathy with a near-perfect person.Finally, a nod to the opening and closing themes by Ichiko! -- both songs are just super-great -- emotive and moving, even if you don't speak the language. magic, until tragedy strikes.

Have you ever thought as a boy ""Gee I wonder what it would be like to have tits smashed in front of my face 24/7?"" I\'m sure you have because every boy has had that thought, now how about having that thought in 5th grade? No. Well that\'s what happens when you stumble across the hidden gems known as harem animes. Now I was fairly young when I watched this so my tastes were as refined cinder block.If you want a watch/no...watch, then the answer is no. This show is mediocre and plain bad. Why did I give it a 7? Nostalgia.I could give you a play by play of all the characters and their development, but you won\'t need any of that because the show will not offer it...........Here it is anyway:***Characters***Shikimori- The main protagonist who is as thick..... headed as all harem leads. Like pita bread you wouldn\'t touch it if not for the meat (tits) and sauces (ecchi  shots) added to it.Yuna- Main girl. That\'s all. She gets all the development and is never mean because main girl.Kuriko- Big tits.

I just rewatched the whole series and remembered why I enjoyed it in the first place. When I first watched this anime as a teenager, I mostly had a crush on Yuna Miyama, Kazuki's self-proclaimed wife, but I definitely liked Rin Kamishiro and Kuriko Kazetsubaki as well. I like the individual magical girls in this anime as characters and think they work well together. Yes, it's true that Maburaho has a cheesy storyline, but it's a harem anime, so I think it works in that context. As someone watching a y2k...anime in 2022, I noticed myself appreciating quite a few of the aesthetic elements present in this anime. I especially enjoyed seeing the art style, fashion, and visual effects of the characters' magic. Although I've since moved on to other kinds of anime since the early 2000s, rewatching Maburaho was nostalgic and fun. 10/10 would recommend Maburaho for anyone looking for a trip down y2k memory lane. anime in 2022, I noticed myself appreciating quite a few of the aesthetic elements present in this anime.

I mean the first 11 episodes were actually really good but then afterwards when they killed him off and turned him into a ghost it completely ruined everything. First while he is a ghost sometimes he can touch them but then other times he can’t touch them. It really confuses me when the girls will carry him away to go do something but then fall through him other times. Also why in the actual hell would you ever think making the MAIN CHARACTER a ghost is a good plot. Like...is literally took away from the main character and pretty much made him one of the wimpyiest main characters I ever seen. Like why make him more whimpy than he already is. Also the ending was so bad I literally wanted to throw my remote at the tv. I def tried looking for a season two not because I liked the show but because I wanted and actual ending. They wasted a very good plot on bad storytelling and not understanding the basics of what harem Ecchi anime’s are. They didn’t even put a beach scene in which is literally a first. I will say this though, seeing rin was a breath of fresh air. I really liked her, prob one of the reason I kept watching the show. The art was actually really good. No, it wasn’t the best art I’ve seen but there def was some moments where I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. The music was ok, wasn’t anything that serious though. Overall I would rate this show a 1 maybe a 2 it was very bad I would never watch this show again. is literally took away from the main character and pretty much made him one of the wimpyiest main characters I ever seen.

Schwarzesmarken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30806/Schwarzesmarken,"['So let me start off by saying ""I F**KING HATE THIS SHOW."" Really I do. And yet, I can\'t find myself giving this show any less than a 10.However, the reason I hate this show is because the writers are dicks and they know it. So this whole show revolves around the Cold War Era. Much like in the U.S. with the Red Scare, there was a struggle in Eastern Germany about loyalty. People selling out their own friends and family for self-preservation. This is the shows main focus. The Mechas and Aliens are really second to the situation.Well in the first few episodes...we met X-Chan. There is serious suspicion about this character whether X-Chan is a traitor or not. There is one scene in I believe the third episode where they show X-Chan\'s ""evil smile""... and that is it. That is all we have to work on to determine whether or not X-Chan is truly a traitor or a Red Herring.This is why this show is truly brilliant . As I kept watching I was searching for something, anything, to whether to trust our suspect or not. I kept playing all possible scenarios in my head, searched for something I missed, but to no avail because there was nothing there. There was nothing I could decrypt. All I could do is watch the events unfold. We don\'t even find out the truth till almost the very end.This isn\'t an accident. The writers want you to squirm. They want you to wrench and search to try to figure it out knowing very well you can\'t. They want you to question everything and create evidence in your head that you believe true that probably is non-existent. This very well replicates the Red Scare in America. There was no way to truly tell if you could trust someone. There wasn\'t magical signals to tell. All you do is hope that you didn\'t get accused.This show is probably one of the deepest anime out there. This whole show is a deconstruction of the mystery genre. There are no clues out there for you to find. All you can do is wait for something to happen even though every second you will try to figure it out. You will assure your self that you know the truth when you don\'t.It almost doesn\'t matter whether X-Chan is a traitor or not. What matters is they are implanting that idea in your head. And that seed will sprout.The fact that the average is a 7 is almost a joke to me. If I had to recommend a show to anyone I think this would have to be one of the first ones YOU MUST WATCH. we met X-Chan.

In addition to B.E.T.A invasion (slightly ugly than titans in AOT if u ask me) they add in some history plot like during the Cold War era , the splitting within Germany between West n East etc. To fight this SOB , eishi or we called as pilot will manned Tactical Surface Fighter or TSF..a humanoid jet fighter. From what i see..this animation is...far better than Muv Luv Total Eclipse. The character , music n other are slightly average but u can go through with it with ease.Give this anime a chance n patiently watch..if u cant watch this slow paced anime then u will never like other awesome slow pace anime like Steins:Gate . far better than Muv Luv Total Eclipse. The character , music n other are slightly average but u can go through with it with ease.Give this anime a chance n patiently watch..if u cant watch this slow paced anime then u will never like other awesome slow pace anime like Steins:Gate .', 'There are two kinds of people that might watch Schwarzesmarken: those who have played the Muv-Luv trilogy and those who haven\'t. And depending on which side you fall on, your view on this anime will be quite different, although both sides will have their own problems with it, albeit totally different ones.So before I get into this, there are a couple things I\'d like to clarify for those who are unaware. Muv-Luv is a 3-part visual novel series released between 2002 and 2006, the last part of which, Muv-Luv Alternative, is widely considered to be one of the greatest visual novels ever made. However, ever...since its release now 10 years ago, the company behind it, Age, have done literally nothing other than create a myriad of side stories, spinoffs and fandiscs based on the Muv-Luv universe. They\'ve never even tried to come up with a new franchise for a whole decade now, instead they\'ve decided to just keep milking their one and only masterpiece until it can be milked no more, which is... understandable I guess, but still pretty saddening. In any case, the Muv-Luv trilogy has never gotten an anime adaptation and perhaps never will, but in 2012 there was actually an anime release... based on one of its countless spinoffs called Total Eclipse. Not only was this a rather strange decision since any anime-only viewers would miss out on tons of plot elements due to being unfamiliar with the main series, but also Total Eclipse turned out to be an incredibly mediocre anime in and of itself, focusing just as much on fanservice as actual story progression, if not more. And now, 4 years later, history repeats itself, as yet another one of the franchise\'s spinoffs has gotten adapted, namely Schwarzesmarken. But of course for any anime-only viewers, the exact same problems as last time still remain.The good news however is that the story of Schwarzesmarken is largely separate from the one of the main story of Muv-Luv. This is because a) it\'s a prequel, taking place almost 20 years before the events of Alternative, b) the character cast is completely different, and c) it plays out on the other side of the planet, in Germany instead of Japan. So in that sense it works out fairly well as a standalone anime... but far from perfectly. This is because Schwarzesmarken intentionally leaves out just about all initial exposition about the state of the world itself, any detailed information about the BETA\'s functionalities and tendencies, as well as a lot of the planet\'s history ever since the BETA\'s initial sightings on Mars in 1958 and their eventual invasion of Earth in 1973. And this is all simply because the anime assumes that you already know all that from playing through Alternative. So it\'s not that the story won\'t make sense for anime-only viewers (it will), but you\'ll miss out on a lot of depth and detail. It also works the other way around as you\'ll be able to relate a lot more to events which have previously only been mentioned briefly in Alternative as it plays out in real time here instead of something which just happened far away and almost 20 years prior from the game\'s perspective.Overall though, Schwarzesmarken is still a pretty big improvement over Total Eclipse at the very least. The tone is a lot more on point with what Muv-Luv is supposed to feel like, with a lot of death, drama, politics and tragic events (though not as much sci-fi). There is also pretty much no fanservice at all this time around which I\'m very thankful for. So atmosphere-wise Schwarzesmarken is a lot more similar to the main series, but there are still some clear differences. The most notable one would probably be the direction the plot goes in, and specifically who the real enemies in the story are. In the main series, it\'s naturally the BETA that everyone is fighting since humanity\'s mere existence is on the line, but in Schwarzesmarken they almost feel like the secondary threat a lot of the time. Of course there are still a lot of battles between the human TSF squadrons and their alien invaders, but in this case there seems to be just as much internal conflict as external. This is because this takes place in Germany in the early 1980s, which of course means that it\'s in the middle of the country\'s split in two, I.E: West Germany and East Germany. The squadron the story primarily follows is the East German Army\'s 666th TSF Squadron, a.k.a. the ""Schwarzesmarken"". They do their part in fighting the BETA on a daily basis, but they see their western neighbors as just as much of a potential threat as the aliens themselves, and the west is of a similar mindset. It\'s almost like a three-way war going on, except that the two human sides are having more of a cold war standoff and throwing insults at each other most of the time, but occasionally end up clashing head-on as well. This is unsurprisingly also used as a consistent and reliable method for generating drama, as some characters find themselves on different political sides despite caring for each other on a personal level. And on top of that there\'s also the good old truth that killing off main characters is not exactly something Muv-Luv has ever been afraid to do, and although it might not exactly be on the level of the main series, Schwarzesmarken is still not afraid to do the same. It gives the post-apocalyptic story a much greater sense of realism and intensity that way, and it definitely pays off.Schwarzesmarken is definitely not a bad anime by any means, but I still find it a bit difficult to actually recommend it to people. Because if you haven\'t played through the Muv-Luv trilogy prior to it, then you should definitely go do that first, and if you have played through it then try as you might but you\'ll find that it\'s almost impossible to not end up subconsciously comparing Schwarzesmarken to the main series as you\'re watching it. There will constantly be this nagging voice in the back of your head saying ""I wish I was just replaying the real game instead"". Schwarzesmarken isn\'t bad, but just by being part of the Muv-Luv universe the expectations on it will be so much higher than it ever has a chance of living up to, and Alternative is just such an incredible work of art that Schwarzesmarken ends up looking a lot worse than it actually is simply by being compared to something so unreasonable. I think the only way you can truly see Schwarzesmarken for what it is is by first playing through the visual novels and then literally forcing yourself to go into the anime with the lowest expectations possible. If you tell yourself prematurely that it\'s probably going to suck, then you might be positively surprised. But if you don\'t, you\'ll probably just be disappointed.Though pretty much all these problems would be solved if Age just decided to actually adapt the real Muv-Luv series already... which I\'ve actually heard some rumors as of late that it might happen in the future after Alternative\'s localization Kickstarter project turned out to be such a huge success a few months ago. Maybe in another 5-10 years, who knows. One can only hope. since its release now 10 years ago, the company behind it, Age, have done literally nothing other than create a myriad of side stories, spinoffs and fandiscs based on the Muv-Luv universe.

One can only hope.', 'So basically my mates and I decided to do a showing of a show this season and we chose Schwarzesmarken.It turned out to be a pretty interesting and exciting masterpiece about human behaviours studies and complicated human relationships.Non-spoilerino summary: In an alternate version of the 1980s, the Cold War rages on even amidst an invasion of alien creatures. Set in communist East Germany, Schwarzesmarken tells the heroic tales of the country’s strongest mecha unit, The 666th TSF Squadron Schwarzesmarken (Black Marks), as it fights against the dreadful and looks-like-shit aliens, BETAs, and shows the West the superiority of communist doctrine and technology.Story 10/10:No...perfect story exists without plotwists. People likes Urobuchi’s works/masterpieces/craps for this particular reason. While it appears on the surface to be just generic mecha+harem anime, Schwarzesmarken stands out from the crowd thanks to its setting.It’s as much about the hell of living within a totalitarian communist state as it is breathing under immense war-stress as they are on to fight deadly aliens with giant robots. The people live in the fear of secret police, STASI, that a wrong word can send them to prison and get tortured as traitors. Thanks to this, you’re never sure which characters are trustworthy and which are informants, and this is the source of all the dramas later on.Above that, Schwarzesmarken simulates the wartime psychology of military combatants during the Cold War Era with East German precision. Characters in this show are more prone to act out of control and without normal common sense, which is this show’s true beauty. The way the story is told is revolutionary as well. Focus of the show is always shifting from one to another thus a large amount of information is able to be conveyed to the viewers. Schwarzesmarken manages to take the viewers by surprise everytime as it displays hidden symbolisms in every singular frames.On the other hand it shows a slight hint on the structural weakness of a non-democracy ruling institution. The secret police is fighting with the military and the politicians in front of a survival crisis—the invasion of BETAs. It just show communism won’t last and freedom to people is the ultimate solution to rule.Characters 10/10:The MC, Theodor Eberbach, is not the generic MC you can see in every show or justice-wannabe Shirou. He’s a normal dude like you and me who wants to go away from troubles. Though for sake of the plot he must save the world and get all the booties. He’s the most normal beings yet the most boring person in the show.*Spoiler*-------------------------------------------------------------Except he bangs his sister.-------------------------------------------------------------*Spoiler*The loli on the front cover, Katia, is nothing but a plot device. A defector from the West, believes that everyone can get along if they just sit down and talk, just your generic naïve character and moe trope. Annoying as hell as she starts speaking thanks to her VA, she literally does nothing and react to nothing. The female version of Raku from Nichijou, she is oblivious not to feelings but betrayal that will cost her life. She just exists because the story needs her to.Irisdina is the Shirou and the punching bag of the show. Full of justice and regrets of killing her own brother when he was accused of treason to continue her living, she decided to fight the ugly BETAs. As the leader of the 666th TSF Schwarzesmarken, she owns great booty and convinced the MC to save the world. Should be the OTP with the MC.And here comes the miracle that saves and carries the show, Lise. As Theodor’s step-sister, she joined the show before the climax. Because she is the climax of the show. Later revealed as a spy  from the STASI, she ,as all other anime little sister, adores his onii-chan to a obsessive degree. She later shows her true colour and sell out the captain, Irisdina due to her jealousy. The rollercoaster she brings doesn’t stop here as she is the main force to stop her precious onii-chan to rescue his love. Lise also carries a heavy role as the leader of the divided fraction within STASI. Basically she is just a cute sister that wants to dominate the country and live with her precious onii-chan happily ever after. For that she paid a heavy price including selling out her friends and her body to STASI.*Spoiler*------------------------------------------------------------------Of course she offers her body to her precious onii-chan. Every 2D imouto’s ultimate tactical weapon it is.-----------------------------------------------------------------*Spoiler*Lise shows a conflicted and complicated personality that perfectly symbolise the twitched soul under communism supremacy. She performs numerous treacherous acts just to be with her precious onii-chan. She even sacrificed her purity so that she can secure a better future, just to be with her onii-chan.Then she displays a truly brutal and violent behaviour that suits her yandere-imouto character seasmlessly. At the end she is just a tragedic little sister whose one-and-only wish is her onii-chan’s affection and love.Art 6/10:Looks miles better than that crap from Studio DEEN so it means Schwarzesmarken is a OK looking anime. Nothing to write home about it. Although the BETAs looks like utter craps, there is a scene where aliens that looks like balllsacks with eyelashes. Truly indecent yet not scary. RIP the mecha design, it’s just tin boxes moving around in this show.Music 7/10:Schwarzesmarken got Fripside to do a pretty decent opening song. It sounds like Black Bullet’s OP. The ending fits the show pretty well too. The sounds effects in the show that emphasizes on “Mai Fatherland” and “Go and Die you Capitalist Pigs” enhances the show’s viewing experience.Overall 8/10:Plotwist and marvellous storytelling with an emphasize on wartime PTSD that happens along with a forbidden incest love, what can you ask for more?Schwarzesmarken may not be the most “hard-mecha” such as Gundam or “silly-romance mecha” such as Macross, but it is a mindbending show that involves viewers to rethink the possibility of communism and most of it, the weight of a little sister’s love. perfect story exists without plotwists.

Focus of the show is always shifting from one to another thus a large amount of information is able to be conveyed to the viewers. Schwarzesmarken manages to take the viewers by surprise everytime as it displays hidden symbolisms in every singular frames.On the other hand it shows a slight hint on the structural weakness of a non-democracy ruling institution. The secret police is fighting with the military and the politicians in front of a survival crisis—the invasion of BETAs. It just show communism won’t last and freedom to people is the ultimate solution to rule.Characters 10/10:The MC, Theodor Eberbach, is not the generic MC you can see in every show or justice-wannabe Shirou. He’s a normal dude like you and me who wants to go away from troubles. Though for sake of the plot he must save the world and get all the booties. He’s the most normal beings yet the most boring person in the show.*Spoiler*-------------------------------------------------------------Except he bangs his sister.-------------------------------------------------------------*Spoiler*The loli on the front cover, Katia, is nothing but a plot device. A defector from the West, believes that everyone can get along if they just sit down and talk, just your generic naïve character and moe trope. Annoying as hell as she starts speaking thanks to her VA, she literally does nothing and react to nothing. The female version of Raku from Nichijou, she is oblivious not to feelings but betrayal that will cost her life. She just exists because the story needs her to.Irisdina is the Shirou and the punching bag of the show. Full of justice and regrets of killing her own brother when he was accused of treason to continue her living, she decided to fight the ugly BETAs. As the leader of the 666th TSF Schwarzesmarken, she owns great booty and convinced the MC to save the world. Should be the OTP with the MC.And here comes the miracle that saves and carries the show, Lise. As Theodor’s step-sister, she joined the show before the climax. Because she is the climax of the show. Later revealed as a spy  from the STASI, she ,as all other anime little sister, adores his onii-chan to a obsessive degree. She later shows her true colour and sell out the captain, Irisdina due to her jealousy. The rollercoaster she brings doesn’t stop here as she is the main force to stop her precious onii-chan to rescue his love. Lise also carries a heavy role as the leader of the divided fraction within STASI. Basically she is just a cute sister that wants to dominate the country and live with her precious onii-chan happily ever after. For that she paid a heavy price including selling out her friends and her body to STASI.*Spoiler*------------------------------------------------------------------Of course she offers her body to her precious onii-chan. Every 2D imouto’s ultimate tactical weapon it is.-----------------------------------------------------------------*Spoiler*Lise shows a conflicted and complicated personality that perfectly symbolise the twitched soul under communism supremacy. She performs numerous treacherous acts just to be with her precious onii-chan. She even sacrificed her purity so that she can secure a better future, just to be with her onii-chan.Then she displays a truly brutal and violent behaviour that suits her yandere-imouto character seasmlessly. At the end she is just a tragedic little sister whose one-and-only wish is her onii-chan’s affection and love.Art 6/10:Looks miles better than that crap from Studio DEEN so it means Schwarzesmarken is a OK looking anime. Nothing to write home about it. Although the BETAs looks like utter craps, there is a scene where aliens that looks like balllsacks with eyelashes. Truly indecent yet not scary. RIP the mecha design, it’s just tin boxes moving around in this show.Music 7/10:Schwarzesmarken got Fripside to do a pretty decent opening song. It sounds like Black Bullet’s OP. The ending fits the show pretty well too. The sounds effects in the show that emphasizes on “Mai Fatherland” and “Go and Die you Capitalist Pigs” enhances the show’s viewing experience.Overall 8/10:Plotwist and marvellous storytelling with an emphasize on wartime PTSD that happens along with a forbidden incest love, what can you ask for more?Schwarzesmarken may not be the most “hard-mecha” such as Gundam or “silly-romance mecha” such as Macross, but it is a mindbending show that involves viewers to rethink the possibility of communism and most of it, the weight of a little sister’s love.', ""Having seen a fair amount of sci-fi related series and mecha as one of my favorite genres, Schwaresmarken stands out as a strange show to me. It’s not because the series is set in the same universe as the Muv-Luv franchise or based on a light novel. Rather, the series is more like a political flair that’s masked by the intense violence of creatures, monstrosity known to their world as BETA.First let’s get a few things out of the way. The series is a spin-off series based on the light novel. (although a visual novel also exists) Historically, the timeline began around the late 1970s...when BETA arrives in Eastern Europe. Eastern Germany gets besieged by them and mankind suffers heavy losses. That is, mankind builds the TSF (Tactical Surface Fighters) that basically translates into heavy duty mechanized machines designed to fight them. 5 years later, Eastern Germany is still suffering with its weakened forces and the Warsaw Pact isn’t holding them much longer either. However, they are supported by the infamous Nationale Volksarmee's 666th Tactical Surface Fighter Squadron, also known the “Black Marks”. The story tells of this infamous group as they fight for survival not only on the frontlines against BETA but also within its own forces, political struggles, and national conflicts.Approaching this series with trepidation, Schwarzesmarken’s storytelling is sometimes decent, sometimes bad, and then sometimes just dreadful. There’s a lot of mixed feelings when diving into such a complex universe. Furthermore, the show is only a 1-cour so terms like ‘rushing’ or ‘butchered adaptation’ can be applied here. To be fair, enjoying this series at fullest would include an understanding of the Muv Luv universe. However, watching this series as a standalone is possible and the experience getting out of the show may be enjoyable. That is, if you really and I mean, really like what it has to offer.Where to start really? The first episode easily establishes a few factors. BETA is on the rampage in Europe and the show isn’t shy to show death on screen with an immense amount of violence. There’s some emotional storytelling going on as well when we see pilots during their last moments. In essence, it should come to no surprise that Schwarzesmarken is trying to paint the idea of BETA being humanity’s ultimate enemy. Or is it really? Behind the frontlines, there’s a fair amount of political and interpersonal flair going on. You see, West and East Germany haven’t exactly been the best of friends. The show easily makes it clear that the two are only united for the purpose of surviving and destroying a common foe. By historical standards, the Warsaw Pact is a collective defense treaty but in this series, it’s almost like an armistice. West and East Germany have their own ideals so naturally, they can’t really get along. One of the major forces in the series besides the 666th squadron is Stasi, an official security force of German Democratic Republic that’s designed to enforce their laws. Spies, treason, and disobedience are met with punishment including death. Furthermore, they have control of a massive intelligence network that almost serves as this series’ version of Big Brother. Sounds scary right? To be quite honest, humanity’s enemies aren’t just BETA but also making an enemy of themselves. And it’s a sad story when we see the body counts.As complex as the show seems, the characters aren’t too difficult to understand once you really see their background stories. Theodor, the main male protagonist has suffered losses in his life including the assumed death of his sister. Irisdina Bernhard, the captain of the squad has been rumored to backstab her own family to get to where she is in the present. Then, we have Katia who tries to desperately appeal to her ideal of “let’s put our differences aside! If we all unite, we can defeat the BETA!” Such an illusion really. The show makes it clear that there’s no genuine friendship between certain nations. Nonetheless, the character cast gives the most prominence for these three characters while the others are mainly supporting players. That’s sad to say as I’ve heard the light novels gave more characterization emphasis on characters like Sylvia, Pham, Beatrix, among others. As I’ve mentioned before, the adaptation serves more of a story to depict the nature of sci-fi warfare. The addition of the military, political conflicts, and personal battles are attempts to create an emotional story. Does it work? In some some ways, yes. However, the majority of the show feels like it tries to stuff down the viewers’ throats with emotions that really is weakly timed. Sure, characters die on and off but it does it really give strong reasons to why we should care about them? The first half of the show has several characters die for mankind’s cause. But to this end, I don’t find their losses to be memorable. It’s not just how predictable how some deaths occur but rather their lack of characterization. The only characters that seems to be relevant in the show are Theodor, Katia, and Irisdina. Later, we also see a surprise character return to the series although I can hardly call it that. In terms of relationship dynamics, that’s hardly anything to take home to. Theodor’s a cold guy who can work with others on a professional level but rarely ever opens up to others. His childhood is tragic and in a way, I guess we should feel sorry for him. Katia’s relationship is perhaps the lightest in the show and also inspires him to fight the good fight. Then, there’s Irisdina, probably the least trustworthy main character because of the rumored gossips about her past. Although on professional standards, she does have a good relationship with Theodor and Katia. The show also seems to establish that Irisdina and Beatrix (a prominent member of Stati) has some sort of history but that’s overshadowed by the actual conflicts going on. I refer to the one about war against BETA.In terms artwork and design, it’s mostly mediocre level in terms of technical quality although I do give some praise to the studio for portraying the technological aspects of the series. It manages to capture the grim atmosphere with the bloodshed and death scenes. And while the pilot suits are designed to make the women look like eye candies, it is also quite convincing. Character expressions are important so the series did its best to capture their emotions. In retrospect, it did a fair job as every episode seems to make their reactions look and feel real. In addition, the TSF are designed with a decent amount of effort ranging from its arsenal, structure, and capabilities. Action wise, the show is powerful enough to convince us that it’s a sci-fi warfare despite the CGI. On the other hand, BETA’s designs looks silly with the insectoid-like eyes and absurd body proportions. They look like aliens that popped out of some B-movie.Soundtrack is actually quite important now that I’ve taken the show at a close glance. Remember, the series is grim without much humor but portrayed as a sci-fi warfare story. In other words, the show did its best to portray that atmospheric setting with more melancholic music. Either way, it does seem to work out in that regards when delivering its intentions. However, character voice mannerism is a weak sign of the show as there’s nothing really a character that stands out individually. In fact, Katia’s voice sounds like a child for someone as part of the military. On the other hand, I do like how characters like Beatrix is portrayed with their manipulative nature expressed by voice acting.After watching Schwarzesmarken, I have to conclude and say that the show is a brave attempt at making this into a memorable war story. But what does it really achieve? A poorly directed and produced series that seems to not be able to connect with itself. The story feels loose while the info dump has a strange pacing. Furthermore, there’s a lack of characterization on most of the 666th squad. I think the show is geared at more of an audience that is very familiar with the Muv Luv universe. To casual fans, the experience isn’t going to be something great and shouldn’t with what it presented. when BETA arrives in Eastern Europe.

I love how it gives a certain point of realism into the story, even though its littered with swarms of mecha-on-monter action. I watched this with my fellow co-workers but none of them seemed to enjoy it because it was too ""grim"", but for me, it was great. Not only does it portray each of the character\'s feelings very well, but what really shines through is the emotions that war brings upon them. The conflict, the struggle, & the desperateness of East Germany, It feels very real. I...loved how they decided to use historical nations reminiscent of WWI-WWII because it helps understand what\'s really happening under all the confusion. If you\'re solely in it for the mecha battles, its cool too, they\'re really action-packed, & long that it somewhat keeps me on the edge of my seat. loved how they decided to use historical nations reminiscent of WWI-WWII because it helps understand what\'s really happening under all the confusion.

Surprising considering it goes up against KonoSuba.Oh and don\'t stop watching straight after the credits end, there is always an after credits scene which is important to the story.Historical Authenticity:  I\'m not allowed to use the word ""accuracy"" because there were no aliens in Germany. German text appears in place of Japanese when written down and from what I can tell it\'s very accurate. Ignore that Schwarzesmarken is grammatically incorrect. There is a reason behind that.

I am interested in Cold War history and what is basically fascist rule. I always love the idea of secret police, such as the Stasi. Which is great because who appears in the show? That\'s right, the Staatssicherheit (German for State Security). I\'ve never watched or played Muv-Luv but I am told politics plays a large role in them as it does in Schwarzesmarken. Remember the aliens attacked humanity? Yeah, they aren\'t the enemy. The Stasi are. From what I can tell that is the message of the show. The humans are your enemy. It\'s pretty thrilling. If I was to go any further I would be spoiling the show. Honestly you just need to watch it.Art and Sound: I\'ve been told the CGI in this show isn\'t as good as others but it\'s good enough to look at. It works as well considering the BETA are aliens are shouldn\'t look like anything on the Earth. As for character designs they are decent enough. As usual in anime the Asian one doesn\'t look Asian, but she is wonderful anyway. Same with the Polish one. There were two German stereotype girls and Irisdina\'s hair was pretty to look at. Katia wears too much eye liner.As for sound I\'ve been listening to the Ed song, Kanashimi ga Jidai wo Kakeru, while I write the review. It\'s peaceful. The Op song white forces gets you excited to watch the show and it was well implemented in the final episode. Voice acting was good and I don\'t think the actors and actresses messed up German pronunciation. There was a stand out song that played in episode 11 which was very epic for the situation. I\'ll find it hopefully.Other than that I can\'t think of any stand out songs. Maybe I\'ll find them when I do a rewatch, hopefully that rewatch will be on Blu Ray.Character: We needed two courses/24 episodes.

First let me clarify that this is a Light Novel adaption, just like total eclipse, written by YET ANOTHER author. Now, when you adapt something like that into anime you’d expect the script writer and the director to bother fixing the issues that total eclipse’s adaption had, but nope, they did not. They not only managed to make it even worse, they also decided it’d be a...smart idea to have LIDEN FILMS animate it, now they managed to pull of Arsan Senki fine, even with issues here and there, but as I said in my TE review, you do not give a studio that doesn’t have enough money to produce a 2-cour mecha show without resorting to CG mechs. Considering 80% of what is on screen are mechs and giant aliens, if you have them cg not only does this kill the animation, but the entire fun of the show. Even a poorly done show like A/Z was more interesting, and that was done by A-1 & Troyca with even worse CG.- SECTION 1 ART & ANIMATION -As mentioned above, the animation mostly consists of CG mechs, regardless how fluent it is, it feels out of the place and unnecessary, even the action scenes feel weak in comparison to Total Eclipse, which was way worse in terms of production budget. Actual drawn scenes have okay animation as in they don’t do any drastic movements, lazy, but nicely covered.The art designs and character design is decades better than TE, but then again it suffers from the exact same issues as the previous title did. Dull and repeating backgrounds that offer little variety and mostly covered in white because of the snow, which at this point pretty much shows that they were trying to save as much budget as they can from this so they can produce Arslan S2 with minimum production issues, which is sad to see as they could’ve handled it much better. Character designs look almost identical, just change the hair color and you’re done.- SECTION 2 DIRECTING & SCRIPT –The directing in this show is all over the place, the guy thought it would be a smart idea to have the characters take their setting and outcomes so seriously that that it makes attack on titan look like the little baby in comparison, there’s usually a level of how much the voice actors have to get immersed to make you feel like you’re really there, like you understand them. However, if you have them take it WAY to seriously, they’ll come out ruining the moment or being too noisy. For example Attack on Titan was a nicely animated drama, it had top tier direction and immersion, but the voice actors tried too hard to make it sound like its life or death, which led to the most anticlimactic outcome for me. However, for short stories it worked, like Levi’s ova’s, so you’d expect it to work here as well, no chance bud.Script writing is almost average… As in, they managed to get it to the setting properly, but still feels uneasy to read through, there are very weird moments example where she sleeps with her brother because she felt depressed because no one trusted her, like WHAT?! During action scenes and crucial moments it’s below to average at best, having melodramatic characters and ideals that seem extremely out of place for what this is, it’s even a political drama as well as an alien war drama because NATIONALISM! And REASONING! Corruption and such, so when he tries to make the script for one scene it comes out even worse in the next, so you’d expect the director to even it out, but no it didn’t happen. He was over blowing the scenes with characters trying to make it seem like hell when you can’t even relate to them.- SECTION 3 PRODUCTION VALUES & MUSIC –Production values aren’t even on the norm to be considered decent. As 80% of the show is CG, and the animation is at a minimum the voice acting over done and script thrown out of the window, there is almost no satisfaction in terms of watching it, the designs are forgettable and basic; uniforms are standard with no unique touch to them.The music is even more forgettable, it’s better than Total Eclipse that’s for sure, but I cannot recall any specific track, maybe the one that played during episode eleven, but damn, it seems to be very difficult to hit the proper score for this, I mean, the Visual Novel adaption of the Alternative Light Novels had 30 tracks, but mostly used 5 of them on certain sections, the others were so played for less than a minute so you’d forget them, what I aim to say with this is that, it had almost no music being played, and yet. Was more memorable and better directed and presented than this misery, if you so want to see Schwarzesmarken for yourself, I’d suggest you turn off your brain if you want to get past episode 4. Or read the Novels it is based off, as they are most definitely better.- FINAL SECTION ENJOYMENT –Having liked the Alternative VN, I wanted to give this a go to see if it’ll be as interesting as I expected it to be, but was disappointed severely with it’s production and presentation, it seems these kinds of stories need at least 20 episodes to be something more or a long running 10-15 novels (50 hour if it’d be a VN) to flesh out and finish it the story. However, with the budget it got and timeslot it had to run through, it couldn’t be more than a mere distraction. I disliked the series after the 2nd episode and it started getting on my nerves towards the end. I highly suggest you look elsewhere if you want a war drama; it’s slightly better in terms of production than TE, but worse in terms of script and direction, so it fails to deliver the expectations and would leave you wanting this to be much better. smart idea to have LIDEN FILMS animate it, now they managed to pull of Arsan Senki fine, even with issues here and there, but as I said in my TE review, you do not give a studio that doesn’t have enough money to produce a 2-cour mecha show without resorting to CG mechs. Considering 80% of what is on screen are mechs and giant aliens, if you have them cg not only does this kill the animation, but the entire fun of the show. Even a poorly done show like A/Z was more interesting, and that was done by A-1 & Troyca with even worse CG.- SECTION 1 ART & ANIMATION -As mentioned above, the animation mostly consists of CG mechs, regardless how fluent it is, it feels out of the place and unnecessary, even the action scenes feel weak in comparison to Total Eclipse, which was way worse in terms of production budget. Actual drawn scenes have okay animation as in they don’t do any drastic movements, lazy, but nicely covered.The art designs and character design is decades better than TE, but then again it suffers from the exact same issues as the previous title did. Dull and repeating backgrounds that offer little variety and mostly covered in white because of the snow, which at this point pretty much shows that they were trying to save as much budget as they can from this so they can produce Arslan S2 with minimum production issues, which is sad to see as they could’ve handled it much better. Character designs look almost identical, just change the hair color and you’re done.- SECTION 2 DIRECTING & SCRIPT –The directing in this show is all over the place, the guy thought it would be a smart idea to have the characters take their setting and outcomes so seriously that that it makes attack on titan look like the little baby in comparison, there’s usually a level of how much the voice actors have to get immersed to make you feel like you’re really there, like you understand them. However, if you have them take it WAY to seriously, they’ll come out ruining the moment or being too noisy. For example Attack on Titan was a nicely animated drama, it had top tier direction and immersion, but the voice actors tried too hard to make it sound like its life or death, which led to the most anticlimactic outcome for me. However, for short stories it worked, like Levi’s ova’s, so you’d expect it to work here as well, no chance bud.Script writing is almost average… As in, they managed to get it to the setting properly, but still feels uneasy to read through, there are very weird moments example where she sleeps with her brother because she felt depressed because no one trusted her, like WHAT?! During action scenes and crucial moments it’s below to average at best, having melodramatic characters and ideals that seem extremely out of place for what this is, it’s even a political drama as well as an alien war drama because NATIONALISM! And REASONING! Corruption and such, so when he tries to make the script for one scene it comes out even worse in the next, so you’d expect the director to even it out, but no it didn’t happen. He was over blowing the scenes with characters trying to make it seem like hell when you can’t even relate to them.- SECTION 3 PRODUCTION VALUES & MUSIC –Production values aren’t even on the norm to be considered decent.

This is worth watchingThis anime is mainly a spin-off and takes place long before Muv-Luv's main events during the earliest stages of the BETA invasion, during the Cold War and the splitting of Germany. We like the historical add-on to the anime plot!Despite there being mechs used, they aren't used in a cliche manner.This anime is really good to be honest. It has good art quality with nicely saturated colors and plenty of detail. The audio is also extremely good as well, having a deep cinema-like feel to it.This anime honestly...feels like it has some aspects from Evangelion and will take a bit of time to watch, but we recommend it to everyone. feels like it has some aspects from Evangelion and will take a bit of time to watch, but we recommend it to everyone."", ""I don't normally write reviews, but when I do it's because I feel the need to express an opinion that may not be the popular one so that people aren't mislead by the oh-so-common mob-rating mentality that we've all seen time and time again. I mean, it makes sense, people will go to rate something and if they're too far from the average may re-think their rating in order to be closer to normal. It's a psychology thing...anyway, on to my review.There's no way this deserves to be (as I write this) ranked #4492. On the other hand, I don't know if it really deserves...to be in 133 peoples' favourite lists, but I can at least wrap my head around why certain people would drop this in their top ten. Really, on the surface, it's another generic mecha...okay, yeah, it's a fairly generic mecha through and through but wait! There's more! The setting is definitely a breath of fresh air for me, there hasn't been another one like this in a while that intrigues me. And while the characters aren't extraordinarily special, they definitely grow and become quite unique as the show progresses - even when you get down into the multitude of side characters. Heck, there are a lot people who have < 5 minutes of screen time in every episode put together that feel like they have their own unique personality which is extremely impressive considering the number of side characters (I'm not even talking about the main supporting...well, harem I guess). Sure, a lot of the main characters are fairly stock, but I think the effort that went into writing good extras balances that out a bit.I can't help but feel that people pegged it as one of the few promising shows this season on Crunchyroll and then saw the generic trash it was pretending to be for the first couple episodes and gave up on it (but obviously not before dropping a trash review on it).Do I think it's a perfect mecha? No. But do I think it at least deserves to be in the high hundreds or low thousands? Definitely. It's sure as hell better than Aldnoah.Zero's second season and arguably better than the first; also, once the last couple episodes come out, I'm almost positive I'll be able to say it's better than the first season too.Do yourself a favour and give it a watch through to the end, it definitely finds it's groove around mid-season which makes the overall quality match up a lot more with the great art, animation, and sound/music choices.

High Average at best, but cut it some slack. The 12 episodes given as screen time was just *way* too short to give the whole story justice. It\'s dark, but the nitty gritty details of the whole thing aren\'t really highlighted, they give you a few shots just to get the general idea. I\'d say that they actually conveyed the main points and prompt pretty well, but as a lore enthusiast, I can\'t help but be disappointing with the lack of content. So much potential down the drain...probably thanks to them having to cut a lot of the content out due to this restriction. It would have felt better if they gave it 25 episodes. PityHowever, as a follower of the Muv-Luv series, I couldn\'t help but watch the whole thing until the end. It was refreshing to see and there haven\'t been too many mecha animes recently (relatively speaking) that i can recall.STORY (6/10)It tickles the history nerd in me to see someones take on a crazy question: ""What if very anti-human aliens decided to visit Earth during the Cold War?""An already unstable period becoming even more unstable! Perfect, what more could you want?The world has just \'recovered\' from WWII and everyone should be good with things, but humans aren\'t a peaceful bunch. Queue the Cold War! Red Vs Blue! But wait, the BETA appear, maybe people can finally get together, trust each other, and work as a cohesive group.Nah, screw that, who needs that when you can get all the power you want? The Black Marks portrays the bad side of people and how dark politics and war can really get. Forget the romanticizing, if you\'re new to dark anime and you want to get a teaser of what the dark side is like, this series is a good introduction. See how humans are just as much a problem as aliens are!I personally like stories like this, which is why i watched the thing in the first place. I find that Despair and Hope (especially in the middle of a war) are very exciting themes to any anime, and the onset of an seemingly unending alien force that wants to annihilate you, your family, your cow and every one else to be a good prompt for even more themes.There are a *few* plot holes that i wish they filled out properly. Nothing major, but they did add one too many spoons of Deus Ex Machina for my taste. Then again, I could just be negative like that. Entertainment like this wouldn\'t be entertainment if it was completely realistic, so i think it went down fairly smoothlyArt and Sound (6.5/10)The OP and ED aren\'t bad, but they aren\'t the best.I\'m sure they can get some peoples blood up, for sure, butI\'m just not the type to look at the music of an anime into that much detail.It\'s SFX where quite nice. It sounded quite typical for a mecha/war anime, but not cheesy or corny.The art seems like it\'s new-gen art on a budget. It fills out the basic ideas of many of the images, but some details were not given any effort, such as the deck of the battleships in one of the scenes, or the uniform details on some of the characters.The art isn\'t stiff, however, and most (if not all) of the parts fitted well into the wholeCharacter (7/10)I actually liked the characters in this one. I\'m biased, deal with it.Most didn\'t lack substance, considering the time of the anime and most of the 666th squad seemed to build on something at least. The members were given equal attention which made them fairly emotionally invest-able to the watcher. There were some lines, however, that didn\'t seem to fit and felt like they were put there just to give weight to the current event or character for that one single moment, so it was a little shallow.Enjoyment (9/10) (Slight Spoilers)I gave it a Nine for a few reasons:-It\'s a dark anime.

Yussssss, i thought it was a dead series.', 'Schwarzesmarken is an anime that focus about human rivalry and political tension in the middle of a war with alien invaders. I think this anime got ignored (maybe because of it being of muv luv universe or being mecha which a lot of people seem to dislike) but I want that people would give a chance to this great anime.So as said Schwarzesmarken focus on the humans in Europe (east Germany to be precise) and about their on going war with the BETA, an alien invaders that took most of Asia in a very short time. Being the last defense line of Europe, the elite...unit of ""Schwarzesmarken"" need to defend their country while also dealing with secret police, political tension with west Germany and the UN and of course internal conflicts. The show does a great job showing us that even in the face of humanity fiercest enemy, humans still won\'t get along and fight each other, possibly risking everything to get their ambitions.We see ideals clashes and political discussions which are very interesting, but we also get a good balance of action-mecha fights and military operations, whether it\'s against humans or against BETA. The story is without a doubt the strongest point of the story.Unfortunately, it isn\'t the same for the characters. There is a large cast and we can\'t get enough focus about everyone. Sure, the main character Theodor Eberbach start as a schmuck and get a character development. But we can say it only about him. The rest are either without personality, or with one gimmick that make them who their are (one is a bitch, one is a strong head etc).We have also Katia, which is a great character. While at first seems like a Moe blob that only cries, she is tough and have strong personality-but Katia being cool doesn\'t fix the rest of the characters-problems that could be fix with more episodes and more time to focus about them.For example Beatrix brehme, which built up to be a big villain, was  a cardboard character without nothing to make her stand out except her cool design, a shame, really.The designs overall were good. There was a lot of doubt about it before it came out but the art and animation were good. Nothing that stands out, but good. The voice acting was excellent.The music fit nicely to the show, and was pleasant to hear.Overall, Schwarzesmarken is a great anime. I enjoyed every second of it. I think more people should give it a chance because it was mostly ignored when it aired. The only people who paid attention to it were fans of the franchise, and I believe that even if you don\'t know Muv Luv or don\'t want to play the visual novels, you will still enjoy it, as a solid series with war setting and great Mecha battles. unit of ""Schwarzesmarken"" need to defend their country while also dealing with secret police, political tension with west Germany and the UN and of course internal conflicts.

It's 1983 and our heroes are part of a divided Germany and the BETA is pretty much at their doorstep.Luckily there isn't any real need to dive into the Muv Luv universe as a whole (it's great though), since the anime is pretty much a very good standalone gateway into the franchise itself.FripSide OP. I'm a big sucker for fripSide's music so this is a big plus for me haha. ED complements the show very well.The anime actually starts...off slow here, the first three episodes feels rushed and a little disjointed because of set up and character development etc, but it starts getting good around episode five, and it kept me waiting for a new episode every week.If you're into mecha, this is for you.

Yeah, if you are patient you should because it pays off in the end, and I do not regret seeing it. Minus points for the fanservice tho. should you see it?

Minus points for the fanservice tho."", ""My opinion:Schwarzesmarken tries to look original by covering its generic plot and characters with political matters, betrayals, Stasi officers and other chicaneries, it tries to arise emotions by needlessly killing off characters and tries to be memorable through cheesy scenes and lines that only made me cringe.I had hope in this show up to the moment they decided it is the best decision to make the MC have sex with his newly brought back from the dead sister.Story: 3/10The story takes place in 1980 portraying a divided Germany and the political battles it harbours as well presenting the battles of the East German Army's...666th TSF Squadron against the overwhelming numbers of BETA monster.The plot does have some good features such as describing the struggles of civilians during war, the sky being blue, the water being wet  and the grass  being green. Yeah, I just listed some random things because I couldn't find anything good about it.The premise of Schwarzesmarken is overused to the point that you think twice about watching it. It is the generic “survive the monster apocalypse” scenario that has been executed much better in other series, not having anything to distinguish itself from the rest of the similar themed anime shows.The plot is riddled with holes, cheesy scenes, cliche plot twists, utterly dumb decisions based on dumb reactions and meaningless deaths.These are some flaws I remember:1. The fact that the robots can fly removes most of the tension from the battles.2. The plot twists are predictable thus becoming annoying.3. The people are afraid of Stasi informants but they talk freely around mechanics and other staff members.4. Ludicrous lines such as “I love you, I would do anything for you. Onii-chan, take me.”5. Lots of meaningless deaths.6. Why is the 666 Squadron’s commander the country’s last hope?7. The sister x brother situation.8. The BETA monsters are intelligent creatures but not intelligent enough to make them interesting.9. Huge explosions resulting from small amounts of fuel.Characters: 2/10Most of the character are dull, one-dimensional and generic with the protagonist as an exception to the rule.We have the mature, cold on the outside but kind on the inside Irisdina , the airhead and mentally damaged Annet, the manly guy, the tough girl Sylvia, the caring and smiling Katia, the yandere Lise and a bunch of other characters that are not memorable.Theodor Eberbach is the protagonist of the series, at first I liked Theodor because he was a cold guy with a cool air about him but then he became a generic MC who says “I want to protect my friends” and that is about all the “development” his character receives.Lise Hohenstein is the yandere sister that fell in love with Theodor (her brother) and later decided to free him from that world by killing him. She does have an interesting background story as a Stasi dog but her character ultimately fails at making the show better.Captain Irisdina Bernhard is one of the main heroines of Schwarzesmarken, she is the leader of the 666 squadron and the starting point of a revolution. Irisdina’s character is dull and receives no development, the only part she plays is the hero captain for others to look up to.The villains of the series are boring, the BETA monsters are more intriguing than the so called villains.Aestethics: 7/10The animation is fluid containing enough gore and blood, the character design and backgrounds are fine but the monster design is bad.Sound: 3/10The opening theme is fine and the ending theme is decent but the insufficient and poor background music is a huge minus considering this show belongs to mecha and action genres.Enjoyment: 5/10I can’t say I liked or hated Schwarzesmarken, it was just another bad show that made me want to get it over with and left me with a “meh, I wasted my time” feeling. It did amuse me to a certain degree with its stupidity but I will forget all about watching it in one or two weeks.Overall: 3/10Schwarzesmarken brings nothing new to the table, it does not have a good plot or strong characters nor is it particularly engaging but it does have many flaws. I would not recommend watching Schwarzesmarken unless you really, really want to watch it. 666th TSF Squadron against the overwhelming numbers of BETA monster.The plot does have some good features such as describing the struggles of civilians during war, the sky being blue, the water being wet  and the grass  being green.

The people are afraid of Stasi informants but they talk freely around mechanics and other staff members.4. Ludicrous lines such as “I love you, I would do anything for you. Onii-chan, take me.”5. Lots of meaningless deaths.6. Why is the 666 Squadron’s commander the country’s last hope?7. The sister x brother situation.8. The BETA monsters are intelligent creatures but not intelligent enough to make them interesting.9. Huge explosions resulting from small amounts of fuel.Characters: 2/10Most of the character are dull, one-dimensional and generic with the protagonist as an exception to the rule.We have the mature, cold on the outside but kind on the inside Irisdina , the airhead and mentally damaged Annet, the manly guy, the tough girl Sylvia, the caring and smiling Katia, the yandere Lise and a bunch of other characters that are not memorable.Theodor Eberbach is the protagonist of the series, at first I liked Theodor because he was a cold guy with a cool air about him but then he became a generic MC who says “I want to protect my friends” and that is about all the “development” his character receives.Lise Hohenstein is the yandere sister that fell in love with Theodor (her brother) and later decided to free him from that world by killing him. She does have an interesting background story as a Stasi dog but her character ultimately fails at making the show better.Captain Irisdina Bernhard is one of the main heroines of Schwarzesmarken, she is the leader of the 666 squadron and the starting point of a revolution. Irisdina’s character is dull and receives no development, the only part she plays is the hero captain for others to look up to.The villains of the series are boring, the BETA monsters are more intriguing than the so called villains.Aestethics: 7/10The animation is fluid containing enough gore and blood, the character design and backgrounds are fine but the monster design is bad.Sound: 3/10The opening theme is fine and the ending theme is decent but the insufficient and poor background music is a huge minus considering this show belongs to mecha and action genres.Enjoyment: 5/10I can’t say I liked or hated Schwarzesmarken, it was just another bad show that made me want to get it over with and left me with a “meh, I wasted my time” feeling. It did amuse me to a certain degree with its stupidity but I will forget all about watching it in one or two weeks.Overall: 3/10Schwarzesmarken brings nothing new to the table, it does not have a good plot or strong characters nor is it particularly engaging but it does have many flaws. I would not recommend watching Schwarzesmarken unless you really, really want to watch it."", 'Yo Minna!Why not recall what happened to Germany after WWII? Germany was split into the ""Bundesrepublik Deutschland"" (west) and the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik-East Germany) and they kinda hated each other but it was more a reaction due to the Cold War. So you probably ask why is this related to an anime review? Well, the setting of this anime is an alternative version of East Germany in the 1980s. I was wondering if there was an anime that has that ""after WWII"" setting and this anime was close to it. The title was supposed to be in German with the meaning ""Black Marks"", but...it ended up being a grammar flop in my opinion. What should be ""Schwarze Marken"" became ""Schwarzesmarken"" in the end and here is the review to it.Plot and Story LineAs said in the intro, the plot of Schwarzesmarken tkes place in an alternative version of East Germany in the 1980s. West Germany is also there and as our history books, the anime too, shows the hatred between the two sides. Of course history alone would be too boring in an anime, so the makers of Schwarzesmrken added up a little drama, a little bit of Sci-Fi and some Mecha-military action. Out came an anime that has a solid and interesting plot with a couple of good background stories and full of action, drama and intrigue. But what is this anime actually about?Well, in such a divided Germany, a new species of extraterrestrial origin called BETA are doing everything just to destroy the world. They are really ugly and creepy monsters that come in all forms and sizes. The story of Schwarzesmarken follows the East Germany Army\'s  666th TSF Squadron, also known as the ""Black Marks"". With Mecha suits that we\'ve unfortunately seen so many times and the most advanced technology, they fight the BETA in order to free the planet of those extremely dangerous creatures.The all BETA story is actually just the foundation of the anime. The highlight of the story is actually a set of circumstances that involve our main characters Theodor Eberbach, Irisdina Bernhard, Katia Waldheim and Lise Hohenstein into the political tensions between the two Germanies.When I firstly started watching Schwarzesmarken I thought that this is gonna end up as one more ""kill the ugly creatures that want to destroy human kind"" anime, but it did not. Because in all that awesome action fights with the BETA comes that intriguing political tension drama between the the East and the West. Not being enough to all that politics comes up another mystery side story about Katia, who she really is and where she actually comes from.  And after some episodes Theodor\'s past catches up and just adds up with all the drama from before. Trust me guys, the show becomes something like an anime soap opera, but a very good one to be honest. That\'s exactly what makes the anime so good. You have all that military action and in the middle of it some drama between our main protagonist. Of course, romance too. In that way, Schwarzesmarken has something for everyone\'s soul.The thing that I liked the most about Schwarzesmarken is definitely the link to the past and the situation in the Cold War. I always wanted to watch an anime based on the happenings after WWII and that\'s why I decided to watch this one. True the BETA stuff wasn\'t a thing I was expecting, but it ended up being a good anime. You really get the feeling of all the hatred and the tensions between the East and West.The story of Schwarzesmarken is a little bit complex, but so intriguing and amazing that you won\'t regret watching it. Of course, action overload and amazing mecha fights. And all that fits perfectly into 12 episodes which is also the reason this anime got an ""Honorable mention"" in ""My Top 5 Anime You Can Watch in Less Than 6h"".CharactersThis is another good part of Schwarzesmarken-the characters. They are all realistic personalities and very interesting too.My personal favorite was the leader of the 666th Squadron, Irisdina Bernhard. She is a tough leader and a very independent young woman. She has to bear much pressure on her shoulders being the hero of the nation. Also there is no doubt that her exemplary leadership and tactical skill are the key for the survival and ongoing success of her team.Also very important in the Schwarzesmarken story is our little Katia Waldheim. She is extremely idealistic, hardworking and adored by the maintenance crew. She has a natural talent and good instinct when it comes to piloting the TSF. She does seem like that overly perfect character that annoys you from time to time, but she is not. Besides, her background story becomes the most intriguing part of the anime so...Animation and StyleThe Animation of Schwarzesmarken is okay. It is definitely not bad, but not a masterpiece either. I think the colors could have been a little bit brighter, they are too dull in my opinion. And since everything is most of the time covered in snow, you don\'t get to enjoy beautiful backgrounds and stuff. The style is aso not special but again, also not bad. It is an ordinary anime style with no special extras. The one thing that the makers could have changed is the style of the robots, the TSF. Giving them a different name doesn\'t make the more special than the ones in Code Geass, Giulty Crown etc. I was disappointed, considering the fact that Germany is the leader in the mechanic industry. They could have come up with something new.ConclusionOn the whole, Schwarzesmarken is a very good anime with a lot of action first of all. The fights and the battle tactics are amazing and very interesting. Linking to the past events in German history, Schwarzesmarken chooses the perfect setting for a political drama like the one we have here. Still there are so many more amazing things that are coming which I can\'t tell because they would be huge spoilers.

I recommend, watch Schwarzesmarken and enjoy!', ""Schwarzmarken is a show that handles a lot of themes without turning into a mess. Its a show that has a slow pacing so I would not be for everyone however it makes for a good popcorn anime (anime that you can waste your time on if you have time to waste).Story 7/10Schwarzesmarken follows a group of mech pilots in east Germany that is in a cold war situation where the berlin wall is still up. They are using mechs to combat a threat against humanity known as the beta which are these aliens. The main story is not about the mechs versus...the aliens but the pressure the pilots face at home where a corrupt government is breathing down their neck every second they are off the battlefield. As I said it is popcorn anime so the story is not the most major aspect what you come to see are the mechs fighting and the scenes where the corrupt government show their true colors.Art 6/10The art used in this anime is kind of bland other than the characters faces and hair. Every character in the show are all wearing the same uniforms throughout the anime. All the backgrounds seem to be reused a lot for both off and on battle scenes. The mechs and aliens used where CGI but like the costumes all the mechs are the same just with a different color  for other groups of pilots. A lot of the animations used for aliens and mechs seem to be reused a lot in the fight scenes.  There is censorship in the scenes where we see aliens kill people which is half the screen being covered in black which is a problem since those are the scenes the aliens would have the most impact.Sound 5/10The music was not really memorable in this anime and neither where the sound effects. when watching the subbed version of the anime I liked how the characters where able to say German words and phrases effectively.Character 7/10The squad of pilots in the anime consist of some likable characters(except Anette who was useless). The characters just want to fight the aliens but hate how they have to deal with spies from the government hiding among st them. It takes a while for characters in the anime to figure out who to trust. A lot of the squad do get a good portion of screen time while a few other characters in the main squad don't. The human villains in the anime are pretty cliche with a massive ego to boot which makes you wish to see them get their comeuppance at some point.Enjoyment 7/10As I say this is a popcorn anime that I used to kill some time I dont think anyone can binge watch it because it does not absorb you or get you wanting more.Overall 7/10 the aliens but the pressure the pilots face at home where a corrupt government is breathing down their neck every second they are off the battlefield.

This anime does look into what happens...when humans go to their extremes in order for peace or destruction through political and militaristic means, as well as what relationships between people can do through those extremes.The plot does have somewhat a slow start but does get intense with plot twists and political dealings and betrayals later on, yes this anime is edgy although LA will say it kinda has the right to be called this due to the setting alone, the aliens are just icing on the cake. There are A LOT of deaths and some of the more coming from the main cast do impact the story and characters to change society in this derelict-power mongering world they are in.In terms of characters, due to how the story is ruthless to it\'s characters both emotionally and development-wise to the cast in general you will grow attached to both the 666th TSF Squad or the individual characters as they have a lofty goal they want to strife for to see, thus even the ""obvious death flag main cast\'s deaths"" contribute to the characters wanting even more to strife for their goal, the villains themselves are extremely clever (though the political faction are kinda evil for evil sakes cliched), but LA will say that a great villain from this anime comes from Beatrix Brehme voiced by \'\'Yukari Tamura\'\', LA won\'t say much but she directly contrasts to the 666th TSF Squad\'s ambitions as well.In terms of animation by ixtl and LIDENFILMS, well the character designs are pretty distinct from one another due to either their accessories or hair color and style (although LA always confused Circe Steinhoff and Gretel Jeckeln), backgrounding was very well done as it evoked Winter in Europe quite well as well overall some good backgrounding overall. The mech\'s go in between CGI and traditional and to be perfectly honest the mech designs are outright awesome to look at (though it\'s like any mech designs with some accessories here and there), now onto the CGI aliens, yes, they used CGI on the alien but LA can ignore this as they ARE SUPPOSE to look ""ugly and alien"", finally the battle scenes overall were impressive to watch and were animated quite well it became even more intense when the plot reaches it\'s intensity.The ending by all means wrap up some loose plotlines and LA will say the ending was a decent climax with a plot twist that makes it somewhat depressing at the same time, nonetheless the ending gave LA quite the impression.Schwarezesmarken is LA\'s first entryway to the Muv Luv series and really by all means with what LA has been saying about this anime\'s characters, plot and themes alone got LA interested and this anime might be a hidden gem of Winter 2016 if only people just didn\'t look at this anime as ""edgy"" and nothing more. Because of this, LA \'\'might\'\' look the Total Eclipse after this...good job Schwarezesmarken you got LA interested in your franchise. when humans go to their extremes in order for peace or destruction through political and militaristic means, as well as what relationships between people can do through those extremes.The plot does have somewhat a slow start but does get intense with plot twists and political dealings and betrayals later on, yes this anime is edgy although LA will say it kinda has the right to be called this due to the setting alone, the aliens are just icing on the cake.

Schwarzesmarken seems to be a generic mecha v monster anime (Muv-Luv, Gunparade March, and so on) but it is far more than that.Schwarzesmarken is an entry in the Muv-Luv universe, but it cuts out some of the romance and focuses on the setting and story, which in my opinion helps it go above and beyond others of it's kind. It tells the story of the BETA invasion into Europe, focusing on East Germany during the (BETA are strange-ass aliens who invaded Earth,...for those who haven't seen Muv-Luv) and simultaneously delivers a commentary on the global political scenario present during the 1980's and the aftereffects of the Cold War. This, while incorporating drama and plot-twists, as well as good ol' mecha action. Too much? No.Story 8.5/10 :I don't believe in generous marking personally, but Schwarzesmarken merits an 8.5. As said before, it successfully incorporates drama, idealism, a little romance, and pretty good action into one show, without individually detracting from any of them. The idealism might make you wince at times, but the tale told about the 666th Squadron's fight against both the BETA and human foes is an enthralling one.Art 8/10:The art is good, but nothing to write home about. The action sequences are well animated, and the backgrounds and character designs suit the grittiness of the narrative. Some of the mech CGI sequences are a little iffy, but when isn't CGI iffy?Sound 7/10:The sound did it's job, but again, nothing special. The OP sets the scene well, while the ED is average. The BGM complements the show well, however.Characters 9/10:Now, this is where Schwarzesmarken shines. The main characters have detailed and comprehensive backstories, and for a 12-episode anime the character development is phenomenal, if a little focused. The interactions between the squad, and our protagonist's ideological leaps and emotional growth are a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast could have done with a little more time, but we can't have everything. The cast also, surprisingly, seems to avoid falling into the tropes and character archetypes that haunt anime for the most part, which in itself is intriguing. (Well, not the idealistic I-wanna-save-the-world loli, but she doesn't really ruin it.)Enjoyment 9/10:If the message hasn't gotten across, THIS SHOW IS WORTH YOUR TIME.The first few episodes are a little dull, and full of cliches, which might be why people don't like the anime, but if you stick it out, you'll certainly conclude this anime with satisfaction, and perhaps, a little wistfulness.It is perhaps not a masterpiece, but it's certainly better than most anime out there, and has a little something to suit every viewer's tastes.

Based in East Germany in 1983 during the eatly years of the BETA invasion it shows a bunch of sub-plots that are fairly interesting.The main storry follows the 666º TFS Squadron, also known as ""The Number Of The Beast· (Schwarzesmarken), leaded by Captain Irisdina Benrhard. The main character is Theodor Eberbach, a pilot that got caught by the Stasi while he was trying to escape with his family through the Berlin Wall, since then he was tortured and forced to work for the army.Almost all of the characters are interesting, having to live...and fight against their inner fears, like being afraid of losing a teammate or a family member. The character development is well done and you can see episode by episode how they are evolving, getting closer, trusting (and untristing, sometimes) each other.Animation is good in general, I haven\'t noticed a low point in this one. Action scenes are the best part, although I\'ve never liked the way the BETAs looks, th TSF moves are really good and the effects in their attacks are also well exectuded, CGI isn\'t annoying and you can enjoy it a lot.The lowest point, I\'ve got to admit, are the anachronism, like ""how did they get to have TSF in the 80\'s"" and stuff like that. But since it\'s in an alternative universe I think that\'s acceptable. and fight against their inner fears, like being afraid of losing a teammate or a family member.

Whilst I originally intended this as a blanket derogatory comment on the pornography of plot and character (not actual pornography of course - as that\'s usually on message) I should have known that eventually something would show up that would make me eat my own words.Yes .. there are women with exceptionally large breasts .. and yes they are driving robots. But something about the tyrannical despot background gives it all a complex, thrilling, savage, manipulative and incestuous edge that is...frankly incredibly impressive in an I-Claudius, first few season game of thrones type way. For the avoidance of doubt and with my humble apologies to those who have not learned English to a native level - those are the right words even though you may not fully understand why till you watch it.Of course, if you found this review in any way offensive I would strongly advise avoiding this, but if you are at the most mildy offended and are still intrigued I\'d strongly suggest at least an attempted viewing. Took me a lot of booze and a couple of goes to loosen up enough get past episode 1 but I promise that neither myself or my prim elitist tendancies regretted anything about it the next morning. frankly incredibly impressive in an I-Claudius, first few season game of thrones type way.

If it weren't for my will...to finish all animes I started, I would've dropped this because of the terrible plot and character build.

It doesn\'t matter whether it\'s MAL-TE or this or any upcoming sequel or prequel the setting was just too ill fitted...to such time line, so:Storywise, the prequel focuses on man\'s struggle with not only with the swarms of BETAs, but within its own struggles inside an oppressive state. Now forget about the plot where a group of veterans whose reputation for kicking the BETAs butt were outstanding, the real plot was more on the geopolitics of the cold war and it was very good that original creator Uchida-san nail it very well, cu\'z during the cold war such purges and paranoia does exist within the once reputed ""IRON CURTAIN"". And yes the things we see in the anime did have such reality during the cold war.The art, was impressive and one wouldn\'t find any knee high sock wearing bimbo, nor would one find a Yamato Nadeshiku, though one would still find a usual white haired girl, red head and a blond girl. I never understand as to why character designer Hara Suuchi did follow the standard uniform of the National Peoples Army and instead used the standard green fatigue uniform that the JSDF wore during the 70\'s. Also, I can\'t seem to dig as to why Katia and Lise have to look like lolis.Sound.........well, for the opening I do like when it was preformed by Fripside,   but not the closing, also I do find the seiyu who did Katia\'s voice as annoying, since it kinda make her the way she is, an naive little girl, who has no idea of what she\'s getting into. Also, the voice of Lise really did make up as this deceptive crazy girl the way the character is.Now for the characters of this anime, aside from the fact that some of the character\'s name were hardly German, nearly all of which where portrayed as a bunch of Stoic individual whom have no other option but to accept their fate in the hands of their oppressor the Stasi, however each character were a different kind of stoic human being, like Theodore Eberbach  was portrayed as this distrusting stoic character who is just trying to hid from the Stasi\'s radar by accepting his sacred duty to protect East Germany, but in reality he\'s in survival mode and just wanna live long enough until the BETAs get him, though he was suppose to have a relationship with a supposed Stasi Dog, Irisdina, it came too little too late, cu\'z Irisdina have to die in the hands of an opportunistic Stasi dog who is a CIA doggy wannabe Axman. Now, I hate the fact that Theodore was basically portrayed to be both a siscon and a lolicon, given that his sister Lise made love to him and Katia, being deigned as this young girl who maybe 16 was being made to be in a relationship with Theodore whom we can say is probably 25 , now don\'t that look like corrupting  a minor? Oh, and his surname Eberbach is Jewish. Now as for the main girl Irisdina Brendhard, her name is hardy German or at least her surname which is Saxon btw, now I kinda like that she is portrayed as this stoic who know how to get around, but I kinda hate it when she has a 2nd in command Gretel Jeckeln whom I can\'t say at first as to whose side she is, and her surname Jeckeln is Welsh , there is also  Thi-Rang Pham, who is name is Vietnamese, so why would someone from South East Asia doing in Europe? Now I could go on but then again there is no point. But I\'ve notice that most violence where often done on the girls, which kinda make me sympathize with the female characters and at time make me wanna bash the original creator for such violence on women.The Enjoyment for me was the part when the Stasi got owned and Gemany was united, but I can ignore as to how this anime exudes such violence on women, why, well Irsidina was often seen being bullied by Axman and Beatrix,  Anette suffering some kind of nervous breakdown, Lise giving up her humanity just to be with Theodore, Phram and Sylvia receiving such domestic type of violence in the hands of the Stasi, Gretel getting her ass kicked by a crazy chick with brocon syndrome and Irisdina getting shot by Axman, let not forget the lolicon element for Theodore and Katia, so for that:Overall, it\'s a ""4"" since this kind of anime should only be watched by guys and guys only, definitely not for girls with feminist ideas. to such time line, so:Storywise, the prequel focuses on man\'s struggle with not only with the swarms of BETAs, but within its own struggles inside an oppressive state.

The same applies to Schwarzes Marken: the greatest enemies are humanity itself rather than the aliens. Full of intrigue and politics, humans try to fight the threat of the Beta while fighting hunger, inequality, poverty and, above all, human rot, and it is very interesting to see how self-interests are placed above a greater good. The story is closed and ends without loose ends, with a sad ending but...at the same time very beautiful. I do not give full marks for the fact that the fights of the robots controlled by humans against the Beta have very funny effects.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------A obra me lembra the walking dead, onde os que mais deveriam ser temidos são os mortos-vivos, no entanto os vivos são os que deve-se tomar mais cuidado.

Cheio de intrigas e politicagens, os humanos tentam combater a ameaça dos Beta enquanto lutam contra a fome, desigualdade, pobreza e principalmente a podridão humana, e é muito interessante ver como interesses próprios são colocados acima de um bem maior.

However, Earth was now under threat from an alien race known as the ""BETA"" that devours any human they find. Irisdinia was now a hero, captain of the 666th Squadron ""Schwarzesmarken"", responsible for wiping out Laser Class BETA which were the greatest threat against human forces due to their long range beams.While out repelling an invasion they come across a distress signal from a lone UN TSF. Katia is...rescued and is taken in by the squadron under asylum as they needed someone capable to replace one of their lost members. Watched over by Theodore, Katia reminds him a lot of his sister Lise who he got separated from while trying to flee from the Stasi to the Western border. As Katia continues to secretly search for her convicted lost father despite the risk of being apprehended by the Stasi, Theodore continues to be haunted by his own ordeal with the Stasi but he soon finds himself fighting against more than just the BETA.This is an OVA that\'s a prequel to the Muv Luv spin-off ""Muv Luv Alternative"" that takes place 18 years prior. It gives you a quick crash course on the Alternative universe during the opening first episode but it would probably be best if you you\'ve seen the older prequel, Total Eclipse which gives a better picture of the world setting.Like Total Eclipse it starts off similarly filled with angst, doom and gloom but doesn\'t lighten up as the show goes on. You have to pay attention fairly closely to understand what\'s going on and even then, you\'d need a bit of historical background on Germany to know what\'s what. As usual, the character development keeps the show interesting as you watch them grow through their struggles and there are some intense fights but there are also a few ""WTH!?"" out-of-the-blue random moments. Fan service and gore are both mild compared to Total Eclipse but there are some brief scenes of sexual exploitation.Be sure to watch on after the ending credits as there\'s more to each episode. rescued and is taken in by the squadron under asylum as they needed someone capable to replace one of their lost members.

That said Schwarzesmarken is a step above most mecha in that it doesn't involve a genius high school boy who defeats the enemy with a brilliant plan one one in the entire world's military thought of. The action is exciting and fun, the geopolitics and history is fascinating and the characters have understandable motivations.However, the main flaw is the anime trying to juggle too many things at once and not entirely succeeding at all of them....Trying to fit in the harem romance, intrigue, warfare, deception, etc is difficult and drags what could be an excellent anime to merely pretty good.Mecha Octane Rating: 8/10 The attempt at using actual tactics and teamwork instead of last minute bursts of understanding and guts make this better than most mecha anime.Harem Development Index: 1/10 It's hard to even argue that it is a harem, but the MC is surrounded by beautiful ladies and there's brief scenes of possible romance that go nowhere.

Schwarzesmarken is supposedly the best mech platoon in Eastern Germany, and charged with performing surgical strikes to give the country a chance. Our protagonist, a young, disagreeable pilot, serves on this mech squad where he must survive countless waves of ugly CGI aliens and the generous breast sizes of his fellow pilots. However, his country is also under dire straits internally as various government factions vie for control, leading to Stalin-style purges and wasted resources. Will his unit survive the...dual threat of alien invasion and internal civil war?Let me preface the rest of the review by noting that this is the first work I\'ve seen in the Muv-Luv universe. Schwarzesmarken is an action-based mech show with a very pessimistic overall mood- full of random killings, deaths, betrayals, and really just anything to compare the worst of humanity with the worst the aliens can bring. I\'ve read of some people having PTSD after watching Total Eclipse- while I didn\'t experience anything to that level here I would say that it\'s probably comparable to Aldnoah Zero. While it is a pretty engaging watch from a thriller perspective, it isn\'t full of particularly smart people; bad choices are made pretty much throughout the entire plot. Furthermore, the story is rife with inconsistencies and gotchas that are jarring and off-putting. If you\'re just looking for some action and don\'t mind the plot, it\'s a pretty fun watch. Otherwise, I\'d say this is only average at best.Animation:I came across mixed overall for the animation in the show. I liked how they set the dark atmosphere with moody clouds and many grays in the palette but more often than not, this was overshadowed by ugly CGI and rather repulsive and anatomically illogical aliens- though I have to say the laser-class aliens add a humorously cute flair to the otherwise dreadful alien mobs. The mechs are also drawn via CGI and though they\'re better than those a decade ago, movements still feel off occasionally. The characters themselves are fairly diverse in appearance though most of the girls are overly proportioned in the chest region. The show also uses overly-heavy eye shadows on the girls, which just makes the antagonists\' instant-giveaway look all the more apparent. I also found the mech outfits rather outlandish; seems to be specifically tailored to highlight bouncy parts. Expressions are pretty generic and other than a few sequences with Katia, rather bland overall.The show has a lot of action, be it mech battles against mechs or aliens or ground warfare with conventional arms. Though a majority of the show is just bullet spamming, some of the sequences aren\'t bad (even a few moments of tactical brilliance) - I\'d still put it a few levels beneath a Gundam show, however. There is a lot of death and a bit of gore, though the camera angle tends to shy away from the bloodiest scenes. Given the rather serious tonality of the show, there isn\'t much accidental ecchi here. Other than the obvious harem-friendly figures of the female cast, there are just a few suggestive scenes.Sound:The show opens with a fast-paced OP with a nice melody and the typical electronic instrumentation of FripSide (think Railgun). The ED is a cool down piece by two of the VAs- the first few measures would probably fit just as well in a breakup scene in a drama. The BGM is pretty well utilized with a wide range of instrumentation. Peaceful moments are full of light orchestral and piano pieces with wide reverb. Battles are much more intense with vocal choirs and brass/electronic instrumentation joining the string-leads, some pieces here are particularly good both melodically and in giving a sense of tension.The VA cast, like the character cast, is quite huge; there are some notable surprises though. I think Nozomi Yamamoto gives by far the strongest performance here. She gives her character a commanding yet reassuring feel, which is just perfect for her role. It is also impressively different from her previous role as Julie in Absolute Duo. I think this is also one of the first roles in which I\'ve seen Yukari Tamura play an antagonist; though in this case her character doesn\'t have much depth.Story:Schwarzesmarken tells a fast-paced yet vile story about our inability to work with each other. It is a fine plot for those who don\'t try to poke holes at it, but unfortunately for me poking around is what I like doing. If you really dig into it, this story is chuck full of inconsistencies, miracles, and improbable circumstances; unfortunately, many of these surface too late in the show to divulge in this review.The story follows one central plotline that pivots wildly between various events; you really are just along for the ride. Many of the show\'s twists are predictable, some are along the lines of things you don\'t want to be true but know will be true... The show builds to a final, mech battle climax that is a bit of a letdown given the falling action. This is followed by a fair conclusion that ties up loose ends fairly well. I still can\'t get over the fact that, despite having advanced mech technology, they don\'t try at all to save their injured.If you\'re looking for a thriller with lots of last second saves and plenty of action, this is your kind of story. If you\'re looking for thought-provoking political dialogue or any real depth to the almost universal mech question of ""why are we fighting"", you won\'t find it here. The disposability of the famous ""Schwarzesmarken"" team members really leaves a sour aftertaste for me.Character:This is kind of a mess. If you check the character ratings for the show on anidb, you\'ll see that most of them are horridly rated. There are many issues in this section that would negatively affect the characters. First, the huge breadth of primary and supporting characters makes it difficult for the viewer to relate to everyone. Second, the show attempts to make as many characters dynamic as possible; this only backfires as it makes a lot of characters (such as Kirce) feel very simple-minded. Third, the show can\'t choose whom to pair up with the protagonist, I counted five potential visual novel potential routes in this animation. Fourth, despite the incredibly important nature of Katia to the story\'s plot, she gets relatively little development- often just shoved aside by Lise. Which brings up number five, Lise is just an unnecessary distraction that ends in exactly how one would predict. Finally, sixth, the antagonists are abhorrent cookie-cutter villains with no depth.I usually like dynamism in characters, but the usage in this show just feels cheesy. This combined with unstable character relationships (especially those involving the protagonist) really bring down this section.Value:Schwarzesmarken is a relatively dark show. Perhaps there is some parallels with the real world situation of today; but philosophizing aside, the show\'s fairly good production and entertainment values are overshadowed by an inconsistent storyline and weak characters- and no I\'m not just ranting about the various pointless deaths in the show. I\'m going to go on a limb and say this is a good watch for those who liked Valvrave- lots of interesting mech battles but little if any real core substance and heart. dual threat of alien invasion and internal civil war?Let me preface the rest of the review by noting that this is the first work I\'ve seen in the Muv-Luv universe.

I still can\'t get over the fact that, despite having advanced mech technology, they don\'t try at all to save their injured.If you\'re looking for a thriller with lots of last second saves and plenty of action, this is your kind of story. If you\'re looking for thought-provoking political dialogue or any real depth to the almost universal mech question of ""why are we fighting"", you won\'t find it here. The disposability of the famous ""Schwarzesmarken"" team members really leaves a sour aftertaste for me.Character:This is kind of a mess. If you check the character ratings for the show on anidb, you\'ll see that most of them are horridly rated. There are many issues in this section that would negatively affect the characters. First, the huge breadth of primary and supporting characters makes it difficult for the viewer to relate to everyone. Second, the show attempts to make as many characters dynamic as possible; this only backfires as it makes a lot of characters (such as Kirce) feel very simple-minded. Third, the show can\'t choose whom to pair up with the protagonist, I counted five potential visual novel potential routes in this animation. Fourth, despite the incredibly important nature of Katia to the story\'s plot, she gets relatively little development- often just shoved aside by Lise. Which brings up number five, Lise is just an unnecessary distraction that ends in exactly how one would predict. Finally, sixth, the antagonists are abhorrent cookie-cutter villains with no depth.I usually like dynamism in characters, but the usage in this show just feels cheesy. This combined with unstable character relationships (especially those involving the protagonist) really bring down this section.Value:Schwarzesmarken is a relatively dark show. Perhaps there is some parallels with the real world situation of today; but philosophizing aside, the show\'s fairly good production and entertainment values are overshadowed by an inconsistent storyline and weak characters- and no I\'m not just ranting about the various pointless deaths in the show. I\'m going to go on a limb and say this is a good watch for those who liked Valvrave- lots of interesting mech battles but little if any real core substance and heart.', 'WARNING: MAY BE LONG AND CONTAIN SPOILERSreview proper starts in the third paragraphSchwarzesmarken (or Black Mark as I\'ll continue calling it in this review) is an anime I watched to try and get my action-thriller fix, nothing more. I had no expectations going into it as just a cursory glance at the plot synopsis immediately brought horrible flashes of awful mecha-action war stories that attempt to rip off gundam series. Wouldn\'t you know it Black Mark became one of my personal sleeper hits of all the anime I watched this year. It has a surprising amount of competence in writing, production, and characterization and...it now serves as one of my go-to examples on how to write conflict. I\'ll try to convey my pleasant surprise in this review. On a side note; this anime is part of the Muv Luv franchise which I did not know until after I watched it and was somewhat surprised then I compared the character designs to KimiNozu and everything made sense. But anyways you really don\'t need to know anything about the Muv Luv franchise to get into this show.Black Mark takes place in an alternative history setting where soon after World War 2 ended the planet got invaded by some ugly ass aliens called Beta who started a war with humanity forcing them to come together in a time where political and social ideologies between the greatest powers in the world could not be more in opposition with each other. Germany has been split as it did in the real world and, like in reality, East Germany plays host to the Stasi, or secret police, whose job it is to eliminate any traitors to their ideology. We follow the story of several mecha pilots (of course we developed advanced mecha suits in the mid-20th century because why not?) from East Germany who compose an elite team that exterminates Beta in close combat missions. While on a mission the MC Theodor and comrades find and rescue a West German mecha pilot Katia and soon after, under Katia\'s request, they allow her to join their elite unit going against their supposed political principals. This among other things brings them into direct conflict with the Stasi and the anime continues with them struggling against both the Beta invasion and their own countrymen.I\'d say the strongest aspect of Black Mark is a simple yet strong sense of storytelling. Being a war-action story, this show attempts to tackle many different themes such as strength in unity, familial bonds, keeping hope against great odds of despair, etc just to name a few. And you know why I can list them like that? Because this anime perfectly manages to lay the frameworks for such themes very early on and dedicates a good amount of time building them up through the actions of our characters.It\'s easy to invest in the story and characters of Black Mark because it\'s so simple yet effective. There are clear stakes and end goals in the story. And I emphasize these stakes because it\'s what drives the story. Why should we care for Katia, Theodore and the rest of the 666th squadron trying to bring down the Stasi in the first place? Because if they don\'t they and everything they care for will be destroyed. Why should we care for them and the things they care about? Because we are shown in good detail why they do the things they do. Katia desires to unite the different worlds to fight against the Beta. Theodore wants to protect his sister and avenge his family who died at the hands of the Stasi. Irisdina also wants to avenge her family and protect the new one she gained in her comrades. Each character has clear motivations that drive them and the anime does a very good job emphasizing the pains they went through. Everything they do done to fulfill their goal. This makes each victory they achieve all the more sweeter for not just them but for us as well. The anime has some very well written dialogue at times that gives a clear picture of the situation the characters are in as well as what they think and feel. If you ever watch this anime it\'s good to keep asking ""why"" the characters are doing things and you\'ll very likely find an answer.Well after all that praise how come am I giving this anime a ""6"" score? Well, the biggest problem this anime has is it\'s extremely thin characterization. Whilst the characters themselves aren\'t badly written and are, in fact, quite compelling, they just don\'t have that much going for them outside of one-note traits. Katia, Theodore, his sister Lise, and Irisdina easily make up the most fleshed out characters in the show and even they struggle to get much characterization so you can imagine how little the rest of the fairly large cast gets. Theodore doesn\'t really become more than the generic edgy war orphan we\'ve often seen and Katia doesn\'t change much from being the idealist. Irisdina is probably the most interesting character with the most interesting backstory but she is unfortunately given way too little screentime to properly flesh out the details. She\'s still my favourite character though. Lise, despite being such an obvious villain, is unironically the one that changes the most as we see her struggle to get her brother to go off with her and leave everything behind. She\'s a great character as she serves as the antithesis to our characters- having lost all hope in herself and her ideals. However she also doesn\'t get much of a fleshed out background until nearly the very end and I find it unfortunate since she made for a compelling and understandable villain. Some of the character development also feels a bit forced at times especially early on when the anime goes for the ""war is hell"" route and it gets pretty predictable. Thankfully this doesn\'t happen often and Katia and Theodore get some great development in the second half. As for the rest of the characters, they don\'t get too much but I like them. Can\'\'t go wrong with your jaded, silent veterans and they feel like a genuine team and family to our characters which is the point. The Stasi themselves are pretty good villains in what they do but they also don\'t get much characterization themselves. An interesting and appreciated point though is that the Stasi orgnaisation in the anime is strongly divided with factionalization in contrast to our protagonists\' strong bonds and desire to unite the two different Germanys.The show is often interspersed with various action scenes where the squadron fight the Beta. The Beta are all CGI monstrosities which look incredibly ugly and jarring even amongst the mecha suits the characters\' fight in are also jarringly CGI. The fights all look mostly the same because they\'re always look to be fighting in the same snowy tundra. And I suspect there was some repeated footage at times. The fights aren\'t that badly directed though and they have great orchestral choral music that really rocks. Honestly, the music is such a highlight that the fight scenes are an unfortunate distraction from them. If you do watch then try listening to the absolute banger music during an action scene like in episode 4. There\'s so much tension and desperation in it to highlight the scene that it almost feels too good for the show. The rest of the animation is fairly alright. Nothing to right home about. It\'s got a lot of dull greys, whites, and browns that characterize the time period the story is set in. I didn\'t notice too many animation errors and I could tell this was well-produced. The direction and cinematography doesn\'t really change much throughout the show. If there isn\'t an action scene then the characters are mainly just standing around and talking. Oh yes, that was another small problem I had with the show. It doesn\'t really know how to convey information in ways other than pure expositionary dialogue. At least the characters and dialogue itself is surprisingly engaging and relevant but this anime has a pretty big ""tell don\'t show"" problem which just makes scenes feel samey throughout. Like, I think I\'ve seen them talk in the same church like five different times in three episodes.The OP and ED are wonderful to listen to and the classical BGM works very well. They almost sound like period pieces from the Cold War. The voice acting is alright. Nothing too outstanding. The cast is made up of a lot of seiyuu I don\'t recognize but they\'re pretty okay. Irisdina\'s voice acting was probably the best but she doesn\'t get too much screentime unfortunately.Overall Black Mark is s surprisingly competent anime that is not only good at telling a war story but a story in general. They present easy-to-understand stakes and motivations for our characters to drive the plot and they execute their themes very well. It is hobbled a bit by thin characterzation and too much exposition scenes but this anime\'s story is one I enjoyed following with it\'s characters and I\'m glad I randomly picked this up.

So i jumped to episode 5 and 8 and skipped around: same footage for the alien fights and the story rapidly jumped in episode 8. I got a real strong feeling this suffers the same fate as ""Gunparade March"" a great manga poorly translated to an anime by a small budget and crunched in episodes.This is not a focused anime on the series it\'s a rushed project to...capitalize on any success the manga had at the time of it\'s release. For that reason i had to bail. More then likely you could watch episodes 1 & 2, then 11 & 12 and the middle portion would be irrelevant and because of recycled footage your not missing out on any great fights and the story jumps make the middle fluff meaningless. So i did just that I watched episode 2, then 11 and 12... no thank you. Being slightly confused but overall getting the jist of it and read some of the other reviews. Ahhh a visual light novel... makes sense now. It\'s a rushed project capitalizing off it\'s success.Honestly gundam wing from the 90\'s has better animation then this or on par with something made in 2016 and has a fully flushed out story over way more then 12 episodes. What im saying is this show is a hard pass and after episode 1 i should have just junked it and left it at that. capitalize on any success the manga had at the time of it\'s release.

I wasn\'t too into the characters; I feel like the MC was very basic and quiet. The blonde captain had a decent story line, which plummeted. And all the other characters are just there. I liked the fight scenes and was interested in figuring out how the East and West would come together, but I started noticing the plot and dialogue was so repetitive. They kept mentioning the west and how big this war was - but all you saw was them fight the...alien BETAs and nothing else. They would just fight and talk about how bad it was. Like where is the plot? Where is this going? Is there more than just these battle scenes and repetitive comments about the east and west and spies and BETAS?I was going to complete the show, because in the first half I had it rated at a solid 7, but I dropped it as soon as they did the incest scene. The MCs long lost sister comes and joins his squad and everyone on the team thinks she\'s a spy for the enemy. Well, the team confronts her, and she runs off upset, her brother finds her and there she is naked in her room, saying ""brother, take me""... So, I watched half of the next episode because - ew yes, she\'s weird, her brother OBVIOUSLY will turn her down, shake her, call her crazy.Nope, he bangs her. SO freaking nasty. They don\'t show it, but in the beginning of the next episode it\'s basically mentioned. He says, ""she loves me so I have to gain her trust, which is why I started a relationship with her"" Um, what?? Yeah, so MC is a creep who banged his sister and this show went downhill. I couldn\'t even keep watching after that. Yes, she is his adoptive sister, but they were raised together since they were children. It\'s weird and gross.I don\'t recommend this. But you can watch it if you can get past the fact that the MC sleeps with his sister. wtf? alien BETAs and nothing else. They would just fight and talk about how bad it was. Like where is the plot?

Loveless,https://myanimelist.net/anime/149/Loveless,"[""It's rare that a series leaves me at a complete loss for words, and I really don't mean that in a good way. I've managed to gathered the words now though, and here they are:STORY - ...What story? Seriously, at what point is anything in this series explained? (Hint: never!) There are problems presented, sure -- Seimei, Ritsuka's older brother, was killed and he wants to find out who did it and why. Not really that intriguing or original, but it works, right? Additionally, Ritsuka has amnesia and is a &quot;completely different person&quot; than he was two years prior, but he doesn't know what happened....Also not that original, but still acceptable. Unfortunately, the series doesn't seem to focus very well on either problems and instead teases you by presenting a lot of leads that seem like they're going somewhere, but never do. Soubi, who should serve as Ritsuka's connection to Seimei refuses to say anything on the matter. In fact, as far as Rituska's troubles go, Soubi's pretty worthless for plot progression even if he does defend him from mysterious attackers (who are never explained). And his creepy shotacon ways seem like far, far too shameless an attempt to wind up the fangirls. I like shounen-ai well enough, and while I don't really care for shota, I can swallow it if it's done well. Well, this wasn't done well at all.The story's only redemption may be that Ritsuka's social anxieties are addressed gradually throughout the series, and the subplot concerning his personality change and memories does see some progress. In fact, it might even be considered a good storyline if we ever got to find out what happened to him, but we don't! Does that even count as a spoiler? The fact that ultimately, nothing happens? The plot with Seimei seemed like it had potential at times -- all of the vague, unexplained hints did seem like they were going somewhere, and if you cocked your head sideways, you might have even been able to pick up clues to the mystery. The last episode seemed like it was trying to explain what was going on, but it was so garbled and nonsensical that it's almost impossible to draw any kind of conclusions from it, and in the end, there's nothing but a big, gaping void where all your answers should be.The battle system in this series is something else that seemed to have potential. The concept of a Fighter and a Sacrifice is actually pretty interesting, though I think they would have survived without all the gratuitous bondage. Unfortunately, the actual fighting is never explained, and it's difficult to deduce where exactly anyone derives their power or how the mechanics of the fighting works. I really don't know why all of these things were sidestepped; it really doesn't seem like it should have taken that much time or effort to explain something that was so central to the whole Seven Moons and Seimei's murderers madness.I haven't read the manga, but I get this distinct feeling that it's probably ten times better than this anime, because certainly it can't be worse. Like I said, the wisps of story here and there seemed to have potential, and it was just frustrating to see that almost none of them have a definite conclusion. It seems like this should have been a twenty-six episode series instead of twelve, or they should have spent more time on actual plot progression instead of random shota fluff and molestation. In the end, I think I just wasted four hours of my life watching this series, and that's about it. And even though I'm sure the manga is better, I'm left so frustrated with the series that I'm not sure I even care enough to go read it.Addendum: The anime was apparently produced when only volumes 1-4 of the manga was out (the series is 8 volumes long), so they had limited source material. Still, I think they could have done a much better job -- certainly things like the fight system could have been addressed better anyway. And while they supposedly left the &quot;ending&quot; open for a possible sequel, there still could have still been an actual conclusion of some sort. But really, unless it's one of those long running shounen series, I don't think there's any reason to ever produce an anime for an unfinished series. It just leads to unpleasant bullshit like this and X/1999. :|CHARACTER - Ritsuka is probably the best character in the series, though that isn't really saying much. In any case, he seems to be the only character that goes through any significant change throughout the series. His turmoil at the beginning of Loveless is very understandable, what with a crazy mother, no memories, and a dead brother. The sessions with his psychologist summed up his development pretty well, though it did kind of seem like a cheap way to present everything to the audience. His relationship with his friends moved up in a classic line graph as he was somewhat sporadic and inconsistent in the beginning and steadily progressed up towards &quot;real friendship.&quot; His relationship with Soubi... I guess it really wasn't that bad; his reaction to Soubi's advances were realistic: his indignation, disgust, and eventual worry. You could see his feelings change slowly as the series went on, and the relationship did contribute to Ritsuka's overall personality progression, so to that end, I guess it was all right.Soubi is probably a much more multi-faceted character than the Loveless anime allowed him to be; I could tell by watching, but that didn't change the fact that he didn't end up being explored all that much. Because so little is revealed about his past, with Seimei or otherwise, you never know what his motivation for anything is, which was immensely irritating and frustrating. He tells Rituska some things, but then establishes a steady history of lies, so anything he says is questionable, even if they sound like they might, or even should, be true. Whether or not he really cares for Ritsuka always seems to be questionable, and his masochistic complex complicates the matter further -- not to mention it makes things ridiculously awkward. I think, in the end, you're supposed to gather that he's changed a little (for the better) since his days with Seimei, but it's really not that convincing at all.All of the other characters were pretty generic, and a lot of them seemed pretty damn pointless too. Rituska's school friends seemed like they could have been plucked out of any other anime Japanese school ever. Sure, they contributed to the plot and Ritsuka's development, but they really weren't that interesting to watch. Kio, Soubi's roommate? Classmate? Random friend? (Ex-)boyfriend? I have no idea what their relationship is because, surprise, they never explained, but he was only fun because he addressed some of my thoughts on Soubi, namely his apparent raging perversion and pedophilia (though Soubi consistently denied these accusations). But other than that, another generic support character? Yeah. The same goes for Ritsuka's teacher and his psychologist, and the fact that both of them were randomly in love with one of the protagonists seemed like more pointless fanservice. All of the fighter pairs sent from Seven Moons were flat and boring -- they were sent to fight, yippee. Did they have their own goals or aspirations? Who knows? Subplot with the lesbians? Seemed like a lame ploy to allow for a convenient winner of that fight. Complete lack of intrigue.Finally... this was the original reason I had no interest in watching this series. What the hell is the point of the cat ears? What does this contribute to anything at all? It just seems like a silly gimmick to invite giggles from the audience (fangirls think about this stuff anyway, do we really need to encourage them?), and to allow for lots of suggestive dialogue in the show. The only reason I could think of for this is to have &quot;proof&quot; that Soubi isn't randomly raping Ritsuka ('cause it sure seems like it sometimes). Here's an idea -- if your character is so inappropriate that you have to have a lame gimmick to prove his innocence, how about not writing him to be so outrageous in the first place? Certainly Soubi didn't need to make out with Ritsuka in the middle of every battle.ARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Resoundingly average. Ritsuka was cute and Soubi was your run-of-the-mill bishounen. All the other characters were similarly plain, and the backgrounds don't really invite rounds of praise either. None of it was bad, but none of it was great either. The animation was about the same, though I really thought the effects for the fights were unimpressive and cheap.MUSIC - I'd actually heard the opening theme, &quot;Tsuki no Curse,&quot; long before I saw this series because it was composed by Yuki Kaijura. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with it then, and I remained unimpressed with it in the series. I'm not really sure what it is about it, but it just doesn't stand up against most of Kaijura's other work. The end theme by Kaori Hikita was similarly plain. The music throughout the series actually surprised me by how random it seemed. Most series, even if they don't have particularly great music, still manage to get tracks that are appropriate for their scenes: sad tracks for sad scenes, energetic tracks for fights, etc. Loveless is probably the first series where I've been confused at their music choices for various scenes... They had weird, mecha-style battle tracks that were far, far too exciting for the scenes they were in, and then strange, melodious tracks that conflicted with conversation-heavy scenes. Occasionally, they had some nice, soft vocal tracks that seemed to fit okay, but they weren't prominent enough to balance out the other randomness.VOICE ACTING - Average.OVERALL - I think the best way to watch Loveless is to treat it as a drinking game. Take a shot of vodka every time Soubi says &quot;suki dayo&quot; (&quot;I like you&quot; or &quot;I love you&quot; depending on context and translator). You'll be mad drunk by the second episode (seriously, he's a broken record) and will thus be too wasted to realize that the entire series has little substance, never answers any of your questions, has no ending, and is ultimately unsatisfying. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go bash in the brains of the person who recommended this series to me. Also not that original, but still acceptable. Unfortunately, the series doesn't seem to focus very well on either problems and instead teases you by presenting a lot of leads that seem like they're going somewhere, but never do. Soubi, who should serve as Ritsuka's connection to Seimei refuses to say anything on the matter. In fact, as far as Rituska's troubles go, Soubi's pretty worthless for plot progression even if he does defend him from mysterious attackers (who are never explained). And his creepy shotacon ways seem like far, far too shameless an attempt to wind up the fangirls. I like shounen-ai well enough, and while I don't really care for shota, I can swallow it if it's done well. Well, this wasn't done well at all.The story's only redemption may be that Ritsuka's social anxieties are addressed gradually throughout the series, and the subplot concerning his personality change and memories does see some progress. In fact, it might even be considered a good storyline if we ever got to find out what happened to him, but we don't! Does that even count as a spoiler? The fact that ultimately, nothing happens? The plot with Seimei seemed like it had potential at times -- all of the vague, unexplained hints did seem like they were going somewhere, and if you cocked your head sideways, you might have even been able to pick up clues to the mystery. The last episode seemed like it was trying to explain what was going on, but it was so garbled and nonsensical that it's almost impossible to draw any kind of conclusions from it, and in the end, there's nothing but a big, gaping void where all your answers should be.The battle system in this series is something else that seemed to have potential. The concept of a Fighter and a Sacrifice is actually pretty interesting, though I think they would have survived without all the gratuitous bondage. Unfortunately, the actual fighting is never explained, and it's difficult to deduce where exactly anyone derives their power or how the mechanics of the fighting works. I really don't know why all of these things were sidestepped; it really doesn't seem like it should have taken that much time or effort to explain something that was so central to the whole Seven Moons and Seimei's murderers madness.I haven't read the manga, but I get this distinct feeling that it's probably ten times better than this anime, because certainly it can't be worse. Like I said, the wisps of story here and there seemed to have potential, and it was just frustrating to see that almost none of them have a definite conclusion. It seems like this should have been a twenty-six episode series instead of twelve, or they should have spent more time on actual plot progression instead of random shota fluff and molestation. In the end, I think I just wasted four hours of my life watching this series, and that's about it. And even though I'm sure the manga is better, I'm left so frustrated with the series that I'm not sure I even care enough to go read it.Addendum: The anime was apparently produced when only volumes 1-4 of the manga was out (the series is 8 volumes long), so they had limited source material. Still, I think they could have done a much better job -- certainly things like the fight system could have been addressed better anyway. And while they supposedly left the &quot;ending&quot; open for a possible sequel, there still could have still been an actual conclusion of some sort. But really, unless it's one of those long running shounen series, I don't think there's any reason to ever produce an anime for an unfinished series. It just leads to unpleasant bullshit like this and X/1999. :|CHARACTER - Ritsuka is probably the best character in the series, though that isn't really saying much. In any case, he seems to be the only character that goes through any significant change throughout the series. His turmoil at the beginning of Loveless is very understandable, what with a crazy mother, no memories, and a dead brother. The sessions with his psychologist summed up his development pretty well, though it did kind of seem like a cheap way to present everything to the audience. His relationship with his friends moved up in a classic line graph as he was somewhat sporadic and inconsistent in the beginning and steadily progressed up towards &quot;real friendship.&quot; His relationship with Soubi... I guess it really wasn't that bad; his reaction to Soubi's advances were realistic: his indignation, disgust, and eventual worry. You could see his feelings change slowly as the series went on, and the relationship did contribute to Ritsuka's overall personality progression, so to that end, I guess it was all right.Soubi is probably a much more multi-faceted character than the Loveless anime allowed him to be; I could tell by watching, but that didn't change the fact that he didn't end up being explored all that much. Because so little is revealed about his past, with Seimei or otherwise, you never know what his motivation for anything is, which was immensely irritating and frustrating. He tells Rituska some things, but then establishes a steady history of lies, so anything he says is questionable, even if they sound like they might, or even should, be true. Whether or not he really cares for Ritsuka always seems to be questionable, and his masochistic complex complicates the matter further -- not to mention it makes things ridiculously awkward. I think, in the end, you're supposed to gather that he's changed a little (for the better) since his days with Seimei, but it's really not that convincing at all.All of the other characters were pretty generic, and a lot of them seemed pretty damn pointless too. Rituska's school friends seemed like they could have been plucked out of any other anime Japanese school ever. Sure, they contributed to the plot and Ritsuka's development, but they really weren't that interesting to watch. Kio, Soubi's roommate? Classmate? Random friend? (Ex-)boyfriend? I have no idea what their relationship is because, surprise, they never explained, but he was only fun because he addressed some of my thoughts on Soubi, namely his apparent raging perversion and pedophilia (though Soubi consistently denied these accusations). But other than that, another generic support character? Yeah. The same goes for Ritsuka's teacher and his psychologist, and the fact that both of them were randomly in love with one of the protagonists seemed like more pointless fanservice. All of the fighter pairs sent from Seven Moons were flat and boring -- they were sent to fight, yippee. Did they have their own goals or aspirations? Who knows? Subplot with the lesbians? Seemed like a lame ploy to allow for a convenient winner of that fight. Complete lack of intrigue.Finally... this was the original reason I had no interest in watching this series. What the hell is the point of the cat ears? What does this contribute to anything at all? It just seems like a silly gimmick to invite giggles from the audience (fangirls think about this stuff anyway, do we really need to encourage them?), and to allow for lots of suggestive dialogue in the show. The only reason I could think of for this is to have &quot;proof&quot; that Soubi isn't randomly raping Ritsuka ('cause it sure seems like it sometimes). Here's an idea -- if your character is so inappropriate that you have to have a lame gimmick to prove his innocence, how about not writing him to be so outrageous in the first place? Certainly Soubi didn't need to make out with Ritsuka in the middle of every battle.ARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - Resoundingly average. Ritsuka was cute and Soubi was your run-of-the-mill bishounen. All the other characters were similarly plain, and the backgrounds don't really invite rounds of praise either. None of it was bad, but none of it was great either. The animation was about the same, though I really thought the effects for the fights were unimpressive and cheap.MUSIC - I'd actually heard the opening theme, &quot;Tsuki no Curse,&quot; long before I saw this series because it was composed by Yuki Kaijura. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with it then, and I remained unimpressed with it in the series.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go bash in the brains of the person who recommended this series to me."", ""For me, the best word to describe this anime is simply &quot;beautiful&quot;... If you truly want to understand it you have to take a closer look and be able to see beyond the &quot;shounen-ai&quot; or &quot;shotacon&quot; tags. I can't even say it's about a homosexual love, because it goes way beyond that, at a more spiritual level. In this anime, love becomes a great source of power. The fighter/sacrifice couples simply HAVE to create a great bond between them in order to become powerful.But love is not the main theme, it deals with a lot of other issues too. For example, the way we...project ourselves on others - Seimei appears in one way for Ritsuka, his mother or Soubi, but we find out about his true nature only later on. Another example is forgetness, memories, the link between past-present-future and essential questions that everyone asks himself or herself at a certain point in his/her life, and how 12-year-old Ritsuka is searching for a meaning of his life. Yet another example is the way people are treated in society due to certain tags they wear. In this case, I'm talking about the ct years that explicitly show the status of their sexual life and how others react to that.Also, in this anime, true love has nothing to do with sexuality, and is expressed by strong emotions and subtile  gestures.The story has an interesting plot, and it develops little by little, and unfortunately  does not end... You'll just have to read the manga too see what happens next. If you only watch the 12 episodes anime series the story doesn't really make sense at the end and it leaves you with even more questions. But it gets interesting when you start to go beneath the surface and find the truth behind all the appearences.The art helps creating a slight dark atmosphere. Not dark as in &quot;evil&quot;... but more like  enigmatic, mysterious. The colors are not so bright, sometimes dark, it has beautiful landscapes, and a lot of scenes occur at night, sunset or in the dark  fighting setting. One of the most interesting artistic elements is the buttefly -  it always accompanies Soubi's arrival, or in Soubi's paintigs, as a weapon, or in Ritsu's collection.The soundtrack also helps a lot creating this slight dark atmosphere, and it backs up every emotion that the characters are feeling. Some emotions don't even need to be expressed by words, the music completes them and amplifies the impact they have on the viewer.As for the characters, they are very strong and complex ones. Ritsuka is the one in search for his existence's meaning, and for life's meaning in general, feeling lost in a world he doesn't understand and that doesn't understand him. Soubi is the one that has the answers but he cannot give them to Ritsuka. When it comes to love, Soubi is the one to show Ritsuka the meaning of it, the meaning behind  the appearances, the powerful and spiritual level of love. But Soubi often acts contradictory, his true feelings remain hidden, he says things very easily but sometimes his actions do not sustain his big words.To me, it's a very unique, enjoyable combination of drama, love, philosophical questions, mistery and supernatural. The words are well chosen and always make you wonder about the truth and how much you far you have to go in order to find it. One thing is for certain - you have to ignore appearances. I really think this anime is deep and worth watching. project ourselves on others - Seimei appears in one way for Ritsuka, his mother or Soubi, but we find out about his true nature only later on.

I really think this anime is deep and worth watching."", 'The yaoi fangirls are going to kill me here. Loveless stands up with Gravitation, Junjou Romantica, and Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi as one of those BL anime that all yaoi fans love. While out of all of those the only one I legitimately enjoyed was Gravitation, that is just a matter of personal taste. Junjou and Hatsukoi are at least somewhat decent, especially when compared to what BL anime that came before them were like. With that out of the way I can safely say that Loveless is one of the few anime that made me want to claw my own eyes out.The story centers around...Ritsuka Aoyagi, a grade school boy who lost all of his memories two years prior to the start of the series. At that time, he also did a complete 180 in personality, going from an outgoing and popular boy who didn\'t have the best grades to a student with perfect grades who avoids any kind of social interaction. This apparently put such a strain on his mother that she began frequently beating him (and much worse in the manga) and claiming that he isn\'t her son, but someone else in her son\'s body. Apparently, if he does anything that the old Ritsuka wouldn\'t do, his mother will beat him. Things were at least tolerable for awhile, since his older brother, Seimei, protected him from his mother\'s beatings, but then Seimei was discovered burned to death in Ritsuka\'s classroom. The anime itself begins after all this when Ritsuka is transferred to a new class. A girl named Yuiko tries to befriend him, but Ritsuka regards her coldly since she\'s only doing it because her classmates put her up to it. After receiving harsh criticism from Ritsuka, Yuiko decides not to be pushed around by her classmates anymore and pushes for a genuine friendship with Ritsuka. After that, Ritsuka meets Soubi, a man who claims to be an old friend of Seimei\'s. Soubi tells Ritsuka about his arrangement with Seimei that if anything were to happen to Seimei, Soubi would ""belong"" to Ritsuka. Soubi turns out to be Seimei\'s ""sentouki,"" a companion who would fight battles with magic, while Seimei was the ""sacrifice,"" or the person who would take the damage in these battles. Since Seimei is now dead, Soubi must become Ritsuka\'s sentouki and Ritsuka will become the sacrifice.Oh, and did I mention that it\'s a huge plot point that virgins have cat ears? Yeah, way to throw random sex into the plot. That\'s one thing I really hate.However, after that huge info dump, nothing is really completely explained again. Most of the episodes consist of Soubi battling another pair of magic fighters and trying to protect Ritsuka in between molesting him. The story itself is so poorly explained that I had no idea what was going on half the time and ended up consulting wikipedia and the manga several times during the course of an episode, and that is not a good thing. I gave it a decent rating merely because it was interesting, but it never did anything more than that. I never really even knew why half these characters were fighting other than some taboo about the fact that Ritsuka and Soubi shouldn\'t be a team because both their names aren\'t ""Loveless"" or something like that. The only thing I could understand was the adult molesting the child frequently. Hooray for pedophilia, I guess! Especially on an already traumatized and broken child!The art was...well, it was actually fairly good, at least on the characters. The backgrounds were a bit lazy most of the time, but at least the magic battles usually looked good, and the character designs were at least distinct. However, the style reminded me a lot of Higurashi in that, while it used bright colors, it always looked like there was a film over the animation giving it a weird misty look that seemed out of place, though that could be because of the poorly done backgrounds.The sound was easily the best part of the show. I can\'t really say the dub of either language was particularly outstanding, but the soundtrack was done by Yuki Kajiura. \'Nuff said. It\'s far from being her best work, but it\'s Yuki Kajiura nonetheless. What\'s not to like?The characters are not so lucky. Most of them are boring, unlikable, or underdeveloped. The worst offender of this is Soubi himself. Since he\'s one of the two main characters, he should be someone the audience can cheer for and want to see succeed, or at least care somewhat about what he\'s doing. I really didn\'t feel anything toward him, even when part of his history as revealed. He has very little personality, and he\'s constantly flip-flopping when it comes to his actions. I can at least understand his motives of wanting to keep Ritsuka safe, but it\'s hard to relate to that when he\'s such a shameless pedophile. The only reason I gave the characters a decent rating is because of Ritsuka. He wouldn\'t have much of an effect if he was a side character, but as a main character he does well. He has a very distinct personality, and his development is very well handled. Sure, he starts off rather depressed at first, but he has every right to be, and unlike some anime characters he does grow quite a lot. His circumstances barely change at all, so the fact that he\'s able to change his attitude is impressive.However, the fact that Ritsuka\'s such a good character actually works against the series. When you actually care about a character, it\'s not enjoyable to watch him suffer so much without any happy ending in sight. Nobody who knows about his abuse is doing anything about it, even Soubi who claims to love him. Soubi\'s sexual advances on a boy who\'s underage even in Japan, especially one who has enough mental trauma on top of amnesia and a possible personality disorder, is just disgusting. I continued watching until the end in order to see something good finally happen to this kid, and it really doesn\'t. I could barely stand a moment of this, so the enjoyment factor was very low. I was able to enjoy the few quiet moments Ritsuka had with his friends, at least, but that\'s about it.All in all, there were a few things in this series that were okay, and the main character is really good. However, it\'s just unpleasant to watch and I find the fact that all of this is fetishized to be disgusting. Any time I hear someone praising this series, I feel a little sick inside. I suppose people are allowed to like what they want, but I personally find this show terrible. The overall score of 3 out of 10 is surprisingly generous, and I only gave it because of Ritsuka and the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura. That\'s all.

That\'s all.', ""I believe that Loveless is MUCH MORE than just some shounen-ai story. It is so much deeper than that. It really delves into the life of a young boy who is lost in the world. Ritsuka's real name being Loveless is a strong showing of that fact.I have to say that sadly, I was confused a few times while watching this anime. And many people I have talked to get very upset about how it was ended. They say that there were too many questions left unanswered. But think about it, in real life, there are always more questions that have not been answered.STORY: I...have to give this a lower rating because, although at the start the story moved along very smoothly, near the end things got very confusing. At first it was simple. Ritsuka lost his brother, and his fighter Soubi came along because Semei ordered him to. And they fought enemies. Not too hard to understand. But then new characters were introduced and they brought up even more questions, half of which never got answered.ART: AMAZING. The colors used in this anime are simply awe-inspiring. The way they portray Soubi as a butterfly and they show it in beautiful colors is just wonderful. The characters are all well-drawn and very cute/handsome (in Soubi's case) The noses bug me a tad, but I'll get over it. :)SOUND: Also great. The OP song is one that I actually always listen to every time I watch an episode. When romantic moments are occuring throughout the course of the season, they play very nice background music. Same with sad moments. The music goes along well with the mood. And not even one of the character voices are annoying! Not even Yuiko. And that surprised me.CHARACTER: I think that if I could add more favorite characters to my list, EVERY single character from this anime would be on it. There is such a good mix of personailities, from the shy Ritsuka to the serious Soubi and the playful Yuiko and the HILARIOUS Yayoi. The way the characters all relate is very nice as well. Although at times, I was confused at why Ritsuka would just let Soubi kiss him and whatnot, but still... very good interactions and love triangles. It's the whole grade school, &quot;I like her but she likes him...&quot; ordeal. And I sometimes like that! It makes the story much more light and humorous.ENJOYMENT: I gave this a 9 because for the most part, I was very entertained. There were a few episodes where I did not laugh or almost cry at all. But something kept me watching this anime. I think for the most part it was the characters. But I enjoyed the fights and the love between Ritsuka and Soubi. I just wish there had been more episodes to enjoy.Overall, I give this anime a 9. Oh... and lastly, go team Zero! *squee* have to give this a lower rating because, although at the start the story moved along very smoothly, near the end things got very confusing.

It makes the story much more light and humorous.ENJOYMENT: I gave this a 9 because for the most part, I was very entertained. There were a few episodes where I did not laugh or almost cry at all. But something kept me watching this anime. I think for the most part it was the characters. But I enjoyed the fights and the love between Ritsuka and Soubi. I just wish there had been more episodes to enjoy.Overall, I give this anime a 9. Oh... and lastly, go team Zero! *squee*"", ""Loveless could some times be a confusing anime but it's irresistibleThe story revolves around Aoyagi Ritsuka,a 12-year old who transfers with a mom having countless mental breakdowns which leads to child abuse dealing physical pain. Two years ago Ritsuka had lost memories and became a different person, from there his brother Seimei becomes important in his life. The anime begins with the death of Seimei which keeps Ritsuka wondering who killed his brother. The story truely begins when Ritsuka meets Agatsuma Soubi, Seimei's former fighter, and all the unexplained mystery comes, well you must watch it to see. It's true that to some the battles...seem like it's not needed but let's just say if there were no battles, most likely Ritsuka and Soubi will have no bond.The art/animation is okay, it's like a regular anime it's not too special, but the cat ears are quite creative and the battles combines fantasy and reality, the art makes the unnatural events possibly believable.This anime's sound is nice overall, in my opinion this anime has very nice music and sound which creates more intrest to an anime watcher's .The characters are creative and has a way of it's own, all the characters seems like complete opposite in a way but fits perfectly together. There's always a bond that ties the characters together.This anime is very enjoyable, but there are scenes at school where Yuiko gets too annoying, that's just the beginning, the episodes in some way becomes better one after another.Overall this anime is worth watching, I would highly recommend this anime to probably anyone. This anime may suprise you at times and may not be what you would expect so be on caution.I shall leave it at that.Hope this helps ~ seem like it's not needed but let's just say if there were no battles, most likely Ritsuka and Soubi will have no bond.The art/animation is okay, it's like a regular anime it's not too special, but the cat ears are quite creative and the battles combines fantasy and reality, the art makes the unnatural events possibly believable.This anime's sound is nice overall, in my opinion this anime has very nice music and sound which creates more intrest to an anime watcher's .The characters are creative and has a way of it's own, all the characters seems like complete opposite in a way but fits perfectly together.

Yaoi-fan girls drive me crazy. I have yet to meet some mature ones, but hey, they probably exist right? And guess what? I\'m a girl too and I hate yaoi :o le gasp. Also I rarely will review anime I hate with a passion (unless DBZ) and this is the only other exception.When someone said I should watch this - I watch about 5 minutes of episode 1 and stopped. Why? I read the plot. What is wrong with the plot you ask?To delve into what society is today, homosexuality...is becoming more acceptable, which is, of course, what you would expect from a growing society. However - PEDOPHELIA IS NOT. Ritsuka is 12 years old-not even in puberty, and some creepy old guy named Soubi is kinda ... making moves on him? Ummm...yea, pedophelia is realllyyyyy acceptable, hmm? I\'m being sarcastic. Though I detest yaoi, if they were closer in age, it would not be so bad, but poor Ritska is 12, Soubi 20 -something years old. Honestly, if anyone thinks this is ""cute"" or ""aww, its love!"" you need to get a reality check. Last I heard, when some poor unfortunate child is a victim of pedophelia, most people get angry and ask why someone would do such a thing.This anime makes pedophelia seem natural, which, it is not. It\'s creepy, sick and twisted and it makes me feel ashamed that girls like me find this stuff appealing.Also, don\'t think I\'m a homophobe for hating yaoi. I\'m not. Get your facts straight.To the sane people who still believe pedophelia is just ... NO, then I say - you are a godsend. To those who find it adorable like in this anime...all I gotta say it...why? is becoming more acceptable, which is, of course, what you would expect from a growing society.

I wore cat ears in my grade 8 school photos. 10/10. Would recommend.)Loveless is a surrealist-emo anime that any kid who spent too much time online in the early 2000s can relate to. The main character, Ritsuka, is a 12 year old Neitzsche-reading emo catboy with an abusive mother, an incompetent predatory therapist, and a mysterious- also predatory- man grooming him and making him fight battles that Ritsuka doesn\'t understand. Ah, middle school- some...things never change. Every adult in Ritsuka’s life is utterly failing him, he constantly lashes out in fear, and the one person who he cares about- his older brother- is now missing. It fully encapsulates the urgency of the 12 year old experience.Right off the bat, Loveless shows you that it isn\'t  afraid of getting accused of doing what it is, in fact, blatantly doing. It doesn\'t waste time making excuses. It just does what it does and depending on your age you\'ll either think ""somebody call child protective services"" or ""I am 12 and this is the best thing I\'ve seen since I google searched emos kissing yesterday."" It establishes itself quite openly as a fucked up story about fucked up people and death and love and, most of all, sex. The entire story is about sex, and the trauma involved in living in a world where you\'re surrounded by things you can neither escape nor fully understand. From the moment we learn that the characters’ cat ears represent virginity, to the erotic fight scenes, we are quickly thrown into having to grapple with what this show is about, and left scrambling trying to figure out what message it\'s conveying. Is this an endorsement? An indictment? Is anyone else uncomfortable- is that even intentional, on the part of the artist? Or is the unsettling knot in my stomach just a by-product of being spoon-fed simple  clear-cut moral messages in cartoons?Maybe media should be wrestled with.Maybe it\'s just a story about being a tween for those who have been there, with the black emo bangs, cat ears, depressed pout, withdrawn eyes, unaddressed trauma, and social struggles. Because back then you didn’t think about how weird it was that adults were flirting with you online while your parents fought in the kitchen, and it didn’t feel weird to watch Loveless and connect deeply with Ritsuka\'s alienation, to sit there watching it and wishing some beautiful older person would whisk you away into another realm, even if it was scary or painful or gay- maybe that\'s what you secretly wanted all along, or maybe that\'s just what you\'re comfortable with because instability is all you’ve ever known, oh, and also, you\'re gay.Watching this as an adult, it\'s clear just how naïve, immature, and traumatized Ritsuka is, and that the way the older man- Soubi- behaves towards him so incredibly, obviously creepy it would almost be funny (in the flabbergasted \'I cannot believe this was such a popular anime- how did they get away with this?\' way) if it wasn\'t ultimately just... unsettling. It might be easy to brush all this off as a typical Yaoi Moment, but this story goes out of its way to establish itself as ambiguously as possible. Ritsuka *also* seems heart-wrenchingly uncomfortable with everything happening to him, and unable to cope with any of the ways Soubi treats him... Even after he develops feelings for the guy. After all, he is a child, and as the title itself suggests, this is not a love story. This dramatic clash of shoujo with shounen, yaoi and yuri, Neitzsche and catboys, bondage and sadomasochism, and the immense power of words, all flows together so coherently in a way that neither suspends nor engages our disbelief, but rather forces one to translate what\'s happening beyond the disorienting haze of anime magic and into the jarring reality of the situation being presented before you can fully grasp the true horror and- dare I say- camp, that is the glue which holds Loveless together... and if all of that goes over your head, well, then it\'s just another questionable anime where some creeps wanted to draw a tsundere shota being preyed upon by an older bishie--- and I\'m unwilling to sit with something so pointless and gratuitous being one of my favorite anime series’ as a tween. There has to be something good I can take away from this, god dammit--- and it cannot just be my grade 8 school photos! things never change.

I didn&rsquo;t even think it was shonen-ai, so it caught me by surprise. I thought it was about something dark and creepy &ndash; guess not.I watched anime with shonen-ai premises before, and have watched one shojo-ai anime, but this anime is really different. At first it was hard to believe/handle. I didn&rsquo;t even like it at first because the shonen-ai was very surprising (didn&rsquo;t like it until episode 3). I&rsquo;m a good girl, from a conservative family, so I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. The fact that the main character is a 12 year old boy who&rsquo;s involved with a male...college student is kinda scary, but surprisingly, beautiful.Yes, that&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for. The anime would have been much better if it focused more on the boy-boy love, and less about the battles and whatnot. In fact, the spell battles and seven moons were a bit vague &ndash; or maybe I just focused too much on the shonen &ndash;ai. In any case, the whole concept was overshadowed by the shonen-ai.I think that&rsquo;s expected from the original creator who started working on Gundam Wing doujinshis.The nekomimis threw me off at first &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t get why they were there. I thought they had nekomimis because catgirls/boys are popular among a lot of anime fans, with me as an exception. I found out later they were a sign of someone&rsquo;s virginity, or lack thereof.Characters were interesting &ndash; Of course, most of them are self-proclaimed perverts (the fact I like all of them scares me). For some reason they&rsquo;re not bothered by the fact that Soubi likes someone way, way younger than him. It&rsquo;s not just him too &ndash; Ritsuka&rsquo;s psychologist seems to have a slight crush on him as well. Anyway, almost all of them are likable (and almost all of them wore glasses, which I love), even Yuiko who irritated me at first. She&rsquo;s not so bad. I have the same opinion about Yayoi, the boy who&rsquo;s hopelessly in love with Yuiko. I didn&rsquo;t like him at first either, but he&rsquo;s actually very funny, and he reminded me of Tamaki from Ouran.I just wish that the other characters had their fair share of lime light. I can&rsquo;t even remember the name of Soubi&rsquo;s hot teacher, and that Nagisa &ndash; sensei, I don&rsquo;t know much about her either. The character management is just done poorly.I&rsquo;m a bit iffy about the drawing style. The backgrounds are marvelous, like delicate water color paintings. On the character design is sub par. The drawings tend to waver a lot, and the bodies are way off proportion (specially Ritsuka &ndash; he looks so skinny). Despite the wavering drawing style, there&rsquo;s still a tasteful amount of bishonens. Soubi happens to be my favorite. The colors I don&rsquo;t like that much either &ndash; the colors look a bit too pale, and I prefer more vibrant colors. There was minimal use of CG, which is OK, since it&rsquo;s just complimentary. CG was used a lot for the fight scenes, but the fight scenes still needed work. They weren\\'t exciting or fun to watch at all.I actually like the voice acting, since the seiyus brought out their characters personalities. I am very delighted at the fact that the seiyus for Soubi, Ritsuka and Yukio are all familiar to me &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen, rather, heard of their work in other series before. Soubi&rsquo;s seiyu, which is Katsuyuki Konishi is actually the seiyu for Kenta Usui from Karin. I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s the same person since Soubi and Kenta have very different personalities, as well as manner of speaking.The music was so-so. The background music is what I would like to call, music you&rsquo;d hear from a creepy carnival at night, and it would make you want to either freak out or kill yourself &ndash; I mean that in a good way. It matches the theme and feel of the anime, after all. I like the opening theme too &ndash; I have heard it many times before I&rsquo;ve even watched the series. The ending song was a bit dreary and depressing, but that&rsquo;s OK.Story wise, it didn&rsquo;t impress me. Bishonen-wise, it sure did. I&rsquo;m hoping there&rsquo;s going to be a sequel, even if it&rsquo;s a bit late to do that. Like I said, some issues were left unresolved, and I want to catch another glimpse of the gorgeous bishies &ndash; after all, this is what I love the most about the anime. college student is kinda scary, but surprisingly, beautiful.Yes, that&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for.

There is nothing wrong with Shonen-ai, but this goes way beyond that. You have a man in his twenties chasing after a boy who is 12, barely starting puberty. Even if Loveless was in his later teens, 15 or 16, I'd be able to deal with that, but 12? It's sick. I could understand if it was a brotherly love, Loveless lost his brother, and finds it hard to believe that people could love him. While they do...handle the age gap gracefully, it's too much for me.But the child molesting isn't the only thing I disliked. There is never any explanation of why the battles go on, what happened to Loveless' brother, etc. Some stories can get away with unanswered questions, but not this one.I originally watched the series, not knowing about this pedophilia, and I liked some of the concepts. The society is based much on sexuality, in fact they have cat ears and tails that the people lose when they lose their virginity. It's unique, and I would like it if it wasn't for Sobi being a child molester. handle the age gap gracefully, it's too much for me.But the child molesting isn't the only thing I disliked.

Normally I'm just not a cat-ear type of girl, but after watching the first episode or two and realizing the importance of the cat ears and their overall symbolism in the show I was incredibly hooked.The story was beautiful and well written, however, I gave the story a 9 because I believe that there was a lot left unsaid. It was almost as if they were waiting for a second season that never came to ease up some questions...about Seven Moons and Seimei. Aside from that it was just brilliant. The characters are easy to love and relate and you find yourself feeling their emotions as the story progresses. The story deals with the issues of pain and loss and the light of hope that new love brings.I thought the music throughout the series was also very beautiful and alluring.

Usually, that&rsquo;s debatable &ndash; anime does have the benefits of things like color and sound, and if there are major plot changes some might be for the better. On the other hand, there are also anime adaptations that are inferior to their respective manga not because of what&rsquo;s in the anime but rather what&rsquo;s not. Oftentimes, short anime series will be made from long manga that end up with a made-up, rushed, or inconclusive ending. This is...definitely the main weakness of Loveless, an anime that&rsquo;s suffers much from its tiny length.Whether you&rsquo;ve read the manga or not, Loveless has a great setting. It&rsquo;s much like our world, but with a notable difference of people being born with cat ears and a tail that they lose with their virginity. That alone makes for an interesting concept if done in a non-perverted way &ndash; and for the most part, it is. But Loveless isn&rsquo;t deprived of a good plot and expect to cover it up with the great setting. Rather, the plot itself is fairly unique and beautifully developed. Ritsuka, a twelve-year-old boy still recovering from the mysterious murder of his older brother, Seimei, happens upon Soubi, an old friend of said brother. He finds out that there&rsquo;s more to Seimei&rsquo;s death than meets the eye: he was killed by an organization known as &ldquo;Septimal Moon,&rdquo; and was involved in a type of bizarre battling based solely on words. In addition to his quest to avenge his brother and rediscover himself, Ritsuka becomes part of the battles himself. It&rsquo;s a great example of a plot that creates a lot of questions that are eventually answered slowly enough to draw the viewer in but quickly enough to keep things interesting. That said, this is the part of the series that suffers most from short-anime syndrome, and the ending that the anime&rsquo;s writers threw together is ambiguous and doesn&rsquo;t provide a satisfying conclusion, a major flaw to an otherwise ambiguous and well-executed plot.Fortunately, however, this lack of plot resolution has no negative effect on the cast, which is full of unique people. Ritsuka, in particular, is moody and hesitant, a far cry from other protagonists in similar series. Because of this, the relationships he creates with the rest of the cast are often unexpected yet beautifully done. Soubi, meanwhile, is a bit more typical of the older, experienced type that is seen often in shoujo anime and manga, but since he&rsquo;s actually quite submissive in some ways he doesn&rsquo;t give off the air of a walking stereotype like you might expect. The supporting characters are similarly well-made; from Ritsuka&rsquo;s oftentimes downright adorable classmates other fighters that all have their own stories and motivation (and some of which are apt to cause tears in the eyes of viewers) there&rsquo;s no lack of memorable characters. (A word of warning, though: if you tend to dislike characters that are a bit whacked in the head a la Evangelion or Utena, Loveless&rsquo; cast may not leave the same impression on you.)Even with this great cast of characters, there&rsquo;s another part of Loveless that is praised more often: the art and animation. That&rsquo;s certainly a justified claim: frankly, the series looks gorgeous. The animation is smooth and remarkably easy to follow, especially considering the style of battling that could potentially be quite difficult. These battles happen on a mostly-black background that&rsquo;s just perfect for emphasizing the important things: characters and attacks. Coming from someone who usually has trouble following action scenes, these are very enjoyable to watch. Outside of battle, the backgrounds are simply breathtaking and the animation is fluid all over. The one disadvantage of the art is character design; primarily I&rsquo;m not much fond of the faces. Overall, there&rsquo;s very little not to like when seeing this series.The lovely art is paired with almost as lovely music. The opening song, &ldquo;Tsuki no Curse,&rdquo; is a haunting melody that sets the mysterious and somewhat melancholy tone of the series, and both the lyrics and singer work with the music to make the song sound great (if not a bit high). The ending song, &ldquo;Michiyuki&rdquo; is similar in mood, calmer but just as dark; it really wraps up each episode nicely. The background music doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, either; the best pieces are fully atmospheric without being intrusive, while others are less effective but still very much listenable.In technical terms, Loveless is great. In literary terms, Loveless is well-made. Still, the series has a reputation among some viewers as being creepy, even pedophilic, while others find it a cute piece of BL anime. However, both of these are shallow and about as accurate as saying that My-Hime is about breasts or Gankutsuou is a mecha series. In some respects, they are true, but in the big picture they&rsquo;re utter falsehoods. Loveless may be about catboys and girl, and have blatantly sexual situations between an adult man and a young boy, but it&rsquo;s no standard fanservice series. The somewhat twisted relationship between Ritsuka and Soubi isn&rsquo;t just there for kicks; it&rsquo;s a unique dynamic that is never portrayed as anything but unusual, and it&rsquo;s a less-conventional way of helping these characters develop. Enjoying Loveless doesn&rsquo;t require a shouta-loving soul; it requires an ability to look past the surface and think about the complexities of human relationships. It&rsquo;s a series that requires some real reflection after viewing, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth that thought. definitely the main weakness of Loveless, an anime that&rsquo;s suffers much from its tiny length.Whether you&rsquo;ve read the manga or not, Loveless has a great setting.

That said, this is the part of the series that suffers most from short-anime syndrome, and the ending that the anime&rsquo;s writers threw together is ambiguous and doesn&rsquo;t provide a satisfying conclusion, a major flaw to an otherwise ambiguous and well-executed plot.Fortunately, however, this lack of plot resolution has no negative effect on the cast, which is full of unique people. Ritsuka, in particular, is moody and hesitant, a far cry from other protagonists in similar series. Because of this, the relationships he creates with the rest of the cast are often unexpected yet beautifully done. Soubi, meanwhile, is a bit more typical of the older, experienced type that is seen often in shoujo anime and manga, but since he&rsquo;s actually quite submissive in some ways he doesn&rsquo;t give off the air of a walking stereotype like you might expect. The supporting characters are similarly well-made; from Ritsuka&rsquo;s oftentimes downright adorable classmates other fighters that all have their own stories and motivation (and some of which are apt to cause tears in the eyes of viewers) there&rsquo;s no lack of memorable characters. (A word of warning, though: if you tend to dislike characters that are a bit whacked in the head a la Evangelion or Utena, Loveless&rsquo; cast may not leave the same impression on you.)Even with this great cast of characters, there&rsquo;s another part of Loveless that is praised more often: the art and animation. That&rsquo;s certainly a justified claim: frankly, the series looks gorgeous. The animation is smooth and remarkably easy to follow, especially considering the style of battling that could potentially be quite difficult. These battles happen on a mostly-black background that&rsquo;s just perfect for emphasizing the important things: characters and attacks. Coming from someone who usually has trouble following action scenes, these are very enjoyable to watch. Outside of battle, the backgrounds are simply breathtaking and the animation is fluid all over. The one disadvantage of the art is character design; primarily I&rsquo;m not much fond of the faces. Overall, there&rsquo;s very little not to like when seeing this series.The lovely art is paired with almost as lovely music. The opening song, &ldquo;Tsuki no Curse,&rdquo; is a haunting melody that sets the mysterious and somewhat melancholy tone of the series, and both the lyrics and singer work with the music to make the song sound great (if not a bit high). The ending song, &ldquo;Michiyuki&rdquo; is similar in mood, calmer but just as dark; it really wraps up each episode nicely. The background music doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, either; the best pieces are fully atmospheric without being intrusive, while others are less effective but still very much listenable.In technical terms, Loveless is great. In literary terms, Loveless is well-made. Still, the series has a reputation among some viewers as being creepy, even pedophilic, while others find it a cute piece of BL anime. However, both of these are shallow and about as accurate as saying that My-Hime is about breasts or Gankutsuou is a mecha series. In some respects, they are true, but in the big picture they&rsquo;re utter falsehoods. Loveless may be about catboys and girl, and have blatantly sexual situations between an adult man and a young boy, but it&rsquo;s no standard fanservice series. The somewhat twisted relationship between Ritsuka and Soubi isn&rsquo;t just there for kicks; it&rsquo;s a unique dynamic that is never portrayed as anything but unusual, and it&rsquo;s a less-conventional way of helping these characters develop. Enjoying Loveless doesn&rsquo;t require a shouta-loving soul; it requires an ability to look past the surface and think about the complexities of human relationships. It&rsquo;s a series that requires some real reflection after viewing, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth that thought.', 'DISCLAIMER: I “thank” AWC’s Random Challenge for making me watch this… and honestly thank my friend who suffered together with me.Also, there are a few spoilers ahead.There are shounen-ai anime. There are bad shounen-ai anime (which are, let’s be honest, almost all of them). And then there is Loveless, a cacophony of things that just shouldn’t exist.Yeah, of course, there is this really deep plot about Ritsuka being Loveless and the other guy being Beloved…. lol, nope, there’s not. Let’s be honest, this anime is about a little boy being wooed by a grown up, adult man. I’m not even kidding.But let’s start from...the beginning. I’m presenting to you 5 reasons why Loveless is a bad thing and every “fujoshi” or whoever who enjoys this is either a 13 years old OR just a sick person:1) EarsOne of the main aspects of Loveless are cat ears and tail. Cute, right? What’s better than a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail. …I’ll tell you what. How about a little boy with cat ears and fluffy tail… without attaching to it some weird “plot” device? Quotes because it’s not related to the plot at all. Let’s say I’m writing a story and I want a cute cat boy in it. How do I justify it? Maybe I’ll just add cat ears to everyone? Ooor I could make this world full of animal-hybrids? No, I’ve got it! IF THE PERSON HAS CAT EARS. THEN IT MEANS. THAT THEY’RE A VIRGIN! YES, GENIUS!…..I get it, it’s probably part of some Japanese weird thing or something. We know Japanese. They are… pretty special in some aspects. But how exactly is okay to just let show off someone’s privacy? It’s everyone’s own choice how to handle their virginity and yes, if someone still has their “cat ears” in 23 it’s completely okay!2) People’s view of Shinonome… This should perhaps be 1.5, because it’s mainly a continuation of the first point. I myself really disliked Ritsuka’s teacher, but that was because of her character (or… “character” :’)). Shinonome, as a 23 years old teacher who still has her ears, is often a target of remarks about her it. Seme-san… sorry, Soubi, refers to her as “childish” despite her being older then him. And why is that? Try to guess…I’ll say it again… IT’S OKAY TO BE VIRGIN IN 23! SHE COULD BE AN ASEXUAL OR SOMETHING! OR SHE’S SAVING HERSELF FOR THE ONE TRUE LOVE! OR I DON’T KNOW! JUST LET HER BE!3) The psychologistDon’t get me wrong, it’s completely okay to have a psychiatrist or a psychologist. Everyone has their problems and problems exist to be solved. But what’s not okay is… a grown ass psychologist woman with… a weird crush on her patient?? Who is a 12 years old boy?? What even was that?! What was the point?! Was it there just for the fangirls to have someone to hate on, or what?! Psychologists are supposed to be profesionals and this is casting a really bad light on this important profession.4) Ritsuka the Sex BombYes, I mean that Ritsuka. That 12 years old little boy who should go play football (…soccer? ‘murica?) or computer games or something. There were just a few characters who DIDN’T want to get the D… or ass… or I don’t know. I have to remind you, that he is 12 years old. Twelve years old.5) SoubiThere he is, the awesome Seme-san, who actually has more than 1,000 Member Favorites on MAL (just… why). He’s a 20 years old art student (let’s say it again: TWENTY years old). His favorite hobbies include fondling Ritsuka, kissing Ritsuka, stalking Ritsuka, breaking into Ritsuka’s room through the window and, finally, offering Ritsuka to “take his ears away”. And we all know what’s that a metaphor for.Also, he’s a masochist who wants Shota-kun to punish him. RIP in pieces.BONUS ROUND) The RelationshipJust to say it again for those in the back rows. The main plot of the story is twenty years old guy being lovey dovey with a twelve years old boy. Soubi’s maybe not a pedophile by psychiatric terminology (I’ll suppose that Ritsuka is already in puberty…) but, you know… I hope that I don’t have to say how much of not okay it is.Yeah, that would be it. The author was either smoking something when writing this or just has some really big issues. The plot, aside the gays™, was non-existent and most of the characters were really, really creepy. And not the good kind of creepy.But this is a review, so I should say also something nice. Uhm… the canon lesbian ship was a nice surprise? But, well, it’s Japan. Name one canon lesbian ship in anime that doesn’t have a nice, mostly healthy relationship. Seriously, if the author can write a cute lesbian pair why not also write a cute gay pair?

Besides virgins have cat ears and a tail? I mean the only actually ok character was the aforementioned cat-eared virgin boy of 12 years old. He was a somewhat relatable pre-teen with his horrible social anxiety. Otherwise the whole thing was mediocre at best. And horrifying at other moments. Especially since his love interest was a 21 year old man. Yay casual pedophilia? And double trouble the guy who was with the 21 year old dude before this is also underaged. So we know he has a type.

She used a lot of symbolisms, life problems, and tries to make a sort of fantasy battle anime combined with romantic drama.First of all, you cannot just make an unknown and boring character jump right ahead with another character without even explaining the connection between the two because viewers cannot relate and feel...what is being felt by the said character. Yaoi scenes felt lifeless because of the distance between the audience and the character; henceforth, the romantic lines are rubbish and sound cheesy.Although she, the author, have the desire to express herself with common life problems, such as the users and the used, loving one’s self, the consequences of love and so on and so forth, the characters are lifeless, edgeless, brainless, colorless and everythingless and killed the entire story.

Yeah it is cute but I cannot see the relevance of cats to the story. I understand stories with demons who has usually has something to do with death, deals and such, but when I see cat people, it tells me that they want the story to be cute and that is all. It reminds me of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s broadway musical “Cats.” The difference between Andrew’s Cats and this type of cat though is that his cats has better, more distinct and fierce personalities and does not aim to be cute.Sound (6/10)The sound is good at least.

The characters are way below the line and do not even feel realistic when they say their lines. I am not sure if the author is aiming for male character with a strong feminine side or what. If so, Ritsuka feels like an awkward male character who immediately surrendered to a female life under the hands of Soubi. Soubi is one of the most robotic and monotonous characters that I had ever came across with – in other words, boring. Yuiko, on the other hand is an annoying, stupid and a useless female character.

I was already taken in by the interesting setting; in which majority of the people in the world have cat ears on the tops of their heads. Seemed like something different and new.Loveless starts off normally, with a young boy with a lot of angst and problems over his lost brother. The...premise seems interesting enough as before you know it, he runs into his brother&rsquo;s friend, which at that time; Loveless begins to show its shounen-ai side. The abundance of characters in this anime is fantastic and each of them has great personalities that grow on you. One of the characters specifically, Hawatari Yuiko brings a lot of energy to the screen and brightens up an otherwise gloomy show. Although, the significance of these side characters are slim to none. They play a very little part in the actual plot and could have easily been written out, which is a shame since the side characters are far more interesting then the main ones.There were a lot of ideas thrown out in Loveless, but very few of them were actually explored. This is truly a disappointment, there was so much that could have been drawn from the plot and in the end it didn&rsquo;t live up to it&rsquo;s full potential. The abrupt ending could be partially to blame for this because Loveless lacks any sort of resolution, leaving us wondering if that was really in the end, with more questions rather then answers.Loveless is a unique anime, with a great environment and engaging side characters, but seriously lacks in the department of story and plot.

The feelings of an unbiased perception of love is very evident and further delves into the inhibitions of what most slice of life animes aim for but with a more realistic character development.

This was a highly romanticised idea in my adolescent brain.Coming back and watching it again, ten years later, I find myself exceptionally uncomfortable. This story is about a paedophile grooming a boy (yes yes, technically he is a hebephile, but general society does not see that distinction). I guess, due to age, I identify with the adult of the series more than the child, and as an adult I find this repugnant.I had to drop it,...refusing to watch it again.If you are young, and fantasise about being with an older male, this will appeal to you. If you are an older male who fantasises about being with a young boy… well, get counselling. Seriously. Or stick with shounen-ai or yaoi that is more age appropriate and, well, less paedophilic.I can't speak for how a fujoshi might view this, but for me, this is a definite no. Probably doesn't help that my tastes have moved more to bara these days. refusing to watch it again.If you are young, and fantasise about being with an older male, this will appeal to you.

I actually wish I hadn't wasted my time with it.First off I have to give the story a 3 and here's why:When I rate a story I take into account the ending too, if your like me this read this. The ending isn't really one, to me it felt like a longer series that just got cut off. They don't explain the big secret mystery of the whole series, and the last episode actually left me with more questions than...i had before, like they were trying to hook you for a season 2 that never came. I find that kind of thing very annoying! Oh and it feels like they drop you in the middle of another world without explaining any of the rules.Now Art, that i give a 7:Yeah, the best thing in this whole series for me was the art, I thought the style was nice, the ears and tails cute, colors well defined and I felt what the characters were supposed to feel a lot through the looks, good job on the art people.6 for the sound:The sound was fair to me, it wasn't annoying but nothing really wowed me either.Characters 4:Now this could just be me here, but I found the characters hard to relate to. One guy is all like 'I love you because I was ordered to' and the other at first seems to hate everyone. I must admit the latter one was easier to understand as the story went on and you see into his past a bit, but they didn't give enough on the older one, the one who loves due to an order, to make him really relatable to me. So for me he was kinda flat and odd.Enjoyment 3:I say this because of the ending mostly.

They explain nothing really and actually leave you with even more questions at the end, which I find Very Annoying!So Overall 4:Interesting at first, makes you want to know all the secrets, makes you want to understand the characters and see where they will end up.

I find that kind of thing very annoying! Oh and it feels like they drop you in the middle of another world without explaining any of the rules.Now Art, that i give a 7:Yeah, the best thing in this whole series for me was the art, I thought the style was nice, the ears and tails cute, colors well defined and I felt what the characters were supposed to feel a lot through the looks, good job on the art people.6 for the sound:The sound was fair to me, it wasn't annoying but nothing really wowed me either.Characters 4:Now this could just be me here, but I found the characters hard to relate to. One guy is all like 'I love you because I was ordered to' and the other at first seems to hate everyone. I must admit the latter one was easier to understand as the story went on and you see into his past a bit, but they didn't give enough on the older one, the one who loves due to an order, to make him really relatable to me. So for me he was kinda flat and odd.Enjoyment 3:I say this because of the ending mostly.

I admit, the concept was harder to grasp and overall a bit more confusing that it would've been if I'd read the manga before hand. I really love the relationship between Ritsuka-kun and his peers. His wit and view of things is very accurate for someone who recently lost something special to them. He is very observant and also very hesitant. His relationship with Soubi is harder to grasp at a younger age. It seems to be overall complicated, but as it develops; it becomes more of a heart pull. I...became very attached to this work in such little time, and was sad when it came to an end. It was very beautiful, and very worth my time.

The music is amazing, the characters are loveable and the whole relationship between the two main characters is adorable. Seeing as it was only 12 episodes long, it was gutting when it ended, but that's probably the reason for it being so good.Ritsuka has been different the past two years since his brother, Seimi had been murdered by the Seven Moons, and he doesn't see the point of living anymore. Until he meets Soubi, the adult, old friend of Seimi. He soon learns that...Soubi is an important part of his life, and together they are Fighter and Sacrifice, even though they do not share the same name. Throughout the whole series the two begin to grow on each other and there bond is alot deeper than they'd expected.I loved some of the things they did with the anime such as the ears, where if you had never lost your virginity with anyone and been in love then you would have ears. It was pretty obvious to see who had done what, and i loved that, because it was like you could read everyone like a book. Ritsuka's teacher still has her ears and she's a very shy character, and all of his friends have also got there ears.The whole story is pretty confusing, seeing as the Seven Moons are not described until later episodes and the whole 'Name' and 'Bond' scenario is pretty strange. Seimi (Ritsuka's Brother) was called 'Beloved' and he shared a name with Soubi, until he died. Soubi was ordered by Seimi to love Ritsuka and become his fighter, even though Ritsuka's real name is 'Loveless' (one without love). So the two are not destined to be together.You have to watch the anime to realise how beautiful it is, and really understand whats happening. Even if you don't like the romance there's still a lot of action with 'Spell Battles' and fighting.There is also Yuri (girl on girl) later in this anime if that's what your interested in.So overall this anime is amazing and i love it. However, watching it a second time just depressed me, knowing i'd never be able to feel the excitement again, knowing there were more episodes to watch which i hadn't already seen.

They grabbed me and made me happy, sad, mad, and all those emotions that anime usually can't do to me. I yelled at my TV at times, I will admit...ENJOYMENT: Somewhere in this incredibly long review, I must have said something about my enjoyment with this anime, so I guess that it's kinda self explanitory.OVERALL: This anime could have easily been given a ten, BUT! I didn't reach the ending! I won't spoil anything, since when people spoil things I want to stab their eyes out, so don't worry. Let me just say that there had better be a sequel to the anime, because this was REALLY incomplete. They left a lot of things open, like who Septimal Moon is, which really bugged me.

He has problems that he doesn't want anyone to know about, so it adds to the mystery.It isn't as much of a love story. It mainly deals with past/present/future destinies.I liked the anime because it deals with a lot of 'what do i do now' stuff and some of the charecters are easy to relate to (In my case)I know that this may not be helpfull......

However, recently, after noticing a great interest in the artwork (that of both the anime and manga), I decided to give Loveless a chance.I wasn't disappointed.The idea of 'Fighter' and 'Sacrifice' are fantastic and interesting concepts. The story itself is wonderful. Loveless is something that watchers can relate to--who hasn't lost someone they love?; who hasn't endured inner turmoils and/or anxieties?I conquered all twelve episodes of the anime and eighty-five chapters of released scanlations in two...days, simply because I couldn't get enough of the Loveless universe. days, simply because I couldn't get enough of the Loveless universe."", ""Overall Loveless has always been one of my favorite anime series.

It is still a very beautiful story, about seeking love and learning to trust.The art isn't bad for Loveless, since it is older. The soundtrack is completely beautiful and mesmerizing to me though.

The main dude is this 14 year old who has amnesia or something and keeps thinking about his brother who died and his true name being “beloved”, the exposition isn\'t super clear but apparently it was like 2 years ago (I had to read the description of the episode and anime to get that)....The kid is just an overall asshole, psychologically toying with the author\'s self insert of an X year old autistic pink haired Japanese girl (to differentiate her from the background set pieces that are the black haired Japanese school girls in this anime) by being a literal two face every time she talks to him. He has a running inner monologue he spews aloud occasionally deriding friends as being in two categories: “users” and “the people who get used”; seeing the former as stupid for being so shallow and the latter as even stupider for being used - which he personally tells to the pink haired girl to upset her. Despite this the girl still tries to befriend him, even overcoming her nervousness at telling her user friends no (who unironically are using her like a pack mule) to spend time with him . However the kid is also a crybaby and a wimp, running away from his self created problems and leaving the girl behind just as completely puzzled as me at this point.While leaving the school we are introduced to some 20 year old creep with long hair smoking a cigarette outside of the school clearly loitering with malicious intent, who scares away the ladies biking outside before meeting our protagonist outside the gate. The most notable thing about this guy is he is ""an adult"" since he doesn\'t have any cat ears or tail. The protagonist demands to know who he is, and the creep is cryptic but reveals he was a friend of his brother that died. The dialogue starts turning into some homoerotic foreplay where the kid basically asks a grown man he just met on a date under the pretext of “making memories”. After taking a bunch of photos, the creep asks the boy if he wants to talk for a while, but the boy says he wants to make more memories by taking pictures, to which the creep counters by telling him it would be more memorable to have a good chat. The boy gets all pouty and shouts insisting that if they don’t make memories this way he will be forgotten. Then all the sudden the conversation turns even gayer and the kid starts getting nervous at all the homoerotic subtext, making the creep promise to not try anything, a promise he immediately breaks by kissing the kid on the mouth. The kid is understandably upset at this pedophile giving him this unwanted advance, and that’s about when I turned this gay shit off.I read the description again and apparently the kid is a “sacrifice” that is kind of like the summoner for Yu-Gi-Oh if that makes sense, while the creep is his “fighter” which would kinda be like the duel monsters from Yu-Gi-Oh. According to the summary I read on the website that was streaming this trash, the duo would go on to be attacked by similar groups and they will have some kinda homosexual adventure while engaged in this battle royale. The title of this anime, “Loveless”, refers to the pedophile without ears, because his codename is “loveless”, the counterpart to his brother’s codename as “beloved” (directly implying a homosexual connection between his brother).TLDR I dropped this trash like a bag of hammers because I’m not into shota cat boy yaoi gay shit.

It is the anime that made me realize their brains are full of hay and gave up on the genre altogether. It’s just too nauseating with no bloody payback! I mean just look at the people who made this. Animated by J.C. Staff, which translates to retarded fan service. Directed by Kou Yuu who has made equally bad gay anime, plus Chrono Crusade and Familiar of Zero which despite their hype and not being gay...are still bad for pacing reasons.And now that we know it’s going to be bad, let’s get a bit more into the story. Or the crumbs of story it has. First of all the setting makes no bloody sense and they never tried to explain it; you just need to accept it as it is. Which doesn’t sound like much of a problem but trust me in this particular case it’s a major downer. Ok, check this out, virgins in the series have cat ears. And when they stop being virgins, those ears drop. WHY IS THAT? Beats me, for all I care it’s just an excuse to throw in cute animal ears on people and to be able to tell who still has his or her cherry intact by just looking at his head. And did I notice an elementary kid in the background with no ears at a certain point? That’s just…EWWW!So what else is there in this setting besides being impossible to hide you are still untouched? Oh, but of course, being gay is so normal to the point your own relative’s lover comes to take a taste out of you too like it’s a normal thing to do. Man, I am telling you the moral standards in this world are so loose.So this super hot gay dude comes to the OBVIOUSLY VIRGIN protagonist and tells him the following.“I used to be your brother’s partner in war (and OBVIOUSLY bed too) but now he got killed, so the logical thing to do is to come after you, so you will be my new partner.”Another thing the setting never bothered to explain if the laws in this place really work like that. I mean everything else looks pretty standard but then WHAM these things come out of nowhere.So the protagonist and his new… partner are to investigate how his brother got killed. He also has to deal with the whole depression issue over his death and to start trusting people again. You know; opening up. Getting closer. Hugging. Kissing. And having sex with your brother’s gay lover. And surely, this other dude seems more interested in that than to reveal the truth of the brother’s death. He even comes out and says it to his face.“I am sooo gonna take away those ears of yours my little love toy.”EWWWWWWW!So at first it appears to be a story about getting over your sadness, trusting people, exposing the ones who are responsible for your brother’s death, as well as losing your innocence to a gay dude. Sounds like a lot of stuff, right? Guess how many of those issues are resolved by the end of the show. NONE! ZERO! Nothing happens! You get 12 episodes of nothing but a deviant build up which results to freaking nothing! AND THEY CALL THIS A MASTERPIECE!What the devil is there to like in this show? The production values? They are barely average. The story? Not only it lacks exposition to its own in-laws, but it also has no conclusion. The characters? They don’t develop in any way and are quite the gay uke/seme stereotypes. Plus, I find nothing cute in people with dog ears; especially when said dog ears sprout on top of their scull and above an already normal pair of ears. THAT IS DISGUSTING! And so is butt-sex. Which doesn’t even occur in this show so I see no reason why the fujoshis like it so much.In other words, there is nothing to love in this show, hence the title. I am losing faith in humanity every time I witness the crap that sell and give birth to even worse crap. It is a terrible show I do not recommend to anyone. Besides of course those retarded women who get their thingies wet by looking at mutated dog ears sprouting out of their sculls.EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!I mean, really, what do those fujoshis find erotic in expecting to see an underraged boy being ass-raped by the gay lover of its own brother and having his own mutant ears cut off? And yet not even getting that by the end of the show and still liking it!“THESE PEOPLE NEED THERAPY AND MEDICATION FAST!”And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 5/10Analysis: General Artwork 1/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 0/2CHARACTER SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 0/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 0/1, Sound 0/2, Story 1/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 3/10 are still bad for pacing reasons.And now that we know it’s going to be bad, let’s get a bit more into the story.

I mean everything else looks pretty standard but then WHAM these things come out of nowhere.So the protagonist and his new… partner are to investigate how his brother got killed. He also has to deal with the whole depression issue over his death and to start trusting people again. You know; opening up. Getting closer. Hugging. Kissing. And having sex with your brother’s gay lover. And surely, this other dude seems more interested in that than to reveal the truth of the brother’s death. He even comes out and says it to his face.“I am sooo gonna take away those ears of yours my little love toy.”EWWWWWWW!So at first it appears to be a story about getting over your sadness, trusting people, exposing the ones who are responsible for your brother’s death, as well as losing your innocence to a gay dude. Sounds like a lot of stuff, right? Guess how many of those issues are resolved by the end of the show. NONE! ZERO! Nothing happens! You get 12 episodes of nothing but a deviant build up which results to freaking nothing! AND THEY CALL THIS A MASTERPIECE!What the devil is there to like in this show? The production values? They are barely average. The story? Not only it lacks exposition to its own in-laws, but it also has no conclusion. The characters? They don’t develop in any way and are quite the gay uke/seme stereotypes. Plus, I find nothing cute in people with dog ears; especially when said dog ears sprout on top of their scull and above an already normal pair of ears. THAT IS DISGUSTING! And so is butt-sex. Which doesn’t even occur in this show so I see no reason why the fujoshis like it so much.In other words, there is nothing to love in this show, hence the title. I am losing faith in humanity every time I witness the crap that sell and give birth to even worse crap. It is a terrible show I do not recommend to anyone. Besides of course those retarded women who get their thingies wet by looking at mutated dog ears sprouting out of their sculls.EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!I mean, really, what do those fujoshis find erotic in expecting to see an underraged boy being ass-raped by the gay lover of its own brother and having his own mutant ears cut off? And yet not even getting that by the end of the show and still liking it!“THESE PEOPLE NEED THERAPY AND MEDICATION FAST!”And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 5/10Analysis: General Artwork 1/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 1/2, Animation 1/2, Visual Effects 1/2SOUND SECTION: 6/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 2/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 0/2, Conclusion 0/2CHARACTER SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 0/2, Catharsis 0/2VALUE SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Historical Value 0/3, Rewatchability 0/3, Memorability 1/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Analysis: Art 0/1, Sound 0/2, Story 1/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 3/10', 'It\'s my first review. So please be kind.I must say that I really loved watching Loveless and actually liked the story until it ran out of episodes. The biggest problem is that the story gets more and more complicated and in the end... no one explains a thing.The story is generally about Ritsuka who has amnesia and whose brother Seimei has died. So Ritsuka tries to find out who killed Seimei but we actually never see that happen. To get things more complicated we have a guy named Soubi who was Seimei\'s ""Fighter"" but refuse to tell anything that would help Ritsuka to find the...killer. So basically he is there as an yaoi element.Sadly, the series doesn\'t seem to focus on the main story and just adds more and more different elements and unfortunately, it makes the whole thing so confusing that when you finish all episodes, you either dislike it, try to desperately find second season or both.I myself think that Loveless is worth watching but it will leave you confusingly think what would happen next. To say something good, I would like to mention that I really liked the art and the opening was pretty good too. killer.

It was finally starting to get really good towards the end and thats when they started to really pick up the story and add interesting aspects to it. Im rooting for a season 2 of ""loveless""its good and i hope in the next series they start to have Ritska be more willing to be outgoing and act more lively the way he was towards the end especially in the very last episode. personally I liiked this series because it was much different then all the other shounen ai in its genre...but it was very intersting in the end. I would recommend other people watch it so that they definitley end up making a season 2. i also hope their are a lot more fight scenes as well as BL ones in the next series. it would be really interesting if the first episode of the next series sums up everything that happens from the last episode +5years into the future and the story takes of running from their already at full speed and kicking. But ill be happy if they just make a season2 personally. i also like that this wasn\'t one of those rapey BL stories. i would be interested to see it with more action and more romance.

There is no point. They just fight and get hurt for the sake of some drama.Many people behave so so strangely.

Also, frankly, I'm too lazy to write out the entire synopsis, so I'm please gather that information from other reviews. Thank you.I genuinely struggled with deciding whether or not to rate this a 10, and I mean that entirely in a good way. It is quite a beautiful anime that tends to leave many confused, and I think that is what I enjoy most about it. It is incredibly mysterious and vague, using a great deal of metaphors (from my interpretation...of it) to make a statement on innocence, virginity/sex, pedophilia, and adultism. I feel that this anime is not as straightforward as people seem to think, but it delves much deeper into the mind and in the reality of our society. If you have trouble catching metaphors and reading between the lines, I do not recommend this anime for you.I'm afraid to say that this anime is very confusing. Perhaps the manga clears it up better (I am certain that the ending will not leave as many questions unanswered). The plot is hard to follow, and there are many concepts that aren't explained. The main complaint that I've seen in other reviews is the fact that it doesn't explain most of its storyline. I blame that mostly on the fact that the anime itself doesn't nearly cover the entire Loveless series. I still recommend watching the anime, for it was HIGHLY enjoyable, despite its vagueness.This anime was truly beautiful and unique, covering many topics that are normally thought of as uncomfortable in our society (homosexuality, pedophilia, sex, etc.).

I was personally disappointed with the ending, and thought this anime could have used more episodes. The ending was not what I wanted, and I feel like they kinda rushed it. With this being said, the last episode is sort of a cliff hanger for me and left me with lots of questions as did Gravitation, and I HATE leaving an anime with many questions unanswered. To me, if I leave an anime with questions that doesn't make a good story. The story overall was really good,...I loved the action, but I can't give it a higher grade since the story in my opinion is not completed.

The the plot to this anime is nonexistent, as the main premise is Ritsuka is obsessed over his brother's death. I know the incident was quite traumatic however, the show failed to depict it as such. The only interesting point in the story (Septimal Moon) was hidden from Ritsuka and the viewer; maybe if the story had started from a different time (like the future) Septimal Moon could have been used as a plot device. It is my understanding that only a few volumes of the manga were out...when the anime was made.Ritsuka's and Soubi's relationship may raise some eyebrows however, this is a work of fiction. The author's intention was so appeal to a certain audience and as an author, they have the liberty to write what they want. Also if Soubi really cared about Ritsuka, he would've tried to get him away from his abusive mother. However is is quite clear Soubi is only with Ritsuka because of Seimei's orders.Another thing that bothered me about Loveless is it's depiction the female cast: all of them were crybabies. No one over the age of five cries like that. I felt like many of the characters, and the world overall was underdeveloped. The fight scenes were boring. When Soubi was injured, I felt nothing.Some merits of Loveless was the relationship between Yamato and Kouya. Their story was more compelling than that of the main characters which is a little shocking.There were many unanswered questions. The opening I skipped each time.

The characters (which come in pairs) were very effective in drawing attention and curiosity with how they express their feelings towards each other. How far will they go? What'll happen next? Is someone actually gonna lose their ears?

The mystery and suspense of the story is very catchy and will make you want to know what'll happen next. But the end did not deliver much and did not...reach the expectations set up by the (unanswered) issues in the beginning.The story is promising and I think the characters have the potential to grow.

I was kind of...disgusted to say the least. And Yuiko was really annoying LOL. The main conflict/interest of the show isn't really the erotic relationship between 12-year old Ritsuka and college student Soubi, but the relationships that Ritsuka so desperately tries to make, the memories that he so desperately holds on to and his eventual realization about the importance of his life and the people around him. It's really a good show and while it confuses you in the beginning, don't waver! Everything turns out for the better!!The art was really well done. The people...are drawn beautiful and the settings are also amazing. The constant symbolism and appearance of the butterflies was also done very well in my opinion.

I didn't really notice the background music throughout the show, but when I did, it was nice.Characterization was amazing, most of the time.

I say BL in quotes because calling this show a BL is like calling Yarichin B***h Club the pinnalce of BL anime(fun fact: neither of those statements are true). And the sad thing is, it is possible for a show following a similar formula to find some success (as provenwith Descendants of Darkness), which just makes this mess of a show all that more depressing.Visuals: The artstyle of this show is one of the few things about this show that I actually liked. While it is just more of the same early 2000\'s animeartstyle (which I already...like), there was also a certain dreamy and ethereal vibe to the visuals of this show, which I particularly love.Characters: The characters in Loveless, much like the story, alternate between being barely tolerable at times and just plain bad for the most part. I willbe talking about the main characters in detail during the next section of the review, so this part is to mainly discuss the side characters. The majority ofthe side characters in Loveless are, to be frank, just straight up annoying and unrealistic to an unpleasant degree. And to be honest, I\'m still rathersuprised myself that I think this, since I usually tend to have a rather high tolerance for what people call ""annoying"" characters. But in all honesty, forthe most part I really did find all of the side characters to be truly unbearable. And to to top it all of, of course the one side character I actually didlike, Kio, got the least amount of screen time (*sob*)! I suppose I could also use this portion of the review to discuss the antagonists (yes, I said anta--gonists, as in multiple of them), but my feeling about them are for the majority the same as they were for the side characters.The Ship: And now for the part of the review I was most looking forward to! I only have three words to say: What. The. Heck. BL anime is no stranger toquesstionable ships, but not only is this REALLY pushing it, but I don\'t even know if you could call it a ship. Let\'s start by first talking about the agegap. A common trope in BL anime that although I don\'t really care for, tend not to mind for the most part. But here... Boy do I mind!! I am stunned that thisanime thought it would be okay to ship a BARELY 13-YEAR OLD middle schooler and a COLLEGE STUDENT?? And of course one of the first things that said collegestudent did upon meeting the middle schooler was to to force a kiss on him. I\'d say more, but, y\'know, spoilers. The second thing I want to bring up is thelack of actual love in this so-called ""BL"" anime. It is revealed multiple times that Soubi\'s (the college student) isn\'t even a result of an emotion hehimself feels (once again refraining myself because of spoilers) and Ritsuka (the middle schooler) just goes along with his advances because he\'s justflustered an/or that desperate for someone to love him. Another thing worth mentioning here is that 2 out of the 3 main female side characters are in lovewith Ritsuka for apparently no reason (one of whom is once again worryingly older than him).Story: By far the worst part of the show. Half of this show\'s description on MAL can just be disregarded because what could have been an interestingconcept to explore is just turned into an excuse to give certain characters a pair of cat ears and a tail. Not to mention that the majority of what or whyanything happens is never really explained properly at any point throughout the whole show.OST: The one other redeeming quality of this show. While I don\'t particularly care much for the opening and ending, I found a lot of the background pieces(especially the piano ones) to be rather enoyable.Overall Thoughts: Despite all of the bad things I\'ve said about this show, the main reason I\'d warn people against watching tis show is just because it\'sflat out boring.

However the if you can catch the humour of the yaoi the anime is pretty good to watch.Loveless i found was all about the main character Ritsuka suffering over the loss of his other bother and discovers what his brother was really like when his brother basically sent a gaurd to protect him. If your into the whole spell casting thing and a bit of romance and comedy you will love it. However for me, my final commment would have to be, its a good watch and...if someone lends you the anime go for it, but i wouldnt go out of my way to watch it. if someone lends you the anime go for it, but i wouldnt go out of my way to watch it.']"
Mahoutsukai Tai! (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/630/Mahoutsukai_Tai_TV,"[""Have you ever come a cross an anime series, and your first thoughts were: Wow, the character design and artwork look great, but I bet the story is shallow and boring? Looking at the above picture you might think that to yourself, but let me just say that this series truly is just as good as it looks. I am so glad I took the time to watch this!Summary:Mahou Tsukai Tai (Magical Users Club) first started out as a 6 episode OVA of the same name, then was later made into a 13 episode TV series. And as you would expect, takes place after the...events of the first series. After the giant bell is defeated! Now that being said, there really is no reason to not watch the TV series first if you wanted to, (the bell aside) there really isn't any kind of major plot change from the two, other than Sae and the gang playing more the role of rookie magicians in the OVA version. Also, the TV series has toned down the echhi-ness quite a bit when compared to the OVAs.Characters: 8/10The characters are all fleshed out quite nicely in this anime; Sae is your typical girl who doesn't have the confidence in herself, Nanka has the spunky spirit of the group, and Akane flakes any chance she gets. With that in mind however, none of the girl's personalities ever come out as annoying, in fact the only character that ever kinda annoyed me was &quot;Takeo.&quot; He rarely ever acts serious when the time calls for it, and falls more in the category of &quot;goofy&quot; than anything else. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just felt he tended to over do it at times. Oh and Ayanojyo? He will most likely crack you up with his hilarious pick up lines on Takeo. Sae is the one that stole the show for me though, she is the kinda character you just can't help but root for despite her self consciousness. Even though the story's main point is the magic, most epsiodes are split. In other words: half of the episode will be about magic, while the other half will just be about life's problems.Artwork: 8/10The clarity of the anime definitely shows its age when compared to now-a-days anime, but just because its an older title doesn't mean it can't stand up against some of the best series in this genera. And I personally feel it does! The art style is just great, each character has a distance look and reaction to certain problems, and (despite its age) is a quite colorful show, but never goes over board in that aspect, which is nice!Soundtrack: 7/10The soundtrack to this title is also quite charming. Both the opening and closing have a nice catchy beat......as does the main BG theme that plays throughout. The soundtrack is by no means the most memorable, but it does the anime justice! Though I only viewed the dub, it was quite well done and most characters did match decently with the voices they were given. Some may find a few on teh annoying side, but all in all they did their best.Story 8/10As far as the story goes, there isn't any main plot for the first half of the show. A mysterious entity appears to Sae on episode one, but pretty much remains in the background until later on. So the first half is mostly just the club members trying to hone their magic skills. The episodes do a great job of keeping you entertained, whether it be Sae messing up a spell that makes every doorway one goes into, make them end up in another part of town, to watching Sae grow ever closer to Takeo. And trust me it has so much to offer in its short time; you will laugh, cry, be puzzled or even be down right creeped out at times. (yes, this show does have it's eerie moments) Everything is settled at the end, with the exception of the relationships between the various characters, which I did feel was a little disappointing.Bottom line: 8/10Overall &quot;Mahou Tsukai Tai&quot; is an endearing overlooked series, and deserves much more attention than it gets. If you like the whole magical girl genera, I highly recommend trying this series out. It will most likely grow on you, as it did me. I hope that one day they bring this anime back in the form of a movie, or even better.....another season! events of the first series. After the giant bell is defeated!

Mahoutsukai Tai is memorable, in both entertaining and appalling ways; it's franchise that had a decent OVA and then duplicated into a GOD AWFUL television series that is among one of the worst that I've ever seen. After all, what is animation if you don't make objects float in the air instead of animating them?• Let's start with the OVA. The first thing that caught my attention in the OVA is amount of love the creators seemed to have poured into it. Though not necessarily good, you can tell...that the creators had an immense passion for their project.• This series seems to do what Project A-Ko did and expanded upon typical archetypes to make them entertaining. We have the pervert with glasses, the klutz, the tomboy, the flamboyantly gay guy, the beautiful flaky girl, and the ojou-sama character. Comedy with stereotypes can work if done right, and I think this OVA is a thumbs-up venture. On the other hand, while the OVA was endearing and lovable, the TV series the complete opposite. Please, if you get into the OVA, don't watch Magic User's Club TV .• The TV series debatably looks worse that some Christian cartoons that were probably funded by a small town church. The animation is ATROCIOUS. There's no point to even having made this sequel, because the new character that the TV series chooses to focus on has no point. Instead of fighting a menacing megalith, like in the previous version, it's just a little transgendered person that likes to mess around with the characters in his free time.• There's a school festival that lasts forever, and random things like Akane shrinking or Sae visiting her family. And none of these episodes are written in a charming or likable way, like the script in the OVA. I had to force myself to sit through this train-wreck of a TV series. It's like they wanted to make a lazy cash grab and decided to make all of the same jokes as the OVA to a nauseating degree with a low budget and questionable character developing moments.• Again, don't watch the TV series, but the OVA is fun. Watch that. Overall, I give Mahoutsukai Tai OVA a 5/10 and the TV series a deserved 1/10 because it was abominable! that the creators had an immense passion for their project.• This series seems to do what Project A-Ko did and expanded upon typical archetypes to make them entertaining.

Which can be found through my profile.------Both OVA and TV review-----✦StoryVery classic magic school Anime. Witches, spells, oldschool stereotypes and the whole general feel is pretty oldschool. I did like the style, but it probably has aged really bad for my taste.Anyhow, I felt that OVA story was more intriguing whilst TV series became oddly very dull. It did add in sense of mystery and some quirks, but the whole way how it was built was simply boring. As episodes passed, the more and more I started fast-forwarding. It simply felt lifeless to...watch.✦Art & SoundArt/animation was good enough. As for sound, I did notice quite some soundtracks and OP/ED was also quite nice.✦CharacterI felt that characters had nice stereotypes and their interaction was most of the time quite entertaining. But as time passed, I got really worn out by their whole character.Sawanoguchi was really cute oldschool moeblob. Found her adorable and probably liked her the most.Then we have straight-man act character, a loose model that likes to run around with men.And 2 main guy characters were sort of a pervy comedy duo. Whereas of the characters is comedic perv and other one is bishounen homosexual. So yeah, it made a good comedy material. Considering how of the guys imagines pervy stuff and gets lost in his fantasy world thinking about girls, whilst the homo kinda breaks that fantasy apart in humoric sense.Aside that we have few noticeable side-characters and some classy stereotypes. But aside that characters felt linear and eventually exhausting. But in the end, they were enjoyable enough.✦Enjoyment & OverallI just cannot explain any better than it probably aged badly for me. It had lot of ""classic"" elements I really liked, but all together it felt really dull and just simply ash-ilike.But OVA\'s were surely more enjoyable. So go check out OVA\'s as they are prequel anyways. And depending how much you like OVA\'s, expect the series being worse. That will help you as the viewer to decide whenever to bother touching TV series or not.Average says 5.5, but this one I don\'t feel like praising. Thus 5 overall. watch.✦Art & SoundArt/animation was good enough.

Night Head Genesis,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1243/Night_Head_Genesis,"[""Night Head Genesis is a show about people with psychic powers and the origin of that energy. It start with the story of the two brothers and their own problems being accepted in society due to their psychic power, evolves into a story about fighting to save the world from a supposed cataclysm and this unveils an elaborate plot about the world, nature, the growing psychic energy and its two sides, the good and the evil.The theory is well explained and based on common scientific knowledge with a spiritual touch, the energy of all living things, animal, plants and humans is evolving and granting...humans powers, all the wrongdoings of humanity turn this power into negative energy causing catastrophes and ultimately the armaggedon. Of course by doing good, and accepting the powers given to humanity we can evolve together with earth into a brighter future.The theory is basically this but while the show does a good job explaining it in the last episodes the plot is very flawed, for 20ish episodes you'll follow the story of the brothers fighting against a big corporation who doesn't care for the future of normal humans but suddenly the story ends abruptly without even explaining what happens to most characters.The last two episodes happen an year and half later and the two brothers again use their powers to prevent another disaster, this episodes are more of a showcase of what would be like if the show didn't end so fast i guess, wasting so many episodes building a complicated plot to end it abruptly greatly damages the show overall and despite the last episodes giving some clues helping to understand the whole story behind the psychic powers the previous 24 episode plot is just unfinished and the little story on the last two would probably be the start of another season. With all said and explained I cant recommend greatly this show despite having great potential, was completely ruined. Its still enjoyable and you do understand more or less what happens at the end, the soundtrack is very good and its not a bad watch if you can bare the sudden shallow ending and not knowing what happens to most secondary characters. humans powers, all the wrongdoings of humanity turn this power into negative energy causing catastrophes and ultimately the armaggedon.

With new darker pot twists introduced with every episode.Story: The story is slow paced and holds a dark overtone. It is the tale of two brothers cursed with psychic, telepathic and empathic which horrify there parents to the point that as children they are sent to a research facility far off in the woods with a powerful barrier keeping them confined within. The story starts when they are adults, escaping from the facility and trying to integrate back into everyday society. However the world is a dark place and they find out...quickly there kind are still very unwelcome. As mentioned the story moves along at a slow pace but maintains an ere of suspense as new complications arise for the two brothers being it of horrid visions of murder or a prophecy of death called the Black Stream. If you enjoy slow paced psychological plot lines then you will enjoy this show.Art: The art is fairly good though at some points when the characters are farther back in the short it seems that the animators got lazy. However the overall appeal of the characters soft and yet crisp looks makes it a treat for the eyes (when they are drawn in all there glory)Sound: The sound track is beautiful. Quiet and creepy and beautifully melodic. Remenicent of Angel Sanctuary's sound track and perhaps a bit of Yami no Matsuei.Character: There aren't many characters in the story as it mainly focuses on the lives of the two Kirihara brothers Naoto and Naoya as they try to integrate into society and use there evolving powers to help others when they can. Generally speaking though they are believable with strong personalities. Naoto takes the role of protective older brother who cares deeply for Naoya and although cool strong and composed is deeply afraid to lose Naoya as the two only have each other to depend on in the world. Naoya in turn deeply cares for his brother yet also is a little less cautious of the world being younger and a little less tainted. He is though kind and soft spoken less cautious and more willing to stray away from his brother.Enjoyment: Overall I found this series to be very good. Anyone who is a fan of supernatural/psychological suspenses will surley find it interesting from the get go. Although slow moving at times the show sets the view up with suspenseful twists that late lead to fierce psychic battles.Overall I give this a 9 as it was a refreshing take on a idea done many times prior with good story and good characters. quickly there kind are still very unwelcome.

Paranormal, sci-fi, two brothers - components for a decent anime. At the end though, this is one of those series that makes you want to take a screw driver to your eyes and ears.The sound is fantastic. It brings back memories of watching X-Files, and the people responsible for the score really hit this one on the head.The story is about standard anime fare - two protagonists which are brothers, gifted with extraordinary abilities, are prophesied to be either the destruction of the world or the rebirth of a...new one. However it takes a long time to drive home the plot and certain encounters drag out just for the sake of filling air-time. The animation is so-so, nothing spectacular.The characters are extremely annoying. The brothers depend on each other a lot, but their method of displaying their dependency drove me mad. The number of times the brothers call each other by name of just simply &quot;brother!!&quot; are through the roof. There's only so much repetition I can take - it brings back memories of DBZ where it took Gohan 3-4 episodes just to cast one energy ball. There is a considerable amount of verbal back and forth, mostly nonsensical threats that are associated with the worst of creature-of-the-week anime series.Unless you are extremely bored, and have absolutely nothing else to do with your time, I would give this anime series a pass. There's a lot of stuff out there to watch instead. new one. However it takes a long time to drive home the plot and certain encounters drag out just for the sake of filling air-time.

In short, the plot wasn\'t as straightforward as I would have liked. ""Plot holes"" was what came to mind, because the flow just didn\'t feel consistent enough.I...absolutely loved the art. The characters were pretty to look at, as was the scenery. And although some of the animation (mainly the scenes with cars) stood out, it was a steady flow of beauty. Another thing that I fell totally in love with was the music! Ending themes I didn\'t so much care for, but the beginning theme and overall soundtrack of the episodes were amazing.The only thing that really bugged me besides the troubles with the plot was the voice acting. Mostly it was good, but especially Naoya\'s ""screaming"" was something that kept me frowning - or cracking up, which probably wasn\'t what they aimed for. It just didn\'t sound real (it was very un-cool in a way).There wasn\'t all that much character development. In the case of Naoto there was some, because he had to come to terms with the darker side of his power, but either the story failed, or I didn\'t see the whole transition moving flawlessly. Naoto\'s reactions to a lot of things, especially as a kid, kept me shaking my head, but maybe that was just his bigheaded nature, who knows.All in all I enjoyed this series.

At first focusing on a series of cases where the brothers meet others with paranormal powers like themselves, they eventually cross paths with an enemy corporation seeking to abuse paranormal powers for their personal gain.On the one hand, Nighthead Genesis has its moments of effective storytelling and character depth as Naoya and Naoto encounter other espers like themselves who are outcasts due to their powers...and the brothers find themselves forced to deal with having to use their power to take lives when confronted with the enemy corporation espers later in the series. For the most part, the series applies the esper powers of the characters for more realistic applications as there are limitations to the scale and control that characters have with their powers and can find themselves becoming exhausted or being on the brink of death after applying large-scale effects with said power. Plus, the show's efforts with horror are genuinely suspenseful at points as enemy espers exploit the mental vulnerabilities of their victims to drive people against one another and to exploit the morality of the brothers to bring them under their control.On the other hand, the show's storytelling approach has quite a number of flaws. Night Head Genesis' pacing is slow enough to the point where it causes development in the plot to drag and the majority of antagonist characters are so shallowly evil that you could care less when they are eventually killed off, even with the show's half-assed attempt at trying to paint sympathy for a few of the villains in one of the final episodes of the series. An annoying feature of the series is Naoya's angsting during many of the show's intense moments, which will have you wishing you could punch the guy out. Also, some of the show's sci-fi elements go a bit too far within its boundaries when it explores elements such as what happens to an esper when their power evolves too much and a later case tackled by the brothers involving an earthquake hitting a town.The visuals to Night Head Genesis are also a major issue as the series is quite low-budget for a 2006 TV anime milking esper powers for a sci-fi anime. While sporting attractive-looking character designs, the series suffers from inconsistencies at many points with properly drawing their details, makes liberal use of animation shortcuts during action scenes and features laughably bad implementation of CG animation for vehicles and special effects that clash rather badly with the regular animation of the series.While Nighthead Genesis has its moments of effective storytelling and sci-fi lore, it still suffers greatly from plenty of missteps in its pacing, storytelling elements, characterization and visuals.

The plot was unique, the concept was cool, it had plenty of blood to satiate my tastes, and overall it was not a terrible anime.The only thing that irked me was how often Naoya yelled ""Niisan, help me!"" constantly. I even counted on one episode, and the number of times he yelled it amounted to probably 8 or so. It\'s ridiculous how much he relies on his older brother and how he can\'t fend for himself whatsoever.There is no character development. None.

It started off in a very promising manner where we're first introduced to the protagonists' powers, before the overarching plot is gradually brought into focus. All the minor subplots make sense, fit into the world, and help explain how Ark functions while also questioning its ambivalent nature and actions.I think the major gripe people might have with the anime is that it's not exactly what you'd call straightforward. A lot of things about the world are kept intentionally hidden from the viewer, and there's always this feeling that you're one step behind with knowing what's going...on. This holds true for the majority of episodes, and the issue stems from binging the series like I and probably everyone else did. As there was originally one week's wait between each episode, I couldn't shake the feeling that the creators intentionally left certain things shrouded in ambiguity in order for the viewers themselves to reflect over the new information acquired between episodes. That's also strengthened by the fact that there's a recap at the beginning of each one. It's not until the final few episodes are over with that things fall into place, but even then it's still not the instant gratification that modern anime would emphasise. This style in itself is not bad, but is definitely something for a viewer to be wary of.Characters were decent with some outliers. In regards to the protagonists, the brothers hone their contrasting powers and learn more about their place in this world, though that's about it for their character development. But frankly speaking, that's already more than enough. Seeing Naoya being able to use his powers towards the end of the series without the same fear compared to earlier episodes was nice, as he was previously more or less unable to even touch anyone but Naoto. In particular I enjoyed the character of Shouko. It's rather hard to go over why without treading into spoiler territory, but her role in the story turned out to be completely different from what I originally expected when she was introduced. Possessing the tremendous power she did led me to believe that she'd use it for a certain cause, but what actually took place was very well done as it both demonstrates a particular plot point and heightens the stakes for what might become a reality. Some may say that potential is lost, but this anime is not about each individual character as it is about the world itself.I haven't seen the original TV drama so I cannot give any comparisons in that regard. Overall however, I liked this anime, in particular its tempo, music, and artstyle. It had some flaws, but this is still a solid 7/10 for me. on.

Ningyo no Kizu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2017/Ningyo_no_Kizu,"[""The Mermaid Saga has a complicated history. The manga was written by Takahashi Rumiko from 1984-1994. In that time there were fourteen episodes that ended up being collected in three volumes. Two volumes of the manga got released as OVAs and, in 2003, those same volumes were released as a full length anime. I haven't read the Manga so I couldn't speculate as to why the final volume always gets left out.Mermaid's Scar has a fairly simple plot. Mermaids exist and eating their flesh either makes humans immortal or, far more likely, turns them into amphibious monsters. The story begins with two seemingly young...people named Yuta and Mana heading to a new town on the same bus as a small child. At this town they hear rumours about the child's mother coming back from the dead and begin to suspect that she's eaten mermaid's flesh. But there are things going on that they can't predict. Things that could have dire consequences for both of them. The story is pretty well constructed and it feels complete, even though it's the middle of the series. The only real issues are that some of the twists don't make a lot of sense and the action isn't set up very well.The characters are pretty flat. The majority of them have only a few personality traits, leaving them very flat. The only character who actually gets pretty fleshed out is the antagonist.The art is dated and, unlike 3x3 eyes, it hasn't aged too well. The backgrounds are bland and the characters have very forgettable looks. It's not terrible, but it certainly doesn't have a distinctive or interesting look.The voice work is okay. Yamadera Kouichi and Takaya Minami both do good jobs overall. The only problem is that they get overly melodramatic at times.The yuri factor is a 1/10. This is another series where the female characters barely even interact with each other.My final rating for Mermaid's Scar is a 5/10. The writing is good, but the flat characters, bland art and mediocre voice work all make for an average series. Honestly, if the concept sounds intriguing to you, I would check out the Manga instead. Is the full length anime any better? I haven't seen it so I can't judge. What I can say is that the Mermaid's Scar OVA is just average. people named Yuta and Mana heading to a new town on the same bus as a small child.

The basic premise of the story had promise: either become immortal or a monster through eating mermaid flesh. What broke it for me were the characters. Or rather, the lack of characters. The only two that were halfway tolerable were Mana and the 'mother'. The rest were flat and dull in my opinion including the antagonist. The art style is pretty outdated even in my eyes with the static shots and the awkward pauses in conversations. The voice acting...again refer to above for my opinion. It could have been...a great story (haven't seen Mermaid Forest I will admit so I don't know if that's any good), but it needed better characters to help carry the story, and better dialogue. a great story (haven't seen Mermaid Forest I will admit so I don't know if that's any good), but it needed better characters to help carry the story, and better dialogue."", ""I just got here from reviewing the first movie, because I watched them right in a row (I have too much time on my hands LOL). The animation and voice acting is about the same, the characters are bland and flat, there's nothing interesting to them, they don't really have any personality traits, and the only thing that sets this villain aside is that it's a child. I assume they use the same actors for the English dub in this movie as the first one, but I didn't look before reviewing this and I'm not going to stop revealing it to look now. I'll just...say that once again it's very mediocre.This movie did not keep my attention as well as the first one I'll admit. A lot more of a plot seems forced, like the part where it turns out that the kid is the bad guy instead of his mom. Then you spend the rest of the movie rooting for them to just kill the damn kid already, but it doesn't really happen and...honestly I got bored so I don't really remember the ending, except it felt very abrupt. Of course the protagonists survived, because this is the middle of the manga, you can't kill off the main characters when there's the rest of the story to finish.4/10 say that once again it's very mediocre.This movie did not keep my attention as well as the first one I'll admit.

number24,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39583/number24,"['One of the few rugby shows I initially scoffed at, at trying to be another abysmal Try Knights, but what it does, it does one thing well: sold the premise on bonds and friendship over the sport through improvement.Being someone who is harsh on all aspects, I was surprised to find out that veteran script/series composer Rika Nanase is on this, and despite the no-name 3rd-rate production staff team onboard of this show, she definitely stands out as the main source of enjoyment, considering the ""cult following"" success of this show (for the 3 of you who watched this). Bleach, Eyeshield 21, Higurashi, Junjou Romantica,...you name it, she has done all and shown her prowess at taking a genre and subconsciously subverting it to make up for the enjoyment experience, and it has certainly done in good spots.What number24 is all about is not rugby, but the bishie sportsboys of Doushisha themselves. What the team comprises are of dreams of former players that don\'t belong and/or have given up in rugby, only to find themselves in the sport that\'s mostly persistent through the bonds and friendship of the bishounens involved.Take the main team\'s quintuple for example: Natsusa Yuzuki, Yuu Mashiro, Yasunari Tsuru, Seiichirou Jingyouji and Ibuki Ueoka. These 5 have weaved the same red thread of fate for themselves in the path to find their true stance towards one another:Natsusa, being taken out of the team and imposed the Manager status (due to circumstances that rendered him unplayable on the field);Ibuki, who has lost his heart towards playing rugby and has no desire to take up the sport once again (but only does because of Natsusa\'s persistent teasing);Yasunari, in spite of being Natsusa\'s junior, has certain disagreements to how he\'d function around the sport and leading his own private life;Yuu, in spite of his small size and although being barely fit to play, made him the Zhuge Liang team strategist and following under Natsusa\'s imposed leadership;Last but not least, Seiichirou, more than being the tropey childhood friend, is constantly being roped in by Natsusa due to his monotonous life and needing someone to lead his life.Add in the seniors and juniors who only got less screentime and act as second fiddle alongside them, the characters overall are brutal for what they do, but it\'s also the same actions that teach them the meaning and spirit of camaraderie despite the different plays of all of them. Not to mention the light-hearted comedy that stems from Natsusa\'s improvised childishness to tease the characters so much it gives off a good chuckle. And that gets a very good sense of debunking the heart of this show, which starts off slow but gives a nice reward at the finish line.Rightaway, the art/animation itself I really didn\'t have high hopes for and think much of since it\'s PRA (a studio mainly relying on outsource help), but to my genuine surprise that everything is clean and distilled, a better effort and not the far cry from Gonzo and Seven\'s efforts to produce Try Knights (like they have a very limited budget). Yes, everything is far from perfect (some PowerPoint-like recycled visuals), but it never really came off as something that\'s left to be desired. And for the longest time, breaking out of their shell to have a majority production stake is a good thing for the uninitiated. A fine job, really TBH, I\'m impressed.On the sound side, it\'s all fair, no complaints here. OP is good, and the numerous EDs are worth the ear-listening treatment from the bishie boys. A good job to the all-male VA team.I\'d think that for future sports shows like this going forward, constructing good character-driven stories is what keeps this genre flourishing, and also getting the right people to handle their job scopes (a.k.a Rika Nanase) is the first sign of relief that this isn\'t the low-tier that we\'ve come to expect from shitty shows (a.k.a Try Knights, Cinderella Nine etc.). If only the anime industry have learned their lessons well...Nevertheless, for sports fans, a good enticement of drama and play is essentialal, and I kid you not, this show delivers.

But if you want a fun, uncomplicated anime about attractive college guys who occasionally play rugby, then you came to the right place.Number24 is not an innovative anime, not deviating much from the tropes included in many similar anime from the past decade. It follows the members of an university rubgy club, showing the personal motivations and insecurities of the characters, as well and the interactions and conflict between them....Like many similar anime, it suffers from a weak plot (some episodes are completely all over the place in this regard) and the pacing is a bit of a mess. Also like many similar anime, it has waaay too many characters for a one cour anime, wasting time on trying to tell everyone\'s story instead of focusing more on the main characters and their stories. However,  Number24 is one of the most enjoyable ""pretty boys anime"" I\'ve watched.The main characters are well fleshed out, with distinct personalities and motivations, and undergo positive development and growth. Natsusa is a really fun protagonist and his character arc of getting into terms with the fact that he can\'t play rugby anymore (not a spoiler, we\'re told this on the first 10 minutes) and trying to make the best out of his new circumstances was pretty touching and inspiring. It\'s also nice that the anime focuses a lot on the managers and showcases how much they help the team. The other four main characters (Yuu, Sei, Ibuki and Yasunari) all are very endearing, having their own character arcs, and all the secondaries are pretty fun. The dynamics between the characters are really fun, and if you enjoy having lots of ship teasing, you\'ll like this.Imo the humor was also pretty fun, with some moments that legit had me laughing out loud, so even if the plot goes nowhere and the pacing was quite slow, this anime never bored me. The rugby scenes, while scarce, were in general exciting enough, especially in the last two episodes, and you don\'t need to have the slightest clue about rugby to enjoy them. The music is nice enough too, with three different EDS that alternate.The acting was also pretty good overall, with some really well known names such as Saitou Souma (who plays a really fun character and does a great job) or Ishikawa Kaito.In summary, if you\'re looking for some sports anime in the same fashion as haikyuu, you\'re going to be severely disappointed. But if you\'re looking for an anime more in the style of prince of stride or cheer danshi (but better than those imo) with likeable male characters and plenty of shippy fanservice and shirtless guys, then you\'ll probably have a good time with this. Like many similar anime, it suffers from a weak plot (some episodes are completely all over the place in this regard) and the pacing is a bit of a mess.

I will try to keep this short and sweet so you can read it quickly to decide if you are going to watch this anime.story: (no spoilers) the main character (Natsuya) got into a car accident and became not able to play rugby. He decided to join as the manager in a collage rugby club. And the anime talks about a senior of Natsuya, a junior of Natsuya, the kicker of the team and a the rest of the team. I really love...rugby so I decided to watch this show. At first, the show was funny and cool but then, the events got random and messy. However, it was cool to see that Natsuya was a manager instead of a player so we can see the players play in a way the manager sees it. I also feel that the matches were way too short. Rugby matches are 80 minutes long, and there is no way they could cover the match in half an episode (10 minutes). The matches seemed like match high-lights, and not an actual rugby match. So 4/10 for the story, disappointing.Art: Not much to say about it, I don\'t really love it but it is not bad. But my problem with the art are 1. the hair styles are way too weird. (Even for anime) 2. The colour scheme is way too pastel and bright, it bothered me a little. The animation has no problem, I am OK with it. 6/10, OKSound: Openings and Endings are pretty awesome, soundeffects and BGMs fit to the parts. 7/10, NiceCharacters: Except Natsuya who had an unique and fun personality and Ibuki who is the relatable dude, other characters had minimal to no real personality and character development. I feel that almost all the characters are way to ""childish"" for being collage student. I don\'t think Collage students are this easy to get that triggered and angry. For the designs, some characters looked way too young. Yuu looked like he could pass for a Grade 6 or 7 when he is in collage, I really though so at first. 5/10, so so.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed the first episodes, they are funny and somewhat interesting. I would be looking forward to Wednesdays when new episodes come out. But for the last few episodes, Idon\'t think I really enjoyed it or not, I only watched the last few episodes because I would like toknow how the story ends or does the ending improve. I won\'t spoil for you. 6/10, fair.Overall: 5, it is average rugby so I decided to watch this show. At first, the show was funny and cool but then, the events got random and messy.

This season is a relatively odd season for anime imo. A lot of hit or miss shows; some catered towards a specific audience. The sports scene tho is pretty great. I mean diamond no ace act ll, the long awaited haikyuu s4, ahiru no sora and a new find Number24.Honestly, i was hooked on episode 1. It really reminded me of free, which is another show i'm a fan of. Rather than sport driven it is character driven, in the aspect...that we don't see too much of the sport itself. At least for now they are definitely showing us a dysfunctional team trying to get up and play some fuckin rugby! I like the characters, they're mostly fun. I won't say the characters are original per se, but the way i see it, in most sports anime it's about the characters attitude towards the sport and that's precisely what we see. We see interactions and growing bonds and some good ol teamwork in the making. Not much complaint there. It is what it is as a sports anime and does it well. Of course there's also the male eye candy aspect to it. Some of their faces are pure bliss to look at and if you're into muscles you'll like their bodies too.Again, this wasn't very constructive, but i imagine that most sports anime fans will like it. It has the drama and the play, although i will say not too much play. That might turn some people who want more of the game away from it. But overall it's solid. It's very enjoyable and unexpectedly i am loving the main character and am very attached to the team.I hope to see more seasons of the anime after s1 ends!

Sure, I can admit and say that Number 24 is far from perfect, especially its animation inconsistencies at times and powerpoint-like transitions, along with it\'s expected one-dimensional side characters because of its huge cast to squeeze with only 12 episodes to do so. But besides that, everything else was pretty great.The art of the characters, and the coloring of the entire show felt soft. The entire show is more character-driven, slice of life rather than being just...a rUgby focused show. You will grow to love the entire rugby team, especially the MC. I have never really come across an MC like this guy. I\'ve heard people say the pacing is strange but imo, it has pretty excellent pacing, and keeps you wanting to watch the next episode. Very lovable characters with distinct personalities, and an overall lighthearted atmosphere. There\'s not one episode where I don\'t smile so wide I\'m giddy, or feel my heart go warm from the sweetness of some moments. Its also quite funny. With decent amounts of drama.I was looking for an anime like Free! and found something quite enjoyable, but if i were to look at it whole Free! still win by miles of course. I have yet to finish this anime, just one more episode to go, but I can\'t help but tell you that this is quite underrated. I just had to express all the positive parts of this series and urge you to watch it. People might be hesitant because of the fanservice or ""fujo bait"", but overlook that the show is much more than that. Try it, and maybe you\'ll get hooked like I am if you\'re looking for some enjoyment to kill your time.This anime is a good example for me not to judge an anime based on its MAL score.

This show deserves a little bit more support', 'Sports anime? More like a Boys Life anime. I learned nothing about rugby but wholeheartedly enjoyed the character interactions and Natsusa being a snarky, lovable gremlin. For only 12 episodes, there was a lot of potential for the plot to be fleshed out more and for the character stories to be explored fully. Instead of a focus on the sport anime genre, this show falls into more of a slice-of-life category, so if you\'re down to relax and watch some chaos ensue from Natsusa\'s shenanigans, here you go.STORY (8/10): For an original TV series, it COULD be better, but maybe if we get a season...2, then perhaps the pacing may see some improvement. There\'s some plot around the team assembling, internal conflict and friction between main and side characters. It wasn\'t necessarily tiring, but you could understand the frustrations and motivation of the people involved. There were several moving parts and many characters, so I feel like a bit more screen time could have been dedicated towards the main trio to fully tell their story. Understanding that the rugby team is big and the fact that we need to gain some perspective on each character involved to feel some empathy, for a 12 episode story, I think it may have been easier to just either make this 24 episodes so we can connect better or just skimp out on the non-main characters. I like the premise of where the story is going, however the animation team could have gone deeper so they can pour salt over our wounds. There\'s definitely more left to be desired.ART (9/10): I like the art. It\'s aesthetically pleasing. It\'s the whole reason I started watching it. Natsusa is pretty. Yuu is cute. Yasunari looks badass. Seiichirou exudes ikemen energy. Ibuki.... is Ibuki. Plus I need to pinch all the junior\'s faces please. Also the ending credits theme has the softest art. Hnnnnng.SOUND (7/10): Nothing too remarkable about it. I like the music box BGMs since it adds a touch of sweetness. Best song out of the 3 ED themes has got to be ""Kimi to Iru Nara"". It grabs your heart and puts it on chokehold. Whoever the heck directed Episode 8 knew what they were doing because the storyboard/music/art direction for that episode got me still thinkin about it.CHARACTER (8/10): I started watching this show because I saw a clip of Natsusa being an obnoxious, snarky brat and I wholeheartedly love him for it. He is a refreshing change to the typical short / cute boy. He\'s got bite. He\'s got an attitude. And he doesn\'t want your patronizing sympathy. And he is 10000% a bully. He\'s hilarious. Plus, his interactions with Ibuki are the best. Short man has zero chill and is savage. Although Sei is a guy with little words, he is a sweetheart who deeply cares about Natsusa. I don\'t think there was enough air time to build on all of the other characters though, like Ibuki and Sei. They have solid premises and an interesting backstory that isn\'t discussed in detail because of the limited episodes.ENJOYMENT (9/10): The show literally went ham within the first 20 seconds of the first episode. Our main boy gets into a car wreck and you get to see the moment that completely messes up his neck for life. That can actually happen to people in reality who end up suffering with chronic pain or relapses, and I think that was what drew me to the show at first. Every time he suffers, I physically wince from the pain on his behalf since I also personally injured my neck in the past and it is not fun. It\'s tragic. It\'s devastating. It\'s life-changing but admirable how Natsusa still tries to remain in the world of rugby as a manager even he can no longer be on the field. It\'s frustrating and can be a harsh reality for athletes or even regular people in our day to day lives. We\'re all one accident away from a potentially life-altering event that could impact our mobility.  I don\'t recall watching any anime that focuses on these types of impacts about a character suffering from some disability/chronic pain, and that\'s what I appreciated about Number24. It\'s not like the typical sports anime with crazy superpowers (except for Ibuki and Sei\'s incredible skill I suppose-- but I don\'t follow rugby in real life to comment on how realistic their talent is). It\'s just a bunch of college dudes doing a sport they truly love. It\'s about basking in the sweet camaraderie of teamwork. It\'s about collectively working towards the same goal. It\'s about learning to let things go. Even if the show is rushed and we didn\'t get to see a lot of plot in detail, I feel that it was in the right direction. With more budget and HOPEFULLY a season 2, we can probably expect a jump in quality.Overall (8/10): If you enjoy slice of life/character interactions and not an in-depth explanation of the sport, give this a try. Natsusa carries the cast with his humor and evil tendencies. The main trio are my favourite. There is untapped potential for how good Number24 could have been with all of the ideas introduced in the show, but I\'ll give them some credit for an original production. Also, the ship fuel has been fantastic. Much wholesome. Very comedic. I don\'t even care if they are platonic or baiting. This was so fun to watch and I hope we get a season 2.

If you\'re looking for a pure anime with the excitement of the matches and training then this ain\'t really for you. This anime follows the inner struggles of the team-mates and how they should be doing to overcome those complexes. What I\'m trying to say is that this anime focuses more on the emotional aspect of the team rather than the actual game time. However, the games ain\'t forgotten but not ""enough"" as in other sports anime. Though, I would really recommend this anime for those of you who like slight angst,...some unique characters, and struggles a team can have both individually and together as a team. some unique characters, and struggles a team can have both individually and together as a team.', ""At first, I was really apprehensive about watching another sports anime especially after how much I enjoyed Haikyuu. That said, I was hooked from the first episode. I haven't watched many sports animes, but I think this one did an excellent job of standing out. It's a daunting task to try and highlight so many characters in such a limited amount of episodes. However, the story flowed beautifully with dynamic characters, plenty of comedic relief, and a great emphasis on the bonds shared between teammates and the struggle to overcome one's own shortcomings. Each character is trying their best to move forward and improve themselves...which was very enjoyable to watch. Each character, no matter how small, plays a role in tying the story together and contributing to the development of their comrades. Usually, I find myself unsatisfied with shorter animes but the ending left me completely satisfied and wanting more. which was very enjoyable to watch.

Setting this first premise aside, let\'s start talking about some more specific aspects.The story itself wasn\'t that bad and I found it quite enjoyable, but they could have surely done much better. On the good side, the secondary characters\' dynamics were pretty good as they were somehow connected to each other but what leaves a bit to be desired is the final result, as it looks more like a mishmash of random events than a series...of sub-plots that had some potential to become even more important in a future season. Even so, it was simple and easy to follow and, although the ending is quite rushed even for a anime that most likely will have a second season, at the end of the day the story in general was quite good.Another aspect that left me with a sour taste in my mouth was the art; I truly loved all the characters\' designs, but - especially in the second part - the animations were kinda crappy at some point and there were a few parts where the voice and the face didn\'t go along at all. It doesn\'t make sense if the character is speaking calmly but then his face suggests he\'s screaming, right?As for the sound part, all the VAs did a great job portraying these characters and I don\'t have any major complaint about this aspect. Maybe the only ""bad"" point I can mention is that some parts felt kinda empty, but this has nothing to do with the dub and, apart from that, it was pretty good.Finally, the characters. I was fairly impressed to see such a character like Natsusa having a main role as his counterpart in most spokons would be either a supporting cast or a second lead if they\'re really lucky. The analysis of his character was pretty good and I genuinely felt happy or sad for him as the story processed and he surely is a character you either love or hate, you still care for him. As for the other characters in the main cast, Seiichirou might come off as the cliché childhood friend who totally depends on Natsusa, but I think he\'s much more than that, it\'s just that we didn\'t get to see enough of him to think of him as a separate person. About Ibuki and Yuu, they\'re really good characters and they have been analyzed quite well, especially Ibuki as he largely contributes to create a different troupe for the main character than the one he was following before. About Yuu, we can say that his insecurities and struggles have been analyzed in dept and that he effectively achieves his goal to improve himself as a manager.All in all, number24 was a pretty enjoyable anime and, if it wasn\'t for the sloppy animations and the confused sub-plots, it would have easily been one of the best, if not the best ""spokon"" (I\'m not sure if it can really be called a spokon though.)Sorry for my bad English! of sub-plots that had some potential to become even more important in a future season.

Natsusa can't play rugby anymore but he's still so lively and cheerful. It's a heartwhelming story about overcoming injury and being aroud the thing you like to do.It's not an so sport focused, so you won't learn much about rugby itself. it's more relashionship and growing up focused. The characters are in college, some questions about going pro or not, discovering your own strenghts, what you can and can not doNatsusa's personality is so mean, likes to bully around for fun, and Seiichirou is more of a straight-thinking guy but they get a long so well.Never skip the ending!The ending...singed by the cast is adorable !The fan service is great also. Characters very shippable! singed by the cast is adorable !The fan service is great also. Characters very shippable!"", ""Story & Characters: 2/10Number24 does well to introduce a lifestyle characteristic among the gung-ho sport of university level rugby. The story is more on the idyllic side with its laid back tonality between characters and rugby matches; This leads me to say that it doesn't suit the typical mens sport theme well in my opinion. This series centers around a very exuberant main character Natsu whose purpose is to appear vulnerable among the other players in the team; He tends to involve himself in situations that don't require his input and becomes quixotic as the story progresses. However, that aside I found the genuine comradery...between opponents and the Doushisha University team surprising for a change; There were subtle scuffles between opponents but in the end many of the characters seemed to be written with the least pernicious way. My rating reflects on the more subtle yet obvious femininity among the male characters and blatant fan service field trip scenes; It personally wasn't to my liking but I understand that this portrayal is mellifluous to the target demographic. Finally, it would have been better to have some form of rugby narration regarding the plays being made during the matches; There were minimal efforts regarding the rules and overall character narration but right up till the end there was no effort to mention some form of rules or play making narration.Art & Sound: 5/10The art and animation are more on the vibrant side with character design taking on the approach of a more colorful set of characters.

My rating reflects on the more subtle yet obvious femininity among the male characters and blatant fan service field trip scenes; It personally wasn't to my liking but I understand that this portrayal is mellifluous to the target demographic. Finally, it would have been better to have some form of rugby narration regarding the plays being made during the matches; There were minimal efforts regarding the rules and overall character narration but right up till the end there was no effort to mention some form of rules or play making narration.Art & Sound: 5/10The art and animation are more on the vibrant side with character design taking on the approach of a more colorful set of characters.

I loved every character so much and was sad when this show ended.The art was stunning!!! I couldn't get over how visually pleasing it was.I had never really seen any rugby games IRL but this show had a decent amount of the sport. It wasn't as much as other sports anime, but I feel like it would have been boring if they added too much of it.

I ended up liking every minute of it. A pretty boy for every taste, a snarky banters, a game that you don\'t need to understand to follow, and lots of drama. My brain left on a vacation, leaving me with two brain cells and they were enough to make the task done.Summary. The plot is pretty sad if you think about it. A rugby prodigy got into a motorcycle accident and was left paralyzed for months. With a serious neck injury as a result of it (a herniated disk),...even tackling him has paralyzing repercussions. And like that his rugby career is over. To stay in a game that he adores, Natsusa decides to transform from the player to the manager and trainer of the club. From that point onward, he figures out the club\'s internal drama and supports others. Dear, made myself depressed now. Besides the main storyline, several smaller ones are a joy to follow like who of them will go pro.I fancy Natsusa, my cocky little gremlin. Put in an unfair and tragic situation, he chooses to focus on the things he can do, rather than drown in misery. But you can see that takes its toll on him. Aside from his resolve, he is pretty eccentric. Cunning and sarcastic, perceptive and opportunistic primadonna. A scheming sweet-talker. A little sh*t you will love. DON’T skip the ending theme.It\'s a sports anime, so you know what that means...A bunch of pretty boys. Every guy here can be described in two three words: a big bro guy, a bad boy guy, a friendly chubby guy, a strict vice-captain guy, a lean smart guy... there are 24 of them, so start your list for easier memorization now! Some of them get some semblance of a thought-out personality, while others stayed one-dimensional. Either way, I like them hanging out together and being bros. By the time of the final game, I cared enough to be tense and worry about the score.There are a lot of yaoi moments, but not official feelings. It’s quite obvious who is couple with who, even though it’s packaged as brotherly love. Dub goes one step further in that direction and amplifies words like thirsty or thick. There are some telling physical contacts and positions, too.This anime lives for drama. Boys are always calling out and one-upping each other. Some rivalry here, some hurt feelings there, some buried history between. Many of the conflicts are solved by boys opening up and sharing their feelings, or throwing each other on the field. And at the end of each fight, some basic lesson about teamwork and self-confidence is served. ""Something something positive vibes, bla bla believe in yourself"". A pep talk never-ending.Art is by far the weakest part of the anime. There is no fluidity of movement and lots of camera cuts when rugby is being played. Everything looks generic and done cheaply. And that eye coloring could be better. Also, why did they make the title design so ugly? It pains me to even look at it. And that crown on top of 24. A royalty?

But upon starting it, I was thoroughly surprised by the theme of friendship. There definitely were scenes that were questionable and fruity, but it wasn\'t overbearing and honestly, I would\'ve had no complaints if there were more.To start with, the characters are peak enjoyment for me. I love the MC and his very hot and cold personality. At one point he gets called a tsundere and that\'s pretty much what...he is, except likable and funny. You don\'t see many MC\'s with this type of personality, they\'re usually A main character but not THE. There are many typical and common tropes but it was comforting. My favourite type of characters were part of the team like Sei, who is quiet, lowkey monotone and calm, but has a soft spot for one person. Many eccentric players, like the second years, who are either weird or sadistic (MC MC MC and one other). There is that boy who kinda looks like a girl and isn\'t as manly as the others, but he plays an important part, and adds to the plot.The plot itself was straight-forward. The MC stays by rugby by being the manager to the team he played with and we see the team overcome fights, differences, jealousy etc etc. The pacing was perfect for 12 episodes, great character development and nearing a 9 at this point. I wish there was a season 2, but it ends on the right tone.Overall, I highly suggest watching this. There\'s probably only about 4 girls shown (for about 15 secs max) throughout the entirety of this, so the testosterone level is HIGH. Which shouldn\'t be that surprising considering it\'s a sports anime about a guys COLLEGE rugby team. Think Free! in terms of character and plot but in rugby. he is, except likable and funny.

Nekopara,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38924/Nekopara,"['Winter 2020 has been a pretty dismal season for anime overall. Eizouken will of course run away with anime of the season because it had exactly ZERO competition that could stop it. It doesn’t matter how boring, self-indulgent, or repetitive it is. Yuasa directed it and Eizouken has a budget, so compared to the rest of the Spring 2020 lineup it’s like watching Canelo Alvarez fight a bunch of children. My personal anime of the season is Interspecies Reviewers, but I can’t review that for a few more days. Instead, let’s look at a series that apparently met Funimation’s high moral standards. This is the...bizarre dumpster fire known as Nekopara.So what the fuck is a Nekopara? Well you see, Nekopara is a shitty H-game from 2014. For the first 2 years, absolutely no one gave a fuck, but then in 2016-2017 it became a popular gag gift on Steam. A shitty game that’s really cheap, so you buy it during a steam sale and gift it to your friend as a joke, knowing that they will probably never play it. Yet SOMEHOW, this piece of shit got an anime adaptation. Why didn’t Big Rigs get an anime adaptation? Why didn’t Bad Rats get an anime adaptation?So why complain about Nekopara? It’s just porn after all! Just shut the hell up and enjoy the cat boobs and literal pussy! You can’t, because the anime removed all the H content and decided to bank on the strong plot and characters. You read that right. This is a game where humanoid cat girls are sent via post to some chef and must help out in his restaurant. In the game he of course bangs these girls, despite the fact they’re only 4 years old and have the minds of children. In the anime, they just kind of hang out and do…nothing. There are tons of slice of life shows where basically nothing happens, but Nekopara sets a new low bar. Since the anime isn’t a porn, I end up having to think about the stuff the writer didn’t want people to think about. Where did these catgirls come from? What is the history of Mankind’s interaction with this species? They seem to have roughly human intelligence and can speak Japanese fluently, but they count as pets and legally as property. It’s not all bad being a cat slave though. The girls get a pretty bell necklace when they learn not to run away. Can’t have your harem of catgirls getting Drapetomania!Did I mention this series got over 1 million dollars via crowdfunding? How is that even possible? I can only assume that some basement dweller used his bitcoin wealth that he collected playing Warcraft 10 years ago. I know I bang on about this in too many reviews, but half of Spice and Wolf and over half of Baccano were never adapted! There are SO many good anime that need another season, but Nekopara is what makes its crowdfunding goals and gets made. Also fuck Funimation for picking this up, dubbing it, and distributing this instead of Reviewers. Gen Fukunaga should be tied to a bed and forced to spend a passionate evening with Elza the hyena girl! bizarre dumpster fire known as Nekopara.So what the fuck is a Nekopara?

Simply put, it’s a very relaxing show with extreme amounts of literal and figurative fluff.Ironically, in contrast to its hentai origins, Nekopara is one of the most wholesome shows I’ve seen. Narratively, there’s not much on the way of plot in this show. It’s very much a “monster” of the week type thing with each episode providing a new challenge or event for the girls to prepare for. These will usually be 90 percent fluff and 10 percent fan service.If you’re looking for a fun and relaxing way to deal with the current...uncertain times and pass time, enjoy CGDCT or cat girls, this is your show. Don’t expect anything groundbreaking or revolutionary, but you will certainly get a laid back and cozy ride.Technically, there’s not much to speak of. This isn’t a battle shonen so there’s no real need for high quality animation. The art, however is extremely well done making the show nice and bright. This adds to that cute feel of the show.In conclusion, Nekopara despite being no masterpiece, was one of my favourite shows of the season and helped me to wind down at the end of the week after class. It was a consistent and fun ride throughout and I look forward to future content.Nekopara gets 8 Nya’s out of 10. uncertain times and pass time, enjoy CGDCT or cat girls, this is your show.

But with every new episode it became more and more clear — Nekopara is hot garbage.Each catgirl gets one comic gag assigned in the beginning of the season, and then writers exploit it repeatedly in almost every episode. Including bringing character up just for a few seconds to show yet another version of the same joke they made in ep1.While each episode has an interesting idea — Cinnamon exploring her breeding desires or Cacao looking for new owners, every single one of them fails both to develop said characters...or move the story. In fact it doesn\'t move even an inch forward.There\'s no progression in any way. That\'s why you can\'t compare Nekopara to any decent slice-of-life where the overall story still moves: be it school year, visible career changes or something else.If this show were an isekai, it would be ""In Another World with My Smartphone"". Just appalling in how big of a failure this is. or move the story. In fact it doesn\'t move even an inch forward.There\'s no progression in any way.

Just appalling in how big of a failure this is.', 'A question: I\'m pretty sure it\'s established somewhere in the VNs that they\'re genetically engineered \'cat girls\', so why call them \'cats\'?\xa0 Are there actual cats in this world aside from catgirls, or are all cats catgirls now?\xa0 Yes, I seriously thought about this hypothetical question while watching the show.Story:Within the Minazuki household lives six different catgirls.\xa0 When the older of the two siblings leaves to start his own patisserie business, the two youngest cats follow their master and appear in boxes as he\'s moving in while the other four cats and his little sister stay behind in their family home, occasionally coming by to...take shifts at the pastry shop.\xa0 And thus (I guess) starts another chapter of their lives.Aside from the first three episodes which establish a completely new character to the Nekopara series, the anime comprises of only one-off stories that put one or two of the catgirls (who\'re conveniently put together in pairs) in some kind of situation that serves as the episode\'s focus, rarely deviating from that single story before the twenty four minutes are up before a different set takes their place in the next episode.\xa0 As a result, conflicts for the anime typically only exist within the confines of the episode, so there really isn\'t any overarching things to keep track of.As for the content, the show is (of course) only focused on cat-based stuff.\xa0 Rather than spending time with Kashou, the cats\' male master, practically everything in the series centers around how the cats interact with each other and any relationship changes that might occur as a result of the episode\'s conflict being resolved.\xa0 The conflicts themselves though feel very random.\xa0 One episode can be about something vastly different than another\'s, and I felt a little thrown off watching at times because one episode can have the girls telling stories in a blackout, and the next has two of them going through a giant, custom-built obstacle course that comes out of nowhere.Despite the surprising amount of variance the episodes have though, Nekopara just feels...boring to watch.\xa0 Even if the content is different, the general storytelling of the anime is centered solely around the girls acting like cats in every conceivable situation, and hardly anything really changes.\xa0 Because conflicts are so easily resolved, there\'s not a lot of actual plot to draw the attention of the viewer, especially since the cute girls are probably the biggest selling point the show has.\xa0 Without that, there\'s hardly anything else that can really hook the viewer, which is made especially boorish when the girls can be extremely hit or miss depending on who they are and whether or not they\'re the focus at the time.As a result, Nekopara\'s story feels less like a \'story\' and more like a collection of memories put together one after another and told through hearsay.\xa0 The episodic storytelling is by no means bad, but everything about them lacks anything significant to draw in the viewer aside from the girls doing their damndest at being cute, acting cute, and having whatever little powwow at the time to keep the episode moving.\xa0 The content feels extremely samey, and given how the Nekopara VNs pan out, a part of me wishes the story went a little beyond just having the cute catgirls do cute things.Characters:I want to get Kashou Minazuki out of the way first because this man barely does fucking anything.\xa0 Despite being the player character that every girl in the series supposedly fawns over, he not only gets barely any screentime, but also has no real purpose in the plot aside from being the establishing point since his confections shop is one of the key settings in the series.\xa0 Like I get it, he\'s a blank slate to project onto, but come on, put a little effort into making him something other than a plank of wood that occasionally does something.But of course the main stars of the series are the six catgirls: Chocola, Vanilla, Cinnamon, Maple, Azuki, and Coconut.\xa0 Based on six different breeds of cat, each of these six girls bear a different archetype which range from the Kuudere, to the dumb one, to the incredibly horny one.\xa0 Despite the show putting as much effort as it could to develop and show off each one, each of the six girls feel incredibly one-note, which serves well to make each one recognizable and add more to the \'cute girls doing cute things\' storytelling, but little else beyond that.\xa0 Each girl only has a small handful of different things or character moments that they\'re capable of doing, which ultimately makes them really static characters if not barely impactful beyond the initial splash.\xa0 Sure it\'s kind of fun to see what Azuki and Coconut are fighting over this time, but I can only see Cinnamon getting horny over something random so many times before it gets stale.Minazuki Shigure serves as the second master to the catgirls as well as Kashou\'s younger sister of unknown age.\xa0 (Yes, it\'s canon that she doesn\'t have a confirmed age.)\xa0 Despite having something of an established brother complex, the show really makes it seem like this is\xa0her cat harem, which in my headcanon is both amusing and terrifying.\xa0 A lot of the show features Shigure instead of her brother in coincidence with the catgirls, which really only exemplify how much she loves (and creeps on) the catgirls that live with her since that\'s the primary character trait that\'s being showed off.\xa0 It\'s definitely an...interesting character trait, but that\'s about all the show really has for her.Finally is Cacao, the an anime exclusive character who is a kitten that serves as the seventh catgirl of the family.\xa0 And she doesn\'t really do anything.\xa0 She\'s silent for a great majority of the series, making her appearances more like a puzzle for the other girls to figure out.\xa0 Which makes her a character of little consequence.\xa0 Beyond the first three episodes which establish her as a new part of the family, Cacao is mostly just...there, participating only occasionally in the series and serving as a mouthpiece for things in the Nekopara universe to get explained to since she doesn\'t really know anything about being a \'catgirl\' as weird as that sounds.\xa0 And aside from liking dried fish and generally wants to participate in things with the other girls, there\'s not much else to say about her.Aesthetics:Felix Film being responsible for animating the kickstarted Nekopara OVA that got mixed reception coming back to do a full cour adaptation is definitely not something I expected but hey, at least this time it looks pretty good, right?The art of Nekopara 2020 is one of the things I praise about the show because it\'s surprisingly good.\xa0 The characters look pretty good even when compared to the L2D/VN counterparts, and the consistency of the art genuinely surprised me because I did not expect this show to have actually good art.\xa0 This alongside with the light color scheme and the detailed frilliness of the girls\' various outfits and uniforms really had me take a step back and actually think, ""Wow this looks pretty good.""\xa0 Admittedly seeing basically human women/girls on all fours hissing at each other like cats or curling their hands like paws to make a \'nyan\' pose definitely made me feel a little uneasy because people don\'t normally do that, even to be cute, but hey, it makes sense for the context of the show.And to keep up with the theming, both the OP and ED of the anime keep up the cute exterior this series has by having the seiyuus of the girls sing them with happy, bubbly instrumentals going on in the background.\xa0 ""Shiny Happy Days"" being the OP is sung by all six of the girls alternating with an upbeat, bubbly tone, whereas the ED, ""Hidamari no Kaori"", is sung only by Chocola and Vanilla\'s voice actors in a slower ballad reminiscent of falling asleep since the two girls do sleep in the same bed.My one qualm with the sound however is actually the voice actors.\xa0 Compared to the kickstarted OVA, the entire cast of Nekopara 2020 is voiced by different people.\xa0 Although I don\'t know the reason why Nekopara got an \'anime adaptation\' after the OVA\'s reception, I\'d imagine the best way to make one would be to use the original voice cast, so I\'m a little confused why this isn\'t the case.Final Thoughts:Considering the source material for this show involves a series of visual novels that have a dedicated slider in the settings to adjust how much boob bounce the girls have whenever their L2D models are moving on-screen, I was not expecting this show to be serious or outstanding in the slightest, and was prepared for whatever ridiculousness was going to come my way.\xa0 I did not expect this show to be as boring as it was.\xa0 I even got tired of watching Cinnamon, my favorite of the six cats, because almost all of her scenes just ended up with her becoming horny without anything else of note.Because everything was side stories, it felt like the show was more like a slideshow that was showing off the girls rather than being any kind of faithful adaptation to the source material.\xa0 (Which I guess is what they tried to do with the OVA, and failed.)\xa0 The \'cute girls doing cute things\' subgenre of slice of life is so oversaturated with so many different shows that almost nothing about this show stood out aside from the notoriety that the name \'Nekopara\' has curried over years within the anime community.\xa0 Sure the girls were cute, yes there was a plot during each episode, and Cacao did spice things up a bit by being a completely new character with potential, but all of that is meaningless when the show is nothing but an endless cycle of \'cute\'.I\'m sure there\'re many people who enjoy this kind of mindless cuteness, but for me, it never felt like the cuteness had a purpose.\xa0 It was the default tone and mode that this series had and that alone made watching it feel like a slog then a brand of cute that had some substance behind it.\xa0 Had the show given us some more substantial story arcs aside from just doing side story after side story, then maybe things could\'ve been different.\xa0 But as it stands, the show is so mindless in being this cute cat creation that I find it hard pressed to define it as anything aside from that.\xa0 Admittedly it does that well, but the show has nothing else going for it.As such, my recommendation really goes out for fans of the series, especially those who\'re REALLY hardcore fans since this is the group that I think would get a kick out of this adaptation the most.\xa0 For the casual viewer, there\'s not really anything I can see is worth the time since the brand of \'catgirls\' being the show\'s main characters are about the only thing that gives the show any sense of unique qualities.\xa0 Without that, the anime ends up feeling like a cute girls doing cute things show, and I think we\'ve gotten to a point where we have more than enough of those in the world. take shifts at the pastry shop.\xa0 And thus (I guess) starts another chapter of their lives.Aside from the first three episodes which establish a completely new character to the Nekopara series, the anime comprises of only one-off stories that put one or two of the catgirls (who\'re conveniently put together in pairs) in some kind of situation

fawns over, he not only gets barely any screentime, but also has no real purpose in the plot aside from being the establishing point since his confections shop is one of the key settings in the series.\xa0 Like I get it, he\'s a blank slate to project onto, but come on, put a little effort into making him something other than a plank of wood that occasionally does something.But of course the main stars of the series are the six catgirls: Chocola, Vanilla, Cinnamon, Maple, Azuki, and Coconut.\xa0 Based on six different breeds of cat, each of these six girls bear a different archetype which range from the Kuudere, to the dumb one, to the incredibly horny one.\xa0 Despite the show putting as much effort as it could to develop and show off each one, each of the six girls feel incredibly one-note, which serves well to make each one recognizable and add more to the \'cute girls doing cute things\' storytelling, but little else beyond that.\xa0 Each girl only has a small handful of different things or character moments that they\'re capable of doing, which ultimately makes them really static characters if not barely impactful beyond the initial splash.\xa0 Sure it\'s kind of fun to see what Azuki and Coconut are fighting over this time, but I can only see Cinnamon getting horny over something random so many times before it gets stale.Minazuki Shigure serves as the second master to the catgirls as well as Kashou\'s younger sister of unknown age.\xa0 (Yes, it\'s canon that she doesn\'t have a confirmed age.)\xa0 Despite having something of an established brother complex, the show really makes it seem like this is\xa0her cat harem, which in my headcanon is both amusing and terrifying.\xa0 A lot of the show features Shigure instead of her brother in coincidence with the catgirls, which really only exemplify how much she loves (and creeps on) the catgirls that live with her since that\'s the primary character trait that\'s being showed off.\xa0 It\'s definitely an...interesting character trait, but that\'s about all the show really has for her.Finally is Cacao, the an anime exclusive character who is a kitten that serves as the seventh catgirl of the family.\xa0 And she doesn\'t really do anything.\xa0 She\'s silent for a great majority of the series, making her appearances more like a puzzle for the other girls to figure out.\xa0 Which makes her a character of little consequence.\xa0 Beyond the first three episodes which establish her as a new part of the family, Cacao is mostly just...there, participating only occasionally in the series and serving as a mouthpiece for things in the Nekopara universe to get explained to since she doesn\'t really know anything about being a \'catgirl\' as weird as that sounds.\xa0 And aside from liking dried fish and generally wants to participate in things with the other girls, there\'s not much else to say about her.Aesthetics:Felix Film being responsible for animating the kickstarted Nekopara OVA that got mixed reception coming back to do a full cour adaptation is definitely not something I expected but hey, at least this time it looks pretty good, right?The art of Nekopara 2020 is one of the things I praise about the show because it\'s surprisingly good.\xa0 The characters look pretty good even when compared to the L2D/VN counterparts, and the consistency of the art genuinely surprised me because I did not expect this show to have actually good art.\xa0 This alongside with the light color scheme and the detailed frilliness of the girls\' various outfits and uniforms really had me take a step back and actually think, ""Wow this looks pretty good.""\xa0 Admittedly seeing basically human women/girls on all fours hissing at each other like cats or curling their hands like paws to make a \'nyan\' pose definitely made me feel a little uneasy because people don\'t normally do that, even to be cute, but hey, it makes sense for the context of the show.And to keep up with the theming, both the OP and ED of the anime keep up the cute exterior this series has by having the seiyuus of the girls sing them with happy, bubbly instrumentals going on in the background.\xa0 ""Shiny Happy Days"" being the OP is sung by all six of the girls alternating with an upbeat, bubbly tone, whereas the ED, ""Hidamari no Kaori"", is sung only by Chocola and Vanilla\'s voice actors in a slower ballad reminiscent of falling asleep since the two girls do sleep in the same bed.My one qualm with the sound however is actually the voice actors.\xa0 Compared to the kickstarted OVA, the entire cast of Nekopara 2020 is voiced by different people.\xa0 Although I don\'t know the reason why Nekopara got an \'anime adaptation\' after the OVA\'s reception, I\'d imagine the best way to make one would be to use the original voice cast, so I\'m a little confused why this isn\'t the case.Final Thoughts:Considering the source material for this show involves a series of visual novels that have a dedicated slider in the settings to adjust how much boob bounce the girls have whenever their L2D models are moving on-screen, I was not expecting this show to be serious or outstanding in the slightest, and was prepared for whatever ridiculousness was going to come my way.\xa0 I did not expect this show to be as boring as it was.\xa0 I even got tired of watching Cinnamon, my favorite of the six cats, because almost all of her scenes just ended up with her becoming horny without anything else of note.Because everything was side stories, it felt like the show was more like a slideshow that was showing off the girls rather than being any kind of faithful adaptation to the source material.\xa0 (Which I guess is what they tried to do with the OVA, and failed.)\xa0 The \'cute girls doing cute things\' subgenre of slice of life is so oversaturated with so many different shows that almost nothing about this show stood out aside from the notoriety that the name \'Nekopara\' has curried over years within the anime community.\xa0 Sure the girls were cute, yes there was a plot during each episode, and Cacao did spice things up a bit by being a completely new character with potential, but all of that is meaningless when the show is nothing but an endless cycle of \'cute\'.I\'m sure there\'re many people who enjoy this kind of mindless cuteness, but for me, it never felt like the cuteness had a purpose.\xa0 It was the default tone and mode that this series had and that alone made watching it feel like a slog then a brand of cute that had some substance behind it.\xa0 Had the show given us some more substantial story arcs aside from just doing side story after side story, then maybe things could\'ve been different.\xa0 But as it stands, the show is so mindless in being this cute cat creation that I find it hard pressed to define it as anything aside from that.\xa0 Admittedly it does that well, but the show has nothing else going for it.As such, my recommendation really goes out for fans of the series, especially those who\'re REALLY hardcore fans since this is the group that I think would get a kick out of this adaptation the most.\xa0 For the casual viewer, there\'s not really anything I can see is worth the time since the brand of \'catgirls\' being the show\'s main characters are about the only thing that gives the show any sense of unique qualities.\xa0 Without that, the anime ends up feeling like a cute girls doing cute things show, and I think we\'ve gotten to a point where we have more than enough of those in the world.', ""“It's not my responsibility to be beautiful. I'm not alive for that purpose. My existence is not about how desirable you find me.” – Warsan Shire, and also nobody in NekoparaEvery few years, we get an anime that is truly a masterpiece: a work that excels in every area to create something that not only entertains greatly, but explores themes so deep that they leave a lasting impression on those who watched them and on the way that anime and the world moves forward in the future. These anime are indeed rare – we are lucky to get one in a year, but by some...miracle, we managed to get two such anime in a single season. It’s hard to imagine a better way to begin the decade than with these two series. One of these is, of course, Interspecies Reviewers, and the other is the anime that we will be talking about today: Nekopara.Many great stories focus on dystopias: from worlds that are blatantly dystopian such as Orwell’s 1984, to ones that are more morally grey, and could even be perceived by some as utopian, like Psycho-Pass. What’s so special about Nekopara is how it manages to be both of these simultaneously, giving it a lot to say about the implications of our own desires as well as the fact that we live in a society, and the direction that that society might be headed in.The first deceptively genius thing about Nekopara is its name, a combination of “neko” (the Japanese word for “cat”), and “para”, the start of the word “paradise”. Or, at least, that’s what the name seems to be, but there’s more to this series than meets the eye. There are many other words that begin with “para”: “paranoia”, “parabola”, “paraphilia”, “paradox”, etc. Which one of these words “para” represents is hotly debated amongst scholars (my money’s on “paraphilia”), but it sure as hell ain’t “paradise”… at least not for everyone involved. Sure, it may be appear to be a paradise at first glance: who wouldn’t want to be surrounded by a bunch of really cute and attractive cat girls who cater to your every need? But this perspective doesn’t consider life for said cat girls.Now, a more conventional dystopian horror would probably present the oppressed class as struggling and visibly tormented by their unjust position as slaves and sentient pets within this society, but instead we are shown something far, far more terrifying: they are totally complicit in and content with their oppression (apart from one character, who’s tail is truly the most haunting of all, but we’ll get to her later). The world of Nekopara has managed to successfully convince the cat girls that they don’t deserve basic human rights: that they are less than human, that they are better off living to serve their masters, that they must never go outside without their master unless they wear their bells. And they never once question these ideas. Nekopara isn’t just about how society oppresses us, but also how we allow it to continue to do so, and that is something truly bone-chilling.But it’s more than merely our complacency in our own oppression that’s being challenged by Nekopara, but also the fact that we may actually be idolising this sort of oppression when put upon others for our own benefit. After all, the series masquerades as a paradise for the viewer to self-insert themselves into, enjoying owning a bunch of cat girl pet slave waifu things, whose sole existence is to serve and please them. This series makes the viewer think: “Would I have been in favour of the subjugation of women and people of colour if I was born a century or two earlier? Am I in favour of the ways in which minority groups remain oppressed today?”.While cat girls serve as a useful metaphor for many oppressed minorities, such as people of colour, the LGBTQ+ community, or weeaboos, they are also of literal significance. If our society has the same view of cat girls that Nekopara does, then we may ourselves become such a society once Elon Musk has successfully created genetically engineered cat girls. In fact, how excited people are for the scientific research being conducted into the field of genetically engineered cat girls is quite concerning: what will be their fate?Our society could easily become the dystopia presented to us in Nekopara. We may look back on this anime much like how we look back on Serial Experiments Lain today: more relevant many years into the future than when it came out. Indeed, Nekopara is a truly visionary work, and the scariest part is that we won’t even realise that we’re in a dystopia – most of the population will think that this is just the natural order of things, ignorant to anything other than the status quo.“But what about the based, woke and red-pilled individuals who see the true horror of their society?” I hear you ask. “Surely they’ll be able to save everyone from this hellhole, right?”. I wish that were the case, but the most terrifying thing of all about Nekopara is the way in which it shoots this sentiment down multiple times throughout its story through the use of the character Cacao, the only character we see in the series who doesn’t see the oppression of cat girls as a good thing.Perhaps the most important thing about Cacao is how difficult it is for her to speak: this represents how society denies those who go against it of a voice: you can’t spread your ideas or influence change; you will just be silenced. But it’s not just that she can’t communicate properly: she can’t escape either. At the start of the series, she is a stray cat, this being her attempt at self-actualisation: to become something other than a lesser being who lives solely to serve her master. But she is found by Chocola and taken in by this horrifying system. Each time she tries to escape, which the other characters interpret as her merely “getting lost” (because who could possibly want a life other than to fulfil their natural role within the hierarchy?), she is found once again. The message of the series is clear: there is no escape from society. No matter what we do, we live in a society. And what could possibly be more of a depressing realisation than that?Story: 10 – The genius thing about the story of Nekopara is just how naturally it integrates these oppressive structures into its world-building. Layered with metaphor and meaning in every shot and every line of dialogue, this is truly one of the most masterfully crafted stories in the history of not just anime, not just television, but in all of storytelling throughout all of time.Character: 10 – The characters of Nekopara are some of the most hauntingly realistic characters in anime. The way each of them has developed their own unique psychological coping mechanisms to delude them into being content with their unjust society is handled in a way that seems to have been brought about by the propaganda that the society has fed them. We see this process gradually happening to Cacao, one of the most tragic and sympathetic characters I’ve ever seen, as she loses her independence to become yet another slave to her “goshujin-sama”.Art/Animation: 10 – Nekopara’s visuals expertly convey the fetishization of the cat girls, which is a significant part of what leads to their dehumanization. The way it presents them as being incredibly cute both serves to help us see what the humans of the society see of them, as well as giving us increased sympathy to their plights, even as they themselves remain unaware of them.Sound: 10 – The voice acting complements the character designs of the cat girls in adding to their fetishization, while also being far enough from anything you would hear in real life that it feels like something’s… wrong here. This is an important part of leading the viewer to the conclusion that society isn’t supposed to be this way. The background music that plays mostly consists of the same track playing over and over again as it becomes increasingly grating, fitting the mood of the series perfectly. The track might seem nice at first, but it quickly becomes something that sounds far more sinister and unpleasant.Enjoyment: 10 – I was hooked. Each week, I was so excited to watch the next episode and find out which elements of the world and character psychology would be explored next, and it’s been a long time since an anime has made me think this deeply or filled me with this much existential dread.In conclusion, Nekopara is one of the greatest pieces of cautionary fiction that has ever been conceived. It may not be for everyone, as it may cause you to slump into a two-week-long depression, and it certainly isn’t an easy watch, but if you want to experience some of the greatest political and philosophical epiphanies of your life, then Nekopara is absolutely a must watch. miracle, we managed to get two such anime in a single season.

At first I was enthusiastic because is not usual to see an eroge getting an animated adaptation for TV , we all know that is exclusively reserved for outstanding series (Grisaia no Kajitsu, Yosuga no Sora, Fate/Stay Night, etc.) and the nekos utterly deserved it. Everything sounds good up to this point.Regardless of the massive change of voice actors and the evident removal of any sexual topics (except for Cinnamon\'s delusions), I was expecting a fun-loving show with a good deal of moe and it\'s fair...share of romantic-comedy. It was meant to be Kashou working hard in order to fulfill his dreams with the catgirls ready to learn, mature and enjoy their lives alongside him and his little sister just like what we saw in the game. Unfortunately, what I received turned out to be quite different from what I was expecting.It was not just the hentai, but also the romance was taken out of the setting. I understand that Felix Films does this to focus on the comedy and the slice-of-life since the anime features a different plot from the volumes, but without romantic scenes the adaptation loses a crucial part of what it was originally meant to recreate, the Nekopara we all know and adore. That was the moment I felt I was watching the wrong show.Although I already felt disappointed on the anime at some extent, I still liked the debut of the new character. Cacao was the best gift this anime could have ever given to us, apart from the OP and the ED. I am the first to plead guilty of falling for her cuteness and innocence and I dare to state that there is no one who disliked the anime because of her. Cacao is a cutie pie truth be told, and that is precisely why I cannot help but feel sad about her just as soon as I remember that her happy tales will end with the last episode of the TV show. After that we will only hope to see her in artworks and merchandising stuff given the fact that she is a character created specially for the anime, unless they do with her the same that DC did with Harley Quinn and turn her into a canon character. And I pray that never happens for obvious reasons (her purity must remain untouched at all cost!).At this rate I thought that was it for me, but I encouraged myself to put all these issues aside so I can enjoy the anime as the regular kawaii show it was trying to be but whitout putting effort into it, I begun to find other unfavorable aspects of which I absolutely cannot find a reasonable explanation no matter how many times I think of them. Kashou gradually loses any participation and barely appears in scene in spite of being ""the protagonist"" and the one responsible of the patisserie. Regarding this last observation, Cinnamon and Vanilla are overly obsessed with Maple and Chocola (even more than how they are in the games) but Chocola and Shigure are not that keen on Kashou, ripping two main elements of their most important motivation, the very same one that made them set the beginning of the story. And to top it all of... apart from Kashou, it is absolutely rare to see other men or even boys in scene. Can someone please explain me what is the logic of this? What is this? Infinite Stratos? It doesn\'t make sense, not in the least.The manga was the first failure of the series being cancelled after just one volume. This, the anime adaptation and the upcoming mobile game proves that NEKO WORKs is starting to abuse of its popularity and that cannot be anything but bad news. As a fan it is not easy for me to say this, but considering all of the above, it is fair to say that they should have focused on the PC games instead.I am the kind of person who never drops an anime once it has started watching it, and that goes doubly for an adaptation of a series I have been following from long ago. I will watch this show until the very end, but if I have to be honest, I doubt I will change my mind about mentioning that this anime is not worth one\'s while.Love Nekopara, not so much the anime.

All what is left to do now is wait for Vol. 4.', ""This is a fun, cute little anime that's enjoyable with, or without playing the VNs. Don't go into it expecting any sort of deep story since that isn't what it's going for anyway. Comedy and cuteness are its strongest offerings and it does them well. They also did well at keeping the spirit of the VNs while separating them so the anime is kind of its own little story instead of just trying to blatantly copy the source material, which doesn't always work out for titles based on VNs.In short, if you're interested in an anime that's just there to be some lighthearted fun, give...this one a try. this one a try."", 'Recommendation: Skip it unless you really like catgirls.Positives:+ Delivers exactly what it advertises. Each episode is 20 minutes of catgirls being cute and absolutely nothing else.  And let\'s be honest, that\'s the reason you\'re going to watch this.  So even though it\'s not a ""good"" show, you\'ll probably like it if you know exactly what to expect from it.+ Can be funny when it leans into the idea of them literally being cats, like Vanilla kneading on Chocola\'s stomach to wake her up, or them being unable to resist the urge to sit in a random box that\'s been left out.Negatives:- The catgirls...are too childlike or infantilized for the amount of fanservice and sexualization.  The gratuitous ass shots and boob jiggling come off as a bit creepy when they\'re mostly treated like children and are barely allowed to leave the house without an adult.  It feels like it couldn\'t decide whether to be a cute show about little girls or a horny show about sexy catgirls, and it split the difference in a way that ended up being kind of uncomfortable.- The human characters suck.  Shigure is a weird and cringeworthy pervert, and to say that Kashou is boring would be to wrongly imply that his presence or absence is felt in any way.  He is a complete nothing character, and the show would literally be no different if he were replaced by a cardboard cutout of Kashou propped against the wall in the background of a handful of scenes.- Catgirls never really evolve beyond their established archetype.  You get a tiny bit of it with Chocola trying to become a big sister/mom to Cacao and an episode where Maple pursues her dream as a singer, but that really only serves to highlight how static all the other characters are, and makes it disappointing when they just reset to their usual selves at the start of the next episode.- Gross, off-putting and unnecessary piss jokes are far too frequent.- Can occasionally fall into being the bad kind of slice of life where it\'s just boring instead of feeling like a fun hangout with characters you love. are too childlike or infantilized for the amount of fanservice and sexualization.

You get a tiny bit of it with Chocola trying to become a big sister/mom to Cacao and an episode where Maple pursues her dream as a singer, but that really only serves to highlight how static all the other characters are, and makes it disappointing when they just reset to their usual selves at the start of the next episode.- Gross, off-putting and unnecessary piss jokes are far too frequent.- Can occasionally fall into being the bad kind of slice of life where it\'s just boring instead of feeling like a fun hangout with characters you love.', ""For those who don't know, the show is based off of an erotic visual novel. For those who know, don't expect similar content as in the visual novels. Most of the development in visual novels is cut from the anime adaptation – story progress, character development, romance (and no sexual content either; just occasional pervy jokes from Cinnamon). Expect just a simple slice of life comedy with a lot of cuteness and catgirls we already know from the novels.With the introduction of an anime original catgirl (Cacao), the show got at least some original content. First 3-4 episodes are focused on this new catgirl and...how she is getting used to living with other catgirls along with Kashou and Shigure.Then the show takes its slice of life episodic pattern, which is a bit of a shame. Because of this, the show lost its momentum and became more plain with no direction or aim. Just random shenanigans and cute moments with the catgirls; though, occasionally has some references to some key story parts of the novel.With the lack of story progress, characters also develop only a little bit. All characters have their basic traits like in the novel (like Azuki & Coconut always fighting), but without further depth to the characters (like Azuki & Coconut coping with each other and the reasoning behind it).The show is a decent introduction to the whole franchise, however, for the best experience, visual novel is highly superior.

The café with a lot of cute catgirls, a true cat paradise!Hi!I\'m pretty sure you came here for a ""Oh, the animation was..."", ""Oh, the characters are..."" type of review.But nope!I\'m sorry to break it to you.Instead, I\'ll be telling you a short story on why I love this franchise so much and how it helped me feel better during some dark times.If you want my opinion on the animation/plot/sound etc., go to the bottom bellow the hearts!Okay,when it comes to Nekopara, I have seen two kinds of opinions on twitter:1.) It\'s super cute!Adorable! I love it!2.)This is such a joke,...people are only in for it because of the NSFW game!I first played the game back two years ago as a horny teenager.First walkthrough, skipped all the dialogue so I could get to the steamy parts.Honestly, didn\'t think much of it back then.But, about a year later, I started playing for the sake of the story because I was in a very,very dark place back then.The stress I had at school, family problems, there was a lot and I was at one of the worst points in my life.I was desperate and binged a lot of different shows that included dark themes, making me feel even more depressed.One day I stumbled uppon nekopara once again on steam.The REALLY cute design catched my eye once more, and so I installed the game again and began reading.A few weeks later, I felt like a different person.I wasn\'t feeling as sad anymore because I knew I had cute catgirls waiting for me at home, no matter how bad my classmates treated me or how much my family yelled at me.I knew that once everyone was asleep,I\'ll be owning a café with catgirls that love me more than anything.And, after new years, when I saw the anime started airing, I started crying.Finally!And I watched it.Now, it finnished airing.This anime made me cry not because of the story, but the memories it awoke in me.No, you probably won\'t be loving it this much.Yes, its okay to judge and call it cringe.But, please let us people who loved this enjoy it! Thank you for your time ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡Story: 8/10-As far as the story goes, it\'s quite cutesy, girly and includes a lot of slice of life elements.The world with humanoid catgirls is truly fascinating and has a lot of detail to it.And the events that follow from first to last minute, are all very relaxing, funny and adorable!Moist!Art: 9/10I can not stress this enough!The fashion in this show is just GOALS.I wish I had a closet with such items, truly!Besides that, everything looks quite smooth and crisp.So soft, you wish you could poke Chocolas cheeks!And fluff Cinnamons hair!Sound: 7/10The opening is quite upbeat and happy, reminds me of candy pop or kawaii edm.A nice song to start the day with!The ending is more relaxing and I\'d say it\'s good to listen to at night, before sleep.I didn\'t pay much attention to the ost tho.Character: 8/10Even tho sometimes cringey, all the catgirls remind me of little kids.I love the idea of the cats being named after cake/icecream flavors A LOT! I even named my own 3 cats Chocola, Vanilla and Maple!Even tho they\'re not with us anymore.RIP to my favorite cats <3Anyway, Each character seems quite different from the other, each has their own opinions and tastes and I\'d say there is something for every viewer to find and love!You will definitely find a catgirl you like!Enjoyment: 7/10I\'d say this is a show to watch when you\'re a bit stressed maybe, when you wanna relax and see something overly girly and cute, and a show you could watch with your little cousins!I did at least~Overall: 10/10I can\'t thank the producers enough for turning this game into an anime.I enjoyed every second of it, despite the lower scores in previous categories.I hope you enjoy your stay at La Soleil, the catgirls are waiting for you!! ♡ people are only in for it because of the NSFW game!I first played the game back two years ago as a horny teenager.First walkthrough, skipped all the dialogue so I could get to the steamy parts.Honestly, didn\'t think much of it back then.But, about a year later, I started playing for the sake of the story because I was in a very,very dark place back then.The stress I had at school, family problems, there was a lot and I was at one of the worst points in my life.I was desperate and binged a lot of different shows that included dark themes, making me feel even more depressed.One day I stumbled uppon nekopara once again on steam.The REALLY cute design catched my eye once more, and so I installed the game again and began reading.A few weeks later, I felt like a different person.I wasn\'t feeling as sad anymore because I knew I had cute catgirls waiting for me at home, no matter how bad my classmates treated me or how much my family yelled at me.I knew that once everyone was asleep,I\'ll be owning a café with catgirls that love me more than anything.And, after new years, when I saw the anime started airing, I started crying.Finally!And I watched it.Now, it finnished airing.This anime made me cry not because of the story, but the memories it awoke in me.No, you probably won\'t be loving it this much.Yes, its okay to judge and call it cringe.But, please let us people who loved this enjoy it!

The story is a weaving web of radical twists and turns, the complete disregard for the fact that the six cat-GIRLS are literally just ""cats"", plus the genius character development creates a trifactor of unparalleled sources of anime entertainment that nothing else even comes close to possessing the power to dethrone this masterpiece. Death Note might as well write it\'s own name down after witnessing the narrative Dyson Sphere that is Nekopara.Definitely my only 11/10. And I\'ve watched K-on so I know what I\'m on about. So proceed forth and immerse yourself INSIDE this anime.....because this is...culture, this is life. culture, this is life.', 'I did not enjoy this anime because i am not a fan of nekos, i find them too much ""nya nya""the story is decent but not formidablei was not disapointed because i know i am biased by the fact they are nekosi think the anime can be better by the story and by the characters, letting the characters less ""nya nya"", less ""cute""As a conclusion, i will say that this anime is not woth a try if you do not like nekos because they are cliché. But, the graphics and the sound are very good, good environnements, and there is no sex in...this anime which is a good thingthanks for reading this anime which is a good thingthanks for reading', ""So it's over. A very disappointing adaptation.But Why? Why is this?How could Felix Firm ruin such an easy adaptation?Because the OP and ED were great, the character designs are mostly faithful, and the animation was great. However...1) They skipped 90% of the introduction, a.k.a. why catgirls exist, how they are adopted etc. This also includes how Chocola and Vanilla were adopted. If you read the vn then you knew that was a very heartbreaking scene, but the anime only viewers will never know about this.2) The main fucking character is barely relevant. Somehow Felix Firm managed to change nekopara from a harem to a yuri...show!3) Pacing was dreadful. Random anime original Keijo episode that should have been used to develop the cat girls. Cacao is not even in the vn - she is an anime only catgirl. She starts with no personality and ends with no personality, and she is a chore to watch due to this. Most of the cat girls are reduced to mere stereotypes - a problem due to mostly the points above.I won't complain about the 'spicy' stuff not put into this adaptation. But regardless I am still very disappointed with the adaptation. I guess it is a mediocre slice of life show? I don't even know as this show has no sense of direction or plot! And it makes me so frustrated! Regardless there are some enjoyable scenes and I love the vn, and that is why I did not drop this show.Alas, if I am being very generous then this show will get a 4. But if I put myself into a anime original viewer's shows, then a 3 would be more accurate. *sigh*oh well... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯rant over show!3) Pacing was dreadful.

Cats? No, CATGIRLS. How much fun, don´t you agree? But has this anime lived up at its expectation?When this was first announced, i was excited that i immediatly scored 10 before it aired because i love the series overall. But little did i know i would be very wrong. Before you start shooting rockets at me because i stand my 10 on this, hear me out.Its a 6 in reality. This series follows the main games story, if you can call it a story; but it didn´t felt...equal or better than the games, rather much worse.Story-6; Like i said, not much story here. Come on, its a +18 game, what kind of story do you expect here? All they do is just do anything different every episode as its own way. While i like the ideas they have, they are just not executed that welll.Art-7; Art is questionable at times. First episodes(3 to be exact) were terrible in terms of art; Chocola and Vanilla at times looked awful, specially the scene where they clap to Azuki(if i remember correctly). Coco and Azuki fighting on underwear also didn´t looked very well(ep.4) at all and yet they repeated that scene on the last episode of the series. More critism on coco because she looked awful; in last ep she well, looked odd at some frames. Overall, it is decent given the episodes 5-11 didn´t had any problem that i spot on. Heck, the OVA art is much better, thats a 9/10.Sound-9; No judging here, sound is very good, thats what felt best in the series.Character-5; This is the main point of dissapointment, the characters. I gotta say i was very dissapointed on how they behave. This series is supposed to follow the main games yet...why don´t they behave the same?Vanilla is the perfect one, the rest have too many problems. Chocola is WAY TOO clumsy; in the games im sure she wasn´t like that. She was clumsy but not in every scene where as in this anime, she is clumsy all the time in 4 EPISODES. 4! Do they hate her or something?Maple just doesn´t exist. She is just relevant in ep.9, the rest she does nothing which is sad because is one of the cats that stand out the most imo.Cinnamon is just...her being lewd. Thats it. That´s all what she does. I mean the games she was the same but not all the time; again, same problem as Chocola. But this time, they take it to extreme; every episode has a scene of her being lewd like they didn´t had any jokes or topics to bring.Coco is a mix of Chocola and Maple. Clumsy and Irrelevant. She also does nothing but being in a fight with Azuki or messing things around. She and Azuki were only revelant in ep 6 and thats it.Azuki, again doesn´t exist and she is supposed to be the influence of the bunch. Dissapointing too.Shigure...no. What happened to her love for Kashou? Thats the only complaint i have AND THATS WHAT SHE IS! This is a completely diffrent Shigure that i know of and only gets an episode to be relevant at which btw, was not her best. And Kashou? ...Who´s Kashou?Cacao who was supposed to be the main focus or should have been, is only relevant in the last couple of episodes(10-12). Expected much more from her; her cuteness is good but it doesn´t change the fact that she needed more focus. And no i won´t talk about Chiyo, she is just there.Enjoyment-7; It felt decent. While of the many flaws, the anime is supposed to be relaxing(in a way...)and fun and thats what it was at times. For people who never played the series, it must be very good for them but for someone who has knowledge, it only makes us think on how much they could have improved...Overall-6; For a Nekopara fan, this felt dissapointing. I thought it would be much better but instead we got a downgrade from the games. Not having the same voice actors was a bit of an issue aswell as the experience didn´t felt the same. If you are a Nekopara fan, you should consider before watching as it will be a bit of dissapointment for you. If you aren´t, enjoy nekos being clumsy and cute. Much cute.Why did i rated 10? I love the series and i know Nekoworks can do much better than this, i belive in them. This was only a step and lets hope Vol.4 has the potential that they can demonstrate. equal or better than the games, rather much worse.Story-6; Like i said, not much story here.

Nonetheless Nekopara has neko-moeness ALL ROUND.Nekopara\'s anime series follows Chocola voiced by Yuki Yagi and Vanilla voiced by Saeki Iori in their daily lives in La Soleil, a patisserie owned by Kashou Minazaki. Now slightly diverging from the game which starts as soon as the first...episode is that Chocola finds a stray young cat that latche sonto Chocola, unable to know what to do, Chocola secretly tries to hide this stray cat, but as this stray cat...let\'s call her Cacao, well Cacao pretty much becomes  aprt of the cast and we gets some development to her, with her opening her up to the rest of the cast as well as her joining in the rest of the core cast in their antics, mostly as a cheerleader for Chocola.Nekopara is a slice of life comedy to the T and LA is fine with that as the antics the core cats goes through is fairly good comedy especially with the character interactions of the cast at that. The slice of life aspect focuses on the cats as well as Cacao for the most part, the comedy revolves around the character interactions, all mostly moe and like LA said at the start of this review, this is pretty much Neko paradise bliss as far as LA is aware.Now since Nekopara is a character slice of life comedy centric anime, let\'s talk about the characters. Starting off, Kashou Minazuki is such a nothing character, being the owner of Vanilla and Chocola, but he\'s mostly in the background to make way with Shigure Minazuki, his little sister and the rest of the cats as the center focus. Oddly enough Chocola and Vanilla are mostly the narrative focus characters instead of the ""player character"" of Kashou in this anime\'s case. Vanilla is the stoic teaser and minder to the genki ditzy Chocola. Before Cacao opens up, Chocola mostly minds Cacao, but afterwards, Chocola is at the most her usual self anyways. Coconut voiced by Marin Mizutani is the clumsy but doesn\'t know her own strength and often butt heads the the tsundere Azuki voiced by Shiori Izawa. We also have Cinnamon voiced by Yuri Noguchi a ditzy but ecchi daydreamer whenever a sexual innuendo comes into play and Maple voiced by Miku Ito who\'s the most grounded of the cast and minds the rest of the cats. Lastly the aforementioned Shigure, Kashou\'s little sister and mostly keeps the cats in check though her absolutely loving cats is kinda running gag to her.The Neko\'s themselves do get screentime as well as their own (or coupled together) character development in one episode thus making us want to know them better, of course Chocola, Vanilla and Cacao gets majority of the screentime because of the Cacao plot point but the rest of core cast gets their own, like Coconut and Azuki having an all day competition with one another, Maple\'s singing career, Shigure\'s depressing day and finally digging into Cinnamon\'s ditzy fantasizing head. Minimum cast and all utilized which is all good.The animation done by Felix Film was actually done pretty well, from the moe yet polished character designs and it\'s decent backgrounding. Felix Films if anything did itself quite well for a ""slice of life comedy"" especially when it\'s to it\'s character designs and considering it\'s a character slice of life comedy, Felix Film knew where to pull in the effort to the animation in. All in all Felix Films did great in terms of character designs.The voice cast does have a few changes form the game, but nonetheless there were some good voice actors to point out, like Yuki Yagi as the genki Chocola, the stoic one liner of Saeki Iroi as Vanilla to the ditzy ecchi daydreamer of Cinnamon and Shiori Izawa as the tsundere Azuki and finally M.A.O as the competent but lovingly funny Shigure Minazuki, the weirdest thing is of Cacao\'s vice actor as her voice actor Yuuka Morishima doesn\'t really do much as Cacao besides some grunting and noises as Cacao, yes as Cacao opens up so does the amount of lines Yuuka gets but semantics. Nonetheless the voice cast were pretty great especially from Yuki Yagi as Chocola.But yes, as much as Nekopara is infamous for it\'s rather...*ahem*  explicit adult material of it\'s visual novel, the anime adaptation is a bleached underpants anime adaptation of the visual novel and given us a more slice of life comedy of Nekopara\'s source material and what with Cacao brought into the anime adaptation is somewhat proof of that and LA doesn\'t mind as LA REALLY didn\'t mind Nekopara\'s comedic slice of life hijinks one bit and more or less gave this anime series as a VERY GOOD breather anime in comparison to the animes in Winter 2020 (and no LA doesn\'t mean this in a bad way either). If Nekopara achieved anything, it\'s essentially the calming cat videos in Youtube bundled into anime form with all it\'s slice of life comedy elements to it and of course with what character developments given to the Neko\'s were also good as well.Coconuts is best Neko, don\'t at me! episode is that Chocola finds a stray young cat that latche sonto Chocola, unable to know what to do, Chocola secretly tries to hide this stray cat, but as this stray cat...let\'s call her Cacao, well Cacao pretty much becomes  aprt of the cast and we gets some development to her, with her opening her up to the rest of the cast as well as her joining in the rest of the core cast in their antics, mostly as a cheerleader for Chocola.Nekopara is a slice of life comedy to the T and LA is fine with that as the antics the core cats goes through is fairly good comedy especially with the character interactions of the cast at that.

So we find out a brother and sister took in a bunch of cats, and now use them as free labor in return for caring, clothing them, etc, a capitalist paradise....The cats are of course all attractive, at first bar Cacao unless you're a loli/pedo lover.    In the game, Kashou sleeps with all the cats but there is no sign of this ever happening in this series as all he cares about is baking and the business.   his sister has a bigger cat fetish it seems and enjoys dressing them up, doing health checks, stripping them down to underwear to measure them, etc, some of the few ecchi moments of the series.As the show goes on despite how well the show is made, the story, character development, conversation, are all lacking.    The girls seemed to have formed of in their pairs already and more likely to go lesbian than after Kashou and Shigure would probably be up for it, if not outfought by her brother fetish.Sadly the season tried to put too many things together and failed badly, Neko fans will still love it as catgirls, but sadly i have read better things as a teacher by teenagers.

Wish there was more character development overall but I enjoyed the show. Wish they also gave more screen time to the la patisserie dude cuz I thought he was the main character (which he is) but gets less screen time later on. Overall I wouldn’t put this in the romance but in the slide of life and comedy section. It’s a great distraction from the real world and the music absolutely slaps. Hoping for a second season or an ova. I didn’t kno they were from a game but I...would rather watch this than play the game.

Some characters can sometimes be annoying but I guess thats just my opinion. The voice acting is kind of weird in some places too and lacks enthusiasm. Other than that, like I said, if you dont take this show very serious and watch it  with a ""Hey it has catgirls doing funny stuff that...doesnt always make sense but its cute and funny because its an anime about catgirls"" kind of mindset it can be fun and you could give it a 7. I watched it with some aspects of this mindset but in the end there are some flaws if you look at it like a real anime and I couldnt give it a 7 because of the earlier mentioned flaws and it also seemed kind of unfair to all the other anime I rated 7 ^^ doesnt always make sense but its cute and funny because its an anime about catgirls"" kind of mindset it can be fun and you could give it a 7.

That\'s all there really is to it. It doesn\'t have much of a ""plot,"" because that isn\'t what its going for, but the individual episodes don\'t have enough substance in them to really warrant watching them. I probably would have rated this show a 6 if it weren\'t for the fact that I was completely bored of it by episode 4. Only reason I really finished it was because me and some friends watched it (and the movie and OVA) as a joke. A boring, 4 hour long joke. The humor in this show is pretty bland, mostly just boiling...down to cat puns and ""this character is quirky and does X,"" over and over again. The other main appeal is the cute/wholesome aspect of it, which it doesn\'t really deliver on. Despite raising $1,000,000, this show looks cheaply made. That kind of hampers its ability to look ""cute,"" doesn\'t it. Other than that there isn\'t really much else of importance.

The normal thing to do is to stop watching anything about the anime, because you don\'t expect to see this type of genre being adapted, especially through TV. However, I need to inform you that Nekopara is a preview of what the game\'s story would be, without the explicit scenes and with a hint of suggestive moments. Does that make anime good? NOT!! And we need to talk about it.Nekopara tells a very simple story: Kashou owns a bakery, called La Soleil. The confectionery has...cats as employees, divided into three pairs, where the “maid café” style predominates. Her sister, Shigure, is the one who gives housing and comfort to most of the cats who work there. The synopsis, by itself, already indicates that the anime will not be much different from the moe pattern, where the characters do anything in a cute and pleasant way. However, I see a serious problem in Nekopara. Anime doesn\'t like its story, let alone what the characters do or don\'t do. Mostly, the show ends up problematizing one or two characters, it develops an expected outcome and the cycle repeats itself constantly. Beforehand, I must remember that the anime tried to be decent. I admit, I liked its beginning. It wasn\'t a story that I would remember in the future, but at least I was interested in how the anime managed to ""hide"" part of Visual Novel and how it made me like the silly things. With each episode that the characters got into a problem, I had fun with how nice and nice he was being.But, not everything is flowers ... the show starts to tire with the passing of the episodes and it jumps from adorable, to repetitive and boring. This is common in moe anime, but Nekopara has evolved up a notch. An example that I could mention is “Anima Yell!”, An anime that, although it has the same moe pattern, it tries to be something more, using sport as a tool to encourage viewers. “Senko-san” is another example of a moe that worked, conveying an idea of \u200b\u200bSenko being an always pleasant caring character. Both animes tried and managed to do very well. Nekopara stopped trying and did not stop being tiring from the second half. The funny adventures of Cacao getting lost in the city streets supported the anime, in my opinion. When that stopped happening, I believe that the script did not know how to continue positively. It was a more boring moment than another. They still had legal elements, but the essence was left out.If only that were the negative side of the show, I would still like the anime, but my biggest problem is with a specific character and what she represents in the anime: Cinnamon. For those who have already forgotten, Cinnamon is the cat with blue hair, being Maple\'s double, in the confectionery. She has the closest proximity to the adult theme of the game. During the show, Cinnamon has moments when she is constantly used as a sexual stereotype of pleasure and perversion. And that happens in practically every episode, where some random moment generates excitement in the character. That factor was enough to bother me a lot, because the character only existed to remind the audience of the fact that the anime comes from an adult game.The problem is further intensified when we realize that Cinnamon did not stand out for itself, which happened with all the other characters. Vanilla and Chocola are the main group of characters, Cacao is the protagonist of the beginning of the show, Azuki and Coconut solve their problems as sisters and Maple has a desire to become a singer. All of them feature episodes entirely dedicated to them, but Cinnamon has NO HIGHLIGHTS. I wouldn\'t mind that if the anime were to develop it in a different way, but since everything that reminds me of it is related to her excitement, I can\'t take the character seriously.Finally, Nekopara is an anime that tried to be something and ended up being absolutely nothing. I admire the attempt by the Felix Film Studio to put on such a delicate show (in the sense of adapting such a controversial game), but you can\'t deny your problems. Furthermore, the production did not help to please the public, precisely because of the factors mentioned above.

I will not accept that any of the others are overall better than her.Many know but if you do not the original source material for this is more adult based along with the visual novel games exists a manga that shows that off almost immediately. That makes the story for this amazing and that is because how that turns into this slice of life comedy that is just so great to watch.Cacao the kitten should be noted to be an anime-only character.The art of the show is superb. It is consistent and detailed....The ears of the girls move with emotion and the tails do what they should. The designs of the girls are really well done and everything in the entire picture you see is really well done.The OP is really fun and great to listen to each time. The ED is a perfect fit especially for the photobook it accompanies. I absolutely love Coconut as a kitten.In this, we have our main cast which outside of the cats, Shigure and Kashou we have Chiyo a young girl that is a close friend of Cacao.From the original OVA we still have the same girls in the overall aspect.For the most part, the cats are in pairs.Chocola and Vanilla a pairing of kittens as sisters who are inseparable. Chocolate is clumsy but also kind and Vanilla is much more reserved in personality unless it is to do with Chocola.Cacao the kitten in the series an absolutely adorable character that Chocola brings in. She is a character that really changes throughout the show leading episode 11 where we get an absolutely heartfelt moment. She is super cute without the hat on also it should be noted.Chiyo is the girl that befriends Cacao and they become very close.Maple and Cinnamon. Maple is a tsundere cat that has dreams that are shown within the show. She is a pretty nice character with her elegance around tea and such. Cinnamon is generally a pervert is really the best way to describe her. She is pretty damn funny.Azuki and Coconut. Azuki is the oldest of the cats in the family and is also the shortest of the adult cats. Her build is also the most modest of them all and she wears a really cute outfit. She is pretty stubborn but cares immensely for those around her. Coconut is when a kitten someone that looked up to Azuki a lot and is extremely cute when you see the pictures and flashbacks of a kitten. Now grown up she is a bit of a gal cat it should be said. She is great and pretty funny. Coconut and Azuki often get in fights which are hilarious.Kashou and Shigure are brother and sister. Shigure is completely obsessed with cats and her brother, she is a complete bro-con. Kashou never accepts his sister's advances and focuses on his dream job. Kashou lives with Cacao, Chocola, and Vanilla. The rest live with Shigure but they all work in MAID OUTFITS at the shop Kashou owns.The show is so enjoyable. Cute girls doing cute things but as catgirls is effectively the show. It gives you smiles and tears of joy depending on which part you are on.Ultimately the show has done an absolutely superb job and is something I would happily have as many seasons as it takes to finish off.

Not bad Nekopara, Not bad at all.', ""The original Nekopara is an adult visual novel where you watch catgirls get lewded through the perspective of a self insert male. TV Nekopara is not only absent of all explicit  content but has tame fanservice even for non-nude ecchi standards, unfortunate news for the hardcore degenerates out there.But if you’re going to strip a visual novel of all adult content, you better sell the character personalities and make their relationships feel genuine enough for viewers to connect to them on an emotional level. TV Nekopara at least manages to do that well by making them appear as close knit as a true family....As such this can be watched for reasons outside of fanservice, as surprising as that may sound.Those familiar with the VN will immediately recognize the quirks of the catgirls (and if not don’t fret - you quickly pick up on this anyway). Chocola is every bit the adorable airhead who tries her best at everything, no matter how many mistakes are made in the process. Vanilla is the same detached genius of infinite wisdom. Azuki is a fearless munchkin with an Napoleon complex towards the more mature looking Coconut. Cinnamon is a maximum pervert that badly wants to bang Maple, who pretends as if the feeling isn’t mutual. The story does well to introduce circumstances that allows them to show off their charm and individuality. A few of such include the power going out and the catgirls needing to entertain themselves by inventing ghost stories, competing in a sports festival, keijo styled butt battles and helping a stray cat feel at home. One of these is not like the other. But its relevant to the plot, I swear.The lone new addition is a cute baby neko who is slowly ingratiated into her new environment. It can be rewarding watching her progression throughout the story that is expedited by the love given to her by her surrounding family. Through her the compassion of the other catgirls is displayed as they sacrifice their own needs for the sake of making the child feel at comfort. Sweet enough to give you the feels. She doesn't really get lewded either so no worries on that front if you're concerned about crossing some invisible moral line.As I mentioned before, the fanservice is very much so on the tame side. This works to make Nekopara fairly accessible for those into SOL shenanigans. But that isn’t to say there is NO fanservice whatsoever, as you do have a number of scenes that are clearly designed to appeal to the lewd catgirl enthusiasts. For instance, Cinnamon has a running gag where she squirts herself in ecstasy over some erotic vision. You can never confirm this visually, nor does she ever explicitly say that she's cumming, but the implication is there to allow your mind to travel wherever you want. There are also end cards after each episode that are hyper eroticized similar to the tone of the VN short of nudity. That is about the extent of the service itself.Do I wish Nekopara took things further? Yeah, as there is a middle ground between fanservice and story that can be reached to appease both parties. Monster Musume is such an example of a show that retains the adult content of its source material while still managing to give the characters endearing personalities that resonate with the viewer. Fruits of Grisaia is another example of an adaptation that still retains adult elements of its source material EVEN WITH a large amount of censorship in excluding the H-scenes. Both of these adaptations also retained the romantic elements from their source material, whereas here there is no such thing. Nekopara could show nudity, intimacy and be very good but actively chooses not to to presumably to appeal to the normie audience. A decision that disappoints me as a fan of fanservice, and probably disappoints the consumers in Japan considering the low BD sales, but not something that causes me to totally dismiss the merits of its charm to those that love it.TV Nekopara is a case of an anime that appears to be ecchi degenerate material but is actually more wholesome than perverted and can be enjoyed by normies who think they're not perverts and think they watch SOL anime for the emotional bonds more so than sex appeal. So you can totally watch this and deny accusations that you fantasize about having a catgirl harem that lives to please you. Instead you just want to watch catgirls live to please each other, non-sexually of course, under the same household working towards a common goal of helping their place of employment thrive that canonically pays them in dick but in the anime world they just get your wholesome love in return. I would enjoy this much more if the VN never existed and I didn't have a nagging feeling that something is missing. Those who never played the VN are more likely to love it,, and some who do and can pretend as if having sex with catgirls isn't their kink may be able to enjoy it fully with no hang ups whatsoever as well.d As such this can be watched for reasons outside of fanservice, as surprising as that may sound.Those familiar with the VN will immediately recognize the quirks of the catgirls (and if not don’t fret - you quickly pick up on this anyway). Chocola is every bit the adorable airhead who tries her best at everything, no matter how many mistakes are made in the process. Vanilla is the same detached genius of infinite wisdom. Azuki is a fearless munchkin with an Napoleon complex towards the more mature looking Coconut. Cinnamon is a maximum pervert that badly wants to bang Maple, who pretends as if the feeling isn’t mutual. The story does well to introduce circumstances that allows them to show off their charm and individuality. A few of such include the power going out and the catgirls needing to entertain themselves by inventing ghost stories, competing in a sports festival, keijo styled butt battles and helping a stray cat feel at home. One of these is not like the other. But its relevant to the plot, I swear.The lone new addition is a cute baby neko who is slowly ingratiated into her new environment. It can be rewarding watching her progression throughout the story that is expedited by the love given to her by her surrounding family. Through her the compassion of the other catgirls is displayed as they sacrifice their own needs for the sake of making the child feel at comfort. Sweet enough to give you the feels. She doesn't really get lewded either so no worries on that front if you're concerned about crossing some invisible moral line.As I mentioned before, the fanservice is very much so on the tame side. This works to make Nekopara fairly accessible for those into SOL shenanigans.

A CGDCT anime featuring cat girls with yuri undertones and lots of ecchi. With reading that sentence you already know if this anime is for you or not. But with the slight chance you still don't know if this anime is for you, then sit, relax, and let me tell you my thoughts on Nekopara.Nekopara is about a world full of cat girls. Cat girls are essentially girls but with cat ears & tails and they act like cats. In this anime we follow Chocola, the cheerful cat girl, and Vanilla, the stoïc catgirl....These two work in the patiserrie of Kashou and they work as maids serving other cakes and other sweets. These two get help from other cat girls Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon and Cononut (courtesy of Kashou's sister, Shigure). One day while Chocola goes out for some errands, she finds a little kitten girl. She takes her home and thus a bunch of antics ensue.The characters are what you would expect out of this type of anime. They are very trope-y and the anime really tries to hammer in what their personalities are. Jokes are repeated constantly and when they introduce new ones they have a hard time making an impact. Thus, the anime feels a tad boring at times. That doesn't mean there is not fun to be had with this anime. When it slows down and has characters just playing with eachother it is very wholesome and funThe ost is meh (sometimes downright annoying) but the animation is great. The artstyle is pleasing to the eyes and there is a good ammount of sakuga which I Always appreciate.So yeah… this anime is okay. If you are looking for something deep, funny or even relaxing, this not the kind of anime for you. It is CGDCT at its core and it never doesn't do anything more then what it advertises. So really, I would only recommend this if you like to watch another CGDCT to add to your animelist.But if you don't take this anime seriously and just want to watch it for the memes (like ghost stories), then definitely check this one out. It is the mindset what I took when I watched this anime and let me tell you I had a blast that way.

"", ""Fun, brainless, meandering. I think they made a great narrative choice in sidelining the dude - he's important in the VN for obvious reasons but by cutting him down to a side character it puts the girls at the center of story. Nekopara doesn't have much depth and meanders its way through 12 episodes of minor dilemmas and happenings, which is serviceable for average slice of life fare but the repetative character quirks which define the show's humor don't really buoy it. The heart of Nekopara is watching denser than average characters do silly things and also having sex with said characters, this show does...half of that and it does it okay.Weak animation when compared to the source material, and while some of that's inevitable in the transition Sayori's detailed character designs are missed. They also went with a very soft color palette for some reason, which comes off as washed out and doesn't make the characters pop.

Obviously they took out the H parts, but they also toned down the ecchi aspect a lot, took out all the drama and character development, and just made some of the characters' funny running gags and did them way too many times and in forced situations, so the comedic moments also fell flat on their face more often than not.

I had first seen the game mentioned online and I found the series soon after. In my opinion, it has a nice and simple story that is comfortable to watch. The characters are all great and their personalities just add to the show.I loved the art style of the series and for me, the characters weren't very predictable. The decisions they make usually reflect their character. I don’t know how it compares to the game, or if they act different. However, I would recommend this series to anyone that likes simple wholesome anime...with fun characters! with fun characters!"", 'TLDR: If you want to fuck your cat, you should watch this but if you want character development and story please go watch another show.I understand if you don\'t want to read a 20 page dissertation about a catgirl anime, but here is my review of Nekopara. If you want, just read my overall paragraph but I tried to bring in as much insight as I could. After watching the twelve episodes of eye-bleach that this anime was, I can honestly say it wasn\'t that bad. I came in with low expectations after seeing the shitshow that the OVA was, but the anime exceeded my...very low exceptions. The main complaint I\'m seeing in reviews is that there is hardly any character development and there is literally no story, and they aren\'t wrong; however, I find it pathetic to see a bunch of people crying about the lack of story in an anime adaptation about a guy who fucks his pets who happen to hot girls with cat ears. Oh yeah, did I mention that Chocola and Vanilla are literally 9 months old. You can not take these things seriously, and the bottom line is that this show never tries to take itself seriously and never pretends to be more than an ecchi nekomimi fetish show. Overall, the anime didn\'t really blow me away, but it was still very entertaining and I thought it was a funny and enjoyable watch especially if you enjoyed playing the games (VOL 4 RELEASES NOV 26 ON STEAM HYPE).Story: 2Coming in, I knew that there wasn\'t going to be any story. This is an adaption of a dating sim where a man fucks his humanoid cats, and I wasn\'t treating it as  anything more than that. The only story really was in the first few episodes when Chocola takes in a young ""kitten"" named Cacao and after those episodes it a bunch of fan service filled spinoff episodes. Although I understand the purpose of the anime is purely for nekomimi fan service, but I wish they at least attempted to have some story throughout the show.Art: 7The animation wasn\'t groundbreaking, but I thought they adapted the characters pretty well from the original games. It wasn\'t atrocious like the OVA was and there were some good still frames of the characters throughout. Also, I thought the fanservice was about right for my tastes, it wasn\'t extremely distracting but still made me cringe at the right moments. Overall, I thought the quality of the art and animation was pretty good but obviously wasn\'t on the same level as the original games.Sound: 7The one thing that really stood out was the voice acting. They definitely brought the characters to life. For example, the catgirl noises they made whenever someone got startled or something were very good and they threw ""nyaas"" into words very well. The op is very catchy and I thought it fit the show well. The soundtrack was mostly adaptions of the original games so they fit the show perfectly and it will be interesting to hear those if you played the games before.Character: 3The characters were pretty much the same as they were in the original show. The MC is still pretty bland as the should be, Shigure is still the cat obsessed brocon, Azuki and Coconut were constantly fighting but love each other, maple is still the easily frightened posh tsundere, Vanilla is still the lovable kuudere who makes the sly comment every now and then, and Cinnamon is whatever the hell Cinnamon is so I won\'t really be taking these characters into consideration. I really liked what they did with Chocola by giving her a maternal big sister role to Cacao and the scenes between them. I guess the next few sentences could be spoilers, but it really doesn\'t matter as there is no story in this show but if you really care skip to the next paragraph. The problem was that I really didn\'t like Cacao as a character. This is subjective, but I really didn\'t see much change in her character. She did have the moment when she drew the picture of Chocola and Vanilla but she still was silent for the most part and never smiled or had any emotion.Enjoyment: 8Despite the problems with the character and the nonexistent story, I can sill say it was an entertaining show, and honestly I wasn\'t expecting much more than that. I see tons of people complaining about the shitty story and complaining that it wasn\'t a hentai, but I don\'t see how you could expect more from it. If you only enjoy story in anime, you probably shouldn\'t be watching an adaptation of a dating sim about a guy fucking his cats. At no point did the show pretend to be anything that it isn\'t and it stuck to its niche of a fun ecchi cat girl show.Overall: 6This show wasn\'t a really deep show like Death Note, Code Geass, or Cory in the House, but it was still entertaining to say the least and I don\'t regret watching it. very low exceptions.

Recorder to Randoseru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14627/Recorder_to_Randoseru,"['""Mixed Feelings"" perfectly describes this series. On one hand, we have the awkward predicament of 2 siblings, which was exaggerated for comedic effect. ie, the adult looking kindergarten boy who\'s less mature than his peers while the opposite is true for his sister. There are uniquely wholesome and funny moments littered throughout. On the other hand, it\'s very obvious there is an attempt to highlight paedophilia. Some might even say, it encourages it. Was the public or police wrong for their reactions? Is it wrong to be attracted to someone who looks like an adult or vise versa? Have societal norms gone so far as...to ostracized edge cases? Well, the good news is, the short format saves it from the topic while we just get to enjoy the off-beat antics that ensue whenever a situation arises. This is done in a way that leaves everything up to you.The animation is average, Not that it is a bad thing. The voice acting left, a little to be desired, as, the suspension of disbelief was broken several times. Then again, given the nature of the content, it would be very difficult to pull off. The pacing was perfect. The story is, well, someone was going to tackle it, at some point. More often than not, it\'s almost exclusively an adult that looks underaged. Juxtaposing the situation to the point that the MCs are siblings was a brilliant move. If you made it to this season, you pretty much already like the story. If your about to dive in, I suggest that you start from season one as this builds upon the previous seasons but it can stand on its own as well. to ostracized edge cases?

Half a year for? And it's just a meme one, nothing like the actual game PV ;-;. That said, the non-chibi art is actually very well done like the M4 in wonderland scene. I was anticipating a semi-memey, semi-serious military anime. Got nothing I was expecting at all, apart from cute chibi sleepo beepo, I guess you can't complain too much about that.I honestly believe the best aspect of this anime is probably the character, the anime gives a very clear image of the personality of each Anti-Rain and 404 member.The story....well...is there one? Nope, well maybe the M4 in Wonderland scene but that's cryptic for newbies.Sound is good because, who doesn't like cute Soppo and Beepo sounds?Overall, I give this series a generous 7/10, I'm sure if a proper anime was made, based on MICA's manga they are currently serializing after the Girl's Frontline story, with a bit of meme and non-chibi character design, I'd probably rate that 10/10Yikes how do I even have time to be writing this review, I should be levelling my dolls for Singularity 😓 is there one?

Naturally, with this success, comes the inevitable jump to animation. How well did it turn out? Well this series is the story of two halves.Healing Chapter comprised the first half of the series. Something that stuck out was the sheer amount of great character interactions and heartwarming scenarios. For example, in one episode, M4 SOPMOD II creates a miniature replica of herself via the flesh of her enemies. The bond between this replica and M4A1 is surprisingly genuine for a short-form anime, and this replica ended up making a cameo later...on. The humor is relatively simple but quite well done, with a charming artstyle and surprisingly good voice acting.The second half, known as Madness Chapter, is a bit of different tale. Based on 4koma comics that were released as fun little stories, these segments are far more fast-paced and humor-focused. And there are more of them. But naturally, the platitude of ""quality > quantity"" comes into play. The shorts are far too hit or miss for me. Some, such as the one with the plant fairy, are charming little snippets. Others devolve into ""geddit dakimakuras"" or ""OOPS the cats ate the food"", or just have zero build-up. It comes off a bit too childish for me at points. The animation here also wildly ranges, quite a few times stuff barely moves and in other times there are weirdly fluid motions of cat people. Character interactions are present but barely explored in favor of the previously mentioned quick gags. The voice acting is still pretty solid though.The characters themselves are in general likable but fairly one-note. I can sum up some of them as ""cat"", ""lazy"", ""drunk"", and ""crazy"". That\'s unfortunately the problem you get when you focus on too many characters. Healing Chapter made up for this with bouncy dynamics, but as mentioned before Madness Chapter half-assed that part.Perhaps I\'d get this more if I liked the game enough, but I don\'t gamble on jpgs and as a secondary to the franchise, this unfortunately couldn\'t get me on board. If you want absurdly short, silly cartoons I could cautiously recommend it, but just know you won\'t be getting the most consistent experience. on.

This takes place after the events of Evol, yet for some odd reason Amata and Mikono seem to have no clue whatsoever of who Apollo or Silvia are. Another complaint is some characters like  Silvia and Reika are rarely seen or heard from, and that Apollo seems far too OP.

While I found Apollo and Kagura comedic, I was very disappointed at how little screen time Silvia and Reika got, and how pathetic Amata still is.Overall - It is enjoyable due to the combination of music and action scenes which is typical of Aquarion, yet what is also typical of Aquarion is a flawed story that has serious pacing problems, as well as poor character developement. been far more better as a movie, the pacing might have been better as well.Art & Sound - Art is the exact same as Evol, with the same recycled music from Genesis and Evol (still never get tired of listening to it)Character - It's good seeing the old characters again, and when you see Apollo fighting with Kagura, it's comedic yet wierd at seeing how similar they are.

Seikaisuru Kado,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32032/Seikaisuru_Kado,"[""No spoilers, except just one: this show is a spectacular train-wreck. If you like good science fiction, beware: this show begins extremely well but manages to destroy everything it built up and trample on its viewer's expectations in every way imaginable in its final episodes.After hearing that this was an anime that had heavy parallels to Arrival, and watching the first five episodes, the sci-fi buff in me was ecstatic. Here was a mature, well-written and absolutely gorgeous looking and sounding sci-fi anime that was headed in a direction that didn't seem hackneyed. It was thought-provoking and sparked a lot of discussion among the viewership....It was a potential masterpiece, I thought.But as the series progressed, anime tropes that had no business appearing in a mature narrative such as this started popping up left and right for no good reason like some rash, creating a very jarring experience, and culminating in an ending that left many wondering how something with so much potential had ended up like this. It became incoherent to the point where one has to wonder whether the author's original vision was altered by others in the creative team to appeal to a larger crowd - one that wouldn't be watching this series in the first place.Story (3/10): The first half was a solid take on first contact, and the plot was genuinely creative and gripping at the same time. The last quarter was an unmitigated disaster for the most part. I don't think any other show with such a promising beginning has bombed so hard.Art (8.5/10): Ah, this is something that the plot couldn't touch, and does deserve a favourable mention: the characters and several other parts are in 3DCG, and it pretty much sets an industry standard to how 3DCG should look. At no point did it look awkward or badly animated - on the contrary, some CG-heavy scenes ranged from beautiful to downright jaw-dropping.Sound (8.5/10): Another thing the story could not completely spoil was the soundtrack, which was great.

Tl;dr: You are probably better off pretending this doesn't exist. That, unfortunately, is the right answer. It was a potential masterpiece, I thought.But as the series progressed, anime tropes that had no business appearing in a mature narrative such as this started popping up left and right for no good reason like some rash, creating a very jarring experience, and culminating in an ending that left many wondering how something with so much potential had ended up like this. It became incoherent to the point where one has to wonder whether the author's original vision was altered by others in the creative team to appeal to a larger crowd - one that wouldn't be watching this series in the first place.Story (3/10): The first half was a solid take on first contact, and the plot was genuinely creative and gripping at the same time.

That, unfortunately, is the right answer."", 'Story: 3Seikaisuru Kado begins with an intriguing premise: An alien arrives on Earth bearing gifts to advance humanity. To ease communication between the alien and the government, a gifted negotiator offers his services. Over time, the alien and negotiator learn about each other and become friends, overcoming their many differences. Meanwhile, the alien\'s gifts are so vastly powerful and beyond human understanding, that they threaten existing international resource and power relations. Soon, the bigger, more concerning question looms: Why?That\'s a lot to work with, and the first 8-9 episodes actually do quite well in exploring these ideas. However, if you\'re after intelligent, well-considered, or satisfactory...answers, you will most likely be disappointed.In fact, ""disappointed"" is the word I\'d use to describe my feelings about this series as a whole. Many of the issues raised in earlier episodes are resolved by way of shoehorned deux ex machinas, then explained away in empty words as to sound somehow profound or meaningful. While I understood the reasoning behind the solutions and how they had to be done, there was little-to-no lead-up and foreshadowing, making them seem overly-convenient, and leave no satisfaction in the resolution. In essence, poor execution: It felt as though the writers wrote themselves into a corner, had trouble resolving everything in the space of a few episodes, or handed the reins over to shallow mahou shoujo writers altogether.Art: 7As a fully CG-based series, Toei did surprisingly well (see: earlier efforts in the sad CG transformation sequences in Sailor Moon Crystal). While it was apparent that impactful action sequences are beyond the reaches of the overly smooth and measured pace of their CG animation, the need itself was rendered obsolete due to the setting and cast of white-collar characters, and it even enhanced the otherworldly quality of the alien. By nature of CG animation, the quality could only be consistent throughout, but overall visual interest is lost through over-reliance on it where there could be better angles or compositions.Sound: 7I actually remember very little of the background tracks, but since nothing stood out to me as being particularly out-of-place either, I\'ll give this a pass. The opening and ending themes are actually quite lovely and help conjure a sense of wonder at the vast universe.Character: 6First of all, I was very impressed by the variety of character designs; the old and young, physically imposing and frail, big and small, etc... Even the main character doesn\'t look terribly outstanding, which lends weight to his professional nature. That said, most of the recurring cast are attractive young people, which kind of ruins that thought. I had trouble taking the main girl seriously, for many, many reasons. The alien\'s design was appropriately strange, and subtly differentiated him as a whole other species, even while taking a human form.Design aside, I appreciated the developing relationship between the negotiator and the alien; in particular, the alien\'s growing attachment to his new friend manifested through subtle glances and not-so-subtle keeping of mementos. The relationship felt believable through their attempts to overcome cultural, linguistic, technological, etc... differences. The love interest, while soundly and reasonably developed as a character, on the other hand, felt lacking in chemistry by comparison, considering her importance in the conclusion.On a separate note, for all that the negotiator was set up to be one of the best in his field, he does very... little... negotiating...?Enjoyment: 3Despite my enjoyment of earlier episodes, the conclusion was poorly done. I spent episodes 9-12 mostly feeling confused and in disbelief over every nonsensical turn of events, disappointed at the waste of potential, and the waste of my time.Overall: 5Only the first 8 episodes and a few technical aspects manage to redeem this series.

Good job effing it up, Toei.', 'A battle of words and ideas between the finest diplomats of Japan and a being from another dimension that comes from a cube.Please be aware that there are slight spoilers in character analysis and story analysis.Once every anime season there is a chance you will encounter an anime that has a premise that is completely new and hasn’t been seen before and one that completely engrosses you in both its setting and story and can keep you entertained until the end. In this case Seikaisuru Kado certainly fits that bill as its one anime that I have yet to get bored off...and indeed continues to intrigue me episode by episode.The premise behind Seikaisuru Kado is a relative straightforward one but one that is exceedingly rare within the anime industry. When you think of aliens or being from another dimension visiting the planet most people would imagine that ok this is going to be an action anime that focuses on the soldiers pushing the alien back right. Not so in this case. The main premise of this anime is diplomacy and how new technology that is gifted by an alien should be used and viewed and whether is it right for humanity as a race to use it. The combination of Diplomacy between the alien and the people of Japan and their relationship with the countries of the world with regards to the alien and his gifts I felt was interesting as was seeing the effects of the gifts on humanity as well.The anime’s Theme of focusing on diplomacy as well as focusing on the larger picture of humanity as a race and not individual countries I felt was an interesting one and this was one anime that really hooked me in when I saw the trailer for it.Seikaisuru Kado’s main story takes place within modem day japan and follows life of Shindou Kojiro a veteran diplomat of the Japanese Governments ministry of foreign affairs who whether by chance or not becomes the first person to meet an alien from another dimension and from there act as the intermediary between him and humanity. The overall story focuses on the negotiation between the alien being ZaShuNina and the government of Japan which is watched by countries around the world and ZaShuNina’s attempt to help humanity by providing certain gifts.Kojiro ShindouKojiro Shindou voiced by veteran voice actor Hiroaki Miura is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A veteran negotiator from the governments Ministry of foreign affairs Shindou is a calm, collected and composed person that thanks to his many years of service to the ministry has a detailed knowledge of not just how Japanese society works but also how governments and countries around the world work as well. As a result of both his experience and knowledge Shindou is well liked by his co-workers and well respected by them and by his superiors. Apart for being calm and composed which is no doubt his prominent trait Shindou is also a smart man and well versed in making quick decisions after finding out all the information that he needs for a given situation. Shindou seems to be a person that takes great pride in being a diplomat and seems to value the job that he has immensely which is best exemplified by the fact that he’s always eager to see things to an end which indicates that he is also very dutiful as well.  As a result of this personality Shindou is someone that understands how negotiations work on an intimate level and as such he will always try to get the best deal for both sides of one.It’s important to note that Shindou also has a softer personality that he shows when he’s not in diplomat mode and is used when he’s interacting with friends and family. Unlike when he’s in diplomatic mode Shindou’s other personality tends to be softer and more respectful but at the same time have less pressure behind his words. In this personality Shindou seems to be a bit of a joker and will often use humor to deal with people that are either too serious, nervous or uptight. This is best seen in his first meeting with Saraka.  As a main character and the main protagonist of the series Shindou develops and forms a relationship with many different characters in the series as part of his new role with his relationship with ZashuNina and Saraka being the most important. Both of these relationships I felt were pretty well done and were built on the most important element that any negotiation would need to have which in this case is trust. Shindou’s relationship with ZaShuNina is arguably one of the cornerstones of this series and forms an important part of the overall plot of the series.In the beginning of the series Shindou as a result of being on the plane that ZashuNina absorbed was the first human that he encountered and as a result of both ZashuNina’s curious and inquisitive nature and Shindou’s sense of responsibility and adaptability they soon established a bond that is built on understanding and trust. As the series progresses it can be seen that Shindou’s advice and observations are highly valued by ZashuNina and that there was a genuine bond of friendship that had been forged between them. Their relationship from the outside could be seen as something akin to that of a normal friendship though naturally one that transcends the human race. Though as later events occur I do wonder whether this bond was indeed real or not. Still I felt that the relationship between the two and the effect that it had on the overall plot was both well developed and was integrated very well into the main plot. As a character Shindou I felt was an excellent character as despite a veteran diplomat that was accustomed to dealing with fellow humans Shindou was due to his personality able to adapt well to the most unusual of situations and be able to act as the link between the people of Japan and ZashuNina which arguably made him one of the most important person on Earth at the time of the event. At the same time Shindou’s compassionate personality while certainly not on the level of Saraka’s also served as great qualities that ensured that his decisions while logical also ensured that he also thinks of the effects that it will have on normal humans as well. All in all, I felt that Hiroaki Miura really did an excellent job voicing the character of Shindou.SarakaSaraka Tsukai voiced by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio and Digimon Adventure Tri fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main heroine of the series. A negotiator that works for the Japanese governments Ministry of foreign affairs that handles Japan’s relationship with other countries Saraka is an intelligent, fast thinking and composed person that looks and behaves similarly to Shindou. Despite working in the same ministry Saraka and Shindou never met before the events of the plot. Like Shindou Saraka adapts a mask of professionalism when she’s working as a negotiator that is both composed and reserved yet this mask does sometimes break when she’s exposed to situations that resonate with her humorous personality. This aspect of her I felt was quite funny and helps differentiate her with Shindou who rarely laughs. Despite being young Saraka is both earnest and hardworking and treats her duties seriously which indicates how she got to her position and rank at her age. Indeed, while Saraka and Shindou have not met each other before the events of the plot it can be seen that he has at least heard of her. Like Shindou when Saraka is in diplomat mode she tends to be overly serious and uptight at times that manifests in a variety of ways. When under a lot of stress which in the series is actually quite often Saraka’s overly serious personality manifests in the form of lectures to people that tries to remind them how important this is. Rather than reassuring others this seems to have the opposite effect on her which I felt was rather funny. As a result of her uptight personality when dealing with people that have a humorous side to them such as Shindou Saraka can be embarrassed quite easily which has the effect of causing her to look rather cute as she blushes quite heavily when she is.Like Shindou Saraka’s personality outside of her role as a diplomat is very different to what you will expect from her but the difference here is that in this series Saraka’s personality outside of her role is explored more so than Shindou’s. Saraka’s normal personality is akin to that of a free spirit and is one that loves to learn new things and explore similar to explorers of old and can be said to be similar to an adventurer. As a result of this personally Saraka has a rather interesting view of how evolution and human evolution should be handled that contrasts a great deal with her role in the story. Saraka is of the belief that evolution should be natural and that it should be left to advance at its own pace and not meddled with which contrasts a great deal with the gifts that ZashuNina brings to the table and makes for interesting conversations between her and Shindou. This belief of hers I felt was interesting not just because it serves as the opposite to ZashuNina’s role in the story but also because this kind of belief is not often seen in anime as well. As a result of this belief Saraka is very firm in her belief that human evolution should be left to them and them alone and that they should only advance when they are ready for change. This causes a number of plat developments and revelations in the overall plot that were surprising. Saraka’s determination to protect human dignity that was used as her reason for her beliefs I felt was really appropriate and fitted well with her personality of always putting the needs of humanity first. A prominent trait of Saraka is the fact that she has a great deal of empathy and as a result she is rather sensitive to the feelings and emotions of people around her and as a result she tends to have a more sympathetic view of people that have views that are not in line with what the majority of people think which I think was interesting as it contrasts both the official position and also Shindou’s personality as well.As a character Saraka in addition to being the main heroine and female lead also functioned as a contrast to the main character and Protagonist of Shindou and helped in showing him a side of the argument that was different to the logical side of things that he was accustomed to. On his own the character of Shindou though a very capable negotiator was a person that leaned on the side of logic a bit too heavily and as a result it can be said that he did view feelings and the larger picture of the human race as readily as he should. Considering the stakes for the whole race I feel that this is something that he should be more invested in. The addition of Saraka though and her partnership with Shindou as negotiators for both ZashuNina and the government respectively I felt really helped matters as this allowed them to interact more with each other. This had the effect of allowing Saraka to not just share her concerns to Shindou but also allow her to show him the feelings of others as well as the larger picture of the human race that he had missed when he received the job. As a result, this allowed Shindou to both be logical but at the same time more understanding of the feelings and concerns of others and more importantly the concerns for the human race as a whole. All in all, I felt that the character of Saraka was one that was well designed and had a clear defined role in the series. The contrast that she had with Shindou I felt was pretty well done. In a way, I felt that as a character Saraka functioned very similarly to a female version of Shindou though one that had both empathy and a belief that was unique to her. The relationship between Shindou and Saraka is one of the main points in the overall plot of this series and I felt that it was pretty well done. From the beginning of the series it was apparent that between the two there was a great deal of chemistry between the two as both had an equal amount of respect of each other. As the series progresses and both learn more about each other this is only intensified the bond. The idea that both characters changing as both learned more about each other is not anything new but the fact that Shindou learned a to be a bit more empathic and more human thanks to Saraka’s advice and her beliefs I felt was done quite well and ultimately helped in ensuring that he had the conviction to stand against ZaShuNina when the time came. The idea that the two as a result of their shared beliefs actually becoming a couple was something that I thought was executed pretty well.The true nature of Saraka however I felt was a pretty good twist and one that came at a really opportune time with the plot line. I felt that Mao Ichimichi really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Saraka.Za ShuninaZaShuNina whose full name is Yaha Kui ZashuNina who in this series is voiced by veteran voice actor Takuma Terashima of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei and Log horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main antagonist of the series. A being from a separate space time that arrived on Earth on a cube shaped object in a most dramatic fashion ZashuNina despite looking like a human being is in fact an alien. ZashuNina adapts two different persona’s that he makes use of in the series which is markedly different from each other though certain traits from one side do transfer to the other side. In his default persona that is used from the start of the series ZashuNina is a calm and quiet person that seems to adapt a neutral stance with regards to his relationship with humanity. Though powerful it can be seen that at this point in his personality ZashuNina acts somewhat like a child as still learning about humanity and its customs which I felt was interesting and kept it within this anime’s main theme of diplomacy. As the series progresses and as ZaShuNina meets new people and learns more about humanity via dialogue and books and media his knowledge of humanity grows and from there the plot moves into the gifts that he is willing to provide to humanity. Though stemming from his second personality and his overall goal the gifts that ZaShuNina provides to humanity do stem from the many limits and struggles that his observations of humanity has told him and these gifts I felt were pretty well thought out and designed as each was created solely to address one issue that is dire to humanity. From a civilian point of view, it’s easy to see why people want to use these gifts so much and why countries around the world are so willing to integrate these into the workings of their countries. I guess its human nature that they will believe everything that someone will say if that person appears to be benign to them and at the same able to help the race advance.ZaShuNina’s second personality was revealed near the end of the series and was anything but benign and indeed was a personality that I didn’t really expect him to have. In this personality which I would imagine is his true nature ZashuNina in a departure from his first personality is a calculating, determined and ruthless person that’s also deceitful and well versed at subterfuge. While his initial personality can be described to be that of a child this new personality can be seen to be that of an adult and a scheming one as well. In this personality ZashuNina is very determined to enact his own master plan and his own designs for humanity even if it meant that it will cost them dearly in terms of life. Indeed, from ZashuNina’s initial personality only his hunger for knowledge which can be said to be his prominent trait is transferred from that personality to this one. In the beginning of the series though I did have suspicions that ZaShuNina would be the main villain for the series the gradual transformation from a benign alien that was seen as a great inventor by humanity to a villain that was dead set on uplifting humanity so that they can provide him with knowledge was so unexpected that it shook even me.The character of ZaShuNina I felt was a really interesting character and made a pretty good villain for the series. The character of ZaShuNina I felt was a very well-designed character that underwent great changes in his behavior and personality as the series went on. Indeed, the changes were such that it’s almost as if there actually two people that have the same name but yet differing personalities in them. Due to this it was not easy to see what his motivations and aims were in the series until his true plan was revealed which I think was the point of this.  I felt that Takuma Terashima really did an excellent job of portraying the character of ZaShuNina and that this character contributed greatly to how excellent this story was.Kanata ShinawaKanata Shinawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Kugimiya is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Shindou and Saraka’s allies in the series. A genius level scientist that works at one of the many research labs that the government manages and oversees Kanata is despite her young age an excellent scientist that apart from being smart is also hyperactive and positive and indeed can spend her days researching new things without a care in the world. Though eccentric and tending to get way too immersed in her analysis’s Kanata is someone that is more than willing to help others if the request itself is something that hasn’t been done before. Kanata is someone that loves to challenge the unknown. While certainly eccentric and easily excited Kanata’s main personality trait is her determination to figure out and determine how something actually works and when combined with her childish wonder at new things this is something that actually makes her pretty endearing. While representing the science side of the story Kanata due to her positive nature is also able to cheer people up with her attitude which I felt was pretty funny to see. Though young it can be seen that her superiors and fellow scientists at the lab trust her immensely due to her intellect and determined nature. Though only a support character I felt that Rie Kugimiya really did a great job at portraying the character of Kanata and that she brought not just intelligence but also determination to the field that proves that human intelligence is also something that should not be underestimated.Arts and animationWith regards to the art that was used for this series I felt that the environments that used and shown in the series was pretty well done with the interior of Kado being especially impressive. The character designs for the characters in this series I felt was also pretty well done with ZaShuNina’s design despite taking the form of a human also looked like a hybrid that’s between a human and an alien. The other environments such as Haneda airport, the Diet building and Saraka and Shindou’s home towns I felt were also well done. With regards to the animation because this series isn’t actually a true action anime the animation in the series is focused more on the showing of how the gifts actually work which I felt was well done and showed just how powerful they were. It wasn’t until much later in the series that the anime featured combat scenes and I felt that these were done pretty well especially the fights between Saraka and ZaShuNina and the final fight in the end.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening and ending themes for the series being especially strong. The opening theme for the series which was called Tabiji was sung by the character of Saraka Tsukai through her seiyuu Mao Ichimichi and I felt that this song along with its visuals did a pretty good job of setting the mood for the series while also showing the evolution of humanity through its visuals. The ending theme for this series which was called Eien No Kotae which was sung by Haruca had a more positive tone to it that for some reason had a calming presence to it. Individual scene music I felt was pretty well done throughout the series.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was excellent throughout the series with each of the characters that were featured in the series being portrayed to the best of their respective seiyuu’s ability. In particular the characters of Koujirou Shindou, Saraka Tsukai and Yaha Kui ZaShuNina who were portrayed by Hiroaki Miura, Mao Ichimichi and Takuma Terashima respectively I felt did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. In addition the characters of Kanata, Takumi Gonnou and the Japanese prime minister Kouzou Inutaba who was portrayed by Rie Kugimiya, Takuya Kirimoto and Hiroshi Naka I felt also did a great job portraying their characters.Overall conclusionIn overall, I thought that Kado the right answer as it is called in the west was a pretty good anime that was actually interesting and indeed was something that really surprised me because it provoked a lot of interesting questions into the world that we live in. it’s not every day that an anime would feature so many real-world questions and challenges inside it though and use that as part of its main plot. The strong points that made Kado the right answer such an excellent anime in my opinion was its interesting theme and the fact that it made use of real world problems as part of it, strong story that provoked questions about the current world, excellent characters, Excellent animation and voice acting.First thing to address is the theme of the show. The main theme of the show apart from contact with an alien race also lies inside the realm of negotiation and diplomacy. At the same time, another thing that was part of this series theme was the gifts that the main villain provided that was designed to help humanity as a race overcome some of the challenges that they currently face. The inclusion of real world problems like energy, time and transporting objects I felt was really interesting and the way that it was revealed to humanity was both intelligent and well done as the thought that any of the three problems that beset them and limit them can be dealt with these gifts will surely find a lot of people who is willing to use them. The main theme of this series however is undoubtedly that of diplomacy and negotiation which I felt was interesting and was a well-designed move on the creator’s part. In animes that feature contact with beings from either parallel dimension such as this one or aliens from other planets or galaxies the line largely lies with either fighting a war to defend the planet or forcefully integrate their resources into your own race with diplomacy largely being ignored or at least seeing limited use. As such it was actually pretty refreshing to see that this anime’s main theme while also dealing with aliens makes use of diplomacy as its main theme. Though like most people I have limited knowledge on the concept of diplomacy and negotiation I felt that depiction that negotiation is built on a degree of trust that was shown between Shindou and ZashuNina was really well done. Watching the two of them gradually learn about each other and at the same time cooperate to create gifts that would benefit humanity as a race while also forging a bond built on trust was something that was nice to see and begs the question why isn’t this concept used more in anime. I felt that the diplomacy side of things in the anime was pretty well done and was a pretty accurate portrayal of how negotiations between parties actually take place even though this party to which Saraka and Shindou talk with is far from anything that both have encountered in their careers. A real game changer there lol.The overall story of the series is another strong point and was one that I felt was done really well. In line with the main theme of the series the overall storyline focuses on first the introduction of the alien being to the world via his most dramatic entrance on to the planet by literally landing on one of Japan’s busiest airports followed by his gradual reveal of what he was and what he represented. The gradual evolution of ZaShuNina’s role from that of an unknown life form to that of a major celebrity and then to his reveal of the gifts that he is willing to gift to humanity I felt was pretty well done.  The concept of using the relationship that he has forged with the government of japan and use this to determine the challenges that face the race as a whole I felt was interesting and played alone with the theme of diplomacy as diplomacy and negotiation is always focused on understanding what the other party needs and providing what they want versus what you yourself want from the. The gradual transformation of this relationship as well as ZaShuNina as a character I felt was pretty well done. Arguably the transformation of ZaShuNina from a benign alien being to one that proved to be a scheming and manipulative alien being that had his own nefarious plan was also well done as was the twist of Saraka’s identity as well. Indeed, transformation and twists also changed the dynamic of the story near the end but in a good way I think. One thing about the overall story that really interested me though was the fact that ZaShuNina’s entrance and the effects that he has is not limited to Japan on its own and indeed affects humanity as a whole. As a result, when deciding on his next moves ZaShuNina and Shindou had to consider the larger effects that bind the world namely its structure. In the world that we live in its easy to see that even as a race humanity is not united entity and that we are divided in both culture, countries and borders that are unique to each country. Though logically it can be said that ZaShuNina and Shindou could have used international organisations like the UN to get the gifts to the people of various countries there also lies the next problem. Humanity as a race is as diverse as a rainbow that while also giving us strength and unity also creates problems like greed and control and points to the fact can these governments and organisations really get the gifts to the people and not hog them for themselves. Its issues like this that really make the story worth investing in as it provokes some really interesting views on the world that we live in. With regards to this question I loved how they actually ended up bypassing them entirely and solving the problem their way.  The true purpose and plan of ZaShuNina’s however doesn’t come into play until much later in the series but it was done in such a way that it really could be said to be one of the best twists that I seen in an anime for a long time. The clash of ideas and convictions that served as the main plot in that part of the series I felt was pretty well done and loved how Saraka and Shindou’s relationship as well as their shared beliefs were used as the main plot here. The clash of ideas between them and ZaShuNina was something that I was looking forward too and was something that was excellently done.There are a number of things that I felt really stood out in this series with the first being how well thought out and how well executed both the twists in the story and the plans to counter them were created. A great example of the latter is the last plan that Shindou and Saraka used to finally put a stop to ZaShuNina in the end. The thought that they had made use of the same tech that he himself had created for his plan to engineer his destruction was funny and had no small amount of irony to it as well. The ending fight which led into the ending itself I felt was pretty well done and demonstrated the fact that when humanity and the anisotropic being work together they can even beat someone as formidable as ZaShuNina. Though the cost of victory was indeed high I felt that as a race humanity can still learn to advance but at a suitable pace and not losing sight of what makes them human.It’s been a while since I seen an anime that in addition to having an excellent theme and story as well as excellent characters and voice acting was able to provoke some really interesting questions that I had never once thought off.  All in all, Kado the right answer was really one of the best animes for this season because it was intelligent and made use of real world issues in a way that only served to enhance its main plot line. The core lesson for Kado the right answer is naturally that while advancement in tech is important whats more important that that is that we should never lose sight of our own unique identity that makes us human when doing it. And probably not trust every alien that shows up on the planet as well. and indeed continues to intrigue me episode by episode.The premise behind Seikaisuru Kado is a relative straightforward one but one that is exceedingly rare within the anime industry. When you think of aliens or being from another dimension visiting the planet most people would imagine that ok this is going to be an action anime that focuses on the soldiers pushing the alien back right. Not so in this case. The main premise of this anime is diplomacy and how new technology that is gifted by an alien should be used and viewed and whether is it right for humanity as a race to use it. The combination of Diplomacy between the alien and the people of Japan and their relationship with the countries of the world with regards to the alien and his gifts I felt was interesting as was seeing the effects of the gifts on humanity as well.The anime’s Theme of focusing on diplomacy as well as focusing on the larger picture of humanity as a race and not individual countries I felt was an interesting one and this was one anime that really hooked me in when I saw the trailer for it.Seikaisuru Kado’s main story takes place within modem day japan and follows life of Shindou Kojiro a veteran diplomat of the Japanese Governments ministry of foreign affairs who whether by chance or not becomes the first person to meet an alien from another dimension and from there act as the intermediary between him and humanity. The overall story focuses on the negotiation between the alien being ZaShuNina and the government of Japan which is watched by countries around the world and ZaShuNina’s attempt to help humanity by providing certain gifts.Kojiro ShindouKojiro Shindou voiced by veteran voice actor Hiroaki Miura is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A veteran negotiator from the governments Ministry of foreign affairs Shindou is a calm, collected and composed person that thanks to his many years of service to the ministry has a detailed knowledge of not just how Japanese society works but also how governments and countries around the world work as well. As a result of both his experience and knowledge Shindou is well liked by his co-workers and well respected by them and by his superiors. Apart for being calm and composed which is no doubt his prominent trait Shindou is also a smart man and well versed in making quick decisions after finding out all the information that he needs for a given situation. Shindou seems to be a person that takes great pride in being a diplomat and seems to value the job that he has immensely which is best exemplified by the fact that he’s always eager to see things to an end which indicates that he is also very dutiful as well.  As a result of this personality Shindou is someone that understands how negotiations work on an intimate level and as such he will always try to get the best deal for both sides of one.It’s important to note that Shindou also has a softer personality that he shows when he’s not in diplomat mode and is used when he’s interacting with friends and family. Unlike when he’s in diplomatic mode Shindou’s other personality tends to be softer and more respectful but at the same time have less pressure behind his words. In this personality Shindou seems to be a bit of a joker and will often use humor to deal with people that are either too serious, nervous or uptight. This is best seen in his first meeting with Saraka.  As a main character and the main protagonist of the series Shindou develops and forms a relationship with many different characters in the series as part of his new role with his relationship with ZashuNina and Saraka being the most important. Both of these relationships I felt were pretty well done and were built on the most important element that any negotiation would need to have which in this case is trust. Shindou’s relationship with ZaShuNina is arguably one of the cornerstones of this series and forms an important part of the overall plot of the series.In the beginning of the series Shindou as a result of being on the plane that ZashuNina absorbed was the first human that he encountered and as a result of both ZashuNina’s curious and inquisitive nature and Shindou’s sense of responsibility and adaptability they soon established a bond that is built on understanding and trust. As the series progresses it can be seen that Shindou’s advice and observations are highly valued by ZashuNina and that there was a genuine bond of friendship that had been forged between them. Their relationship from the outside could be seen as something akin to that of a normal friendship though naturally one that transcends the human race. Though as later events occur I do wonder whether this bond was indeed real or not. Still I felt that the relationship between the two and the effect that it had on the overall plot was both well developed and was integrated very well into the main plot. As a character Shindou I felt was an excellent character as despite a veteran diplomat that was accustomed to dealing with fellow humans Shindou was due to his personality able to adapt well to the most unusual of situations and be able to act as the link between the people of Japan and ZashuNina which arguably made him one of the most important person on Earth at the time of the event. At the same time Shindou’s compassionate personality while certainly not on the level of Saraka’s also served as great qualities that ensured that his decisions while logical also ensured that he also thinks of the effects that it will have on normal humans as well. All in all, I felt that Hiroaki Miura really did an excellent job voicing the character of Shindou.SarakaSaraka Tsukai voiced by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio and Digimon Adventure Tri fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main heroine of the series. A negotiator that works for the Japanese governments Ministry of foreign affairs that handles Japan’s relationship with other countries Saraka is an intelligent, fast thinking and composed person that looks and behaves similarly to Shindou. Despite working in the same ministry Saraka and Shindou never met before the events of the plot. Like Shindou Saraka adapts a mask of professionalism when she’s working as a negotiator that is both composed and reserved yet this mask does sometimes break when she’s exposed to situations that resonate with her humorous personality. This aspect of her I felt was quite funny and helps differentiate her with Shindou who rarely laughs. Despite being young Saraka is both earnest and hardworking and treats her duties seriously which indicates how she got to her position and rank at her age. Indeed, while Saraka and Shindou have not met each other before the events of the plot it can be seen that he has at least heard of her. Like Shindou when Saraka is in diplomat mode she tends to be overly serious and uptight at times that manifests in a variety of ways. When under a lot of stress which in the series is actually quite often Saraka’s overly serious personality manifests in the form of lectures to people that tries to remind them how important this is. Rather than reassuring others this seems to have the opposite effect on her which I felt was rather funny. As a result of her uptight personality when dealing with people that have a humorous side to them such as Shindou Saraka can be embarrassed quite easily which has the effect of causing her to look rather cute as she blushes quite heavily when she is.Like Shindou Saraka’s personality outside of her role as a diplomat is very different to what you will expect from her but the difference here is that in this series Saraka’s personality outside of her role is explored more so than Shindou’s. Saraka’s normal personality is akin to that of a free spirit and is one that loves to learn new things and explore similar to explorers of old and can be said to be similar to an adventurer. As a result of this personally Saraka has a rather interesting view of how evolution and human evolution should be handled that contrasts a great deal with her role in the story. Saraka is of the belief that evolution should be natural and that it should be left to advance at its own pace and not meddled with which contrasts a great deal with the gifts that ZashuNina brings to the table and makes for interesting conversations between her and Shindou. This belief of hers I felt was interesting not just because it serves as the opposite to ZashuNina’s role in the story but also because this kind of belief is not often seen in anime as well. As a result of this belief Saraka is very firm in her belief that human evolution should be left to them and them alone and that they should only advance when they are ready for change. This causes a number of plat developments and revelations in the overall plot that were surprising. Saraka’s determination to protect human dignity that was used as her reason for her beliefs I felt was really appropriate and fitted well with her personality of always putting the needs of humanity first. A prominent trait of Saraka is the fact that she has a great deal of empathy and as a result she is rather sensitive to the feelings and emotions of people around her and as a result she tends to have a more sympathetic view of people that have views that are not in line with what the majority of people think which I think was interesting as it contrasts both the official position and also Shindou’s personality as well.As a character Saraka in addition to being the main heroine and female lead also functioned as a contrast to the main character and Protagonist of Shindou and helped in showing him a side of the argument that was different to the logical side of things that he was accustomed to. On his own the character of Shindou though a very capable negotiator was a person that leaned on the side of logic a bit too heavily and as a result it can be said that he did view feelings and the larger picture of the human race as readily as he should. Considering the stakes for the whole race I feel that this is something that he should be more invested in. The addition of Saraka though and her partnership with Shindou as negotiators for both ZashuNina and the government respectively I felt really helped matters as this allowed them to interact more with each other. This had the effect of allowing Saraka to not just share her concerns to Shindou but also allow her to show him the feelings of others as well as the larger picture of the human race that he had missed when he received the job. As a result, this allowed Shindou to both be logical but at the same time more understanding of the feelings and concerns of others and more importantly the concerns for the human race as a whole. All in all, I felt that the character of Saraka was one that was well designed and had a clear defined role in the series. The contrast that she had with Shindou I felt was pretty well done. In a way, I felt that as a character Saraka functioned very similarly to a female version of Shindou though one that had both empathy and a belief that was unique to her. The relationship between Shindou and Saraka is one of the main points in the overall plot of this series and I felt that it was pretty well done. From the beginning of the series it was apparent that between the two there was a great deal of chemistry between the two as both had an equal amount of respect of each other. As the series progresses and both learn more about each other this is only intensified the bond. The idea that both characters changing as both learned more about each other is not anything new but the fact that Shindou learned a to be a bit more empathic and more human thanks to Saraka’s advice and her beliefs I felt was done quite well and ultimately helped in ensuring that he had the conviction to stand against ZaShuNina when the time came. The idea that the two as a result of their shared beliefs actually becoming a couple was something that I thought was executed pretty well.The true nature of Saraka however I felt was a pretty good twist and one that came at a really opportune time with the plot line. I felt that Mao Ichimichi really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Saraka.Za ShuninaZaShuNina whose full name is Yaha Kui ZashuNina who in this series is voiced by veteran voice actor Takuma Terashima of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei and Log horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main antagonist of the series. A being from a separate space time that arrived on Earth on a cube shaped object in a most dramatic fashion ZashuNina despite looking like a human being is in fact an alien. ZashuNina adapts two different persona’s that he makes use of in the series which is markedly different from each other though certain traits from one side do transfer to the other side. In his default persona that is used from the start of the series ZashuNina is a calm and quiet person that seems to adapt a neutral stance with regards to his relationship with humanity. Though powerful it can be seen that at this point in his personality ZashuNina acts somewhat like a child as still learning about humanity and its customs which I felt was interesting and kept it within this anime’s main theme of diplomacy. As the series progresses and as ZaShuNina meets new people and learns more about humanity via dialogue and books and media his knowledge of humanity grows and from there the plot moves into the gifts that he is willing to provide to humanity. Though stemming from his second personality and his overall goal the gifts that ZaShuNina provides to humanity do stem from the many limits and struggles that his observations of humanity has told him and these gifts I felt were pretty well thought out and designed as each was created solely to address one issue that is dire to humanity. From a civilian point of view, it’s easy to see why people want to use these gifts so much and why countries around the world are so willing to integrate these into the workings of their countries. I guess its human nature that they will believe everything that someone will say if that person appears to be benign to them and at the same able to help the race advance.ZaShuNina’s second personality was revealed near the end of the series and was anything but benign and indeed was a personality that I didn’t really expect him to have. In this personality which I would imagine is his true nature ZashuNina in a departure from his first personality is a calculating, determined and ruthless person that’s also deceitful and well versed at subterfuge. While his initial personality can be described to be that of a child this new personality can be seen to be that of an adult and a scheming one as well. In this personality ZashuNina is very determined to enact his own master plan and his own designs for humanity even if it meant that it will cost them dearly in terms of life. Indeed, from ZashuNina’s initial personality only his hunger for knowledge which can be said to be his prominent trait is transferred from that personality to this one. In the beginning of the series though I did have suspicions that ZaShuNina would be the main villain for the series the gradual transformation from a benign alien that was seen as a great inventor by humanity to a villain that was dead set on uplifting humanity so that they can provide him with knowledge was so unexpected that it shook even me.The character of ZaShuNina I felt was a really interesting character and made a pretty good villain for the series. The character of ZaShuNina I felt was a very well-designed character that underwent great changes in his behavior and personality as the series went on. Indeed, the changes were such that it’s almost as if there actually two people that have the same name but yet differing personalities in them. Due to this it was not easy to see what his motivations and aims were in the series until his true plan was revealed which I think was the point of this.  I felt that Takuma Terashima really did an excellent job of portraying the character of ZaShuNina and that this character contributed greatly to how excellent this story was.Kanata ShinawaKanata Shinawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Kugimiya is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Shindou and Saraka’s allies in the series. A genius level scientist that works at one of the many research labs that the government manages and oversees Kanata is despite her young age an excellent scientist that apart from being smart is also hyperactive and positive and indeed can spend her days researching new things without a care in the world. Though eccentric and tending to get way too immersed in her analysis’s Kanata is someone that is more than willing to help others if the request itself is something that hasn’t been done before. Kanata is someone that loves to challenge the unknown. While certainly eccentric and easily excited Kanata’s main personality trait is her determination to figure out and determine how something actually works and when combined with her childish wonder at new things this is something that actually makes her pretty endearing. While representing the science side of the story Kanata due to her positive nature is also able to cheer people up with her attitude which I felt was pretty funny to see. Though young it can be seen that her superiors and fellow scientists at the lab trust her immensely due to her intellect and determined nature. Though only a support character I felt that Rie Kugimiya really did a great job at portraying the character of Kanata and that she brought not just intelligence but also determination to the field that proves that human intelligence is also something that should not be underestimated.Arts and animationWith regards to the art that was used for this series I felt that the environments that used and shown in the series was pretty well done with the interior of Kado being especially impressive. The character designs for the characters in this series I felt was also pretty well done with ZaShuNina’s design despite taking the form of a human also looked like a hybrid that’s between a human and an alien. The other environments such as Haneda airport, the Diet building and Saraka and Shindou’s home towns I felt were also well done. With regards to the animation because this series isn’t actually a true action anime the animation in the series is focused more on the showing of how the gifts actually work which I felt was well done and showed just how powerful they were. It wasn’t until much later in the series that the anime featured combat scenes and I felt that these were done pretty well especially the fights between Saraka and ZaShuNina and the final fight in the end.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening and ending themes for the series being especially strong. The opening theme for the series which was called Tabiji was sung by the character of Saraka Tsukai through her seiyuu Mao Ichimichi and I felt that this song along with its visuals did a pretty good job of setting the mood for the series while also showing the evolution of humanity through its visuals. The ending theme for this series which was called Eien No Kotae which was sung by Haruca had a more positive tone to it that for some reason had a calming presence to it. Individual scene music I felt was pretty well done throughout the series.Voice actingVoice acting for the series I felt was excellent throughout the series with each of the characters that were featured in the series being portrayed to the best of their respective seiyuu’s ability. In particular the characters of Koujirou Shindou, Saraka Tsukai and Yaha Kui ZaShuNina who were portrayed by Hiroaki Miura, Mao Ichimichi and Takuma Terashima respectively I felt did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. In addition the characters of Kanata, Takumi Gonnou and the Japanese prime minister Kouzou Inutaba who was portrayed by Rie Kugimiya, Takuya Kirimoto and Hiroshi Naka I felt also did a great job portraying their characters.Overall conclusionIn overall, I thought that Kado the right answer as it is called in the west was a pretty good anime that was actually interesting and indeed was something that really surprised me because it provoked a lot of interesting questions into the world that we live in. it’s not every day that an anime would feature so many real-world questions and challenges inside it though and use that as part of its main plot. The strong points that made Kado the right answer such an excellent anime in my opinion was its interesting theme and the fact that it made use of real world problems as part of it, strong story that provoked questions about the current world, excellent characters, Excellent animation and voice acting.First thing to address is the theme of the show. The main theme of the show apart from contact with an alien race also lies inside the realm of negotiation and diplomacy. At the same time, another thing that was part of this series theme was the gifts that the main villain provided that was designed to help humanity as a race overcome some of the challenges that they currently face. The inclusion of real world problems like energy, time and transporting objects I felt was really interesting and the way that it was revealed to humanity was both intelligent and well done as the thought that any of the three problems that beset them and limit them can be dealt with these gifts will surely find a lot of people who is willing to use them. The main theme of this series however is undoubtedly that of diplomacy and negotiation which I felt was interesting and was a well-designed move on the creator’s part. In animes that feature contact with beings from either parallel dimension such as this one or aliens from other planets or galaxies the line largely lies with either fighting a war to defend the planet or forcefully integrate their resources into your own race with diplomacy largely being ignored or at least seeing limited use. As such it was actually pretty refreshing to see that this anime’s main theme while also dealing with aliens makes use of diplomacy as its main theme. Though like most people I have limited knowledge on the concept of diplomacy and negotiation I felt that depiction that negotiation is built on a degree of trust that was shown between Shindou and ZashuNina was really well done. Watching the two of them gradually learn about each other and at the same time cooperate to create gifts that would benefit humanity as a race while also forging a bond built on trust was something that was nice to see and begs the question why isn’t this concept used more in anime. I felt that the diplomacy side of things in the anime was pretty well done and was a pretty accurate portrayal of how negotiations between parties actually take place even though this party to which Saraka and Shindou talk with is far from anything that both have encountered in their careers. A real game changer there lol.The overall story of the series is another strong point and was one that I felt was done really well. In line with the main theme of the series the overall storyline focuses on first the introduction of the alien being to the world via his most dramatic entrance on to the planet by literally landing on one of Japan’s busiest airports followed by his gradual reveal of what he was and what he represented. The gradual evolution of ZaShuNina’s role from that of an unknown life form to that of a major celebrity and then to his reveal of the gifts that he is willing to gift to humanity I felt was pretty well done.  The concept of using the relationship that he has forged with the government of japan and use this to determine the challenges that face the race as a whole I felt was interesting and played alone with the theme of diplomacy as diplomacy and negotiation is always focused on understanding what the other party needs and providing what they want versus what you yourself want from the. The gradual transformation of this relationship as well as ZaShuNina as a character I felt was pretty well done. Arguably the transformation of ZaShuNina from a benign alien being to one that proved to be a scheming and manipulative alien being that had his own nefarious plan was also well done as was the twist of Saraka’s identity as well. Indeed, transformation and twists also changed the dynamic of the story near the end but in a good way I think. One thing about the overall story that really interested me though was the fact that ZaShuNina’s entrance and the effects that he has is not limited to Japan on its own and indeed affects humanity as a whole. As a result, when deciding on his next moves ZaShuNina and Shindou had to consider the larger effects that bind the world namely its structure. In the world that we live in its easy to see that even as a race humanity is not united entity and that we are divided in both culture, countries and borders that are unique to each country. Though logically it can be said that ZaShuNina and Shindou could have used international organisations like the UN to get the gifts to the people of various countries there also lies the next problem. Humanity as a race is as diverse as a rainbow that while also giving us strength and unity also creates problems like greed and control and points to the fact can these governments and organisations really get the gifts to the people and not hog them for themselves. Its issues like this that really make the story worth investing in as it provokes some really interesting views on the world that we live in. With regards to this question I loved how they actually ended up bypassing them entirely and solving the problem their way.  The true purpose and plan of ZaShuNina’s however doesn’t come into play until much later in the series but it was done in such a way that it really could be said to be one of the best twists that I seen in an anime for a long time. The clash of ideas and convictions that served as the main plot in that part of the series I felt was pretty well done and loved how Saraka and Shindou’s relationship as well as their shared beliefs were used as the main plot here. The clash of ideas between them and ZaShuNina was something that I was looking forward too and was something that was excellently done.There are a number of things that I felt really stood out in this series with the first being how well thought out and how well executed both the twists in the story and the plans to counter them were created. A great example of the latter is the last plan that Shindou and Saraka used to finally put a stop to ZaShuNina in the end. The thought that they had made use of the same tech that he himself had created for his plan to engineer his destruction was funny and had no small amount of irony to it as well. The ending fight which led into the ending itself I felt was pretty well done and demonstrated the fact that when humanity and the anisotropic being work together they can even beat someone as formidable as ZaShuNina. Though the cost of victory was indeed high I felt that as a race humanity can still learn to advance but at a suitable pace and not losing sight of what makes them human.It’s been a while since I seen an anime that in addition to having an excellent theme and story as well as excellent characters and voice acting was able to provoke some really interesting questions that I had never once thought off.  All in all, Kado the right answer was really one of the best animes for this season because it was intelligent and made use of real world issues in a way that only served to enhance its main plot line. The core lesson for Kado the right answer is naturally that while advancement in tech is important whats more important that that is that we should never lose sight of our own unique identity that makes us human when doing it. And probably not trust every alien that shows up on the planet as well.', ""Seikaisuru Kado - I have now seen up to episode 03Premise: An other dimensional being of un-fathomed & seemingly exponential unlimited power & of great technology arrives in Japan to offer humanity the perfect opportunity to grow.The Evolution -Promoted is a progressive proposal for mankind - to value compassion & sharing (heart/good) - to grow.To accomplish such, a unification of all, end conflict - needs that require fulfilling:0.

I didn't expect this anime would have been as good as it was and at least for the first 75% of the series I thought the show was very consistent.The way how the story was constructed along with its premise, allowed the show to have a great base from where the story could go in a multitude of directions. The direction the show eventually went wasn't one that I personally got a lot of satisfaction from but it was still to the point where...overall the anime still felt enjoyable.The art is a blend between 2D/3D and surprisingly I thought that it was handled extremely well.

Adult demographic SF with emphasis on concepts; more talk than action.  Art for alien parts is eye-candy; terrestrial, ordinary, at least by comparison.  Characters have actual character but it's too soon to know what if any development will occur.  I have some concerns about the alien being too powerful and too benevolent, but further plot developments may put  twists into the initial situation -- I like what I've seen so much that an original twist or two might even be in store....(By 'original' I mean not something like a simple good/bad flip.) (By 'original' I mean not something like a simple good/bad flip.)"", 'Note: This review contains spoilers. Also, don\'t pay too much attention to the rating I gave here.Negotiation. Getting what\'s in your interest is the goal of negotiations. But defeating your opponent and temporarily gaining what you want will always come back to bite you in the long term. What\'s best for you is giving both parties something in their interest. That sounds easy, but it\'s extremely difficult in fact.There isn\'t just one answer, for one thing. We aren\'t God. We\'ll never know what was right and what was the right answer for our whole life. But, even if we don\'t know, we just have to...keep looking.Seikaisuru Kado features Kojirou Shindo, a Japanese negotiator working for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, encountering Yaha-kui zaShunina, a godlike existence presented as an anisotropic being coming from outside the universe. Thematically speaking, this series is about the meeting of two existences (Humans and Anisotropic being), two different levels of technology, from how will try to interact with each other up to how one existence will influence the other.On the one hand, there is Humanity being confronted to an upper being, overwhelmed by the technology of the anisotropic they get their hand on with zaShunina\'s offerings on multiple levels. On the other hand, there is zaShunina, representing the anisotropic beings, is interested in Humans and all the information they represent, being their mean of communicating, how they react due to his appearance, and try to act as a human to understand them (4th episode when he\'s reading for example). It\'s revealed he\'s trying to give humans a sense of the anisotropic also for his own good.The premise of Seikaisuru Kado is attractive due to its attempt to confront both parts on an ideological debate rather than a threatening approach. At first, the story depicts how Shindo acts as a negotiator between zaShunina and humanity since he agrees with zaShunina\'s goal of making the mankind advance. He ends up becoming the representative of the anisotropic being to present and rephrase zaShunina\'s idea for the rest of the world so that a mutual understanding can be set up.The first part of the show (~8 episodes) resolves around mankind confronted to the discovery of new and unknown technologies. But getting your hand on a new technology ain\'t that simple, and especially with an unknown one. It makes you raise questions as the legitimacy of using it (Tools ain\'t good or evil, only their users are. Should we change the society to rely on something we don\'t understand yet?), its impact on the world, be it at an economical level (with the Wam), or at a societal and psychological level (with the Sansa).Confronting to those questions, three points of view are depicted between zaShunina, Shindo and Saraka. zaShunina believes that accepting those technologies and spreading them as soon as possible is the right answer. Tsukai Saraka is totally opposed to zaShunina\'s ideology as she believes humans should progress ""naturally"", by themselves, and not by forcing it. Humanity have to be ready to accept such an evolution. Between the two of them lies Shindo. He\'s not opposed to a sudden evolution of the world. As a negotiator, he seeks what should benefit humans. He weights up the pros and cons and act on what he thinks to be the best solution. In episode 0, he proves himself [to us] to be able to solve a problem by suggesting an idea leading to a better outcome, and that he doesn\'t fear the concept of evolution.Media is also a strong element in this first part as it\'s present as the tool to bypass governments decisions (be it with the Japanese conference or Setten) by letting the people made their own choice. It\'s a tool praised by zaShunina himself as he believed that everyone should think for themselves as what\'s supposed to be good or evil. Media happened to have a greater influence than politicians since it\'s the way they used to ""force"" the knowledge to spread regardless of the governments\' will. (As an aside, the first episode of Black Mirror gave an interesting idea of the impact of media.)The second part of the show (eps 9-12) is about zaShunina being influenced by humans and how his interested got redirected from mankind to Shindo. zaShunina being more and more human is not something unusual since it already started some episodes ago. In addition to act as one, zaShunina displayed emotions since the end of the 6th episodes, be it with its facial expressions who changed from its original stern one and the use of obscure concepts such as like and dislike (episode 7). The last episode completely confirms this change with zaShunina being sad, angry and surprised (and even the two last ones at the same time), etc. I wouldn\'t go so far as to say zaShunina got corrupted by human\'s nature, but the fact its personality changed in contact to Shindo and him looking disinterested from humanity gaining a sense of the anisotropic is what made this second part interesting.While the first part of the show was about mankind interacting with an anisotropic being, the second is focused on Shindo confronting zaShunina as individuals. zaShunina beaks off the talks with Shindo when he refuses to come with him to the anisotropic. Shindo is no longer a negotiator between the humans and the anisotropic being, but the one zaShunina was showing affection and the one he wanted to bring outside the universe. As for Shindo, zaShunina ain\'t simply an anisotropic being, but a friend for him. A friend he will put his life on the line to try to correct him or else, he will stay in the wrong. Their confrontation represents both their disagreement as individuals/friends (or more for zaShunina) and as an anisotropic being and a human negotiator.In episode 10, it is mentioned the problem lied in zaShunina wanting to reach the one right answer with humanity by bringing them to the anisotropic so they won\'t die (as a species) billion years latter while the humans won\'t accept to perform such a sacrifice because it\'s also a part of a human life to live the best they can in the time they are given. Similarly to episode 0, Shindo ends up satisfying the two parts by proving the two existences could evolve in a way zaShunina didn\'t even consider.In the end, with the disappearance of zaShunina along with Kado, the anisotropic technology stop working. It\'s also a warning about the backlash of wanting to rely on something you don\'t master or develop yourself as the question was raised earlier. To complete the conclusion of this story, the series ends up explaining what matters the most is to know you can  still advance farther and to set a goal to lead your way.Seikaisuru Kado got its pros and cons. You may not like how the story turned out, especially for the second part and the twist they choose to do. Still, this series was worth being watched for all the thematics it grasped even if a lot of idea could have been more developed.Seikaisuru Kado doesn\'t provide the right answer, it makes yourself pondering at what the right answer should be for all the problem it raises.

What started off as a beautiful political journey pushed by science and philosophy, within episodes became generic and predictable.Story: 4As said before, the story idea and story itself were fantastic. The pace was perfect - not too slow to bore us, but not to fast to make us super confused. There were many new terms used, but, for the most part, were explained in a way that was easy to understand, or simply didn't take away from the overall experience. Each episode was a joy - wanting to know what would...take place next; what would the media do? how would the UN react? would the people revolt to the changes? e.t.c Really, there was so much potential to be had in the story.But then episode 9 came, and all was lost. Was it because they had to rush? - after all, it was an original which had no manga or novel as a true backbone. Maybe they thought the viewers would prefer it this way. Perhaps it was a matter of one person placing their terrible ideas on the table. I don't know, but I do know that the result was devastating. Politics? Gone. The people and their opinions? Gone. The influence of the media? Gone. Subliminal philosophy which made you think regardless of whether you wanted to or not? Gone.  All the amazing things that have been built up until now? Absolutely gone; disappeared. Or, rather, replaced. And by utterly predictable 'romance' and the generic tropes one would expect of an 'arrival sci-fi', caused by one annoying 'girl' who feels the world should be dictated by herself and herself alone.Art:10Actually outstanding. The art was magical. Toei really outdid themselves here. Managing to mix 3D and 2D in such a smooth, barely noticeable way, the animation style was new and fresh. The character designs were easy on the eyes and this quality remained constant throughout the whole anime. The use of patterns and symmetry in both the OP, anime and ED, was incredibly fitting - it really evoked a sense of the 'anisotropic' and of incomprehensible, alien thoughts. Honest kudos to the studio here - it was breath taking. A shame that the latter part of the story put it to waste.Sound: 8Again, magical. The timing has been great, regardless of what point in the plot we were in. I can't remember anything particularly spell-binding, or so perfectly suitable to the animation that it made me repeat said scene several times. The OP and ED were the same as the overall art - made in such a way to not use actual human languages or words, but to simply evoke ideas using music.Character: 5And here we are, at last. Shindo - the negotiator who stood between the anisotropic and humanity('universe'). He was essentially a translator for everything, but was also our eyes into the world as he was always the first to see the new items brought to humanity. Shindo was an interesting character; he wasn't made to be anything special and had the nice balance of being a human and being a calm, collected government official. His relationship with Shu(zaShunina) was most intriguing to watch - it was clearly a mutual adoration; Shindo was interested in the anistortopic and Shu was interested in Shindo himself who he walked side-by-side with in the advancement of humanity. It was made very easy to see why these two were put together as a 'team' - they have a nice dynamic and would honestly be interesting to watch together regardless of setting.Shu, himself, was an interesting specimen. He's treated like a baby or a sheltered person, who has all the knowledge in the world, but no actual experience to go with it(note; babies don't have all the knowledge in the world, but he's like a baby in that he's new to the world). It's a joy to see his stoic expression and general countenance fade to smiles and expressions fitting what he was actually feeling. We know that he reads books to enable him to understand human culture more, which, again, has influence on his expressions and actions. The cool thing with his arms were also nice - adding a feature to outwardly show how different he was to the world. Shu was a great character. Towards the end, I didn't like where his character alignment was going, as he had to switch roles for the sake of plot convenience. However, he still remained a nice character - he learnt even more emotions, made his motivations clear, e.t.c This adorable anisotropic creature really was the biggest delight of the series for me.And then we have Tsukai Saraka, the generic-creator. Honestly, Saraka would've made a far better side-character. Her motivations were sound; her actual personality was believable; seeing how she balanced family and her tsundere-like nature with her work personality was fine. What wasn't okay, however, was what she did to the plot. Honestly, this character single-handedly turned what was amazing and unique into a pile of generic tropes and predictability. What should've been Shindo and Shu, the representations of humanity and the anisotropic, getting to know and understand each other and their values, in turn helping each other develop and advance like in a symbiotic relationship, turned into something else entirely. Saraka would've worked far better as the simple human girl with simple, straightforward, human values, contrasting with that of Shindo's and Shu's, who wouldn't get her way because the plot would be far more flavourful that way.Lastly, the actual side characters. They do well to fuel the plot, from the Prime Minister to the childish scientist( whom everyone seemed to hate for some reason which eludes me). They were believable, yes, including the childish scientist, who mirrors actual scientists, and honestly didn't cause any discrepancies.Enjoyment: 6Again, my enjoyment greatly deteriorated as more episodes passed by, due to the absolute 180 in plot and genres. However, everything else was still mostly great, so I couldn't lower my score that much.Overall: 6.66 was probably too harsh considering it only had one terrible factor, and 7 was too high because of that said terrible factor, so no rounding done here. The anime was - has been - a joy, for the most part. It was simply pulled down by the last few episodes, which are currently influencing my review the most. I haven't finished yet, and there is the possibility that my score will change depending on how this goes(hopefully it'll be higher because I don't want to leave this anime bitter). I definitely recommend watching this, however be prepared for the utter drop in story quality towards eps 8-10 at the least.Also, forgive my typos, I was too lazy to re-read. take place next; what would the media do? how would the UN react? would the people revolt to the changes? e.t.c Really, there was so much potential to be had in the story.But then episode 9 came, and all was lost.

The anime so far looks interesting. I think the CG in the anime is great for non-living things but human animation is still jerky and robotic. But i think its a lot better than other anime with CG like the recent Berserk.The differences between the hollywood movie ""The Arrival"" and the anime is the shape/form of the technology the alien species transfer. In the movie the alien gifts humans a language that can alter time and stuff where as in the anime it is more of a solid tangible looking thing called...Kado.Overall the anime looks very interesting and the art is superb especially the fractals in the Kado technology. I think we should watch this anime. I watched till episode 3 and my score for this anime is 9/10. 9 because of the slightly lame looking animated people.

Maybe they\'d hire more auteur directors, try original story concepts or do something to aim for a new crowd that wouldn\'t previously enjoy their work. That was likely the thought of Toei Animation, when in addition to their successes with Dragon Ball Super and the juggernaut One Piece, they decided to create Kado- The Right Answer, an all CGI original sci fi series having debates about such complex topics such as the ethics of humanity and how prepared they would be for sudden...instantaneous advancements in technology. This wasn\'t Toei\'s first time doing this. They released the widely beloved Mononoke series which felt above the norm, and to my knowledge 2013\'s Kyousou Giga was considered to be an overlooked classic as well. However for Kado, it feels like it was so close to establishing its identity and maturity firmly, only for that potential to be wasted and lead into something annoyingly typical.SPOILERS AHEAD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDThe plot, although not the most original at first glance, starts seeming to come into its own. A giant shiny multicolored cube falls from the sky onto an airport about to take off, including two workers with skill in diplomacy, for which Episode 0 established:Kojirou Shindou and Shuuhei Asano. We start by seeing the government of Japan trying to handle this foreign presence of the cube and then by seeing those trapped inside it interacting with the being naming itself Yaha-kui zaShunina, which would later be called the Anisotropic for convenience. Later on we get to meet more characters, including skilled foreign diplomat Tsukai Saraka, Japan\'s prime minister, news reporters and Kanata Shinawa, an eccentric scientist girl who understands the alien technology the most. While not the most concrete characterization, they seem to work fine for this portion of the story, as it becomes all about seeing these diverse reactions and showing how these mature people see the different suggestions the alien brings up to advance humanity\'s functions. The people would be of greater understanding of each other and the universe regardless of what choice they picked. The story, while not that investing, seemed atypical and fairly grounded and mature despite the supernatural entity. Does it continue these ideas it set forth until the end of the show though? Not exactly.......See, at around the halfway point, Saraka snaps out of her professional attitude to have a Tsundere moment that main character Shindou brings up and it\'s at this point when things start to fall into typical anime-ness. A few more moments like this come up, we get some comedy involving a festival episode and then Saraka goes on a massive speech on why humanity is amazing  and the world is amazing and that everyone is perfect! This was the point where I lost faith in the show. It made it seem like this professional diplomat character turned into a typical over-idealized anime heroine, saying things that felt contradictory to the morally gray nature of certain debates earlier. That\'s not the only thing that happens though. The anisotropic itself goes from wanting to and considering collaboration with humanity and technology to.....wanting to backstab the main character and absorb all of humanity for his own goals. Not only does this completely go against any attempt at character development the conversations might\'ve had earlier, but combined with Saraka\'s over idealistic speech completely ruins their sense of moral ambiguity we saw previously for the past 7-8 episodes or so.Then, in an unexpected twist with zero buildup, Saraka ALSO turns out to be an alien, the simple bonding relationship between her and Shindou turns into a love which lacks the proper pacing in itself, and Shindou and zaShunina have a punching battle which ends in the death of Shindou, the defeat of the alien and more idealistic speeches about humanity. Therefore, we end our Seinen story with a climax that wouldn\'t be out of place in your average battle Shonen.This feels contradictory to the intentions from the beginning. If your idea is to create a unique product that will stand out from the genericness that seems to overtake the market, why decide to take the cliche route out anyways? It\'s like if an elegant ice skater near the end of his routine decided to swap out from rollerblades, slipping on a loose banana peel and falling flat on his face. Kado\'s overall execution simply comes off as ineffective at best and extremely jarring at worst. With the intriguing concepts so much time was put into meaning very little by the end of it, Kado feels like a wasted effort on the story front. Too much time was spent on the mature debating to accept the high tension stakes of the climax, so when a character you appreciate literally has his life on the line, you\'d like him, but not care enough to that extent that we\'re concerned for his safety in an actual fight we\'d not seen animated before.That said, as far as animation goes, it was actually one of the show\'s greatest strengths. Yes, including the CGI. Many have often seen CGI animation as an unfortunate crutch, especially when it comes to anime, with the new Berserk adaptation being one of the standout examples of its badness. However, this show not only decides to not have excessive movements with the CGI, but use it to convey the slight movements and body language of those in arbitration in a faster way than traditional animation. And unlike say, Ajin, the frame rate didn\'t feel too fast for its own good, so the choppiness that could\'ve been there was not. The best part of the animation though, was the background art inside the Kado itself. With the liquid gold exterior and the many different shapes formed, the director was allowed a lot of perspective shots to sell the out-there nature of the series. That said, if the show ever reverts back to 2D animation....it looks BAD, like, really choppy and generic looking. Still, the good outweighs the bad and the animation overall benefited the series.The sound...didn\'t really do it either way. The OP was nice, the ED was nice, and background music was functional but unmemorable. Moving on to the biggest disappointment, the characters.The main character,  Kojirou Shindo, is the one who gets the most screentime and has the overall importance. He\'s a skilled debator who ends up siding with the anisotropic in his goals to advance humanity\'s nature. While it is interesting to see why he continues to side with the alien for every debate topic that comes up in the early episode, the ""bromance"" there felt like it happened too fast for me to fully buy. Agreeing with the alien was one thing, but siding with it for every possible option felt like an extreme. Still, he\'s the character we get to know the best and most of his decisions are shown fairly well in context. We like him enough? Sure. Do we care about him enough that his DEATH could leave an impact? Not to that extent, the story of Kado didn\'t feel like it was building up to such a thing. Character death was such a foreign concept, and the show seemed to favor logical over emotional. The character\'s resolution is sound but the full extent of the story does him about as much harm as good.The alien zaShunina also started off the story fairly interesting. With an ever growing view of humanity and technology could benefit or hinder humanity\'s potential depending on its use, it was interesting to see him propose his morally gray views, rather than simply wanting to take over the world and eliminate humanity. Sadly, that\'s exactly what the final quarter of the series ends up doing. His betrayal of Shindou makes it too easy for the audience to choose to go against him, and his final scene has him too easily see the positiveness of humans and have a typical villain angry face breakdown scene. Therefore a possibly interesting and deep character was turned into your average everyday bad guy.Even with him though, easily the character most affected by this change in tone and direction is Tsukai Saraka. I already mentioned before how her Tsundere moment was the first crack in its foundation of something above the norm, but it\'s even more jarring if you consider her largely professional position and debating skills seen prior. Sure, you could argue that the Tsundere moment was to show she had more sides to her than just her professional life, but you start seeing more and more of these moments, as well as her speech about why humanity is special and amazing and start to lose faith in that confident and mature image. The show near its end tried to build an ever lasting romance between her and Shindou which....really doesn\'t work. They did know each other very early on in the series, but at that point, they were mature negotiators who collaborated in their field of work, not lovers. The transition to this could\'ve been handled far worse but still feels too far out of left field to care about. Even when her insane faith makes more sense with the twist of her true identity, it felt unnecessary, and in the last three episodes her character takes steps too drastic from the first nine episodes. Saraka is probably my biggest disappointment in the show, particularly for the fact that they tried to force a Renton/Eureka esque romance in a show or place where it didn\'t belong and mean little to her professional foundation.As for everyone else? Well, there ARE other characters, like the aforementioned quirky scientist girl, Japan\'s Prime Minister, News Reporters, and other high diplomatic from other countries, but in the end, everything comes down to these three and the rest don\'t have a lasting impact. We never get to see the end goal of their views because of the forced tonal change of the ending. Even Shuuhei Asano, who seemed like he would be an interesting character at the start as Shindou\'s partner, devolved to running away and crying without doing anything that felt substantial compared to his partner. It\'s sad how much the story\'s alternate direction sacrifices the foundation of so many characters for the sake of hasty rewrites.END OF SPOILERSIn the end, the way Kado ultimately played out was like a massive disappointment with a sudden and out of place payoff that I didn\'t expect, want, or ask for. So much that was built up, debated, and foreshadowed meant nothing but idealistic schmaltz. I might\'ve gained something from the show if it didn\'t awkwardly switch tracks near the end and kept up the debate angle, but despite trying to stand out, all it did was shoot itself in the foot to become another forgettable title that won\'t be remembered over the next few years quite so fondly. instantaneous advancements in technology. This wasn\'t Toei\'s first time doing this. They released the widely beloved Mononoke series which felt above the norm, and to my knowledge 2013\'s Kyousou Giga was considered to be an overlooked classic as well. However for Kado, it feels like it was so close to establishing its identity and maturity firmly, only for that potential to be wasted and lead into something annoyingly typical.SPOILERS AHEAD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDThe plot, although not the most original at first glance, starts seeming to come into its own. A giant shiny multicolored cube falls from the sky onto an airport about to take off, including two workers with skill in diplomacy, for which Episode 0 established:Kojirou Shindou and Shuuhei Asano. We start by seeing the government of Japan trying to handle this foreign presence of the cube and then by seeing those trapped inside it interacting with the being naming itself Yaha-kui zaShunina, which would later be called the Anisotropic for convenience. Later on we get to meet more characters, including skilled foreign diplomat Tsukai Saraka, Japan\'s prime minister, news reporters and Kanata Shinawa, an eccentric scientist girl who understands the alien technology the most. While not the most concrete characterization, they seem to work fine for this portion of the story, as it becomes all about seeing these diverse reactions and showing how these mature people see the different suggestions the alien brings up to advance humanity\'s functions. The people would be of greater understanding of each other and the universe regardless of what choice they picked. The story, while not that investing, seemed atypical and fairly grounded and mature despite the supernatural entity. Does it continue these ideas it set forth until the end of the show though? Not exactly.......See, at around the halfway point, Saraka snaps out of her professional attitude to have a Tsundere moment that main character Shindou brings up and it\'s at this point when things start to fall into typical anime-ness. A few more moments like this come up, we get some comedy involving a festival episode and then Saraka goes on a massive speech on why humanity is amazing  and the world is amazing and that everyone is perfect! This was the point where I lost faith in the show. It made it seem like this professional diplomat character turned into a typical over-idealized anime heroine, saying things that felt contradictory to the morally gray nature of certain debates earlier. That\'s not the only thing that happens though. The anisotropic itself goes from wanting to and considering collaboration with humanity and technology to.....wanting to backstab the main character and absorb all of humanity for his own goals. Not only does this completely go against any attempt at character development the conversations might\'ve had earlier, but combined with Saraka\'s over idealistic speech completely ruins their sense of moral ambiguity we saw previously for the past 7-8 episodes or so.Then, in an unexpected twist with zero buildup, Saraka ALSO turns out to be an alien, the simple bonding relationship between her and Shindou turns into a love which lacks the proper pacing in itself, and Shindou and zaShunina have a punching battle which ends in the death of Shindou, the defeat of the alien and more idealistic speeches about humanity. Therefore, we end our Seinen story with a climax that wouldn\'t be out of place in your average battle Shonen.This feels contradictory to the intentions from the beginning. If your idea is to create a unique product that will stand out from the genericness that seems to overtake the market, why decide to take the cliche route out anyways? It\'s like if an elegant ice skater near the end of his routine decided to swap out from rollerblades, slipping on a loose banana peel and falling flat on his face. Kado\'s overall execution simply comes off as ineffective at best and extremely jarring at worst. With the intriguing concepts so much time was put into meaning very little by the end of it, Kado feels like a wasted effort on the story front. Too much time was spent on the mature debating to accept the high tension stakes of the climax, so when a character you appreciate literally has his life on the line, you\'d like him, but not care enough to that extent that we\'re concerned for his safety in an actual fight we\'d not seen animated before.That said, as far as animation goes, it was actually one of the show\'s greatest strengths. Yes, including the CGI. Many have often seen CGI animation as an unfortunate crutch, especially when it comes to anime, with the new Berserk adaptation being one of the standout examples of its badness. However, this show not only decides to not have excessive movements with the CGI, but use it to convey the slight movements and body language of those in arbitration in a faster way than traditional animation. And unlike say, Ajin, the frame rate didn\'t feel too fast for its own good, so the choppiness that could\'ve been there was not. The best part of the animation though, was the background art inside the Kado itself. With the liquid gold exterior and the many different shapes formed, the director was allowed a lot of perspective shots to sell the out-there nature of the series. That said, if the show ever reverts back to 2D animation....it looks BAD, like, really choppy and generic looking. Still, the good outweighs the bad and the animation overall benefited the series.The sound...didn\'t really do it either way. The OP was nice, the ED was nice, and background music was functional but unmemorable.

The story is exquisite, the characters are for the most part very likeable, the CG is eye candy and the soundtrack both for the opening/ending and for the ost of the anime is honestly amazing.Initially, I was a bit thrown off by the CG in the anime but the art style blended it in quite well so it's easy to lose sight of it. The animations for the humans are still quite robotic in comparison for the animation used for Kado and other non-living things. Which I do admit is rather frustrating at times but it...does not take away my enjoyment of the series.The plot itself is rather unique for an anime, this sense of diplomacy and formality gives a breath of fresh air to many anime viewers such as myself. It's refreshing to see an anime which does not feature teenagers in a High School. This storyline is currently making you question humanity as a whole with its various array of questions and choices. Definitely check out this anime is deep stories are your style.TLDR; This anime's plot, art, soundtrack and characters are amazing.

It managed to raise my expectations extremely high for the better first half- and then it took all of its amazing potential and shattered it. I stopped at episode 10 after seeing the impending train wreck and decided to read summaries of the last two instead of wasting time.As a science fiction fan who enjoys the like of Arthur C. Clark and Frank Herbert, the beginning concepts for this anime were right up my alley. They even seemed a bit new - at least, they were something I'd...never seen before. The nature of this series seemed very fresh on the anime scene, breaking a lot of predictability. At least, that's what it seemed it was doing until it totally destroyed the integrity of the entire first half of the show by doing a 180 with its theme and becoming unbearably predictable and shallow (Not really that shallow compared to a lot of anime. Even with its disappointment at the end, it's a decent anime altogether, it's simply the sheer amount of potential this anime wastes that causes me to dislike it particularly.) People who have seen this show - you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.This 180 is the sole thing that ruined the anime for me - a big thing. Other things relating to the overall production seemed decent. I'm not a fan of the animation style, but it's surprisingly easy to get used to.Overall, unless you want to be incredibly disappointed, STOP this anime around episode 8. Duck out while it's still good. Play with the ideas it's presented. If you really like this show from episode 8 and prior, 9 and onward will be nothing more than depressing. never seen before.

This is why Kado came in like a welcome breath of classic air, bringing up the interesting questions that the genre is well-known for.Being interesting alone was however not enough to make this series great.We start our journey of interdimensional exploration with some rather slow pacing, sometimes used well to flesh out characters, other times to waste an episode on watching the futuristic paint dry. Yet it keeps you hooked by introducing crazy concepts, such as...what might happen if humanity was given brand new life-changing technologies. Sadly, it only scratches the surface of its own premise, seemingly more interested in just raising questions instead of actually exploring them. The effects these new technologies are having on humanity are never shown.With more episodes this series could've done much more. Heck, with better planning and pacing the series already had the potential to do more. What it all boils down to is one question, should humanity try to advance faster, or should it take its time to get wherever it's going? Despite a flashy and crazy climax, the anime predictably enough seems to lean for a more conservative and cliché answer, one that wastes the story's potential.If I were to praise Kado for anything, it would be on the technical side. It managed to successfully blend 2D animation and CGI in a way that didn't make my eyes want to flee in terror, which is quite the feat.While not great, I can't say I regret watching Kado, since it was different from most anime being made today. My hopes would be that this could encourage more stories with complex ideas in the future, but with more polish. what might happen if humanity was given brand new life-changing technologies.

It started of with a lot of these deeper, philosophic questions about humanity and ends with well... something quite different.The final episode was horribly rushed and the ending was very unsatisfying. I don't want to give it away but the way the Main Characters story finished was just very anticlimactic.Art:This anime uses a lot of CG, especially for its characters. If you're really bothered by this then it might bother you in this show as well.For me however it worked very well, the CGI was obvious but it was executed in a way that it didn't feel out of place at all. If this is the future of CGI in anime then I'm up for it.There were a lot of beautiful wide shots of Kado and its surroundings in this show, especiall the proportions of Kado in comparison with other objects was handled exceptionally. It really felt huge. The inside of Kado was also designed beautifully and was one of the highlights of the show from an artistic point of view.The character designs weren't anything that special, but I think that was the point, it was a show that was set in reality so everybody looks like an ordinary person, except for the anisotropic being whose design I really enjoyed.Sound:The soundtrack of Seikaisuru Kado was a highlight of this show. The opening and also the ending were just awesome. Especially the opening, I never skipped this one. Though in general the OST was quite good. It added a lot to the series and made a lot of moments feel bigger.Characters:Shindou, KoujiroShindou is the protagonist of Kado, he's a negotiator for the Japanese Government and the person who also negotiates with the anisotropic being.He's a very likeable and interesting guy, worthy of being a protagonist. His interactions with his co-worker Hanamori would've been enough for me to watch a slice-of-life show with them just doing their negotiations.He goes through some interesting character development over the course of this show, I just wish the end of his story arc wouldn't have been so anti-climactic.Yaha-kui zaShuninaThe anisotropic being who wants to  advance humanity. His deisgn was great and I really liked the concepts of the anisotropic he brought to this world. He was a very interesting and mysterious character right until the final episodes. It was interesting to see him change due to the influence humanity had on him.Tsukai, SarakaThe female lead of this show. At first she felt a little out of place in this show. Her typical anime antics just didn't fit with the otherwise serious world of Seikaisuru Kado. But she was a nice and sweet girl and she grew on me. It was interesting to see her become so important later on.Enjoyment:Overall I'm a bit disappointed with this show. I really enjoyed everything until the twist and was ready to rate this 9/10. But the twist of this show first drove it into a direction that was only okay instead of great and then the final episode happened and I won't give away the ending but it was a huge letdown for me and some of it felt like an asspull to me.I'd still recommend this show for it's great 10 episodes!

And I was not disappointed... well at least for the first few episodes. Everything started going downhill after the second half. The anime introduced itself as a spectacular sci-fi mature type of anime; however, it trailed off and the sci-fi aspect was completely lost, in my opinion, when the romance was forcibly put into the anime. I especially hate it when a random side character is given a \'main role\' for the sake of advancing the plot.[Story] -- 5: MediocreSpeaking of the plot, as I mentioned before,...I had a hard time following it after a few episodes. There were so many plot holes and so many questions left unanswered. If the anime had gone more into the sci-fi genre, instead of delving into the shitty characters, a lot of the questions may have been explored and even answered. That would have left us with a greater understanding of the anisotropic.[Characters] [Spoilers] -- 2: DreadfulThe characters were atrocious in this anime.

The way the genre shift and twists are executed is so terrible I don't even know what this author was trying to accomplish.I mean if a romance was going to be the main point/solution instead of you know science and negotiations then maybe they should have spend some time developing that instead of spending 2/3 of the shows building the mcs' relationship only to destroy it in one scene so a character with like 3...scenes in that 2/3rd can win.

Then it went down the drain.Story: 4This anime\'s plot seriously had a lot of potential. The beginning sets you up with a conflict of technological advancement vs conservatism. It asks the questions related to change. Then, midway through, this show turns into a mahou shoujo romance between Shindo and Saraka. Instantly, Shindo changes his philosophical stance to match Saraka\'s. The show then becomes a one sided competition between the yaoi pairing bond between zaShunina and Shindo vs Shindo and Saraka\'s superluminal romance bond. In the end, there is even a Deus Ex Machina...who magically, through whatever contrived plotholes, comes with powers to make Saraka\'s side win. I call this bullshit.Character: 5Most characters were 1-dimensional. Shindo and Saraka included for the most part. They\'re just maybe 1.5 rather than 1.0. The dynamics going on with Shindo doesn\'t make any sense but you can possibly just blame that on the fact that Saraka is a canon Sue who twisted the original story concept.Art: 7Everything looks pretty decent. It\'s possibly the best part of this anime.Sound: 7Sounds okay too.Enjoyment: 5I started off excited every week for this anime. Halfway through, that changed. By the last episode, I just laughed at how much of a trainwreck this became. The writing in this show started off good but halfway onward, becomes about as good as your typical fanfiction.net work in the last half.

In episode 7, they introduce the Samsa device that allows people to become aware of their multidimensional selves, thus eliminating the need for sleep. When the Japanese government representatives are discussing this, all they are thinking about is how this would improve human productivity, without a thought for the fact that it\'s precisely excess productivity caused by excess population that is leading the environment to a...catastrophic failure in the relatively near future. Also, it\'s ignoring the psychological issues, the boredom factor and other problems. It seems that the show is just trying to say - like a good Japanese - that people would be able to work a lot more, and is not aware that it\'s precisely this overdedication to work that causes so many psychological and social problems to Japanese individuals, including the overly high suicide rate (not the only factor, but a major contributor), and entirely disregarding the idea that people in other cultures DO NOT live for their jobs. The only moment the show approaches this problem is when they question whether rapid development would lead to happiness, when actually survival is far more of a pressing issue here. The wam would already lead to disastrous disruptions in the economic structure of the world. Add that to billions of people having too much time in their hands and/or companies pushing them to work more, thus speeding up the exhaustion of natural resources, and the anisothropic\'s gifts look increasingly like a curse to me. The only one that seems to realize this is Saraka.And then the show throws everything out the window in the last three episodes. After Sayaka became God (she even has a halo, for fuck\'s sake!) and Shindo falls in love with her for no reason at all, and poor Za Shunina becomes ""the villain who wants to destroy the world for no reason"", everything the series had of good simply vanished to be replaced by the most boring and predictable ending possible. I should have seen this a mile off. The childish scientist (portraying scientists like children who are unaware of the social world around them is one of the most appalling misconceptions I know, on part with portraying engineers as socially-retarded nerds and soldiers as sadistic murderers) and the tsundere negotiator (seriously, how did she get that job with a personality like that?!?) were already giving terrible warning signs that the authors behind the story were not taking their plot as serious sci-fi. Also, for reasons I mentioned above, the plot\'s whole outlook on the problems created by the contact with the anisothropic was naive at best, so it did not come as a surprise for me that the screwed up the series completely by creating that stupid, cliche ending.Finally, at no point did the CGI animation become pleasant to me. I was always watching the series IN SPITE of the terrible animation. Compare this to something like The Incredibles and you\'ll understand what I mean. Yes, one is a feature film with a huge budget. But honestly, I don\'t care. If you\'re going to make it CGI, that\'s what you should go for. American CGI TV series are also terrible, for the same reasons: stiff character movement and constantly bland and unconvincing facial expressions. Kado was the only good thing on the animation side, and the only thing that should have been CGI.Music: forgettable. I really can\'t recall a single song or theme from the anime after watching it.Sound design: good, but nothing exceptional. The sound is not a truly integral part of the story, but merely ""sound effects"". For comparison, see how the sound design is incredibly meaningful and integral to the narrative in Serial Experiments Lain, where even the sudden moments of silence have a profound impact in a scene.As a whole: very mediocre and totally forgettable series. Nothing to hate or make a fuss about. It had potential as an idea and wasted it because most writers of anime are not good at writing actual sci-fi (Shin Sekai Yori being the one notable exception of the past then years, as far as I know - after all, Gundam is not sci-fi, just as Star Wars is not sci-fi, but rather space opera). catastrophic failure in the relatively near future.

Then they just screw it up.Spoilers ahead...Episode 9 is the last episode I enjoyed along with the first parts of episode 10, then it just went straight downhill and made me want to tear the hairs out of my head for wasting over 3hours straight binging it since it was so good. All the amazing plot, the potential, the description of how their world was, how it was introduced/told to the viewers was good.

WHAT KIND OF HIGHER BEING THROWS AWAY THE SIMPLEST OF LOGIC. To be honest this just pissed me off so much that it made me write this review.

This anime had so much potential and I stand by my belief that things could\'ve been improved even a little by allowing it a 24 episode run time rather than 12, but should nothing of the story and development change that\'d all be for naught in the end.For me this anime wasn\'t a complete waste of time, I seriously enjoyed it up to episode 8 and actually wouldn\'t have minded if they ended it there, went on a month long hiatus then came back with a fully fleshed out...and well thought through ending instead of the crap shack we got instead. The visuals, the music and the characters for the most part were fantastic, even the story started out well being sort of like the CG anime equivalent of Arrival (excellent film, I highly recommend watching it), but as with a lot of ambitious projects they just couldn\'t seem to figure out how to appropriately end the series without royally fucking it up.(From here on excuse me if I rant a little, the ending is about my only qualm with Kado).For starters, Shindo, zaShunina and even Saraka (whom I didn\'t like that much anyway) were good characters in their own right. It made sense that the 40D alien boi had no understanding of human concepts and emotions, it made sense that Shindo wouldn\'t be at all shocked by making contact with an alien because that\'s his character, and it made sense that at least one of the main cast would be opposed to this and encompassed that side of humanity\'s reaction which was what Saraka represented. But all semblence of development was completely throw out the window when things started coming to a climax.Shindo I\'m not so hung up on apart from the fact that he\'s praised by the Prime Minister for being able to walk his own path, yet the power of boners makes him follow along with Saraka\'s wishes like a dog in heat. Or how his amazing negotiator skills are scrapped in favour of needless violence, yay! //throws upNow here\'s where I start getting annoyed; Saraka was a character that, as I said, I didn\'t like (and I could also sadly tell where they were going with her character the second I saw her because she\'s the only other character in the whole anime with red eyes bar zaShunina). The reason being was not because she was written badly but because we stood on opposites sides of the argument, something I consider excellent writing for a character. She represented the cautious and fearful side of humanity, our distrusting nature towards a deal that feels too good to be true, the most basic and instinctual fear of even the most simple of creatures; fear of the unknown. This however is completely ruined by one simple fact...she\'s not human. She is fearful because she has knowledge of what zaShunina might do and what he is capable of, the complete opposite of humanity who fear what they don\'t understand. Her character could have had so much more depth and meaning if they\'d just kept her human, but instead they reduced her to typical tsundere waifu material and only worth a damn for her womb.Now comes zaShunina, the biggest cliché insult to me since I really loved his character (for reasons I shall make clear a little later on). From how much anime and movies and series I\'ve watched over the years I\'ve become really damn good at telling where a story is going to head (not to toot my own horn there, just fact), which is why I\'m happily surprised when media does something I didn\'t expect. For all intensive purposes, Kado was heading the latter direction at first, being something I\'m not unfamiliar with but something I don\'t see often, so it\'s refreshing, but unfortunately it started running down the road of predictability far too fast, tripped up and dropped its own plot down the storm drain. I have no doubt that zaShunina was intended to be the quote unquote ""bad guy"" of the series, but I highly doubt it was intended to be this blunt about it. All of the development he\'d gone through was utterly trashed when the decision was made to have him turn psychotic, I find it hard to believe that A) he, who has never been remotely human in his life, could learn to be human in a month when it takes us humans years to learn to do that and B) a highly intelligent 40D being would become emotionally unstable. It felt messy, rushed and above all else out of character.The other part of things that upset the fandom was of course the queerbaiting. I won\'t talk too much about it but I will say this; it was noticeable and disgusting. I have no idea why having a gay couple in a regular anime is so bad that they have to kill them off for it, just having a non-hetero couple in your anime does not make it a BL/GL or a yaoi/yuri, it makes it a wholesome and relatable story to a minority often overlooked in the media. I have watched anime made in the 90s do a better job representing the LGBT community than our supposed ""world of equality"" nowadays.Now...for the part that pissed me off the most about the ending....I\'m sorry but...for being a heavily science(ish) based anime...HOW THE FUCK DID THEY MESS UP BASIC MATH?0 + 0.5 does not equal 2 for fuck\'s sake, there is no way that a human being and an Anisotoron who is essentially human and abandoned almost all her power could produce a being more powerful than a whole, pureblooded Anisotoron. That. Is. Not. How. Biology. Works.And don\'t give me that ""She\'s a Anisotoron, she can alter things"" because she has next to no power anymore, she threw away her power to be born and live as a regular human being, retaining only as much as she needed to survive I suppose. To use an extreme example, a normal healthy human and a human with a hereditary degenerative disease /does not/ produce a child with the cure to cancer. It does not work like that. What happened in Kado was, say it with me now;PLOT CONVENIENCE.They could not figure out a way to end this anime, so they asspulled, and I think this is what annoyed me the most.I have my own story and headworld, I\'ve had it for years now and I share it with my partner. Between us we have created a wide universe rich with lore and mysteries in equal amounts, and the ""God among men"" situation is one I am very familiar with. This is why Kado appealed to me, it was like watching an anime that had parts of my own headworld lore in it and that was fascinating to see come to life before my eyes. I and my partner sorted the problems of having OP characters in a very simple way; the God-level characters in our headworld are /passive observers/. They don\'t fight, they don\'t interfere with ""lesser beings"", they are simply there to see to it that the universe is running smoothly and that there are no beings getting too powerful and causing chaos. The only time they clash is with each other in their own pocket dimensions, well away from any collateral damage. We asked ourselves why they shouldn\'t be antagonists and the answer was simple;""Beings with enough power to create universes are wise enough to know that their power should be used to protect the weak, not cause conflict.""Too many writers create God-level characters and then slap human concepts onto them as if beings of that level would share our beliefs. None of mine and my partner\'s God-level characters have human emotions, they have a set of emotions that are like human ones but not the same and can copy human emotions if they want be can\'t really feel it. None of them have ""morals"" because those were things made by humans in the first place, they have an understanding of the concept of ""right"" and ""wrong"" but again these are human concepts that humans made to judge the actions of other humans, so they feel no need to adhere to these rules, they won\'t chastise someone for murder nor congratulate someone for saving a life, they simply acted and that is that. This is represented beautifully by one of my God-level characters who apologizes to others but never means it, he understands that whatever he did is seen as ""wrong"" but he himself sees no problem, so when he apologizes to others you can tell it\'s insincere.More and more writers are exploring deeper and out-there concepts, but we must understand that these things cannot ever be fully quantified by our own look on the universe and everything within it, and I believe this is where Kado ultimately failed what it set out to accomplish. and well thought through ending instead of the crap shack we got instead. The visuals, the music and the characters for the most part were fantastic, even the story started out well being sort of like the CG anime equivalent of Arrival (excellent film, I highly recommend watching it), but as with a lot of ambitious projects they just couldn\'t seem to figure out how to appropriately end the series without royally fucking it up.(From here on excuse me if I rant a little, the ending is about my only qualm with Kado).For starters, Shindo, zaShunina and even Saraka (whom I didn\'t like that much anyway) were good characters in their own right.

I have no idea why having a gay couple in a regular anime is so bad that they have to kill them off for it, just having a non-hetero couple in your anime does not make it a BL/GL or a yaoi/yuri, it makes it a wholesome and relatable story to a minority often overlooked in the media. I have watched anime made in the 90s do a better job representing the LGBT community than our supposed ""world of equality"" nowadays.Now...for the part that pissed me off the most about the ending....I\'m sorry but...for being a heavily science(ish) based anime...HOW THE FUCK DID THEY MESS UP BASIC MATH?0 + 0.5 does not equal 2 for fuck\'s sake, there is no way that a human being and an Anisotoron who is essentially human and abandoned almost all her power could produce a being more powerful than a whole, pureblooded Anisotoron. That. Is. Not. How. Biology. Works.And don\'t give me that ""She\'s a Anisotoron, she can alter things"" because she has next to no power anymore, she threw away her power to be born and live as a regular human being, retaining only as much as she needed to survive I suppose. To use an extreme example, a normal healthy human and a human with a hereditary degenerative disease /does not/ produce a child with the cure to cancer. It does not work like that. What happened in Kado was, say it with me now;PLOT CONVENIENCE.They could not figure out a way to end this anime, so they asspulled, and I think this is what annoyed me the most.I have my own story and headworld, I\'ve had it for years now and I share it with my partner. Between us we have created a wide universe rich with lore and mysteries in equal amounts, and the ""God among men"" situation is one I am very familiar with. This is why Kado appealed to me, it was like watching an anime that had parts of my own headworld lore in it and that was fascinating to see come to life before my eyes. I and my partner sorted the problems of having OP characters in a very simple way; the God-level characters in our headworld are /passive observers/. They don\'t fight, they don\'t interfere with ""lesser beings"", they are simply there to see to it that the universe is running smoothly and that there are no beings getting too powerful and causing chaos. The only time they clash is with each other in their own pocket dimensions, well away from any collateral damage. We asked ourselves why they shouldn\'t be antagonists and the answer was simple;""Beings with enough power to create universes are wise enough to know that their power should be used to protect the weak, not cause conflict.""Too many writers create God-level characters and then slap human concepts onto them as if beings of that level would share our beliefs. None of mine and my partner\'s God-level characters have human emotions, they have a set of emotions that are like human ones but not the same and can copy human emotions if they want be can\'t really feel it. None of them have ""morals"" because those were things made by humans in the first place, they have an understanding of the concept of ""right"" and ""wrong"" but again these are human concepts that humans made to judge the actions of other humans, so they feel no need to adhere to these rules, they won\'t chastise someone for murder nor congratulate someone for saving a life, they simply acted and that is that. This is represented beautifully by one of my God-level characters who apologizes to others but never means it, he understands that whatever he did is seen as ""wrong"" but he himself sees no problem, so when he apologizes to others you can tell it\'s insincere.More and more writers are exploring deeper and out-there concepts, but we must understand that these things cannot ever be fully quantified by our own look on the universe and everything within it, and I believe this is where Kado ultimately failed what it set out to accomplish.', ""This is my first review, but I can say I am confident in my current opinions on this series. I'll skip over my personal praise and jump to the individual aspects of this series so far however.Story: 9/10I am a writer, and am pursuing writing as a very possible career, and have watched quite a bit of anime so far. It is what I pull a lot of inspiration and lessons from, and has been a great way of improving my quality and skills as a writer. Taking in this series and what it has to offer, from just the episodes so far I've learned...a great lesson in writing; adding uniqueness to your story that has not been seen in other people's stories before. This may be a spoiler, but what occurs in Kado when the cube makes contact is not what you'd expect, which is massive destruction or the emergence of aliens or robots or any other evil foreign entity, but rather the cube setting down almost perfectly and a human emerge which, so far, has not been hostile whatsoever. Breaking barriers of what the viewer expects is great and usually tough to achieve as a writer, but so far Mado Nozaki has done an amazing job with the series.Art: 8/10This is actually a surprising score for myself to give, as I generally hate CG/CGI animations, although I've completely lost concern and care for the CGI in Kado so far. The backgrounds and other objects aside from the humans all appear to not be CG/CGI, at least to me, and the humans actually blend very well with them. Also, did I mention how stunning the cube, Kado, has been so far? Its shifting colors and movements are, as another reviewer stated, eye candy, and I've enjoyed every chance I've got to look at Kado. Japan's scenery is also portrayed very well in the series so far, and we have yet to see if the series will extend further to other countries/areas.Sound: 8/10I love music and sound effects in anime, and the music is nothing short of a masterpiece so far. The opening gives off eerie yet majestic vibes, and the singer expresses the greatness of what Kado: The Right Answer has to offer. The ending, despite many skipping over it, is actually very good also, and you can even hear the Japanese oriental sounds mixed in near the beginning (pardon me if I termed that incorrectly). Aside from that, from what we've heard songwise in the series so far, almost all of it has been majestic and attractive to the ears, at least mine, and they've done a fantastic job on the sound effects for Kado, the elements of the world, and even the little things such as echoing footsteps and rolling WAM.Characters: 7/10So far the characters have been all-around great, with not that many cliches, troupes, or copy-paste characters. And there will always be some underlying similarities between how characters act in anime, as we all are humans and similar in our personalities and reactions. But the characters that most stand out to me are the main-main ones, such as Shindou and zaShunina. Shindou has this very stern and down-to-the-point personality, one that we don't normally see as often if at all, probably because it's hard for most writers to execute well. However Mado has done superb with Shindou and his interaction in the world so far, and everything Shindou says or does intrigues me. This is the same with zaShunina also. I expected zaShunina to come to Earth with some evil plan, whether that be direct or underlying, and when that didn't happen I expected him to come to spread or share an insane idea or religious belief, both of which he did not do either. I am closely analyzing zaShunina whenever he says something, and am waiting to find out what his true intentions are if he even has any, which honestly at this point I'm somewhat convinced he's a character type I have never seen in anime or any other form of media for that matter.That's about all I have for my review, and I do hope it helped. I highly recommend you give this series a try if you have not yet done so, as I believe it truly offers a story and idea that has never been seen in anime yet, at least in my experience of watching it. a great lesson in writing; adding uniqueness to your story that has not been seen in other people's stories before.

Shindo is an extremely relatable and well-rounded character, though I would have liked to know about his personal background. What really pulled the enjoyment factor up for this anime for me was watching ZaShunina grow and become steadily more human, and at the same time, Shindo's relationship with him.In the middle episodes there is a lot of 'let's stall this as far as possible' which really is not the way to go for a 12 ep arc - probably why the plot twist seems to have come OUT OF NOWHERE. There is a...decided lack of relationship development between Saraka and Shindo, not nearly enough about Kado's inside and Shindo's work inside, and a very over-simplified summary of the benefits of the devices to the world.I would have liked more international meetings, and maybe side-plots to introduce the effect of the devices on humanity. Instead, though we're talking about important concepts such as giving power to humanity which they could possibly abuse, you're forced to go through Shindo meeting his mother, a camera guy getting recruited by a Google anime knockoff brand and a festival where ZaShunina buys a turtle. I think the producers need to set a tone - and stick to it. There is a lot of confusion about the general direction the poorly developed plot takes. Personally, I hate the canon ship and I think it would have been much better and more realistic to leave Saraka as a human who is mildly irritating. Not nearly enough physics/ actual serious science - this could have been thrilling. If another studio had produced it or it had better funding, no doubt it could have been a smashing success like Steins;Gate. decided lack of relationship development between Saraka and Shindo, not nearly enough about Kado's inside and Shindo's work inside, and a very over-simplified summary of the benefits of the devices to the world.I would have liked more international meetings, and maybe side-plots to introduce the effect of the devices on humanity.

I starting jotting down my thoughts after the third episode in order to write the best review possible, so I’ve had a lot of time to ponder on this.Animation:I’ll be honest, I really don’t care for the animation. I don’t like cgi-blend. The art style in episode 0 was superb, which made the art style for the rest of the series kind of a bummer. However, this is my personal opinion.Story:Here’s what I love about the story. Despite the fact that it’s just about as sci-fi as sci-fi can be,...the way it plays out is weirdly...accurate. I feel like humanity’s response to zaShunina in this show is realistically how humanity would respond to this kind of event. The central protagonist isn’t some hot blooded 17 year old Chosen One with the fate of the world in his hands. It’s a government negotiator. A bureaucrat. Everything is disputed politically and diplomatically. Even the UN gets involved here. As complex and fantastical as it can be at times, this story is told practically.Theme wise, the show focused the most on one thing: humanity, humanity, humanity. When the UN gets involved of the dispute over what to do with the resources zaShunina has given Japan, zaShunina says something that I think sums up the central conundrum of this show: “I came here to help humanity, not countries.” Coming together as humans despite national borders isn’t exactly the conflict in the story here—it’s asking whether or not we’re even capable of doing so.That is, until the story gets turned backwards and upside down in a plot twist that made me jump up from my couch and start shouting at my tv. But that’s all I’ll say on that. You’ll just have to see for yourself.There are a couple reasons why I knocked a few points off my score here, because it could very easily have been a 10. One is simply that I tend to be a tough critic so, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Second was the animation. I just couldn’t get used to it and I didn’t think it looked good. And last was a combination of a few different inconsistencies.“Can we trust Yaha-kui zaShunina? Does he really have humanity’s best interest at heart?” This is something I was asking with every episode, but curiously, the show itself only touched on this question from time to time. So when you’re watching it, make sure you ask yourself that. You might be surprised at the answer.But to that I add my greatest criticismCharacters:This show is considerably more plot driven than it is character driven. It’s not that the characters are weak or even bad. But when you have a plot this complex and, in my opinion, magnificent, if your characters aren’t equally as strong then the story they exist in is going to overshadow them and swallow them whole. This was the problem with Kado, and big time.Shindo is...Shindo. As you watched the show you’ll see that everyone admires him immensely. There’s not a person who dislikes him. And he’s a nice guy. I don’t really have anything bad to say about him. But that’s just it. Despite how everyone goes on and on about how exceptional he is, he’s annoyingly average to me. In the last couple episodes his heroic characteristics start to shine though, so by the end of the series he turned out to be a good protagonist. It just took too long to get thereTsukai Saraka was quite the interesting character. At first I didn’t like her all that much. They tried to make her, a government employee, come across as a tsundere-like character. Why? Why on earth would a show like this need a tsundere?? Anyway, you see a different side of her in episode 7 and from then on I respected her a lot. By the end of the show she was my favorite character. I just don’t understand why she was portrayed as she was initially. Perhaps it was strategic, but it sure got on my nerves.Hanamori was funny, and definitely the “how the hell did I get caught up in this?” character in the series. Yet he turned out to be crucial to the plot, and I always appreciate it when a show makes the comic relief more significant than you might think they are.Dr. Shinawa was also another favorite of mine. Sincerely eccentric is how I’d sum her up. I always loved her contributions to the story.And Yaha-kui zaShunina. Man oh man. Definitely the most impressive development wise. ESPECIALLY by the last episode. His development seemed a bit too rushed in my opinion, but it was still mostly consistent with the pace of the show. I went back and forth between distrusting him and loving him, and often found myself at a weird equilibrium between the two. And I loved it.I think there was at least an earnest effort to have strong characters, so I’ll give them that. It just didn’t quite work. They focused too much on the story to really give the characters their day in the sun.So, here are the cliff notes- Watch episode 0- Rewatch episodes if you can, it’ll help a lot- Think really hard about the questions the show asks- More plot driven than character driven- But the characters are sincere- The plot is slow to build but pays off wellI’d give it a 7.5 if I could, that’s what it is in my heart of hearts.

The ending of the show really messes so much up it isn’t fun. It has been a while that I have seen a show or read a book that started out this good and then crashed and burned like Kado. It is even worse than “Langoliers” by Stephen King which created an amazing atmosphere a great mystery and had a laughable ending. Why is it worse? Because in the case of Kado, it was not just that the ending was weak. This was Donna of “Doctor Who”.Animation...– 7I wasn’t very fond of the CGI-only animation but it actually sort of worked here because of the otherworldliness of Yaha and Kado and the CGI emphasised their alien qualities nicely. In the case of the human characters, it would have been great if they had been animated the old-fashioned way. Maybe a mix of both with a heavier emphasis on CGI would have been good but since the CGI was actually pretty well done a 7 it is.Story – 5Kado is about First Contact and in the beginning, the show does so many things right that I could have shed a tear. I wondered why it was compared with “Arrival”. They are not really similar but both “Arrival” and “Kado” are about communication and language and so much more. It debates the pros and cons of natural to sudden technological advancement. How would the media handle a first encounter with aliens? How about the political and economic impact of technology that is so far removed from what we know? The show was smart, the pacing was great, the ideas were fascinating but halfway through something changed. Maybe they ran out of ideas, maybe some people wanted to have a say. I don’t know what happened but whatever it was, it was not good and the show suffered massively and received a very stupid deus ex machina ending.When it comes most of the episodes, especially the first arc (8 episodes), the show would receive either a 9 or 10 but that ending deserves nothing less than a big fat zero, so all in all 5. This is why this show is so frustrating. It had so much potential but Yaha, who had been cool and composed suddenly became downright human and emotional. I adored the developing relationship (in a way undefinable – Friendship? Love? Something more profound?) between Shindou and Yaha and in my eyes, it was not just a simple friendship and then the finale happened. Talk about badly handled.Music – 10The music is utterly gorgeous and it is my favourite score of the year so far (and this also includes scores like “Mary Magdalene” by Jóhann Jóhannson). 岩代太郎 already did a great job with A.I.C.O. but outdid himself with the help of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The OP and ED did not only fit perfectly with the images but are also very, very beautiful. There is even a beautiful operatic Aria included (ヤハクィザシュニナ伝 ~Diva Version~). Do buy it. It is totally worth it!Characters 6Again a solid ten in the beginning but with an ending like that- 6 is generous.I hate this show. I love this show. I loved it so much but I hate it for being such a massive let-down at the end. – 7I wasn’t very fond of the CGI-only animation but it actually sort of worked here because of the otherworldliness of Yaha and Kado and the CGI emphasised their alien qualities nicely.

First contact based sci-fi dealing with aliens/other-dimensional beings, and some of the reviews even went as far as to note the DMT/psychedelic motifs that accompany the best of this genre (after all, if you\'re going to see a tesseract, your brain is gonna bend.)So far, so good.  But, so many of the reviews seemed...to contain the same critique:  ""This show started excellent but somewhere around episode 7 (sometimes 6, sometimes 8) it took a nosedive.""  So, I began the show.  I waited with bated breath until episode 7 and - absolutely nothing surprising happened.  If *anything* (and without giving away spoilers) there was a slight tone shift from ""straight up Arrival-esque sci-fi"" to ""here come some mild anime tropes and some unexpected character developments.""  And even the character developments were not what I was somewhat expecting them to be.Basically, this is very solid sci-fi fare, a rare ""mature"" anime (term used relatively here), with a closed-loop plot, some great concepts and some decent character interactions which may have simply turned off people who thought they were going to get ""pure"" Arrival in anime form.  I\'d recommend this to sci-fi fans, psychonauts, and basically anyone with an interest in higher dimensions and how we as humans cope with those concepts.  I think Asimov or Clarke said any sufficiently higher technology would appear to us as magic.  Likewise, would a higher dimensional being appear to us as an angel or a god?Ultimately, it\'s a first-contact tale for the modern era, it\'s the Day the Earth Stood Still for our time.  Ignore the people complaining about the last third of the series, because honestly, I don\'t quite get what they were expecting and the story seemed to remain of a consistent quality to me.  Again, without spoilers, I\'d just say let yourself have some fun on an otherwise high-minded philosophical ride.My only quibble, if anything, is I wish this was maybe a few episodes longer as I would have liked to see more of the world reacting to the events portrayed, and some of the complex character motivations fleshed out a little further.Oh, and do watch Episode 0.  It\'s on Crunchyroll.  It provides some character backstory that does come back to enhance the plot.Final thought:  I believe the same writer wrote ""Babylon"" which I started but never finished, but having seen Kado now I think I need to return to Babylon and give it a second chance. to contain the same critique:  ""This show started excellent but somewhere around episode 7 (sometimes 6, sometimes 8) it took a nosedive.""

It\'s on Crunchyroll.  It provides some character backstory that does come back to enhance the plot.Final thought:  I believe the same writer wrote ""Babylon"" which I started but never finished, but having seen Kado now I think I need to return to Babylon and give it a second chance.', ""This anime started very well, but towards the end of the show they started jamming in plot twists that didn't fit well with the rest of the show and the dialogue transitioned from legitimately deep and meaningful to stuff you would see on a 6th grader's #deep instagram post. I did not like the ending at all.Aside from the story, the art was actually surprisingly good for a show that was almost completely CGI, this is an example of good CGI use. Unfortunately, the art wasn't good enough to make up for all the trash thrown in my face.This show had so much potential...but it was all unfortunately put to waste. Makes you wonder what they were thinking when writing it. but it was all unfortunately put to waste.

""Finally,"" I thought, ""a mature sci-fi series dealing with the politics of first contact!""Unfortunately, the show begins to veer off (for me) at the festival episode, and goes downhill from there. The ending in particular was very disappointing to me due to the abundance of tired anime tropes the series had done well to avoid or keep understated so far.There is also no room left to explore the wider implications of anisotropic tech that earlier episodes seemed to promise.Regarding the Art,...I will say that the anisotropic structures were rendered very well and were unmistakably alien. The music was also very good (especially that opening) and gave an inspiring vibe.It\'s up to you whether - knowing what you know now - you\'ll still want to pick up KADO. It\'s a difficult series to rate numerically because those first few episodes really are very good, while those in the other half are uninspiring to say the least. I take a dimmer view of the overall series because it raised my expectations only to dash them, whereas some worse series at least show you what you\'re in for.

The premise is very interesting - an alien being shows up without being detected by any nation's defense systems. It's weird ass space vehicle is called Kado and it sets down on a Japanese airport, absorbing a plane full of people in the process.  It just so happens that a highly ranked government negotiator is on the plane and he becomes the surrogate representative to the world for this alien being.Beyond the artistry of the graphics,...I find it interesting how the reactions of people are being depicted. Granted, we only see a small population compared to the world.  The power plays being depicted are probably true to form in many ways, especially for governments. For instance, the alien offers a source for unlimited, sustainable, and non-polluting energy to share with everyone. But the United Nation lead countries want to take possession and decide how the power source should be used, who should have it, and of course the power utility brokers don't want it to be shared.The ethical and moral dilemmas being portrayed are deep. What gives Setten Company the right to expose the world to mind altering technology just because it is offered by the alien?  Why isn't anyone questioning why the alien being has suddenly appeared on Earth, alone.I'm looking forward to seeing how some of my questions are answered and how the characters will be changed - both the alien being changed by exposure to Earth humanity and by the humans as they receive technology light-years beyond our capability of understanding.

That being said this is probably one of the first shows I finished and felt completely upset and unsatisfied with.The concept is great, the first half of the season introduced it well. Sadly it just went down hill, by the end everything about the last episode upset me.The relationship between the love interest and the main character seemed forced and really unneeded.  I felt there was more chemistry between Shindo and zaShunina.The fact Shindo is the worlds best negotiator but .....never really does that?all of the big empty mumbo jumbo to explain away things.I could just go on and on.Personally I was totally on zaShunina's side the whole time. sign me up for that ending. never really does that?all of the big empty mumbo jumbo to explain away things.I could just go on and on.Personally I was totally on zaShunina's side the whole time. sign me up for that ending."", 'This anime started off with a lot of promise in the first episode and it seemed like it was gonna be a mature (Or at least not childish) anime involving a lot of politics and tense diplomatic negotiations. It was far from it, I was really disappointed that it turned out so terrible but I wasn\'t really surprised considering a huge chunk of anime suffer from the things I found bad about this anime.Let\'s start off with the story.The story had so much promise but it fell short in almost every aspect. The story itself could have been bearable if they fixed one or two...things. Those things being Character and not having so much tropes ruining the atmosphere and ""tension"" of the anime.ArtPersonally disliked it but for 3DCG they did good.SoundNot much to say really, had some alright sound and a nice soundtrack. I think a few of the SFX were stock sounds but they could have been just really similar to what I\'ve heard in other anime so who knows.CharacterThe biggest problem with this anime is the characters every character is so very droll and uninspired. This anime would\'ve been a lot better if they managed to make you give a shit about anyone in the show. I can\'t even find myself hating the characters either, they are so boring and bland that they aren\'t likable but they aren\'t really unlikable other than a few ""quirks"" here and there.The most annoying and boring characters are the MC and the Science chick. The MC is just boring as all hell with the typical can-do attitude every generic anime MC has. The science chick (I forget her name) is so chock full of annoying and boring tropes to make her seem so quirky that it\'s actually grating.

The concept of rapid technological and societal advancement is always intriguing and the show manages to keep your utmost attention for the first 8 episodes. It introduces certain philosophical concepts and paradoxes that make you deeply contemplate about them and consider your stance.However, from episode 9 and onwards, it feels as if the writer and director got a reality check that there are not many episodes left, and the show degraded to a moronic battle shounen showdown (Kirito style) that completely renders everything before that point null and pointless.

These issues are present when human negotiator Kojiro Shindo takes on the job to work with the alien being, Yaha-kui zaShunina, in trying to express and comprehend the gifts that zaShunina provides to advance humanity's evolution.In the issue of diplomacy, Kado focuses on the interactions...between Shindo and zaShunina, as Shindo serves as a mediator between the Japanese government and zaShunina in working out the interests of both parties. Besides mediator, Shindo also serves as a sort of confidante to zaShunina who expresses his desires for what he would like to bring for humanity with his gifts and Shindo even gets first exposure to them before the rest of humanity. Still in spite of this diplomacy and zaShunina's apparent benevolence, hints are dropped in early episodes that his motives may not be as benevolent as they would seem on the surface and this gradually becomes more clear as episodes progress into Kado's second half. Even then, the series does enough to develop a character dynamic between Shindo and zaShunina throughout the series where Shindo's interactions with the alien being affect him mentally in leading up to the show's finale.The other matter in the series, humanity's being unprepared for rapid advancements, gets explored in how the world would respond to such changes and zaShunina's influence in offering them. As zaShunina deliberately chose Japan as the starting point for introducing his technology to humanity, these developments don't exactly make the other countries of the world enthused as they grill political pressure on Japan to share whatever they are provided from the start of the series. The Japanese government also gradually starts to express concern with the rapid advancement in zaShunina's progression of the abilities he bestows upon humanity as Shindo communicates the alien's goals and trying to come up with measures to minimize the effect this would have on the populace at large. Also as mentioned earlier, zaShunina's motives with providing humanity's rapid evolution not being so benevolent contributes to developments in this element of the series as the tools he provides for the advancement serve as components for the plans he has in place.I feel I should also address two rather controversial elements to Kado that need addressing, the first of which being in the form of the character of Saraka Tsukai, the Japanese government's own negotiator opposed to zaShunina's devices being bestowed upon humanity. There are some rather surprising revelations about her character that get revealed in the show's second half that some fans have assumed to be a deus ex machina of some sort. Granted the series doesn't provide any proper foreshadowing that hint to the revelations coming about. But at the same time, her concerns about zaShunina were brought about in earlier episodes and hints of zaShunina not being so benevolent were shown at points in earlier episodes as well. In addition, a case can be made where her stance on humanity's evolution is a representation of a naturalistic stance in allowing humanity's evolution to happen with time rather than speeding things up as zaShunina is attempting to bring about.The second and most recent element would come in the form of the show's ending. Again, some may argue how it came about would be a kind of deus ex machina since hints of how the events come about were not hinted to in the anime's prior episode. I would argue in this particular case, enough was fleshed out in earlier episodes about the capabilities of the anisotropic where what came about was not necessarily so out of nowhere, especially with what is revealed about Tsukai. It also meshes up with the naturalistic views on evolution that Tsukai favors since the interactions between humanity and the anisotropic bring about a potential new path in evolution for both species rather than the rapid advancement that zaShunina was forcing about.Overall, I can kind of see where the events of Kado's second half may cause viewers of the series to be divided in their reception of it with some of the major seemingly sudden developments that I brought up above. Still, I feel that there was enough fleshed out and explored within earlier episodes of the series where the developments didn't completely come out of nowhere and made enough sense once you picked apart the hints alluded from earlier episodes. The series offers a rather engaging and solid exploration of debating about following a natural path of evolution or attempting to speed up the process, and creates some engaging chemistry in the interactions between Shindo and zaShunina with their growing relationship that eventually turns confrontational due to their differing ideologies on human evolution. Kado won't be for those that prefer their anime to be on the more action-heavy side.

In a season very light on good original shows, Kado: The Right Answer may well be the best non-sequel of the season. Here\'s why:-Story-On the surface Kado is a show about alien first contract. However, as the title suggests, the real emphasis of this anime is about whether humanity will choose ""The Right Answer"" - progress - or fail to grasp the opportunity because of infighting and reluctance to change.What makes Kado great is the quality of the writing. There\'s just enough tension...and mystery without descending into drama. The fact it is an entirely original story means that the episode to episode progression is mostly smooth with new reveals and information at a steady pace.The reaction to the alien arrival is, unlike many alien stories and perhaps anime in general, realistic, nuanced, and intelligent. The reaction of the Japanese government, the public, and the international community to events seem close to what might actually happen. It is clear that a good amount of thought went into writing this show.The only major flaw in Kado as of ep 6 is that in the most recent episode, there\'s kind of a cop-out regarding the reveal at the end of ep 5. This is the only time I\'ve felt disappointed about the progression of the story.-Art-Kado is a CGI anime which certainly will put some people off, but it probably works better here than it has in most anime in the past. The show is mostly people sat around talking to eachother, so there\'s less of the usual jerky animations associated with anime CGI. The models, especially yaShunina\'s, look fairly good. Overall Kado isn\'t a visual marvel but it\'s animation does the job.-Sound-The nature of the story means the VAs don\'t get much chance to emote, but so far they all sound fine. The only annoying VA is the scientist girl, but that aspect of her character is I think intentional. The OP is pretty unique for an anime and sets the tone very well.-Overall-Despite its visuals and not being based on any source material, Kado is gaining more and more of a following and recognition, atleast in the western fandom - and for good reason. If the plot summary interests you at all, you owe it to yourself to atleast check out this very novel anime. and mystery without descending into drama.

Would we go about exploring the universe to satisfy our craving for knowledge and experience?

I mean, come on, some ""higher dimensional"" being that comes into our average world to speed up our progress as a human race? I had to see how they would play this out realistically. I wasn\'t bored a single second of the anime because of how well they portrayed how an authentic government would handle something like that and anything this potential threat provided. So in that regard, the story lived up exactly to how it describes...in MAL\'s synopsis.Character development and sounds were pretty decent, nothing to complain about.The only thing I had a problem with in this anime was the ugly CGI and the ending. They mix the typical animation with CGI the majority of the time. CGI is ugly when you use it on main and supporting characters, but for special scenes with lights slapping everyone in the face and magical pewpew beams it looks really well, so I guess I can\'t complain.In the end it didn\'t turn out like Berserk\'s CGI animation, so I\'m really thankful.The ending could have been done better. It was like they just gave up trying to explain stuff and slapped something together to be Edgelord-worthy.tl;dr Good anime worth a watch if you like realistic first-encounter stuff, but has an ending that isn\'t the best, but NOT enough to judge the entire anime negatively. in MAL\'s synopsis.Character development and sounds were pretty decent, nothing to complain about.The only thing I had a problem with in this anime was the ugly CGI and the ending.

About what possibly lies just beyond humanities reach? If you\'ve answered yes to either of these questions, than Kado might be an interesting and thought provoking series to watch.Unfortunately the important word in the previous sentence is ""might"". Generally I try to describe the good in an anime, in the hopes of getting people to watch and form their own opinions. However in this case I think I should take the time to warn you in the hopes of saving you from disappointment.Kado is a mostly good series. It has a strong cast...of unique adult characters, splendid art and sound design, coupled with a fascinating ""first contact"" style sci-fi story. Most of this goes to shit by the end though. This show is an excellent example of a train-wreck. It takes its core sci-fi elements, philosophical questions, smart characters, and kills them all one by one.I give this anime a 6/10. It kept me entertained throughout most of its run. It was thought provoking, gorgeous to look at, and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I wish it had stayed that way till the end, but what can you do.PS: If you want more context for my scores out of 10, please visit my profile.PPS: Although it is listed here on MyAnimeList as being 12 episodes.

It also enables zaShunina to transfer between both worlds. It is owned by Yaha-kui zaShunina -- his goal is to advanced the world. Earlier in the series, Shindo has tried to negotiate with zaShunina to release him and everyone in the plane.

I'm just here to say my opinion. Minor spoilers ahead.I see many people say that at some point the story just dies out and they don't enjoy it anymore, and I'll just say this, don't tell others not to watch it just because you didn't like it. For example I really liked it, and I gave it an 8/10, which I rarely give. The story is consistent, it doesn't leave a lot of holes in the plot, unlike...other anime, the idea behind the anime is pretty original, I haven't seen anything like that before, the art seemed bad at first, since i have had very bad experiences with CGI, but the way they used it was AMAZING!If you see this, please don't listen to the other reviews that tell you to drop it. Many people said the same thing about anime that everyone enjoyed, and for the most part people actually believed them.In any case, what I'm trying to say is this is anime is one of the best I've seen, with amazing art, good character design, the voice actors are amazing too, and a nice story. Over all it's an 8/10 and a def ''Please watch it if you see this review''. other anime, the idea behind the anime is pretty original, I haven't seen anything like that before, the art seemed bad at first, since i have had very bad experiences with CGI, but the way they used it was AMAZING!If you see this, please don't listen to the other reviews that tell you to drop it.

It's really balancing on a knife's edge right now and has the capacity to either finish strong or completely fuck everything that made it great with the most recent episode.So I'm going to separate 2 different iconic aspects of the show which is something I don't usually do. The animation, and the story/premise. So the first thing I'm going to talk about that is of note is the animation. The animation is all CGI for the most part that uses cell shading to give the appearance of...2D characters. This is honestly the best integration of CGI in a an anime that I've ever seen. The anime industry has been making great strides in doing this starting from Aku no Hana and Kingdom in 2013, and Kado really nailed it. The integration isn't perfectly seamless naturally. You can still tell that all the characters have 3D shapes but it certainly isn't jarring like what we've seen in the past and ends up working really well.The second big aspect is the story. The premise is actually fantastic. Kado deals with many philosophical concepts associated with meeting a new more advanced form of alien life which seeks to fast forward humanity's growth. Firstly this is great, because for once we actually have a show that explores interaction with a benevolent alien species, not a blindly evil one, but the real thing that makes it great is the philosophical questions these interactions pose. How fast should civilization advance? Are our current political constructs more detrimental than they are helpful to the progress of mankind? For example, if humanity is given the opportunity to have unimaginable power, would it actually help us, or would it just make us destroy ourselves like nuclear weapons did. These are the questions Kado explores, and it does it very well for the most part. Kado is 100% the most thought provoking show of the season IMO, and I'm really excited to see where it goes.So why did I give it a 7? Honestly it was  going on an 8-9 for me until a recent turn in the series made me question if it was going to be able to keep true to what made it great. And honestly I don't think it will be able to with the direction it's going and will devolve into something much more base than it could be. I'm hoping to be proven wrong but these last few episodes will decide whether Kado will be a show to remember, or a show that will fade into obscurity after the season is done. 2D characters.

The following review may contain spoilers but the series is very difficult to review without such so I will try not to spoil too much but you have been warned.The story starts out very solid but I wouldn't really give it a high score for its beginning, very fun and interesting to watch at the start but largely you feel it beginning to drag along as if feeling it becomes somewhat repetitive. Of course this changes drastically in the last part of the anime which is hands down a fantastic...switch up to make the anime not a standard 6/10 anime.The story itself is an incredible way to explain first contact, a lot of the science is obviously bogus as we can't expect authors to all be PhD's in physics. But it perfectly mixes semi-fantasy with semi-sci fi. As the beginning will show it is not a standard sci-fi more advanced civilization but a being closer to god than man. This is where the premise really does an excellent job of trying to world build the idea of what zaShunina really is, it starts out as an excellent poltics meets science meets magic story but quickly it becomes apparent that isn't the main premise and thank god for it cause it was truly getting stale.The ending itself is a masterfully crafted thing, using all the foreshadowing in the world to truly bring about the idea and leaves so much open to interpretation allowing a story that you can barely wrap your head around feel much more satisfying, nothing is worse than a complicated ending but being told exactly how things ended, that being said I wouldn't mind an OVA explaining a little bit of what happened to cause the ending (you'll know what I mean when you get there.).  The biggest issue I have with the end is Yukika who, although somewhat foreshadowed, seemed poorly implemented thought that could be because they had few episodes left to work with without making it obvious what the ending would be.The characters really truly developed which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of series, you can feel the characters changing before your eyes each episode and opening up to let you peer inside and see what makes them tick, zaShunina above them all. Though Saraka's character was very stale and remained largely unchanged and somewhat boring, I didn't truly like her development as it seemed to have a huge focus and little results, though she was far from a bad character.The music is great, a mixture of Haloesque music mixed with classical fantasy hymns. Played in the perfect tone at the right times.The art is where it somewhat falls flat in my opinion, many praised the art and true it is far above what many CG series manage to do *cough* Berserk *cough* but that is like saying a man in a wheel chair is more mobile than a rotting corpse. The non-human CG is great and has incredible visuals and even the human CG is bearable but far from incredible, also the constant switching between classic drawn anime and CG was irritating and I would've much preferred only Kado be CG and perhaps the artifacts, everything else should have been drawn including zaShunina and his various powers. The fregonics CG being the only exception.Overall I loved this series, no 2nd hand embarrassment from having to watch cringe worthy characters, no obscene and out of control drama, just a nice sit back and enjoy action and political series with a touch of human emotion drama. I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't a teenager not even a year out of high school who thinks they are a physics grad student already and wants to complain the direction of its 'science' any person that thinks the science was great to begin with is just an idiot that wanted to think that, the science started off pretty bad and ended the same way because it was never meant to be a true science based series, it leans more towards fantasy and tales of gods and princesses than it does sci fi. switch up to make the anime not a standard 6/10 anime.The story itself is an incredible way to explain first contact, a lot of the science is obviously bogus as we can't expect authors to all be PhD's in physics.

That was a choice that nobody saw coming. The middle part is weak tho.Animation, character design, soundtrack are on point. The opening credit is really cool, musically and visually, and I never skipped it. The 3D is a bit hard to forget, but it’s done in a nice way.Main characters are cool and some of their dialogues are pretty neat. You can’t avoid some cliché, and...maybe you’ll roll your eyes from time to time. Still, the scenario is pretty strong in my opinion.You should give it a try.

The last four or so episodes completely buckle, wrecking established themes (negotiation), characterization (a...number of characters), stakes (human's evolution), and even tone (political drama vs...battle shounen?)That's not to say that the objective facts of the conclusion were bad - I can easily see the appeal of every choice, even the circumstances around the god-awful battle-shounen scenes - simply that the delivery was atrocious, robbing the viewer of the satisfaction of a cohesive story.Absolutely every single factor of Saraka was a mistake, though. Nothing about her...role in the plot was good. The more Saraka is featured the worse the story got, and she poisoned the depth of the anti-Imperialist subtext that allowed me to choke down that abrupt, unsatisfying ending.On the other hand, the CG is dynamic, subtle, and well-utilized. The neutral poses can be a bit stiff, but it does its work. role in the plot was good.

This is my first ever review as I felt a lot of reviews were fairly controversial, I just felt I should add my 2 cents in this.First the story I loved it. This anime to me was very unique. Alot of people seem to complain that the ending was lack luster. Plot holes. Etc Etc. But I think people forget a lot of animes are just filled with these. Now there are a few plot holes and \'Plot twist\' that come from know where as people say isn\'t completely true,  they are slight build ups and...I noticed them instantly. I didn\'t understand them fully because they are subtle such as \'What was that glare for?\'I never found the plot holes to be incredibly big \'deal breakers\' just a few rushed solutions. This anime did an AMAZING job at making they\'re characters have personality. I felt they were all unique. There isn\'t huge tropes like \'Tsundere\'  saying ""Baka Baka Baka"" every sentence.The ending did fall a bit short not to say it was BAD it just wasn\'t what you would expect from it i could say last few episodes were fairly more \'anime\' then the rest of the show. But it ENDED, which a lot animes don\'t do anymore.. they just keep it open so you read the manga/lightnovel. I didn\'t have a problem with the ending I liked it, it could of been better, although it was way more \'This is an anime\' type ending in the later episodes which was a little disappointing as they did an AMAZING JOB at keeping this anime ORIGINAL, and UNIQUE.I\'m sorry if this wasn\'t the best review this is my first ever review. I loved this anime tho. It was fresh to me and completely different from that \'No personality MC/ Otaku who gets all the girls and his own harem/ trope.I really wish I could give a better review but spoilers I feel can ruin it.

Later on, it turned out to be saving humanity from anisotropic? That\'s when things went downhill for me.Art: 10/10Truly amazing visuals for the characters and the background scenaries. Everything was beautiful and really pleasing to the eyes for a CGI anime.Sound: 10/10Music was really good in this anime, ending, opening, for showing suspense, etc....The seiyuus did a good job expressing the emotions for the characters, especially for zaShunina in the last episode. Extremely well done, felt so much emotions coming from him.Character: 9/10Character development really came a long way, especially for zaShunina. Saraka was second.Personally didn\'t like Saraka since the beginning I saw her. A tsundere debater and she turned out to be an anisotropic being, which was shocking.Shindo was really smart and definitely one of my favourite characters. Tried his best to understand zaShunina and teaching him lots of things about humanity.zaShunina started off with no signs of expressions but later started showing more emotions like a human being after the 2nd or 3rd last episode which was great and very happy to see. The last episode was the best in how he expresses his feelings for Shindo and the cycle of emotions that he showed after Hanamori and Yukika appeared. Was 100% spot on, love it! My heart broke in a million pieces for zaShunina ;-;Enjoyment: 7/10It started off really great and got me hooked to it but ended to be such a huge disappointment. 2 of my favourite characters died and it felt like it was rushed. Lots of unexpecting turn of events but they just had to make zaShunina the bad guy huh. Hated that concept/idea.Ending was pretty horrible and not what I expected. I have never disliked an ending so much. It had me go ""What? Ok ..."" I\'m still so so upset about zaShunina\'s death. I feel that they could\'ve made the fight end by him not dying? Not really for Shindo because he had to die in order to save humanity and buy time for Yukika.(Still would\'ve preferred that Shindo didn\'t need to die and go by an alternative ending of Shindo leaving for the anisotropic world with zaShunina).Overall: 7/10This anime had so much potential but the creators had to ruin it after making Saraka the main character and went off the wrong direction instead of focusing on the main plot, or at least what I expected this anime to be, which is sci-fi about ""humanity advancement"" and no romance at all. Sadly during the last few episodes, there was romance involved, which makes me want to forget them but I can\'t due to zaShunina\'s character development as a whole, it was splendid.Sigh, like the majority of the viewers, it was great while it lasted. Wouldn\'t really recommend this for plot but you might like it either way, in terms of character development and art. Think the type of audience for this is for adult anime lovers.

I feel this is becoming a bad habit of mine! I will try to keep this spoiler free, but it\'s hard to discuss my opinion of the anime without bringing to light certain aspects of the anime.First of all I want to say that I can truly understand where many of the negative reviews (or even just the 4\'s and 5\'s) are coming from. The plot does take a rather sharp, and in...my opinion, pretty much un-guessable turn around episode 10. I know it threw me for a spin, and I can see why people were so frustrated by this seemingly random change in the show.As many have mentioned, the first 8-9 episodes are pretty incredible the premise feels original, zaShunina is awe-inspiring yet inspires every curious bone in our bodies, the pacing is on the slow side, but steady, and filled with plenty of, ""whoa, holy shit really?"" moments.Then the big twist happens, and everyone suddenly seems like different people, almost literally (wink wink), the motives of zashunina are explained and feel, well, a little arbitrary, a little random, and kinda dumb. But the show does explain it if you pay attention. WARNING SPOILERS COMING zashunina is said to have in innate desire driving him to seek knowledge, and to seek more than he can process. In many ways it seems similar to our desire to eat. We need it, it drives us, and yet even when we\'ve eaten we want more, and more, and more. Always hungry, never satisfied. I\'d like to think that zaShunina, as an immortal being, has been \'never satisfied\' for basically eternity, and then suddenly meets humanity, and is like an old man suddenly seeing the Fountain of Youth or something.I guess that\'s mostly what I want to say in this review the last episodes are a climax of an inevitable struggle between the two protagonists desires, neither can give in, and, as is so human, it leads to conflict. I think this is masterful of the show to do. SPOILERS!!!! Even as zaShunina brings humanity closer to the anisotropic, he is inevitably dragged closer to being human.And that\'s really what the show was about right? Not some \'Arrivals\' esq anime about first contact, but an intense exploration into our own reality. Can there be more? Or is everything reduced down to 0\'s and 1\'s? I know I don\'t believe it is, I think there\'s more, maybe that makes me biased to like this shows ending, but hey, that\'s all opinions are right?So hats off to a show that did a marvellous job exploring questions that have plagued the greatest minds of scientists, philosophers and garbage men since the dawn of man, with what tools they had and no more answers than we have. my opinion, pretty much un-guessable turn around episode 10.

Will you accept?Story: 9Politics and Diplomatics. Sci-fi and Philosophy. Everything may seem serious and require you to think a little bit along the show. But the pacing is easy enough for you to be relaxed and enjoying the show. With mind-blowing surprises here and there to keep you interested. This is definitely the strongest point of this show.Art: 8Its another 3d series, and it's actually good. Unlike other 3d series from before like Berserk and Ajin, there is a huge leap in quality for this show. The movement looks more natural, face expression and lip-sync...also much more accurate. Although the character design still pales in comparison with the high budget 3d movies, but for a tv show this is much better than before.Also, choosing 3d for this show is the right answer (no pun intended). Because the sci-fi part of this show, also with our Alien friend nature and demeanor. Using a hand-drawn animation might be hard if not at least looks weird, hence the 3d.Sound: 7Since most of the time of the show spent with characters talking in a serious situation, there are hardly any BGM at all. It is a serious show after all. But that Op-Ed sounds really otherworldly and its mesh up nicely with the show so there is at least something to tell.Character: 7A strong willed MC that working as a public servant and being praised as the miracle worker. An Alien that is a walking ball of mysteries. The heroine that may appear as a typical tsundere but actually has a deeper meaning to it. Also with various sub-character spread across the government, military and press and even scientist. This show has a lot of variety of people with their own personality and thoughts which is good.Except, this may be a minor thing, but as a non-Japanese this may look a bit weird and biased to see that potrayal on Japs government being so clean and un-corrupted while the people of foreign organization like UN being treated as the greedy one.Enjoyment: 8Personally, i hate boring things like politics. But this show has shown me interesting stuff in sci-fi and philosophy that got me hooked into it until the end. Also probably because of those surprises that keeps popping up time to time.Overall: 8Mind-blowing sci-fi stuff, cool 3d animation and characters that full of mystery and surprises.

Have you ever thought about the progression of humanity? As a species, we have slowly evolved in terms of technology, morality, and politics that has helped us become “better” people. What if humanity could advance greatly in just a short span of time? KADO has that answer. What makes this anime so interesting is that it covers many topics on how humanity could advance, using special tools that further enhance human capabilities.It’s not just that, the more interesting part of KADO is how humanity and the main characters react to having such growth. Each character has a unique personality explores a side of KADO that hooked me fully, ranging from news coverage, to researching, to handling negotiation for this mysterious gift for humanity. This will become clear once you have watched the anime yourself, I do not want give away much away. This blend of covering human advancement topics with the reactions to KADO is what makes the anime a seriously intriguing watch.It is an anime I feel the community is severely undervaluing. Just because the last episodes of KADO have a dramatic shift in direction, it does not mean the anime can be immediately and conclusively be called bad. I can see where complaints come from, and to some extent, I agree. BUT! Truthfully, although I *somewhat* understand the themes of KADO, the last episodes were still VERY interesting enough with how the directing and dialogue was handled. These episodes do connect to the human advancement themes KADO has had right from the start with how the main characters and humanity grows throughout these 12 episodes once things are put together.Regardless if you think the last episodes of KADO was good or bad, I think we can agree that KADO did bring VERY interesting discussion! I would go as far as saying that it is nearly as much of a classic as Evangelion. Between the two, the themes of morality and human progression, I find KADO to be more interesting since it covers a more refreshing territory. Although, we'll see how people treat it the next couple of years to see if KADO becomes a cult classic. In this generation of anime fans, we’re constantly cycling through new interesting anime season by season, we forget and move on to things quickly without gaining a sense of appreciation of what makes each anime valuable in its own right. Hopefully, the “major” anime fans of the community will continue to hold on to KADO for a new generation to discuss.I've come to a point where I find over-exaggerated emotional outburst opinions not interesting anymore, regardless how detailed it may be. This is more on the negative opinion side. If it's so easy to be negative, then we lose sight on the more interesting aspects of things. Negativity brings unneeded attention as well opinions that SEEM substantial, but in the root, do not go into deeper than emotional reaction.It's why we have a life cycle of negative outbursts, never fixing the root of the problem, but quietly setting it aside, having no growth. IMO, if we wanna become better people, we have to set aside negative emotions and openly explore why certain things are so interesting. The more open you are to allowing discussion, the more curious you become in exploring many things in life, it makes life more worth it. This is why I find KADO so intriguing, because it gets you to think about a lot of things and the overall anime itself.*SPOILERS*If there’s a few things I wanted from the anime, was that it would explore Saraka more. Perhaps this was left for interpretation, or maybe it is that I have to watch the anime again to really understand Saraka more and why she kept her secret for so long. That’s another thing, there are so many things worth talking about in KADO, it easily is worth a re-watch to further explore what the anime is trying to convey. There’s also the inconsistency of CG and 2D. It’s nothing jarringly bad, but it can be a bit distracting when a scene transitions from 2D to 3D. The whole anime should have been 3D the whole time through.*SPOILERS*Overall, I personally think KADO should be hailed as an anime classic for how it really gets people to deeply discuss its themes and how human society can advance forward in the future. It is worth the watch regardless how the anime ends. Once you’ve finish the anime, you have to let me know your thoughts and your opinion on the matter. Do you personally agree?

One thing to keep in mind, you may want to watch episode 0 if you can find it, it's on crunchyroll but may be harder, as it sets up plot points within the series.Art:   beautiful and I loved it, something about how...they did alot of the art, plus using fractals and mandelbulbs throughout the series I liked.Sound:   it works, nice music, nice sound effects, everything that make for a compelling series I feel.Characters:   I liked them all, it really is about a journey and everyone feels like they have their place, and it worked for me.Overall and enjoyment:   I really enjoyed it despite a few hiccups, it won't be for everyone, but I think it's worth giving it a shot, I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to check it out and I'm glad that I did. they did alot of the art, plus using fractals and mandelbulbs throughout the series I liked.Sound:   it works, nice music, nice sound effects, everything that make for a compelling series I feel.Characters:   I liked them all, it really is about a journey and everyone feels like they have their place, and it worked for me.Overall and enjoyment:   I really enjoyed it despite a few hiccups, it won't be for everyone, but I think it's worth giving it a shot, I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to check it out and I'm glad that I did."", 'This is one of the unusual anime I saw this year.I have not seen any anime that tries to touch questions that involve entire humanity for quite some time. In a sense, the anime on occasion gives impression similar to what I experienced when I watched Ghost in the Shell for the first time. Still...It does not reach the same level, even though it obviously tries, and on occasion managed to make me feel as if I had a chance to take a look at something vast, big, alien.... or I don\'t know, it is hard to describe.Detailed breakdown below:Story: 6/10It starts out extremely...well, however, it goes through series of ups and downs later, and has wildly varying quality. Some scenes are done in magnificient fashion, yet at the next moment it manages to present some sort of sub-par event that is rather mundane and is not as well executed as what you saw before. So, it is a bit of a rollercoaster ride. One thing you see something amazing, and then ext thing, something mediocre. I also didn\'t quite agree with some of the events, some of the ideas and some of the outcomes of the story.On a related note, the anime features fully adult cast, and is not set in school Which is great.Art: 7/10:The anime uses mix of CG and traditional drawings. Half of it is performed as a full-cg render, then suddenly in the middle it starts using hand-drawn sprites, then continues using mixed approach. The CG looks great and reminds me of Sidonia No Kishi - it is the newer well executed style that blends very well with traditional animation. The use of CG is fully justified by the huge number of people, objects present in the anime, and various alien looking constructs, including kado itself. I think in the future we\'ll see more of this art style. I enjoyed it a lot, but there were a few scenes which were exectued less elegantly, and in some cases of hand-drawn characters they could use a bit more detail.Still, it looks good, and some of the moment were amazing.Sound: 7/10:I really liked the primary theme of kado that plays now and then. It had a feeling of ""magnificance"" to it, and was pleasant to listen to. The soundtrack fits the anime perfectly, without mismatching music.Character: 5/10:Surprisingly, characters are not that great. Saraka Tsukai is incredibly well done, and the most believable, most sympathetic and most amusing character out of entire cast. The rest however, is less interesting more stereotypical, and suffers from a ""carton cutout"" syndrome. Basically, all moments involving Saraka were enjoyable, while in case of other characters, behaviors and interactions are less believable, more anime-like, somewhat cliched. Also, protagonist himself has a problem of not displaying too much information.Enjoyment: 6/10:Well, I liked it. The anime surprised it, but I think it could\'ve been greater. Some of the moments presented in it were odd, and the story itself doesn\'t fully deliver what it could\'ve been. Some of the story turns in the middle were quite cliched, and though I didn\'t quite see them coming, they weren\'t that greed.Overall: 7/10:Unusual, interesting, and more ""smart"" anime that tackles difficult and BIG questions... except that it has couple of flaws, fails to deliver satisfying outcome in some cases, and some story turns are slightly underwhelming.I enjoyed watching it, and would love to see more of stuff like this. So, It is recommended to watch this one.

Yaha-kui zaShunina and Shindou had some nice chemistry and if the show focus solely on them negotiating, I wouldn't have complained. But the other characters were poorly developed, especially like Agate who for some reason the show keeps cutting to but never did anything that develop the plot.  Other characters are there for no reason (Ritsu) or just tropes for trope sake (Kanata). But I gave it a 7 because the art was good and music was nice plus the concept was thought out even if the execution left something to be desired. "", 'Spoiler Warning!So overall it was a pretty good anime, except for some things that really destroyed the anime for me.For example at the end Shindo is dead and then out of nowhere comes his daughter that he made with Saraka to kill zaShunina, it was just really confusing and after that it gets fully revealed that Saraka has a relationship with Shindos assistant.To sum it up i would wish me more romantic episodes and not just a short part with Saraka and Shindo `cause everytime it was just arguementing and that every episode.Also i would love if Shindo would be alive, because i just hate...the relationship between Saraka and Shindos Assistant.Sry for that bad review, it´s my first one xd~bye bye the relationship between Saraka and Shindos Assistant.Sry for that bad review, it´s my first one xd~bye bye', ""Technology advancement concept on this story is a bit mysterious and vast. They presented new terms, being and materials that (on their end) makes sense when mixed up altogether. For me, it's between a good and fine anime. I like the animation but I guess the downside is the terms used and how fast the story was going until the last episode. Introduicng a new character at the end to solve a problem is a surprise for me and I don't know if it's necessary or they just need a good escape to end the story because the new character have no follow up whatsoever...until the last second. until the last second."", ""Really amazing to see how to ruin something to shambles.No spoilers,  just one or at most two : this show is a spectacularly horrible.I really like good science fiction, but this show begins extremely well but manages to destroy everything it built up and ran wild over my  expectations in every way imaginable in its final episodes.After reading that this anime  deals with god like entities arrival, and watching the first five episodes, I was astounded. The sci-fi buff in me was ecstatic. It was a mature, well-written and absolutely gorgeous looking and sounding sci-fi anime that was headed in a...direction that didn't seem uncanny. It was thought-provoking and sparked a lot of discussion and made me question various things. It was a potential masterpiece, so I thought.But as the series progressed, and everything has an end. So the makers of this anime decided to ruin everything.

The plot was genuinely creative and seemed to be a masterpiece at the same time. The 2nd half or should I say the  last quarter was an unmitigated disaster for the most part. I don't think any other show with such a promising beginning can be ruined so greatly. It's really amazing to ruin something so badly.Character (4/10): Just like the plot, the MC  end up getting appalling.

Teekyuu 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20473/Teekyuu_3,"['Teekyuu is what you would get if you took a ""tropes in slice-of-life"" textbook and ramped the pacing up to light-speed.Watching all thirty-six short episodes in a row is not advised, as doing so will set your brain into meltdown mode. It is difficult to remember anything that happens in Teekyuu... because, hell, how could you? There is no time to think or process anything beyond ""I like that girl\'s ponytail!"" or ""Huh, I guess that just happened."" Teekyuu is an experience that can be likened to a nasty hangover; the kind that results in your memory being a foggy mess and your dignity...being, maybe, just a tiny bit damaged.Teekyuu can best be described as a show wherein high school girls talk like chipmunks and occasionally (okay-- never) play tennis. If you came here for the sports, look away. Look very, very far away. Nearly every episode involves the four girls doing something inane and often nonsensical- a two minute joke leading up to a single punchline. The humour is passable in the sense that it is inoffensive, although I don\'t imagine anyone will be laughing unless they are incredibly bored or incredibly stoned. Maybe both.So what about the characters? What about them, indeed. After thirty-six episodes, I don\'t know any more about them than I did at the start. The girls can only be differentiated by their single defining trait: ponytail-chick, freaky-loli-chick, blue-haired-chick, and Nasuno-- wait, who was that again?That said, it\'s unfair to expect profound characterisation from a short comedy series. The problem is that they have /no/ characterisation. The girls are not even defined enough that their personalities can play off each other, which severely hampers the comedy as a direct result. I think the only instance where there was any kind of chemistry was when the blue-haired-girl (I am purposely avoiding proper names here) experimented with different hairstyles, eventually finding herself with a ponytail which then results in ponytail-chick accusing blue-haired-girl of stealing her character. Oh, wait... that\'s playing on a single trait. Again. Oops.The animation is mediocre at best. It\'s clear as day that the studio had very little budget to work on. The characters look stilted and occasionally inhuman when in motion, although the animation is often removed in favour of static scenes wherein the girls scream at whatever nonsense is currently happening. It\'s difficult to even tell what the hell is going on from the visuals since it will cut to a new scene after about two seconds. It is insanity in motion.Teekyuu\'s sound is slightly better, although that isn\'t much of a compliment. The theme song is catchy but takes up a valuable thirty seconds of screen-time. The background music on the other hand is hardly noticeable in the midst of all the craziness that occurs. At least the voice acting is decent.If nothing else, Teekyuu is a decent way to pass a few minutes whenever you find yourself especially bored. It\'s almost charming in how ridiculous it is. Whether you find the notion of ""cute girls who talk really fast and (probably) take drugs"" amusing is up to you, but I do suggest having a bucket beside you while watching.

It\'s starting to latch onto consistency as if begging to be relevant. It\'s pathetic, but it\'s also cute. I\'m glad that, in some way, the show is starting to get a feel for what it wants to be.

It doesn't look so stop motiony...anymore, which is a relief after the first season where it was choppy and dull.The characters are slowly becoming more developed. Well, scratch that, Yuri is becoming more developed. The other characters retain their stupidity, we just see how Yuri grows to love them after a while.Overall, I enjoyed this probably more than I should've. :DI would recommend this if you: like crack stuff, like parodiesI would NOT recommend this if you: like overarching plots, didn't like the rest of TeekyuuHave a great day everyone! anymore, which is a relief after the first season where it was choppy and dull.The characters are slowly becoming more developed.

Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12783/Sora_no_Otoshimono_Final__Eternal_My_Master,"['""How can we make the most unsatisfying ending possible, while still technically concluding something?""I am convinced that this is what the directors/writers/whoever asked themselves when making this film.Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master is a film that replaced the would-be third season of Sora no Otoshimono, an anime I find sadly underrated. It\'s often cast aside as yet another pile of trash fanservice, when in fact it has an incredibly deep storyline, as well as fantastic emotion and drama. SnO Final forgets about all of that-- no, they deliberately ignore it in this mess of a film.The SnO manga had mountains of story left...to tell. A third season would have barely managed to fit all of that in, but it was still possible. When it was confirmed that we were getting a second film instead, that dream was crushed. Yet there was still hope. Towards its end the anime deviated from the manga, making it possible that this new movie might provide a unique ending while still borrowing key elements from the source material. We were worried, but we had faith. What we got, however, was nothing of the sort.The movie begins with Ikaros\' dramatic climax from the second-to-last chapter. Immediately this is unsettling; there was no way they could fit the massive final arc and all of its setup into this 50 minute timeblock. The scene progresses, and ends approximately where the chapter does. It then cuts away to several months prior, a typical day at the Sakurai household. From this point to the penultimate scene, the film is nothing but random filler chapters meshed together to create a bastardization of the romantic progression between Ikaros and Tomoki. Chapters are placed where they don\'t belong for no rhyme or reason, important plot points are tweaked to move along this clusterfuck of a story, and the supporting cast is reduced to comic relief and pointless exposition. But this isn\'t even the worst offense. Consistently, the film teases all of the major plotlines. ALL of them! And what do we get from it? NOTHING!! Absolutely nothing, as if to say ""All this cool stuff happened, but you don\'t get to see it."" I may not speak for everyone, but I for one was offended by this. This movie\'s lack of care for the audience\'s appreciation of detail was insulting. In the end, Ikaros\' dramatic climax concludes, and the movie ends... bitter, and incomplete.One may argue that speaking from the point of view of somebody who read the manga is unfair, and that I should take it as a piece of the anime and nothing more. Ok, let\'s try that.Right off the bat I have no clue what\'s going on. What is Zeus? Why are they attacking it? What happened to Nymph and Sugata? Where is everybody else? Why is the world falling apart?All of these questions come from the first scene alone, and the rest of the movie fails to answer any of them. This movie expects you to have read the manga, and is impossible to review from any perspective otherwise. That said, I feel it does an incredible injustice to the manga and its fans, blatantly disregarding everything that made it so special in the first place, just to say they half-assedly resolved their love story.I\'ve seen many disappointing anime in my time, but none are as painful as a disappointing ending to a good anime.

Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal My Master was just that.', 'When the Sora no Otoshimono manga finally ended about half a year ago, I was honestly amazed. Why? Because the ending was absolutely beautiful! Given that this is an ecchi story, the amount of emotional impact the manga conclusion had is still unmatched to me for its genre. Now as a result I was of course very much so looking forward to seeing this finale closing out the anime series as well.Now that I\'ve seen it however... let\'s just say that this ""Final"" movie doesn\'t do the manga justice. At all.Assuming that you\'ve seen all the prior seasons of Sora no Otoshimono before watching this,...you should already know what to expect. It is the same good old character cast and the same good old perverted yet hilarious sketches. The only thing that really changes for real towards the end is of course the story.The word ""rushed"" is not strong enough for this one. The pacing of Eternal My Master is a mess. It basically rushes through the remaining manga chapters like a runaway train, skipping a huge amount of content in-between, and while many of the key scenes are still adapted, the transition between them isn\'t executed well at all. As a result, the story just ends up needlessly hard to follow and the supposed emotional impact misses its mark.Above all though, what really let me down was the ending itself. It just wasn\'t the same. Literally. The super emotional conclusion the manga had just didn\'t exist. Numerous key scenes from the very last chapters simply aren\'t there, and the epilogue is straight-up missing. Hell it hardly even properly explains why the ending it *does* have actually happens the way it does. Overall it just doesn\'t leave you feeling satisfied at all.As a whole, the production value is still good and the girls are still as likable as ever, and really those are the only reasons I\'m kind enough to give it a 4 overall. However the story is just incredibly poorly executed and as a result it will only leave you disappointed in the end.TL;DR - Read the manga ending instead, pretend this one doesn\'t exist. you should already know what to expect.

If you were expecting something like the scene where Nymph's master tells her to bring her pet and shit goes down, prepare to be disappointed. The movie has about 5 whole minutes of serious moments, confusing but serious, and then the rest of the movie is filler/fan service. The first few minutes show the world being destroyed and people dying and all this crazy shit happening with no explanation. The beginning and ending was good although it felt confusing. The...first few minutes showed promise but they never developed on it. I wasn't sure if I was missing some plot because I didn't read the manga but the middle part felt pointless. They do a flash back and show a lot of filler. Characters chilling and talking and making jokes. It didn't have very much to do with the opening and ending and felt like jokes instead of a serious movie. You could remove most of the middle part and the over story will still be intact. The main poster is Ikaros holding Tomoki while her wings are on fire, I was expecting something badass. The trailer showed all the action scenes and left out all the filler scenes. Instead of watching a movie I paid $10 to watch, it felt like I was watching an OVA. If you wanted a light hearted comedy then this movie will make you happy. I expected a lot more than a comedy and wanted something serious.Art: 8/10The art is still really good. It carries on over from the show. Tomoki looks a little different but not to the point it becomes a problem. Everyone else looks exactly like I remember. Nothing in the movie happened that really let the art shine so I can't really give it a high score. They used a lot of flash backs within the flash backs, scenes from the show so it was weird seeing Tomoki change back and forth.Sound 8/10The sound is still good just like the show. The sound track is still beautiful as well as the ending song done by Blue Drops. Blue drops has done most of the OPs and EDs of the show and movies, so hearing them return was a nice treat. I recommend everyone check out the end song cause it's really good. Not much else to say about the soundtrack besides that it was good.Character: 7/10Can't say much about the characters. Only Ikaros changes a lot, and Tomoki a little. Ikaros has the most character development and we get to see her change from being an emotionless girl to something more interesting. All the other characters seem to stay the same. No one I can remember changed that much. Ikaros became a real character at the end and Tomoki's relationship between Ikaros and himself grew stronger which was probably the only good thing to come out of this movie.Enjoyment: 7/10I did enjoy it a lot but for different reasons. I wasn't touched because of it's touching story. I was mostly just laughing at the jokes and being aroused by the fan service. I was expecting the dark story but got something completely different. Although I wasn't completely disappointed I wasn't too happy with it. In my mind I thought shit was gonna go down and people die and tears shed but instead we got 45 minutes of characters running around making a few jokes and Tomoki being perverted.Overall: 6/10I can't recommend this anime to all Sora no Otoshimono fans. Overall it felt like it could have just been an OVA rather than a movie. I believe the original plan was to make a season 3 but instead made a movie. So instead of having 4 hours of content, they some how managed to shorten it to 49 minutes, and you can guess how that turned out. Maybe I hyped it too much, people were telling me that they were adapting the serious part of the manga and I got a few minutes of that but for the most part it was just jokes which is what I got from the anime. I recommend people just stream it rather than buy it or go watch it in theaters if you are lucky. If you wanted a light hearted story then this is perfect for you.

In other words, it feels like being betrayed.Sora no Otoshimono  Final: Eternal My Master is one of the movie that have been most anticipation and one that have been through so many controversies. One of them is making this one into a movie. The first plan for Sora no Otohimono Final: Eternal My Master is making this into a series format but suddenly. they\'re changing it into a movie without any particular reasons. The result? We have a very much rushed and unclear story.Sora...no Otoshimono  Final: Eternal My Master taking a place after the first movie, Sora no Otoshimono: Tokeijikake no Angeloid. The story in this movie is mainly focussing on the relation between Tomoki and Ikaros and how their life works after the previous movie and thats it. There isnt any plot and moreover, the whole story is a mess. At the first we have some dramatic scenes between Ikaros and Tomoki then after that we would seeing an usual SnO, which is comedy between the characters but then back again with some dramatic scenes without explaining whats happen with the first dramatic scenes. As the result, the emotional scenes that probably the director wants misses the mark and loses its impacts.The other things that should be noticed how this anime doesnt explain anything in the end. As for a ""closing""movie to the series, this movie doesnt explain anything like what really Ikaros do in the past? Where is Zeus? What is the black hole that appear in the sky? and  so on. It leaves a big question and bring confused to viewers that doesnt read the manga like me.But after all that, there is a good aspects that keep mestill to watch it until the end. It was the fillers. If you\'re expecting this anime would ""finally"" focus solely on serious story, this maybe a letdown. Since, nearly 80% of this movie still have an entertaining and funny scenes like the usual Sora no Otoshimono. The jokes as usual is great and the characters is still fun and lovely to watch. Moreover, the Tomoki\'s harem increasing with the presence of Chaos. However, funny scenes like this would confused us with where do they want to bring this anime? A serious one or like the usual one (Rom-com)?The art and sound in this anime isn\'t much a thing,of course for movie format the quality is a little bit better than the series one but in the end, it doesnt much mean anything while the story is a mess.As a fan of Sora no Otoshimono, this movie is surely a disappointing and makes me think what is in the director\'s head when making this. Is it a marketing sales so people would buy the manga for knowing what happen or the director just want to make a mess? who knows. Well, i really hope they make another movie or probably series to be a bridge for explaining what happen in this movie. no Otoshimono  Final: Eternal My Master taking a place after the first movie, Sora no Otoshimono: Tokeijikake no Angeloid.

', ""Warning : spoilers ahead. For those who don't want to be spoiled, stay away from this review XDWell, where do we start?We all knew that there would be some disappointments after watching this movie. When I saw the title, 'Final', I expect something great. Building a story to a good final arc, and giving a good final conclusion. Well, my expectations was not fulfilled at all. But it doesn't mean this movie was terrible at all, I just feel this shouldn't be a final movie for Sora no Otoshimono franchise. Fans that only follow the anime (including me) would be extremely disappointed.First problem of this...movie is.. the story, or I should say the only problem. At first few minutes (around 5 minutes), we got to see amazing and emotional scenes. It was a good start of the movie. After that suddenly we were shown daily lives in Tomoki's house. It makes the watcher eager to wait to see how the story goes until that first amazing scenes happened. But.. unfortunately.. we won't get it. The movie only tells comedic daily lives and interaction between characters until before the emotional final scene.Just by watching this movie, eventhough I haven't read the manga, I know this movie skipped a lot of chapters. Anime watcher wil really have no idea how the story becomes like that. Honestly, rather than making the movie like that, I think if it would be a final movie, it would be definitely better to adapt the final arc of the manga, even though it would feel rushed.Okay, leave the negative points behind (and my personal disappointment T.T), this movie also got good points. For the art, well, it wasn't improved from the previous series/movie, I think. Or was the previous movie even do a better job (doubt)? Anyway, the animation was pretty good. But too bad we got no battle scene in this movie. For the sound I think the BGM was good, especially when Ikaros flies to synapse. ED song was good too.Next, for the characters. Previous characters are back, even Chaos is back. I missed them a little bit. They still have the same personalities.  For character development, we don't see much, except that we could see emotional side of Ikaros and I like it.Now, for the enjoyment. If this movie was actually an OVA and wasn't a final movie, I could get some good enjoyment. There are some good comedic and touching scenes which I really enjoy. What brings my enjoyment down is that this movie was a final movie.Well, overall score from me would be 6. I still don't understand why they made the final movie like this. Do they want us anime watcher to read the manga? Anyway, this movie is still worth watching and really really make you want to read the manga (I'll read it immediately after this!!). movie is.. the story, or I should say the only problem.

Anyway, this movie is still worth watching and really really make you want to read the manga (I'll read it immediately after this!!)."", ""It is my subjective view of this anime...so provokes are not welcomed..Before I mention about this movie, There are a few things I want to say.I really really really love this anime. Afrter watching 'Sora no Otoshimono' I cried a lot..The story was touching, the characters were very attractive, and the music(OST, OPs, EDs, etc) was great. At least I thought so.After I finished watching the 1st season of the anime, I watched Forte, Tokei-Jikake no Angeloid, and so on..And recently I watched the final series of the sora no otoshimono, Sora no otoshimono final eternal my master.The most regretful thing was the story..and I...think other fans would feel the same.According to the PV of this movie, it said that this movie will contain the truth of the original manga, which made me look forward to this and excited..But after I finished watching this movie, the questions I had before still wasn't solved and it only left more. Additionaly, the story was sort of incomplete..which made me anooyed and puzzled at the same time.I was shocked as the story unfolded. At first, without any detailed explanation, tomoki and ikaros were going to synapse with some purpose.And then, ikaros tells tomoki about her past and why she must take tomoki to synapse. Since I alreay watched the original manga, I could understand what they were talking about but to those who haven't watched the manga, it would be an very unkind beginning.And then suddenly the scene changes and the time goes backwards...I can't remember more specefic details about the story but the ending was extremely impressive(not for a too good reason) that I will never forget it.It might be a spoiler to the fans who haven't watched it yet so I won't say exactly what happened. But the time goes back to the present and the synapse appears again..Actually, the ending was disappointing, but not only disappointing, it left a strong aftertaste. Though I couldn't watch how tomoki recreated the world, and how he took a revenge on Minos, and other various scenes, I still liked it.I could watch the happy moments of  tomoki's everyday life and about the ikaros's expressionless face.It felt more like an long OVA than a final movie, but I'm still satisfied with it.On the other hand, the art was pretty nice.The hair color of many characters changed a lot and was more neat. The line had become a lot thinner and  coloring became much lighter compared to the anime. In my opinion, I sort of liked this but because I knew the reason, I wasn't so happy about it. I'll say about this later..The biggest difference was the eye. Before the color much thichker and I think the eyebrows were more detailed. But after the inner part of the eye looked more simple as just filling the color with a monotone(In my private opinion).About the Sound, It was good and not so good at the same time.Actually, All of the musics used in this movie weren't new except the 'Always Smiling' and the 'ERSE', and BGM-1,2,3,4.Many musics were from the OST albums of the first and second season of the anime(Tenshi ga Kureta Gekibanshuu, Heart ga Me wo Samasu Ongakushu, etc)Since I loved all the musics of soraoto, I was expecting a new album including many new OSTs but I could only get a few more songs..The Characters had changed a lot from the first and second season of the anime and the first movie. Especially, Ikaros had changed more than any other characters. She even disobeyed her master tomoki and tried to throw away him(Of course, it wasn't her fault. That bad bad bad tomoki oredered ikaros to remove her imprinting from tomoki in order to watch ikaros's smile although that wasn't the best solution.).Also there was something interesting about Kazane Hiyori. After she disappeared because of the dimension bomb(?) in the first movie, she said that she had went to many parallel universes but could only find tomoki in this universe. I wasn't able to understand what exactly she meant..(After all Soraoto isn't science anime haha)Enjoyment...hmm..there were many erotic scenes but since I focused on the main story, it wasn't that interesting,,but was still fine.I don't have much thing to say about this.Overall. Yes, there is a reason why this movie was so different and had such an ending.The Original company which made the first and second season of the anime and the movie tokei jikake no angeloid was 'AIC A.S.T.A.'.But because of the insufficiency of funds for various reasons, the company sort of fails and the staff members of AIC establishes a new anime company called 'Production IMS'.The reasons why the art style changed and why the story was unkind and incomplete could be partially explained.Thanks for reading my review..Since my natvie language is Korean instead of Englinsh, there might be some grammatical errors. think other fans would feel the same.According to the PV of this movie, it said that this movie will contain the truth of the original manga, which made me look forward to this and excited..But after I finished watching this movie, the questions I had before still wasn't solved and it only left more.

But the time goes back to the present and the synapse appears again..Actually, the ending was disappointing, but not only disappointing, it left a strong aftertaste. Though I couldn't watch how tomoki recreated the world, and how he took a revenge on Minos, and other various scenes, I still liked it.I could watch the happy moments of  tomoki's everyday life and about the ikaros's expressionless face.It felt more like an long OVA than a final movie, but I'm still satisfied with it.On the other hand, the art was pretty nice.The hair color of many characters changed a lot and was more neat. The line had become a lot thinner and  coloring became much lighter compared to the anime. In my opinion, I sort of liked this but because I knew the reason, I wasn't so happy about it. I'll say about this later..The biggest difference was the eye. Before the color much thichker and I think the eyebrows were more detailed. But after the inner part of the eye looked more simple as just filling the color with a monotone(In my private opinion).About the Sound, It was good and not so good at the same time.Actually, All of the musics used in this movie weren't new except the 'Always Smiling' and the 'ERSE', and BGM-1,2,3,4.Many musics were from the OST albums of the first and second season of the anime(Tenshi ga Kureta Gekibanshuu, Heart ga Me wo Samasu Ongakushu, etc)Since I loved all the musics of soraoto, I was expecting a new album including many new OSTs but I could only get a few more songs..The Characters had changed a lot from the first and second season of the anime and the first movie. Especially, Ikaros had changed more than any other characters. She even disobeyed her master tomoki and tried to throw away him(Of course, it wasn't her fault. That bad bad bad tomoki oredered ikaros to remove her imprinting from tomoki in order to watch ikaros's smile although that wasn't the best solution.).Also there was something interesting about Kazane Hiyori. After she disappeared because of the dimension bomb(?) in the first movie, she said that she had went to many parallel universes but could only find tomoki in this universe. I wasn't able to understand what exactly she meant..(After all Soraoto isn't science anime haha)Enjoyment...hmm..there were many erotic scenes but since I focused on the main story, it wasn't that interesting,,but was still fine.I don't have much thing to say about this.Overall. Yes, there is a reason why this movie was so different and had such an ending.The Original company which made the first and second season of the anime and the movie tokei jikake no angeloid was 'AIC A.S.T.A.'.But because of the insufficiency of funds for various reasons, the company sort of fails and the staff members of AIC establishes a new anime company called 'Production IMS'.The reasons why the art style changed and why the story was unkind and incomplete could be partially explained.Thanks for reading my review..Since my natvie language is Korean instead of Englinsh, there might be some grammatical errors."", ""Well, what can I say.. I haven't read the manga. Some months ago, I found out about Heavens Lost Property and watched the series. I was astonished by the plot, the characters and the comedy it offers. Its really a great anime. Then, I found out about the first movie - The clockwork angeloid. It was a nice and emotional movie, however it did not live up to my expectations. And then we got this.. Eternal my master.Being one of the very few that have not read the manga, this movie was a disaster. Even though I really had NO idea what was going on...at the first scene, I was confident that they would fill it up somehow.Boy, how wrong I was.After that scene, we are returned to the classic mood and style of HLP. Some Ecchi's we all know and love from the series, lots of fun times and that obvious, but entertaining harem part of the anime were all present. I liked the emotional part with Ikaros throughout. However, just after that part of the plot ends, the horror kicked in..SPOILER ALERT AHEAD. STOP READING IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED YET. OVERALL, ITS BETTER NOT TO WATCH THE MOVIE IF YOU'VE NOT READ THE MANGA LIKE ME. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.To my unpleasant surprise, the first scene continues, and we see Ikaros with Tomoki up in the sky. Ikaros keeps on burning, and Tomoki keeps on screaming for her to go back. Ikaros, out of the blue, tells him she's in love, and for the first time ever, we see her smile. She throws Tomoki into synapse and she gets destroyed. Then the movie ends.Yes. Just like that. Astrea was probably already dead on the first scene, Nymph died at that very time, I have NO idea what zeus is, I dont know why Sugata is hurt, I never learned what happened to the blue-haired girl, I don't know how Hyiori remained alive, and finally, I have NO IDEA why Ikaros sacrificed herself to get Tomoki into synapse. What hurt me the most is that they killed off the ENTIRE cast without telling us why. This not only ruined the manga for me, because now I know that after some emotional struggles Ikaros will die, but it ruined my overall impression of the anime. I liked the characters. I knew they would probably die, but skipping the final battle, skipping Tomoki's actions after Ikaros died, skipping Astrea and Nymph's deaths, skipping Sugata's injury, skipping EVERY MAJOR PLOT POINT in a movie and expecting it to turn out good is simply unacceptable.A big, big disappointment overall. at the first scene, I was confident that they would fill it up somehow.Boy, how wrong I was.After that scene, we are returned to the classic mood and style of HLP.

All it did was put the most vague  yet the most obvious answer to the SnO series. With a conclusion included on the synopsis, I decided to see this 2nd movie since the 1st movie somewhat pulled me into it.I can tell that this SnO movie tried more than it can offer. The story tried to put all things at random, with the usual antics of the gang plus inserted serious footage, I can't even switch my senses as I just left the movie seen only by my eye and not through my mind. I didn't...even bother to understand what it is trying to send to the audiences or what is it about. I clearly don't want to say something rude about the movie since I can vividly remember the fact that I enjoyed SnO TV series way back some years ago. It's a terrible experience to see something you like, massacred in a bland fashion and that's how I can put how this 2nd movie went.I could say nothing to the art and sound. It was the usual quality. The feeling of the TV series was retained and Sorami City was still shown as a free and lax city with UMA a.k.a Angeloids roaming around. The ED theme was somewhat closely derived from the movie content itself and it was satisfying to hear at most.Characters, are all right, I guess? They're the same rowdy group that put antics over the much more important details. However, in this movie, the story focuses much more on Tomoki's and Ikaros' struggle to realize their affection with each other under the over-the-limit denseness.I am not a reader of the reference so I definitely don't have an idea as to how it went, or what should it really be, but if this is an honest adaptation then it's all more the worth the time missing it.Concluding, SnO Final: Eternal My Master is a bad experience and is a hurtful reminder of what a show SnO is all about. I was honestly drawn by SnO due to Tomoki's perversion and along the way, I couldn't even realized that SnO is something serious over gag. And giving a conclusion where love prevails is something this show should have left untouched. even bother to understand what it is trying to send to the audiences or what is it about.

Least to say, I was disappointed. There was really no explanation for things that needed to be explained and left you with a thought ""Well now what?"". Honestly, you\'d be better off finishing the manga before watching this movie, it\'ll make alot more sense to you. ', 'OMFG you don\'t please just don\'t watch this movie!If you\'re a Sora no Otoshimono fan you\'ll be utterly disappointed with this ""movie."" It literally provides no ending to the series and doesn\'t even make the effort to animate the fights against the Synapse.Read the manga! The last 20 chapters of the manga are amazing and that end ohhhhhh that end is so worth it compared to this vomit of story called ""Eternal My Master.""This is why I tell everyone if you like a series/show find the true (Canon) source. The manga specially the last chapters were terrific this ""movie"" is the complete opposite! ', '""Awful"" ""confusing"" ""major let down"" ""WISH I NEVER WATCHED IT!""The series Sora no Otoshimono i recommend it\'s great in all perspectives and i enjoyed it it\'s just this movies is a major let down.I found this movie to be extremely horrible due to its huge gaps in information and the story is all over the place. The movie starts with an intense scene that leaves you wonder how it got to be that way. When it cuts back in time it does so to show a meaningless heap of sh!t before returning to the climax with no explanation what so ever.PEOPLE SHOULDN\'T DIE WITH...NO EXPLANATION!WHO ARE THE NEW PEOPLE WITH 4 WINGS?WHY DID EARTH GET DESTROYED?WHY WAS THERE A F@#%#*! FILLER LIKE EPISODE INSTEAD OF ALL THIS? NO EXPLANATION!WHO ARE THE NEW PEOPLE WITH 4 WINGS?WHY DID EARTH GET DESTROYED?WHY WAS THERE A F@#%#*! FILLER LIKE EPISODE INSTEAD OF ALL THIS?', 'Heaven\'s lost property has been a rather interesting anime for me to watch as a whole.  It was a show that I hated, due to its overuse of its ecchi elements, but was a show I really liked because of how much depth and actual plot and story that the show had, which made it stand out from other harem shows that exist.  And so, for the conclusion of the anime adaptation of a rather decently made show, we have this...steaming pile...  (aka Sora no Otoshimono Final:  Eternal my Master.)Story (3.40/10):  The story of this so-called ""movie"" goes with...well, I\'m...honestly not sure.  According to the description, it\'s supposed to be the ""final"" movie to wrap up the Sora no Otoshimono anime.  This statement is completely and utterly false.  Cause really, all you get in this movie is essentially a plot about Ikaros, and a bunch of plot holes.For the plot involving Ikaros, which was essentially the main part of the movie, we get a new bit of depth to her character as she gets freed by Tomoki, removing her link to him, and thus becoming free like her sisters Nymph and Aestrea.  This part of the movie gave a lot of depth to Ikaros\'s character which made her a bit more of a three dimensional character rather than just ""another harem girl"".  While this was a well made part of the movie, everything else was rather...lackluster.For one thing, at the beginning of the movie, we get a sort of ""ending"" where we are shown a scene of what seems to be the climax of the movie, before we\'re abruptly put into a completely different situation with Tomoki and the Angeloids at home which feels like a very awkward transition because not only the beginning does this, but the entire movie does.  The movie itself consists of many, many transitions to different scenes that change both the characters involved, and the mood and tone of the show.  As a viewer, this is a very awkward experience as the movie never stays consistent with what it wants to do, ending with mostly confusion rather than a synergistic plot.In addition, the whole of the movie skips a lot of details.  (Similar to how TWGOK goddess arc skipped over two of the more important arcs in the series.)  The viewer is basically thrown into a storyline that unless you\'ve read the manga, is unfamiliar, even if you\'ve seen both seasons and the movie before this one.And now, for the nail in the coffin, the one thing that makes this movie deserve a 3 rating for story, the ending.  For one thing, the story ends in a cliffhanger; the one taboo that every production studio should know by now upsets the audience because of how unsatisfying it is.  Not only does it end on a cliffhanger, it ends on a note that leaves a lot to be explained seeing as how the event that the movie ends with is such a shocking event that it created a sense of rage within me because I expected a lot from this movie, seeing as how the anime built up the story and characters rather well.  And seeing the whole thing end with something of this poor quality...it\'s a little heartbreaking.Overview:+  Good character development for Ikaros-   Awful scene transitions- -  Worst...ending...ever.  (Yes, that is two negatives.  Does not equal a positive.)Characters (7.22/10):  The characters of the Sora no Otoshimono stay for the most part, same for the movie as they did for the anime.  For the most part, aside from the main two characters of Ikaros and Tomoki, there isn\'t very much change to their characters.Ikaros mostly gets the development for this movie.  And for her development, we get a better look to her character and her connection with Tomoki.  What I like about this development is how we get to see and explore more of Ikaros as she realizes more of herself over the course of the movie.  And what really makes her character is one simple thing, emotions.  (If you know Ikaros\'s character, than you would understand how much of a change that will make.)There were however some members of the cast that I felt were some very strange additions.  That being the two angeloids of Chaos and Zeta (Hiyori).  While Chaos was a decent addition considering how her arc in the end of the second season would match up to her appearance in the movie.Hiyori however is a different story.  Hiyori is the angeloid that appeared in the first Sora no Otoshimono movie.  And because of her appearance in the last movie and what had happened to her, her appearance in this movie was rather surprising.  (So surprising that I actually had to pause the film and think for five minutes as to WHY she would even be here.)  Her very appearance in the film is evidence enough to show that the movie skipped over a LOT of detail from the last movie which shows how bad the creators screwed up with the passage of time from this film and the last.  They even bothered us to show us some scenes involving events with the other characters that apparently we were supposed to know.  (Cause I don\'t remember one of characters getting stabbed in any part of the anime.)Overview:+  Consistent main characters+  Great character development for Ikaros-  Confusing character addition.  (Hiyori)Art and Sound (7.56/10 and 7.00/10):  The art for Sora no Otoshimono has always been one of its strong points because of how distinct it is.  The show switches its normal style of animation with a chibi style of animation, interchanging between the two during comedy moments, and even making them exist in the same scene.  It\'s a very distinct style that fits very well for the show, considering how detailed the standard style looks and how well integrated the two styles go with each other.As for music, the sound for this movie seems to be as good quality as what the anime openings and endings had.  While it wasn\'t as prominent, the sound was still rather nice, though I would admit it\'s not as memorable as it could be.Overview:+  Good and distinct visual style+  Good integration between both animation styles+/-  Decent soundPersonal Enjoyment (2.33/10):  To be honest, I hate this movie.  I\'ve always been impartial with the Sora no Otoshimono series because it has 1 part of it that I love, and another part that I hate.  That being the actual story and the ecchi.  The plot I felt has always been a strong point in the series as it gives a nice bit of mystery and has always kept me interested.  However, as an inverse, I\'ve always felt that the ecchi part of the show was a bit distracting and a bit out of place because it was always done in an extreme, an extreme that I personally don\'t like.  Well, enough of my opinion on the series.  Time for my opinion on the movie.For one thing, this shouldn\'t even be called a movie.  It barely breaks an hour of runtime, it\'s basically as long as GJ-bu\'s OVA which has a runtime of 45 minutes.  (A movie is generally at the very least 1.5 hours.  Even anime movies.)  Another thing is the fact that this movie basically downgrades the quality of this series because despite its overactive ecchi portions, Sora no Otoshimono is still a good series.  I just felt a bit disappointed when watching this because I expected a lot of things, good things since this movie was supposed to wrap up the series as a whole which it failed to do because it left out so many details and explanations, turning it into a mass of plot holes and confusion than anything else.In addition, this was originally supposed to be the third season of the anime, existing in a 12-13 episode long season.  Why they made the change, I\'m not sure, (probably budget cuts or something), but really, I was disappointed because story-wise, the plot would\'ve been much better and better explained seeing as how a 49 minute movie compared to a 12 episode long season of 24 minutes is quite a gap for screentime.  Personally, I would\'ve liked to see a third season.  Hell, I would watch a loop of Tomoki\'s nipple song for 10 hours in order to get a third season.  (That\'s a figure of speech.  No one take that too literally, k?)  Alright then, 3 question time.Did I like this movie?Well...kinda.  The movie did some good things by giving Ikaros more character development and more qualities to her character, which is always welcome in any anime series since character development is what makes us the audience relate to the character and attach ourselves to them as they go about the story plot.What didn\'t I like?Plot holes, cliffhanger read the manga ending, awkward transisitons, uncomfortable ecchi moments; need I say more?Would I recommend this to anyone?If you\'ve watched both anime series Sora no Otoshimono and Sora no Otoshimono: Forte in addition to the movie Sora no Otoshimono tokeijikake no angeloid, well, you gotta finish the whole thing, right?  Well, not really.  This movie to me is sort of like Madoka Magica rebellion in a sense of how you personally would want the series to end.  (I\'m personally sticking with the anime ending in that discussion.)  You can either stay with the anime\'s ending and keep that in mind as the ""ending"" of the series, or you can watch this and ""accept"" this as the true ending of the series.  Really though, I would say not to as the anime already diverges from the original source material, and the endings for the anime and even the first movie are far better than the one that this one provides.  In short, Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal my Master is by far the worst alliteration in this franchise.  It\'s clunky, poorly written, and very, very confusing.  Personally, I would not recommend it, as I find it to be a very poor viewing experience.Overall Score:  (4.98/10) honestly not sure.

I saw what they left out, and for my enjoyment, after reading the last pieces of manga, I noticed that I had been right! The story is amazing! It truly is. But this last movie was not. It cut out too much of important stuff and I feel like the creators didn't really care. They rushed this just so the anime could have a conclusion and so they cut out the most important stuff (which can...be figured out or at least guessed if you pay attention during the films as I did).  I am the kinda guy who likes to see the happy ending with no space for the viewers interpretation (in some cases). This could have been one. But yet again, as this last movie was what it was, it didn't do honor for the manga - so people, if after watching this amazing anime, and then when the credits of SnO Final Eternal My Master start to roll and you feel disappointed / confused, here's my advice: read the manga (at least the ending) so you really see how the things ended and what really happened! be figured out or at least guessed if you pay attention during the films as I did).

This is the question that will appear on your head when you have finished this movie!. There are people who read manga or anime, Of course people who watch both. Having said that, This movie has totally stabbed the fans of ""Heaven\'s Lost Property"" with the ""Empire State Building"", No exaggeration.I\'m a huge fan of the series, I had high hopes for this film and i feel betrayed. Right on the start. The World is disintegrating and you\'re like, What the hell is going on? Tomoki and Ikarus appear to be the only ones left there,...They\'re talking about ""Zeus"" and i also was like what\'s that, Tomoki asks Ikarus to take him to the synapse and she does and also reveals that she would die if so and goes regardless. At this point you\'re like? Any time now? I want to know what\'s going on?.So the story starts and i had a good laughs but as the time transpired i was sweating cold and being like Ok, Where the hell is my explanation? The movie reaches the end back to the beginning and Ikarus dies and launches tomoki into the synapse, Right before saying "" I love you my master"" and The end.What the fuck is that? What in the multiple world of fuck was that? That\'s what i want to know. For any fan that hasn\'t watched ""Heaven\'s Lost Property: Eternal My Master"" DON\'T WATCH IT. It will taint your current regard of the series, I\'m having nightmares on this.Sohara, Mikado, Astrea, Chaos, Nymph, Hiyori all wipe out of existence and you will not know where are they at? what happened? At all!  I repeat.This movie has good comedy, good drama, But the movie is about ""What the hell is going on"" and what you really see is ""Shuffled memories of Ikarus and Tomoki plus a love confession and a kiss"" and The END.  I\'m so mad, I am now wishing to have stopped my self from watching this film. The memories and the countless times i\'ve watched the series have been crapped on and stabbed multiple times, Please don\'t do this to your self, I wish someone had told me not to watch it, Now what do i do with the anime i currently own plus the first movie. They\'re talking about ""Zeus"" and i also was like what\'s that, Tomoki asks Ikarus to take him to the synapse and she does and also reveals that she would die if so and goes regardless.

Before you watch this movie I suggest watching the rest of the series and reading the manga( I haven't but I could tell I wasn't aware of some things) .Story: It starts out with Icarus and Tomoki flying towards the Synapse and so many questions in the audiences mind. The story then processeds to jump into a flash back that will be the telling of the main story for the movie. From here the viewers are dropped into the world of HLP sometime after Forte and Movie 1 took place. From...here Tomoki and the gang proceed on what could be described as a long episode of the series in which Tomoki and Icarus come to realize their feelings for each other. In the end it is enjoyable but it feels very rushed in trying to wrap up the story that was supposed to have a 3rd season. Because of this 3/10.Art 10/10 Improved from the series looks amazing. That's what a movie budget lets you do I guess.Sound 10/10 Songs from the show return, acting was good. I can only assume the dub will have the return of the cast which will be great as well.Characters 6/10 Everyone is the same as they were in the show following their typical character traits without much time to improve themselves besides Tomo and Icarus which is fine since the movie is centered around those 2. However they drop 2 characters that briefly appear in the anime/movie into the mix and are just like oh you're here and now part of our group. I'm sure manga readers will make more sense of this but to anime only viewers I just really have to wonder why they're back.Enjoyment: I rated it a 7 on mal so I stand by that. As a stand alone story it was good but as an ending to the whole series of HLP I'm disappointed.Overall I'm giving this a 7. Besides the overall story basically ending out of nowhere this is enjoyable for fans of the series. And if you really want to know more about what ends up happening in HLP you'll read the manga. It shouldn't have to be that way but that's what happens when a season of anime gets crammed into a 50 minute movie :/Hope you enjoyed the review everyone. here Tomoki and the gang proceed on what could be described as a long episode of the series in which Tomoki and Icarus come to realize their feelings for each other.

Many people have come to terms that a book will always be better than its media production, and to me SnO was fairly even with the story in the anime and the story in...the manga... that is until I watched Sora no Otoshimono Final: Eternal my Master.Characters 10/10:Let\'s start with one of the most enjoyable parts of the anime: the characters. For those who have been loyal fans of Sora no Otoshimono since Episode/Chapter 1, Volume 1, the characters have not changed (however they have developed quite excellently, through the good effort of Suu Minazuki). However, Hiyori is brought back into the series, something that was teased in the first movie\'s ending scene. Chaos is also shown with a little more depth, but didn\'t receive any development. Overall, the characters were their old, funny selves but gave off a darker vibe than it\'s premovie counterparts (mostly due to the movie being about 50 minutes long).Art 10/10:I have nothing to say other than Suu Minazuki was a genius in designing these characters. I like to think of it on par or even better than the animations than Date a Live and Noucome, considering those were later releases the animation was amazing.Sound 10/10:The sound itself had no problems, other than there just needed to be more of it. I found that some scenes could have used more music to it while others could have used a different sound track. Like I said, no problems with the sound.Story 4/10:This is where the movie failed.For those who have read the manga of SnO, we all know the emotional impact it had on us. The build to the climax (AND THAT LONG AWAITED PUNCH TO THE FACE) had left the story with a sad but sweet taste to it, sad because the series is over but sweet since the ending was just beautiful. The faults of this movie lies with its pacing.1) The movie left out much of the manga. It completely skipped over some of the huge highlights of the manga (Pandora evo, Chaos development, Suguha\'s past). While the parts that were adapted were good, they were rushed, and some parts were cut and fused with other parts of the story. Having a season 3 rather than movie would\'ve fixed this problem immediately, and would\'ve probably risen sales, but to me it doesn\'t look like the sales will be very high.2) Can you even consider that an ending? It gave you a taste of the manga, something I had fangirl screamed over for the first five minutes until the next 40 minutes ruined it, with the last 5 minutes leaving me feeling frustrated, annoyed, and most of all unsatisfied. The original manga ending was beautiful and, IN MY OPINION (yes people share different opinions), perfect for the story. Now all Nippon and IMS had to do was copy that same ending and it\'s emotional impact and boom, the score average would\'ve probably risen to about an 8, but because it didn\'t the story gets a 4. Don\'t title something as a finale when it doesn\'t even end anything.*Enjoyment 5~/10:Regardless of how bad the movie was executed, I love Sora no Otoshimono from the bottom of my heart. This rating is starred because it is my OWN PERSONAL rating, so it will be heavily biased. Sora no Otoshimono is absolutely amazing as a whole, but this movie gave me s**t. That ""Read the Manga Ending"" completely pissed me off, and I can imagine Suu Minazuki facepalming right now over the poor execution of this movie. I would be facepalming too if I knew that 3-5 entire parts of my story that were important, intense, and amazing were cut out and filled in with a crappy 50 minute movie that didn\'t even solve anything.Overall 4/10:The story is mainly what ruined it for me. I want to completely forget this movie ever existed and just reread the manga, because the manga has all the good stuff and none of the bad stuff Nippon and IMS gave me. My recommendation is to just pick up Sora no Otoshimono from where it left off in Season 2 and read it from there \'til the end.

The whole experience was an obligation for closure rather than enjoyment.This movie contains no structure or coherency, and it felt more like a youtube compilation of funny moments with some more serious moments sprinkled in. Which you should ignore completely if you wish to enjoy it because there is no resolution or development for them. The only thing that had some resolve was the romance between Tomoki and Ikaros, but it's hardly anything emotionally deep. I also...struggled to understand the logic behind their emotions and actions.At the end of the day, this movie is more or less a advertisement or trailer for what's to come in the manga. So watch it if you want that completion but otherwise it's not worth your time. struggled to understand the logic behind their emotions and actions.At the end of the day, this movie is more or less a advertisement or trailer for what's to come in the manga.

So there shouldn't be any risk of spoilers, that is IF you decide to watch the movie. This review is written from the perspective of someone who has followed the anime and not the manga of the series.What can I say about this final chapter to the Sora no Otoshimono story?

This movie was the most disappointing ending to an anime I have ever seen, which is really a shame. They took one of my favorite endings from one of my favorite manga's, and turned it into worst ending of my FAVORITE anime.When the third season was announced I was ecstatic, and when it was announced that it was being made into a movie I was skeptical, knowing they had a lot of ground to cover and that 90 minutes may not be enough. When I found out it...was only 50 minutes my heart sank. I knew it was going to get botched.Essentially this is much like the original ending of Evangelion. A random story arc (although I wouldn't go as far to say that this really had much of an arc at all) that doesn't answer any of the problems or mysteries set up by the previous movie and 2 seasons.Right from the cold open I knew what was in store. It would have made no sense had you not read the manga because it wasn't even explained throughout the film.All this was was a mish-mash of sequences taken from the half-finished 3rd season strung together into a choppy, no-plot mess with no real resolution at the end.The art was new and not really my style. I liked the old style better.The characters were still their good old lovable selves, so I'll give it that. All except Tomoki. I don't want to spoil it, but let's just say Tomoki's reasoning on a decision he makes in this movie do not make sense AT ALL because of something that was already made very clear in the earlier seasons regarding the Combat/Computational/Emotional levels of the 3 original Angeloids. Hopefully those who have already seen this movie know what I'm talking about and understand what I mean.But in the end, if you wanted closure, you're not getting it here.

Also it might contains spoilers but I\'ll try my best not to reveal much.I first started with the manga because I happened to saw the final chapter somebody posted on FB, which was quiet interesting so I decided that I just have to read it. The journey lasted for a few days since I\'m a fast reader. I hadn\'t been move this much since I seen Clannad. I picked up the anime series on the same day and dropped it on the...same night. Why? You might ask. I wasn\'t able to withstand  how they degrade the epicness that was in those panels into child play scenes. Call me an elitist, but I was VERY hype to started the anime due to how good the source was.Let\'s get starts on the revies now, I feel like I just have to reveal my background with the series so the it won\'t looks like I\'m just bashing the movie on purpose.Story 1 / 10 : Likes the name of the movie itself, it\'s suppose to be the ""Final"" installment to the anime adaption, yet they still manage to mess up big time. At first,  I firmly believe that I\'m just being biased. They might already have cover the missing pieces on Forte. So I pick up Forte to confirm whether it\'s true or not, turn out it never cover any beside making another mess.  The movie practically skips all the factors that were in the final arc, and starts at the very last panel where everyone else already died. I\'m quiet sure that synapse have a shield as protection against enemy attack, but who disables it in order for Ikaros to gets Tomoki in? There are so many flaws in this movie, it\'s just outragous, I\'d give it a 0 but I can\'t due to MAL\'s rating system.Art 7/10 : I\'ve never really cared for the art of an anime, but I guessed the art is pretty good, which it has be since this movie was released in 2014 not decades ago.Sound 4/10 : Personally, Tomoki voice annoys me off. I understand that he\'s a pervert, but dude sounds like a baby lion that\'s communicating using human language.Character 3/10 : Most of the cast members became irrelevant in this movie, unlike in the manga where they all played a huge role as the trigger of the event.Enjoyment 1/10 : I did not enjoy the movie one bit. I woke up one day and saw the movie was released with sub, so I decided to watched it since the manga have one of the best ending arc I\'ve ever seen. Turn out it\'s a pure disappointment due to the excessive amount of contents that were cut off.Overall 3/10 : It\'s terrible, this movie doesn\'t gives the final arc in the manga what it deserves. I personally couldn\'t enjoy a single second. The story lacks so much details, many contents were serve off the movie which lead to nothing but confusion. I believes they could of fit in at least half the story, releases Sugata\'s back story as an OVA, then concludes the movie with part 2 instead cramping in useless info to pass that 50 minutes mark. same night.

The entire series if you have not yet read it was a huge roller coaster ride from start to finish. It takes you on an emotional trip on just about every level. If anything I highly recommend this series if you are able to look past the lewd character design and fan service.So the Story: 6Simply put it doesn\'t live up the potential of the manga. I know that many people don\'t like comparing the two because...so much NEEDS to be cut from it to fit on screen. This isn\'t an excuse to butcher the entire ending for the sake of having a product out there. The film, while not doing the Manga any justice at all does deliver on some major plot points. Yes, everyone dies. Yes, the whole isn\'t real. Yes, Tomoki is pretty much the only ""real"" person in the series. But you CAN NOT fit all this into one single movie. It just doesn\'t work.Art: 8Can\'t complain much here. It falls in place with all the previous parts in the series. I\'m only giving it an 8 because personally the style isn\'t meant to be artistic. Of course this is entirely my opinion and take on the art style.Sound: 9Believe it or not the sound is amazing! I have yet to purchase the blu-ray, but the 1080p version of this online sounds great! Of course you can\'t expect much from a series like this but for what it\'s worth its good.Character: 5I have to say I am a little disappointed in this. We are never properly introduced to many of the characters nor are we told how many characters came to be during this time line. Of course if you have been reading along with the manga you would know exactly whom everyone is. But if you entirely focused on the Anime up to this point, you\'d have no idea who these people were.Enjoyment: 7This is entirely on your own opinion. Personally I liked it just because it was more SnO. But realistically I would be surprised of anyone really enjoyed it. Does not do the series justice, all it really was, was a filler to the ending.Overall: 7Like I\'ve said before this series DESERVED another season. Of course we may never know the true reason behind why the other season was canceled but if I had to guess it would\'ve been budget cuts or loss of interest at the company. Honestly, if you are a fan of the series just watch it for what it\'s worth. Look past the story and just remember that this is the last time you will see a new animated series with out beloved angels. so much NEEDS to be cut from it to fit on screen. This isn\'t an excuse to butcher the entire ending for the sake of having a product out there. The film, while not doing the Manga any justice at all does deliver on some major plot points. Yes, everyone dies. Yes, the whole isn\'t real. Yes, Tomoki is pretty much the only ""real"" person in the series. But you CAN NOT fit all this into one single movie. It just doesn\'t work.Art: 8Can\'t complain much here. It falls in place with all the previous parts in the series. I\'m only giving it an 8 because personally the style isn\'t meant to be artistic. Of course this is entirely my opinion and take on the art style.Sound: 9Believe it or not the sound is amazing! I have yet to purchase the blu-ray, but the 1080p version of this online sounds great! Of course you can\'t expect much from a series like this but for what it\'s worth its good.Character: 5I have to say I am a little disappointed in this. We are never properly introduced to many of the characters nor are we told how many characters came to be during this time line. Of course if you have been reading along with the manga you would know exactly whom everyone is.

Boy, are you in a for a load of confusion.Now if you're confused thats normal because Angeloid of Clockwork takes place in Chapter 39/77 of the Manga. The first 5 mins and the last 5 mins of the OVA takes place from the...final chapter (Chapter 77) in the Manga. See the gap? Basically the people that made the OVA expect you to have read the Manga already.To avoid spoilers, The OVA starts off really serious because its the final chapter, then a flashback happens and you spend the rest of the OVA filled with recycled jokes and fanservice. Then after the flashback we come back to the present where we see a brief 5 min scene of the final chapter with Icarus/Ikaros and Tomo flying and talking before reaching the Synapse and BAM! Credits kick in! Yeah, it ends on a f**king cliffhanger.So to conclude, if you're a fan of Sora no Otoshimono you have to read the manga no matter what.

Than the channel is changed again to Batman, but before you can get a sense of what the batman movie is about your friend turns off the tv.

The manga and the first two seasons were really great and the first movie, while not nearly as good as those, was at least watchable and somewhat enjoyable. This? They butchered the story and most other good things about the show. To call the ending ""rushed"" would be an understatement. Well, the end of this ""movie"" (which is barely the length of two episodes) barely qualifies as an ending. The shear amount of plot from the source material...that this movie glosses over is absurd.

If you liked this series I would actually recommend skipping this movie because it could potentially ruin it for you. The previous movie really left me hungry for the finale and I was hoping this one was going to answer all the questions that had been building up. It doesn’t. I am a firm believer that any anime should stand alone, instead of using the source manga as a crutch. I have a feeling that only those who have read the manga know what’s supposed to be happening...in this movie cause I couldn’t tell you if you put a gun to my head.I’m going to skip the animation, sounds, ect. simply because they don’t differ from previous movie/seasons.

The climax seems exciting and important stuff has happened. Here is where the movie just becomes a jumbled mess. The middle part feels like a long episode. It answers no questions left over from the previous movie (it actually raises more). Even more galling is that it is completely disconnected from the beginning. I actually checked to make sure this was part of the movie and not some OVA that accidently got inserted.This middle part has its own conclusion and then immediately jumps back to the beginning.

And for the fans in Japan and for those who watched the first movie in 2011 when it was first released they\'ve been waiting 3 years for this. For those of you who aren\'t huge fans of the franchise, there was supposed to be a third season released after the first movie, but that never came to be and after awhile they made this instead. And what we...get is nothing more than disappointment, confusion, and irritation.Story: 3As soon as the movie begins Tomoki and Ikaros and flying into the sky towards the Synapse. Right away there was no pacing whatsoever but I could forgive it since this is only 50 minutes and they want to get as much in as possible or because this was a preview for what was to come later into the film, which is both true and false. Ikaros explains that if she approaches the Synapse without permission she\'ll end up burning into flames but obviously still heads for it anyway. This lasts for the first 6 minutes and makes you think you\'re going to see an amazing finale but then we find out that this happened later in the movie. After that most of the ""movie"" just feels like your average Heavens Lost Property episode but with Hiyori and Chaos added, even though they pretty much have no reason to be here since they do nothing to the plot at all. But the story is Tomoki frees Ikaros from being his slave and while this is going on Sohara, Nymph, and Astraea try to become closer to Tomoki. This is pretty much the entire movie besides the last 2 minutes. Ikaros throws Tomoki into the Synapse and it rolls to the credits. This movie is just a huge middle finger to the fans and saying read the manga. And considering this is THE FINALE of the anime, as a conclusion to the franchise I would end up giving this a 1. As I mentioned most of this movie feels like it would be a regular episode of the third season.Art: 10Ok, I think its fair to say this movie looks phenomenal. The art style has changed, but I\'m ok with that since I love this one just as much and maybe even more than the first two seasons itself. This is definitely the best aspect of the movie. Everything is filled with bright colors and is animated fluently, especially the first 6 and last 2 minutes with Ikaros and Tomoki flying in the sky.Sound: 9Erase and Always Smiling are without a doubt one of my favorite songs to come out of the already amazing and catchy Heavens Lost Property soundtrack. Besides those two songs everything else is ripped straight from the anime which isn\'t a bad thing like I said.Characters: 7Heavens Lost Property has some of my favorite characters of all time and they are enjoyable in this disappointment of a movie. The movie mostly focuses on Tomoki and Ikaros which is fine. I also love the development of Ikaros in this movie, its one of the rare good parts of the film. The characters are almost as entertaining as ever but that\'s not the problem. There\'s not much for these characters to really do. They\'re just thrown in for almost no reason.Enjoyment: 6Since most of this is just a regular episode I did end up really enjoying it. However there\'s no reason for the first 6 and last 2 minutes of the movie to exist. If they were cut out and this was just some sort of special OVA I would have enjoyed it a lot more, even if I did want it to be a finale. But if you forget about all the confusion and disappointment you\'ll end up enjoying this at least a little.Overall: 4Eternal My Master begs to ask the question, ""Is this better than nothing.""And well to me I\'d have to say it is better than nothing. I mean I\'ll take anything over nothing as long as its enjoyable.Eternal My Master fails as a movie. It certainly fails at a finale. However I will say as an episode I will give it credit. But still as I continue to rant, Eternal My Master just feels like an advertisement for the ending of the manga with a regular episode bundled in as well. get is nothing more than disappointment, confusion, and irritation.Story: 3As soon as the movie begins Tomoki and Ikaros and flying into the sky towards the Synapse.

Ikaros explains that if she approaches the Synapse without permission she\'ll end up burning into flames but obviously still heads for it anyway. This lasts for the first 6 minutes and makes you think you\'re going to see an amazing finale but then we find out that this happened later in the movie. After that most of the ""movie"" just feels like your average Heavens Lost Property episode but with Hiyori and Chaos added, even though they pretty much have no reason to be here since they do nothing to the plot at all. But the story is Tomoki frees Ikaros from being his slave and while this is going on Sohara, Nymph, and Astraea try to become closer to Tomoki. This is pretty much the entire movie besides the last 2 minutes. Ikaros throws Tomoki into the Synapse and it rolls to the credits. This movie is just a huge middle finger to the fans and saying read the manga. And considering this is THE FINALE of the anime, as a conclusion to the franchise I would end up giving this a 1. As I mentioned most of this movie feels like it would be a regular episode of the third season.Art: 10Ok, I think its fair to say this movie looks phenomenal. The art style has changed, but I\'m ok with that since I love this one just as much and maybe even more than the first two seasons itself. This is definitely the best aspect of the movie. Everything is filled with bright colors and is animated fluently, especially the first 6 and last 2 minutes with Ikaros and Tomoki flying in the sky.Sound: 9Erase and Always Smiling are without a doubt one of my favorite songs to come out of the already amazing and catchy Heavens Lost Property soundtrack. Besides those two songs everything else is ripped straight from the anime which isn\'t a bad thing like I said.Characters: 7Heavens Lost Property has some of my favorite characters of all time and they are enjoyable in this disappointment of a movie. The movie mostly focuses on Tomoki and Ikaros which is fine. I also love the development of Ikaros in this movie, its one of the rare good parts of the film. The characters are almost as entertaining as ever but that\'s not the problem. There\'s not much for these characters to really do. They\'re just thrown in for almost no reason.Enjoyment: 6Since most of this is just a regular episode I did end up really enjoying it. However there\'s no reason for the first 6 and last 2 minutes of the movie to exist. If they were cut out and this was just some sort of special OVA I would have enjoyed it a lot more, even if I did want it to be a finale. But if you forget about all the confusion and disappointment you\'ll end up enjoying this at least a little.Overall: 4Eternal My Master begs to ask the question, ""Is this better than nothing.""And well to me I\'d have to say it is better than nothing. I mean I\'ll take anything over nothing as long as its enjoyable.Eternal My Master fails as a movie. It certainly fails at a finale. However I will say as an episode I will give it credit. But still as I continue to rant, Eternal My Master just feels like an advertisement for the ending of the manga with a regular episode bundled in as well.', ""~Minor spoilers~Story:4/10 Now there are 2 reasons the story got such a sucky score.first is the beginning the beginning was all over the place and i was so confused i spent like 20 minutes looking if there was a movie i had skipped.the second reason is the ending (which ill discuss more in the spoilers section so don't worry no spoilers X3)Art:9/10 The art is some of the best I've seen from the heavens lost property series.and if this wasn't the last movie or continuation at all in the series i would love to see more of it.Sound:7/10 if you've seen the anime or the...first movie you know what your getting and nothing has really changed.Characters:5/10 Just like the beginning of the movie...confusing is all i can use to describe the characters of this movieOverall:6/10 Now do i recommend to watch this movie if you REALLY like the heavens lost property series then yes it gives you a(somewhat acceptable)ending to the series and sends it off to a new journey.PS:this movie ruined the anime for me like im legit sad you will know what i mean you see the ending enough said good day. first movie you know what your getting and nothing has really changed.Characters:5/10 Just like the beginning of the movie...confusing is all i can use to describe the characters of this movieOverall:6/10 Now do i recommend to watch this movie if you REALLY like the heavens lost property series then yes it gives you a(somewhat acceptable)ending to the series and sends it off to a new journey.PS:this movie ruined the anime for me like im legit sad you will know what i mean you see the ending enough said good day."", ""To the ones who read the manga and were hoping for an anime adaption of it sorry this isn't it, the first 5 minutes showed tomoki being flown into synapse and then it turns into an ova or a flashback to do with the anime series for the rest of the movie, and it feels like a filler episode and when I say a filler episode  I mean a filler episode, you may like it but when that first 5 minutes from the manga played for me I was happy then when the rest played I was pretty ticked off,we all like anime...and this is my opinion but the choice is yours whether you like it or not and this is my opinion but the choice is yours whether you like it or not"", ""tl;dr: A really solid episode, but not an ending at all and rather than leaving any sort of closure just leaves an incredibly hollow feeling of incompleteness.It is difficult to describe what the story is for this film because it's kind of completely a mess. As you can tell from the title, it was billed at being an epic ending for the series, but it was really anything but. I suppose the best way to describe it is by describing how it was structured. It starts off being thrown straight into the middle of what seems like the climax. The art and animation are great....Loads of stuff is happening on screen. It's not clear what is going on and they're talking about things using terms that haven't ever come up before, but the stakes seem to be higher than they ever have been and things really seem to be going down. OK. That's pretty normal. Loads of films and shows use the technique of throwing the viewer straight into the action, and then slowly building back up to how they got there over the rest of the film before taking it further. One would expect that's what's happening here, and sure enough, it shows the title card and brings the story back to right after the previous film and show. It starts building directly off of that, showing the aftermath of the previous seasons, showing what all the characters are up to, and building up some foundations for where the plot is going to go. This was pretty nice in that the previous season and film never really had an epilogue to end with, so this brought some closure there. It then dives into a story about\xa0Ikaros\xa0revolving around her relationship with Tomoki that I think was by far the best we've seen of her in the series, with some major development therein. It isn't anything overtly epic, it feels like a standard episode that you could find anywhere in the middle of the previous two seasons, though probably the best at that sort of content.\xa0So\xa0everything up to here is pretty amazing. However, for viewers paying attention to the timing of the film and noticing that we're getting pretty close to the ending, there's a bit of an awkward feeling in that the film hasn't even begun to set up the climax, and it really doesn't feel like there's time to do so, let alone actually go beyond it into a solid resolution. And low and behold, just as abruptly as when we were thrown into the climax at the beginning of the film, we're thrown in again. And then it just keeps going. It is obvious that what is happening is really important. The scene is incredibly well made in that it had a strong emotional impact even completely lacking any context. And then at something of a cliffhanger it just\xa0sort\xa0of ends and cuts to credits. Though I suppose calling it a cliffhanger isn't entirely correct, because at least with normal cliffhangers you have an understanding of the context that led up to it and some expectation of what could happen. This was like a cliffhanger where you don't know how they got to the cliff, who even is at the cliff, or what the cliff even is. It was really well done, with everything\xa0from the voice acting to\xa0the effects to the cut to credits to\xa0the ED itself, but\xa0it made no sense.Originally, this was supposed to be a third season that would probably have been around 12 episodes but was shortened to a movie. And not a full-length movie like the prequelto this that was about 1 hour 45 minutes, but rather a film that was about 50 minutes. It feels like the show was cancelled, but they didn't want to let the project be a complete loss, so they just salvaged what they had from the first, second, and second to last episodes, threw it together and called it a day. It doesn't really end anything, just leaves you\xa0with questions that make you want to read the manga, which is where I suppose they intend to make their revenue from. What\xa0makes it so annoying is that what they did show was really great and showed they were capable of making something\xa0amazing,\xa0but\xa0they just didn't and wasted all that potential. The series deserved better and I can't remember the last time I was so\xa0disappointed\xa0about an anime ending. Though the\xa0fact that this isn't really an ending at all and that I'll still get that when I read the manga does soften the blow somewhat.The only reason I gave it a decent review is that if you don't consider the title about it being the ending, and also ignore the opening and ending and just look at the middle, it's a really really good standard episode. Loads of stuff is happening on screen.

What is Minos\' plan? What are the angeloids? What is the Synapse really? Will Tomoki get his peace and quiet?I had to read the manga to find those answers...It\'s sad that they won\'t...make a new season or new movie that will *actually* conclude the story... make a new season or new movie that will *actually* conclude the story...', 'I thoroughly enjoyed the seasons of this series, but the movies left a lot to be desired especially if you read the manga. This final movie that was supposed to be the ending did not end anything. It left us hanging entirely with what can only be considered as one of the most depressing endings of an anime in this genre. ', 'So I\'ve come to the conclusion it is physically impossible to review this movie without discussing the manga, in order to explain exactly what went wrong here. So while most, if not all my reviews are spoiler free (Apart from Ghost Hunt), this review will be spoiler heavy for both the manga and show.Alright, so I have seen this movie twice now. Once through my first viewing of the series, and the other through my recent rewatch of the series, after I had read the manga sometime last year. So I can offer both the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the manga, and someone who...read it.I had read the manga purely because this movie left me with far more questions than answers, and a large amount of frustration. Despite claiming to be the finale of the series, and offering closure to your burning questions, it does none of that.The movie literally begins with the final events leading up to the end of the series, has a few unrelated arcs from the manga in-between, and then skips back to the end without explaining how all of this came to be, or without actually showing the ending to the series. It offers no closure, just questions.Now then, let\'s rewind, and see what went wrong.The one thing I appreciate this ""movie"" for (which I hardly consider it a movie as it\'s only 50 minutes long, while the other one is I think an hour thirty) is it made me read the manga.I now consider the manga and the anime to be two separate entities from each other. The anime is much more comedic in tone, while the manga is more tragic in its narrative (although it also has a lot of comedy). This movie was supposed to be season 3, but that statement was rescinded, and it was decided it was to be a movie.After some time, and reading the manga, I think I understand the decision, though don\'t necessarily think it was the right move. You see, the anime by the end of season 2 was already far past being able to accurately follow the manga. Chaos, one of the most tragic characters of the manga series was basically turned into another one of Tomoki\'s ""Angeloid Harem Girls"" by the end of the anime. In the manga, she goes rogue after having her heart broken, and kills Hiyori and Astrea, and kidnaps Sugata and takes him to Synapse to start the events that this movie begins with. Problem is they narratively trapped themselves into a corner. Not to mention where the first movie ended was far from the actual ending of the series, which this movie starts with. They had a long way to go, and too many plotlines to fix.So yeah, I get why they did it, but how they did it is inexcusable. What they should have done is treat the anime separately, and try to end the series in its own way, while roughly following the manga. It could have been done, they didn\'t need to have Chaos be the instigator for the ending events. Overall I feel this movie, while it does have some good traits, is a totally insufficient end to a great series. read it.I had read the manga purely because this movie left me with far more questions than answers, and a large amount of frustration.

If you\'re here hopefully you\'ve seen the ""movie"" so you\'ll have some context as to why everyone is upset. If not, then go do yourself a favor and watch it so you\'ll understand where everyone is coming from.I\'m not gonna complain or go on a long rant, there\'s plenty of those here and they\'re quite justified. Instead, I\'m gonna share my thoughts on why this was possibly made. As we all inevitably learn in our search for more SnO content, this movie was made after the third season was canceled. BUT WHY IS IT LIKE THIS? Well I think the answer is simple, rather...than just seeing the series die or delivery a rushed crappy ending... the producers decided to turn their crappy rushed ending into a last ditch effort to get people to read the actual manga. The movie really has no answers or conclusion to the series, quite the opposite actually. It raises more questions and ""shock factor"" moments, showing further that the story of SnO is much more different than what it let\'s on.So while like many I felt upset immediately after finishing the last bit of SnO anime content that was left, I came to realize that this might have been the only thing the producers could do to try and salvage their sinking ship due to their own circumstances surrounding the cancelation. than just seeing the series die or delivery a rushed crappy ending... the producers decided to turn their crappy rushed ending into a last ditch effort to get people to read the actual manga.

Yes I dare say this movie feels incomplete and felt we were still shown in its production stage. The animation isn't the problem but the screenplay is what makes it feel incomplete.I have never seen anime project like this on how haphazardly they release this to the market. I am no fan...of heaven's lost property but even I can say this is way worse than the other heaven's lost property content and I would blame the higher ups of this production company for approving such a mess of a movie(more of an ova than a movie tbh). Go read the manga instead as at least more effort was put in that even if I have many complaints for it. of heaven's lost property but even I can say this is way worse than the other heaven's lost property content and I would blame the higher ups of this production company for approving such a mess of a movie(more of an ova than a movie tbh).

If you liked the previous seasons you will most likely like these aspects of the movie aswell.Onto the bad. The story feels rushed and the ending is disappointing in my opinion. Just throwing it out there.You may ask yourself why I still gave it a 6. While it did feel rushed I still got enjoyment out of it, I laughed and for the first 85% of the movie had a good time. The ending...is just mediocre, this together with the rushed story brings it down to a 6.I know the movie is flawed and from a technical standpoint should probably deserve a 5 or even lower, but this rating is mostly based on my enjoyment. is just mediocre, this together with the rushed story brings it down to a 6.I know the movie is flawed and from a technical standpoint should probably deserve a 5 or even lower, but this rating is mostly based on my enjoyment.']"

OMFG I am so freaking happy that I forged ahead anyways. Seriously, this show is SO damn underrated I am almost offended. Forreal...what is wrong with you people?It has a superbly woven mastery to it that you just do not find in a lot of shows, and I love a good sci-fi.  Did I mention ACTION PACKED TO THE HILT?!! I know it is a remake so this opinion is based solely on this reboot. Are there a few corny moments that happen... yes....Will all be forgiven considering you will be hanging off the edge of your seat more than once? Hell yes. I so respect a well thought out, cohesive story with believable characters more than I detest any other flaws I came across. The musical scores were simply amazing and so well timed, seriously bravo. It gave me a James Bond-esque vibe and I watched every single James Bond movie as a kid, so perhaps I am slightly biased. The character designs/set/costume were different and intriguing.Best part? As an adult, I didn\'t feel like my senses were being dulled with fluffy filler or immature moments that I couldn\'t relate to.Cons: The ship designs could have been a bit more ""futuristic"", but then again I believe the original story was written in the 70\'s/80\'s -  (it was so much action that after a while I didn\'t even care). The alien races were all a bit too ""humanoid"" and they could have done better than just changing skin color, although the creativity with the worldbuilding (to me) offsets this.  I wont spoil it, but the ""miracle"" that happens at the end might make you do an epic eyeroll.I give this a 10 due to the fact I was literally drawn into the story like I haven\'t been in ages, and for someone who is not easily impressed that is priceless.

Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga Nai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49533/Uchi_no_Shishou_wa_Shippo_ga_Nai,"['My knowledge on rakugo is pretty limited, so I can\'t say how good of a job this anime does at it, but what I can say is that I really enjoyed watching it.The plot is simple. It mostly revolves around a tanuki who wants to master rakugo in order to trick humans. We follow her (mis)adventures as she aims to fulfill her goal of becoming a Rakugoka. On the way she meets a lot of interesting people and dwells more into the world of rakugo.The rakugo itself is really interesting to listen to, altough I don\'t find it particularly funny, but honestly I don\'t...view that as a negative thing. Because of the cultural differences and the fact that I\'m reading the translation of rakugo, and not the real thing I\'m completely fine with not finding it funny most of the time.I also love the ""No Tail Tales"" that shows up after the ED and explains the rakugo. Most of the time I can understand the story, but sometimes I can\'t really seem to figure it out so the ""No Tail Tales"" is really helpful in that regard.The animation is pretty decent. It\'s not spectacular like in some other anime that we got this season, but it\'s unique and I really like it. The character design is also very well done.To me this was one of the better anime of this season, and I\'d highly recommend that you watch it. It\'s kinda sad that it\'s so underrated. view that as a negative thing.

It\'s kinda sad that it\'s so underrated.', ""Honestly, there is a lot of charm and good feelings when it comes to this show, and how it conducts itself. From entertaining and fun characters that are certainly memorable. To the whole feel of the show itself. Making it one of the shows you'll enjoy watching this season. While it won't amaze in action, but it more than makes that up with it's charm and character. To the point it even brought out a few laughs from me. If an anime can promote a reaction like that, then it's certainly worth watching.Story and characters: 8These are the main highlights, as they really blend together,...hell I have to give a shoutout to how this anime starts. It really ties into the show, which I really like, as if it's a nod of how the story is going to go. Something you'll see as it progresses. So far the show has a bit of a relaxed but comedic vibe within it's context, with certain under tones within, that'll make it more interesting than a simple slice of life. A bit of spice thrown in, to make it standout more on it's feet. Which is great to see.Set in a more historical Japan like setting, as the whole show gives off that vibe, and does it well, from it's textures, and sound quality. As we follow our protagonist. Mameda, as she tries to fit in with the humans. Learning from her father, that the age of tanuki playing tricks on humans, or living among them is basically over. Yet she wants to go over, and have her fun and such. To live as a human. All while trying to fit in, she finds herself enjoying Rakugo-ka. From another important figure in Bunko. At first, it does hit well, but Mameda finds herself sucked in, so much so, she wants to become their apprentice. Willing to do what it takes in order to achieve such, it's pretty sweet honestly, and it can really make you root for the characters, with their charm, and personality. Mameda herself, is a very upbeat character after all, that'll bring attention to the show, just from that alone. If she was less energetic and more calm, it wouldn't have hit very well.Another touch on the show, is the after ED. Some shows don't really go into detail on their subject matter, but this show does. That is a neat touch, and does deserve recognition, and appreciation. Even if you're not interested, it's a nice touch, you have to admit that at least.Art and sound:7As mentioned previously, I really do love the vibe this gives off. From the quality of the sounds, really hitting it's marks with it's environments, but also matching so well with each and every scene. Of which, each having a nice and good colour palette to them. They really took their care with this show, to make it look real nice, and that will always be appreciated in my book. it doesn't stand bad at all. Making certain points look real good, and others feel unnerving, but in a good sense of the word.This show is going to be a sweet tale to enjoy and watch, with it's many additions, making it for an entertaining product. A watch for sure. hell I have to give a shoutout to how this anime starts. It really ties into the show, which I really like, as if it's a nod of how the story is going to go.

Mameda, as she tries to fit in with the humans. Learning from her father, that the age of tanuki playing tricks on humans, or living among them is basically over. Yet she wants to go over, and have her fun and such. To live as a human. All while trying to fit in, she finds herself enjoying Rakugo-ka. From another important figure in Bunko. At first, it does hit well, but Mameda finds herself sucked in, so much so, she wants to become their apprentice. Willing to do what it takes in order to achieve such, it's pretty sweet honestly, and it can really make you root for the characters, with their charm, and personality. Mameda herself, is a very upbeat character after all, that'll bring attention to the show, just from that alone. If she was less energetic and more calm, it wouldn't have hit very well.Another touch on the show, is the after ED. Some shows don't really go into detail on their subject matter, but this show does. That is a neat touch, and does deserve recognition, and appreciation. Even if you're not interested, it's a nice touch, you have to admit that at least.Art and sound:7As mentioned previously, I really do love the vibe this gives off. From the quality of the sounds, really hitting it's marks with it's environments, but also matching so well with each and every scene. Of which, each having a nice and good colour palette to them. They really took their care with this show, to make it look real nice, and that will always be appreciated in my book. it doesn't stand bad at all. Making certain points look real good, and others feel unnerving, but in a good sense of the word.This show is going to be a sweet tale to enjoy and watch, with it's many additions, making it for an entertaining product. A watch for sure."", ""Another Rakugo show? I know that that's a bit of a fair niche just like manzai a.k.a Japanese stand-up comedy, but while the understanding to appeal to Japan is there to be the difference, over in the West, there's just a miniscule size of anime otakus being history buffs. And having said that, this show gets lost in translation, but how so does it fare against the come-and-gone contemporaries?It's been said in Japanese folklore that the raccoon a.k.a tanuki does have a rather malevolent past. The oldest and earliest tales and legends speak not only of the possession of humans but also of shapeshifting. One...of the most famous myths surrounding the tanuki is its ability to shape-shift into the form of a beautiful woman with which it plays mischievous tricks on passersby. Despite transforming itself, the tanuki can also transform certain things, such as turning pebbles into gold, or faeces into food. and a common image of this magical, malevolent creature is one with a leaf on its forehead, as this is believed to be the source of its power. With time, the malevolent tanuki evolved into a much tamer one, while still using their illusionary magic, they were rather seen as a mild annoyance than an actual danger, known for bothering travelers, hunters, or monks with harmless tricks.And this is what describes the racooon girl Mameda in a nutshell. Having been birthed and grown up in the Taisho era where the traditional trickery of the tanuki is rendered obsolete, with her racooon tribe declaring that the ways of the old are no longer effective against the new breed of evolving humans, she is the one that stubbornly refuses to let go of tradition despite being bullied over and over by fellow tanuki. In the hopes that she can master the art of trickery just like her father did, the trip to Osaka would become Mameda's defining moment in resourcefulness of trying old habits that just fail hard and earn the ire of people, to learning new things that would entice her to keep the tradition alive. In this case, it's the art of Rakugo a.k.a Japanese verbal storytelling.For one, Mameda is an interesting character, no doubt. Being the pickled young tanuki that she is with the entire raccoon village already free of the burden of trickery, she tries so hard to convince to the masses that raccoons should follow their ancestral tradition, but in the process, it appealed to no one, almost forcing her to be expelled out of the village. It's in this state that in Osaka, she meets a well-renowned Rakugo-ka by the name of Bunko Daikokutei, but she's no ordinary human either. Bunko is what is known as the kitsune a.k.a nine-tailed fox, also carved from tradition, but there're good and bad foxes, and she is of the Zenko (or benevolent) celestial fox that's associated with the god Inari. They are sometimes simply called Inari foxes. Even if they do not have nine tails, these kitsune are always depicted as being white in color, have the power to ward off evil, and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits. Besides protecting Inari shrines, they also protect the local villages from the evil kitsune and other malevolent Japanese foxes. Mameda being a try-hard, she approaches Bunko for help in mastering the art of trickery, and Bunko's answer is through Rakugo, which she slowly entices Mameda to see it for herself. The journey is set for the tanuki to learn a new form of tricks from the nine-tailed fox, and it takes a buttload of confidence and will to perform as Mameda learns the ropes and becomes a full-fledged Rakugo-ka.This is how mangaka TNSK envisions the manga to be in the English official translation: My Master Has No Tail, meaning that Mameda's master Bunko has shapeshifted into a human (meaning she no tail), saved by her former master when people stopped praying to her and wrecked both her home and life with injustice, and her source of trickery is through Rakugo, which in the presence of Mameda, decides that she's worth the one shot to spread her name even further. And just for context, masters pick their apprentices very carefully, esepcially in Rakugo, because a lot is at stake here: the reception of the student in inheriting the name of his/her master, and the reputation built afterwards. Thankfully, Mameda is not alone in this regard, as there're other characters that intersect along her lines of also becoming a Rakugo-ka, such is the case for Shirara Tsubaki. Her father is Byakudanji Tsubaki, one of the greats in the world of Rakugo, albeit his sloppy, debt-ridden image gave him a reputation that doesn't bode well with the people. And being the daughter of such a father, she cannot take it any longer, and lik Mameda, uses Rakugo as her learning curve to help her father tide off all of his debts. And I can tell you that becoming a Rakugo-ka is NOT as easy as it looks, it takes a lot of skill, talent and on-the-fly thinking to ever make it to the finish line: the audience having fun and laughing at the jokes imposed from the many Rakugo stories. All in all, while the characters are all diverse, they certainly help Mameda in fulfilling her dream to be in Bunko's shoes, and that's a tall order in and of itself.Certainly, the most surprising aspect, is that Liden Films, the studio that's used to the overhaul workforce to pump no more than 3 shows per season, does a 180 on its fold of overworking its staff members in preparation for next season's continuation of Tokyo Revengers. Because let's be honest: in recent years, the production values were decent, but at least consistent towards whatever the sources were to take a breather, and in the overworked anime industry, any kind of rest is a luxury to have, and under Strike the Blood director Hideyo Yamamoto, it looks just fine.Music artistes have come and gone, and so is the prevalence for GARNiDELiA, with her OP song being low-key catchy and an intended fun reference to the series overall, but like with Taishou Otome Otogibanashi, the quality has dropped significantly. However, Hinano's ED is calm that it gives you the exact sense of episodes' end and relieves all of the drama unfolded for a nice contrast with the apprentice-master duo Mameda and Bunko. Also, the after-credits of Shippona no Shippo a.k.a No Tail Tales where Maneda (in her tanuki form) explains the context of the episodes' Rakugo stories, it's honestly a nice touch for people who don't really understand to be given full detail on the story, it deserves recognition, appreciation and the effort behind it, even if it isn't interesting.No doubt that this tale of trickery is a good one to come, but at the cost of explanation, and ultimately equalling all that down to enjoyment, which this show feels like a mixed bag of sorts. Rakugo is a very niche aspect, but unlike manzai comedy (which every country in the world has sone imitation or form to it), it's purely a Japan-only feature that complements to those who understand, or those that are wanting to learn more about it.Regardless of how you see this show, unless you're in for a learning lesson about Rakugo, then it's gonna give you boredom. It's slow, but it has heart, and for that I can appreciate this anime for what it is.

It's a decent show overall."", ""I think people will look at the premise of the show and notice that it's about rakugo and formulate their opinions on whether they should watch it or not because of that. And that makes sense. As rakugo is a main element of the work. However, I think it has so much to offer outside of that focus of rakugo. There are great characters and character interactions as well as some strong themes of found family and performance. Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga Nai is able to take these ideas and make an  incredibly compelling and heartwarming story.The center of this story is...the idea of found family. The main focus is on a tanuki who doesn't have a place to go. Her father is dead and she dreams of carrying on his legacy of the traditional tanuki values of pranking others and having fun. But as times change those values have been lost and the world has moved past them so there isn’t a place for her to call home. And so that brings on the central idea of the show which is Mameda finding a place where she can fit in and thrive.And she's able to find this in rakugo. The show does a great job of showcasing how someone who is weird and not like a normal human, because she's not one, is able to fit in with other performers who also have their own weird mannerisms and atypical ways of behaving. I like how they're all generally able to accept her despite some of the weirdness that she has. And I like how nice all the interactions end up being. Even if they don’t trust her at the start, or look down at her, those around her see her earnestness and can’t help but root for her.Her relationship with Bunko is a highlight. Despite how closed off she is, she is able to relate to the position of Mameda because of the similarities that the two of them do share. They're able to create a connection and she's able to grow a bond with Mameda despite the differences in personality between the two of them. They're both able to let each other grow. Bunko is very competent and skilled, but she has issues of loneliness and closed offedness. These issues are able to be tackled with the inclusion of Mameda in her life. It's nice seeing her barriers slowly erode and seeing her get close to Mameda and seeing her take on a mentor role. The pair just have a lot of natural chemistry between the cynical and wise Bunko and the earnest, optimistic, but very foolish Mameda. Mameda is the perfect character to bring Bunko out of her shell because of her earnestness and her willingness to push for the things that she wants. It's a great example of how being positive and determined can have a positive effect on those around you. In the end, while Bunko certainly had reservations before taking on Mameda, it's easy to see that they're bond is beneficial to the both of them and how the two of them make a tight knit and valued family.Mameda in general is a really good character and is the highlight of the show. Her personality is really cute and fun.  I think they did a great job in giving her a simple but strong backstory so that we can empathize with her and really want to root for her, while also making her have a fun, charismatic personality that makes her a blast to watch. She has a wonderful combination of earnestness and optimistic foolishness. It's great seeing her get stuck in her foolish ideas of grandeur and see her get ahead of herself and her dreams to have only to have reality make itself heard where she really stands. It's also just wonderful to see the amount of excitement and passion that she has for her dreams. She is a very animated character with a lot of fun reactions no matter whether she succeeds or not. Whether we get to see her excitement when she succeeds, her disappointment when she fails, or her silly reactions when she gets ahead of herself it’s always a treat to watch. Regardless of what happens, she always has a fun response to it. Her determination and support for others is really fun to watch, her impulsivity combined with her optimistic and caring nature makes for a great combo where we get to see her try to help others and do her best despite the odds. Her silliness and earnestness just makes her a perfect main character that I loved watching.The themes of the show are also really good. The show is able to use the idea of performing as a way for Mameda and Bunko to find a place for themselves. Despite them being non-human creatures they were able to find a place in human society and find the place that fits them even though one might not think that it would. It also brings home the power of fiction and what a work can do. The ideas that it ties to rakugo are not exclusive to rakugo and still work for other forms of fiction. Such as the idea of being able to lose yourself in fiction and find this whole new world. The idea of being able to take their pranks and use them to express themselves via fiction is a great one, as it allows them to be accepted for who they are, while still fitting in with society. Ultimately it works well, both as a heartwarming story but also as a good message that people can find a place somewhere. The idea that all these performers are a bit out there and all have their own circumstances is a good one. It helps with the idea that anyone can fit in. There's so many unique ways that one can approach art and showcase art, that for everyone who is a bit out there you can find yourself a place in art and in fiction to be able to express yourself and showcase your own craft. Ultimately, it is a very positive message and it can be seen in this show with a lot of different characters with different backgrounds that are all able to come together and put on great performances.Art wise and sound wise, I think it works really well. I don't think the art stands out but it looks really nice and I think its cuteness works well for the general tone of the story. I think the sound was also good. The performance is really worked well. I am untrained and not very knowledgeable on rakugo but I thought that their craft seemed good.Overall, it was a really strong show that has a lot to offer. It has great characters, great character interactions and a whole lot of meaning to it. The heartwarming ideas of found family are fantastic and Mameda’s spunky and silly character creates a wonderful viewing experience. I definitely recommend for others to check it out and to look past the rakugo focus if that is deterring them from picking it up. There's a whole lot that this work has to offer and ultimately is one of my favorite shows of the year. the idea of found family. The main focus is on a tanuki who doesn't have a place to go.

This anime just tell how humans are and how nature isAnd both are foolish and because both are very poor they are pity but both are full of potential to get wiser and matureBut both thinks they are right but both have very similar things in them which are slightly different than other but that difference make them hugely different from each other like :humans are voilent harmful even for themselves not wise or mature to take right decisions and they dont even known because they are foolish and narcissistic / self centeredOn the other hand  Nature is innocent not wise or mature to take right decisions as a result anger is in there decisionsBut still nature is way better than humansBecause humans are narcissistic / self centered but nature is not + action/decision based on voilence is higher destructive and harmful than aggression or angerBoth needs assistance.Understanding and support for the person in need to ease their burden of being foolishAnd here is where art comes with very important role ( i realised it later after 9th episode )YOU can SKIP this -- From the beginning art form name rakugo has there for many reasons firstly time period where this anime is set and how whole thing is created and connected to each otherAt that period of time rakugo was famous in mass public, and storys of rakugo have meaning in it (its just not only for entertainment) and because this is journey of getting wiser and mature thus story helps (easier even for kids) to understand complex themes topics leason step by step as if we were learning from someones real life mistakeSo yeah rakugo is there for a reasonART IS Love to make people better, Wisdom to make righteous decisions/actions, deep understanding to verify reality, eternal never gonna outdated, clarity to reduces doubts, stillness no panics, truth which we all need and want (who needs/wants lie?), exploration/enquiring of self and surrounding, acceptance to see equality, and not being limited (0 is not limited and infinity/eternal is also not limited means 0 to eternal is art, if it exists its art)Art is shown as performers or artistsART makes nature and humans better great wiser and mature not let them be pity foolish poor like beforeSo its about 3 thingsHUMANS NATURE ARTSo this is story about relation between nature and human, how bith of them are, what is there potential, how they get betterNature is represented as our main characters : bunko and mameda and maybe bunchoHuman : all the other characters other than performers and main characterArt is middle men to connect nature and humans (art have similarities from both) and ART REPRESENTS only higher form/potential of both: nature and humans.

A charming little anime about a Tanuki called Mameda living in a time period where the Japanese people are getting harder and harder to trick and prank thanks to the advancement of technology. Later, after trying and failing to trick a mysterious, mythical creature living as a human, she discovers the magic and modern “trickery” of rakugo, and in such awe she decides to pursue a career as a rakugoka by studying under her reluctant master, Bunko.I’ll be honest, I’m not exactly the biggest fan of anime about rakugo. I don’t hate it...or anything, I’m just purely neutral towards it. However, I will admit this show is very wholesome. Mameda journey learning to integrate with humans instead of bamboozling them traditionally as a Tanuki is pretty fun. Most of the cast is eccentrically delightful from the staff at the theatre to the strange master rakugoka’s to even the normal everyday people of the city. Everyone is interesting in some way with their own story to tell which helps given that rakugo is an art form about telling stories.However, I just have a real problem with the pacing. One minute I feel totally engaged with the show and the next I’ve zoned out from boredom. I know that’s not a particularly helpful critic, but I can’t really explain it in writing. I think if you choose to watch it you’d understand, or maybe not and that’s just me. The only episode I didn’t have this problem was the Thunder God episode which just so happens to be my favourite.I also think the art is very… just okay? The character designs are great, but I find the art overall to be bland. A lot of block colours and the lack of good scene lighting and shading doesn’t, make it the most immersive anime to look at. The animation does goes some ways to help with the overall presentation. Mameda is very expressive and when characters such as Bunko and Tsubaki are performing rakugo there’s a positive tonal shift that happens in the art, but apart from that I wouldn’t call this LIDENFILMS best work.I don’t know what else to say. I don’t want to give the impression that I don’t like this anime because I do, but in a season/year packed with probably some of the best anime I’ve seen it’s really hard to pinpoint why this show is overall, just okay.6/10 It’s Okay *Thumbs Up* or anything, I’m just purely neutral towards it.

My Master Has No Tail is a story of journey of life, which would be relatable to many in present times despite its setting. And each of the cast has a very interesting background to see about, and has their own way of life to look into. Rakugo is just a centered idea,...the rest is how they pulled it out.Not going to prolong this, I enjoyed the story and the casts a lot. And you'll not losing things with guides given from the No Tail Tales even. A good watch for the mind and soul. Especially Mameda always being adorable each week. the rest is how they pulled it out.Not going to prolong this, I enjoyed the story and the casts a lot.

I like that there was at least some character development on Mameda in the second half of the show and it's clear she's more motivated and determined to be like her master Bunko and she has certainly found a sense of belonging with her. She's learning, and she'll get there. This show, I admit, makes me more interested to study the Meiji era and Rakugo. I doubt this would be forgettable story.The art style and animation are good, and I actually liked the background and aesthetics for a show...that takes place in the Meiji era. The soundtrack is alright, OP is catchy and the ED is soothing to hear. Most of the other characters were quite likeable as well, and it's good that they each had their own backstory. that takes place in the Meiji era.

Rakugo has a very functional comedy and a highlight that makes it the great icing on the cake of the work, but this also puts Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga...Nai in a situation of monotomy, since the other proposals of the work do not even reach the foot of the work done on top of rakugo.The fact that Mameda is a tanuki can sometimes be well used by the work, as in episode 05 where she transforms into a shamisen to replace the one that had broken, thus allowing Koito to follow up, but this is a rare occasion, since even the residents' treatment of the existence of a tanuki in the city becomes frivolous over time. On the one hand, this demonstrates that Mameda managed to infiltrate society, but on the other hand, its differential starts to lose prominence.The narrative of Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga Nai is weak and does not show great depth at almost any moment, making it very dependent on the presentations for the work to be interesting, episode 10 where Mameda passes the Enshi test it is the only one where the narrative manages to gain prominence. Mameda's relationship with the other tanukis was constantly shown, so that she was out of the group, when Mameda decides to go to the forest in order to be able to concentrate to decorate the Jugemu, the memories that had been forgotten for a while return. When asked why she was so concerned about the name Daikokutei, Mameda replied that this was the only place where she belonged, the idea of belonging is also brought about by Enshi's relationship with her last name and her relationship with Bunchou, making this the deepest moment of the series.The advancement of civilization was very present at first (after all, it was forgotten over time), and this created a depth in the universe, the tricks of the tanukis no longer worked with humans, after all, with all the technological advances, the deceptions of the tanukis became they made something small compared to what had already been created, causing the existence of the tanuki to be forgotten and they needed to live like common animals. Despite the tricks no longer being effective, the desire to deceive from the tanuki and the desire to be deceived from the humans still existed and created a connection between them, so much so that the best scene in the work is when Mameda, to escape from the humans, throws herself a tower and lands on Bunko's boat, causing the humans who previously ran after her in a rage to start laughing. The only moment where this idea ends up being rescued is when Bunko and Mameda start to deceive people so they don't have to pay a debt that wasn't theirs, despite working as a comedy, it doesn't have enough development to be memorable and add something to it. series.In conclusion, Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga Nai has a very efficient rakugo, immersively giving life to the experience of the stories told, and when the anecdotes were not told in full, they received their attention in the post-credits, sometimes even providing information that covered the knowledge on the topic. Despite the comedy working, mainly through rakugo, the narrative does not have enough content to support the work, thus it becomes monotonous and shallow.(Sorry for any mistakes, the text was translated by Google Translate)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga Nai era uma obra que em primeira instância não demonstrava ser nada demais, criar qualquer tipo de expectativa para a obra parecia maluquice, porém o primeiro episódio conseguiu mudar um pouco essa visão, apresentando um rakugo imersivo ou ilustrativo dependendo do momento, criando assim uma forte conexão com as histórias contadas tanto por parte dos personagens, quanto do espectador.

Por um lado isso demonstra que a Mameda conseguiu se infiltrar na sociedade, mas por outro lado o diferencial dela passa a perder destaque.A narrativa de Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga Nai é fraca e não demonstra grande profundidade em quase nenhum momento, fazendo com que exista uma dependência muito grande das apresentações para a obra se mostrar interessante, o episódio 10 onde a Mameda passa pelo teste da Enshi é o único onde a narrativa consegue ganhar destaque.

Ao ser questionada do motivo de se preocupar tanto com o nome Daikokutei, Mameda responde que esse era o único lugar onde pertencia, a ideia de pertencimento é trazida também pela relação da Enshi com seu sobrenome e a relação dela com o Bunchou, tornando esse o momento mais profundo da série.O avanço da civilização foi muito presente em um primeiro momento (afinal foi esquecida com o tempo), e isso criou uma profundidade no universo, os truques dos tanukis não funcionavam mais com os humanos, afinal com todo o avanço tecnológico as enganações dos tanukis se tornavam algo pequeno perante ao que já havia sido criado, fazendo com que a existência dos tanukis pudesse ser esquecida e elas precisassem viver como animais comuns. Apesar dos truques não serem mais eficazes, a vontade de enganar provinda dos tanukis e a vontade de ser enganado dos humanos ainda existiam e criavam uma conexão entre eles, tanto que a melhor cena da obra é quando a Mameda para fugir dos humanos se joga de uma torre e cai no barco da Bunko, fazendo com que os humanos que antes corriam atrás dela enfurecidos começassem a rir. O único momento onde essa ideia acaba por ser resgatada é quando a Bunko e a Mameda começam a enganar as pessoas para não precisar pagar uma dívida que não era delas, apesar de funcionar como comédia, não possui desenvolvimento suficiente para ser memorável e acrescentar algo a série.Concluindo, Uchi no Shishou wa Shippo ga Nai possui um rakugo muito eficiente, de forma imersiva dando vida a experiência das histórias contadas, e quando as anedotas não eram contadas por inteiro recebiam sua atenção no pós-créditos fornecendo por vezes até informações que abrangiam o conhecimento sobre o tema.

I only made it half way so maybe it gets better in the second half, but I wont be here for it. everyone is different and I always say try before you say you dont...like something, but this flavor isn't for me. best wishes on your anime journeys. like something, but this flavor isn't for me. best wishes on your anime journeys."", 'I do not know enough about Rakugo to know if the portrayal in this anime is good or bad; but I know enough after watching this that Bunko is a boring Rakugoka who inexplicably looks like a middle school boy while also managing to have an annoying condescending personality. A quick read about Tanuki teaches that they were rumored to have magical powers, they are tricksters who shapeshift and steal. Mischievous creatures sort of like raccoons are known to be on this side of the world.Mameda is the Tanuki in question, being sent to the big city in Taisho Era (early 20th century) Japan....She takes the form of a brown haired girl in most of the scenes, which is actually a knock against it because Mameda’s Tanuki form is so adorable, which combined with her seiyu, makes a compelling enough character that I felt the typical anime-girl design she walks around in was unnecessary. The side characters are only occasionally articulated while crowds are depicted in blue, as blanks. Nothing that happens in the first episode is especially captivating, well apart from the flying ship thing that was touching… but what keeps me watching it is how bad I feel for Mameda being constantly mocked and mistreated by a society who are no longer fooled by her silly tricks.The Rakugo stories are hard to understand- like I get they are parables, but the punchline goes over my head and I don’t understand the references, so combined with the totally unconvincing performance Bunko gives, I can’t say I find anything interesting in its portrayal of Rakugo at all. They do this montage at the end of each episode that attempts to explain the story told in the Rakugo scenes… but the long winded explanations somehow manage to be even more confusing!Most of all I can’t stand how harsh Bunko is toward Mameda, which means I end up not really caring about her as a character. I just want to see Mameda succeed at something or find a loving home if nothing else.*It’s been 3 episodes and so far this is a pleasant enough watch with a nice sounding ED that I could recommend watching the whole run, but whether it becomes memorable or not after the season ends depends on whether it can do something truly magical with its theme. I don’t know if a semi-comedy like this is aiming to do anything so profound, but given the significance hinted at by its historical setting and cultural subject that it’s based around, I do hope it tries.

Wellber no Monogatari: Sisters of Wellber Zwei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3501/Wellber_no_Monogatari__Sisters_of_Wellber_Zwei,"['I\'m surprised there aren\'t any reviews for this anime.  I actually enjoyed this anime.  More so than the first season.  I\'ll try to keep what I liked about this season vague so I won\'t spoil the story.The second season focuses on Tina, Rita, and Gallahad who are in search for the man with the Wasp tattoo.  We get to experience the ""sisters"" friendship and how much each will do for the other.  The first season had some major flaws, especially regarding travel time and distance.  Things didn\'t really match up.  The second season seems to keep...the focus away from travel time which is a plus.  The only issue I had was with Rita\'s hair.  lol.  One minute it\'s short, next it\'s long again.  Ah well, that\'s a minor issue.We finally get to see some background on Borgey the tank which was interesting.  I really enjoyed the latter parts of this anime.  I found that the ending was good.  The ending was what boosted my score of this anime.  Too many times I find that I\'m enjoying an anime then I get to the end and get disappointed.  Not the case here.The animation was very good.  Their use of CG blended in quite well.  I also liked the music used in this.Anyhow, if you watched the first season and was able to deal with the all of the ""time"" issues, then I believe you should watch the second season.  You\'ll find it richer and more rewarding than the first season.  I enjoyed following their story. the focus away from travel time which is a plus.  The only issue I had was with Rita\'s hair.  lol.  One minute it\'s short, next it\'s long again.  Ah well, that\'s a minor issue.We finally get to see some background on Borgey the tank which was interesting.

I really didn´t know exactly what that “mood” was, but it turned out to be the “Sisters of Wellbur ”-series. I stumbled over this series by pure accident, and there are several reasons why this one was so hidden. First, it´s about 10 years old, second, it only come out subbed two years ago on streaming sites, third, it has few members, and fourth, the main audience was probably mainly missed at the time, and therefore, has much lower score then it really deserves. The ending...can be a bit dividing, and at some points it can get a bit too melodramatic. Even so, I must say, that I very much enjoyed the 26-epsisode long tale about two very different women, and the adventure they did. This review covers the whole series, with this being the second part of the story.Sisters of Wellbur is very loyal to it´s tags. It has loads of drama, adventures, characterisation, little bit steampunk-fantasy, friendships, romance, wars, betrayals, and even a bit of a murder case. The main story is the friendship between the master thief, later bodyguard Tina, and Rita, a princess of a country on the brink of war. By accident, they end up on the run from Rita´s kingdom, chased for attempted murder of the prince of another country, and are hunted by more than a few. A long the way to Rita´s uncle neighbouring country, they learn from each other and others to be better and stronger people, trial by error. Rita finally sees and learns about the real world, growing up a lot along the way. She has some real strong moments in the story, being strong and brave in her own way. Both of them is actually two of my favourite female leads at this day and time, they complemented each other well. They form a very strong bond, but if you hoped it would be romance between them, drop those now. It will be intense romance, but not between them.The structure is pretty episodic, but definitely have a red thread. This is more a “it-is-about-the-journey-not-the-destination” kind of narrative. It can sometimes get on the tranquil side, but each such story gave something to the characters or story. The series has two main goals, one solved half through, and the next is solved in the latter 13-episodes (Zwei). The first involves Rita´s mission to get an important document to her uncle that could prevent a war, and the truth of why she stabbed the crone prince. A long the way there, she faces some hard realities. The second half focuses on Tina´s hunt for the man with “killer wasp”-tattoo on his chest, and that revenge is far from simple in many ways. Narratively speaking, this was very good. Character presented often played some role later in the story, big or small. Problems was solved, question marks erased, and important decisions, sacrifices and redemptions was made. The pacing is a bit on the slow side, but it filled out these 26-episodes perfect. The story didn´t feel rushed or dragged on, it came and did what it was meant to do. It may at some points stretch out the emotional or dramatic a bit much, but how it´s handled in the long run was actually pretty far from your average cliché. Characters are a bit more grown up then your every day anime, they reason pretty logical, and have a tendency to priorities the right things. Besides Rita and Tina, SoW have some pretty good characters and characterization. It also doesn´t shy away from some more grown up content, but I didn´t get feeling it was there to give fanservice or overly spice up the drama. It served a purpose, because honestly, most of us do get naked and such occasionally. The ending, as I mentioned before, can be a score riser or lower for many. I personally thought it was hard, but still kind of right. The shows title is Sisters of Wellbur after all.The voice acting was over all very good, matching the characters personality with their voices, and doing a great job of portraying them. The soundtrack has it´s strong point´s and weak points, the strongest being the music coupled with emotional scenes, and the ending theme ""End of the Dream"" by E.O.D. Sound effects can be a bit weak, but the shows main purposes isn´t large explosions or action.The art and animation are both had drawn panels and CGI. The CGI can look a bit funky at times, but the hand drawn stuff is often pretty good, especially close ups, and backgrounds. It really has a thick atmosphere, helping convey the mood and setting. The fight scenes is slowed pace and not that great choregraphed, this is not a show to watch if looking for super cool action scenes. They do carry a healthy dose of weight though, especially as the show progresses.To me, SoW, was exactly what I was in the mood for. I can see that it will not suit everyone, but I definitely think it has a much larger audience then it appears to have today. The main characters had a tough and hard journey, but an unforgettable good one as well. I enjoyed it a lot. I have said it in the past before about other shows, and may been a bit off the mark, but this show is really underrated and sadly under watched. It has a special story progression, multi-dimensional characters, world building, and satisfying thread tying. It´s not an uninspired game, light novel or even manga adaption for marketing purposes. It´s a hidden Production I.G original production, with a fare share of thought put in. I will absolutely remember this one for a long time.Arigato beru! can be a bit dividing, and at some points it can get a bit too melodramatic.

Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1533/Ai_Tenshi_Densetsu_Wedding_Peach,"[""Whyyy are there no reviews for Wedding Peach? I just noticed this and I decided something needed to be done about it!Wedding Peach is, by far, my favorite pure maho shojo. What makes a pure maho shojo is that it is basically about a girl that uses some sort of device to transform into her &quot;better&quot; self, and gains super powers and defeats evil. And, of course, there has to be romance, and really heavy emphasis on friendship.The most famous of maho shojo has to be Sailor Moon, and while that was always my favorite maho shojo for years, I watched Wedding Peach and realized...that Sailor Moon doesn't live up to wedding peach.Story: The story is about Momoko, a girl with a LOT of pink hair that lives with her father. The plot line is similar to Sailor Moon--if you've seen Sailor Moon you'll definitely like Wedding Peach. The difference is that Wedding Peach is entirely wedding themed. All of the weapons that the Love Angels use have to do with love and marriage instead of love and planets, and there is even a wedding episode similar to an early episode of Sailor Moon.But what really sets Wedding Peach apart is the romance. I don't want to give anything away, but the romance is soooo much better than the romance in Sailor Moon. Momoko takes a really long time to realize who she is in love with, and the romance happens to be very Romeo and Juliet-esque. They are forbidden to love one another and the last ten or so episodes are really romantic. I think that's why I loved it so much, because both of the characters really loved each other and went through so many struggles to be with one another even though the Angel and Demon worlds forbid it.Art: Okay, yes, it's HORRIBLY '90s. It's the same style as Sailor Moon, and let me say, the wedding dresses are just awful. The only saving one is Angel Daisy's because hers is less frilly. I really liked how the guys had longish hair, unlike the guys in Sailor Moon, who had really ugly short haircuts. Wedding Peach is just slightly more updated.Sound: Nothing wrong with the sound...um, Yuri's voice can get kind of annoying but I'll get to her in a second. I liked the opening song a lot, too.Character: I loved Momoko, she is so cute and definitely not as annoying and whiny as Sailor Moon. My only issue is Yuri. She reminds me a little of Tomoyo from Card Captors. Kind of a breathy-whiny voice, and her character usually makes me annoyed. Her romance is definitely not as romantic as Momoko's, and I don't really feel all that sorry for her because to me, she's not that nice of a friend. :) Yousuke is AWESOME though, he is by far the best male character. And Jama-P, the little sidekick devil-turned-good thing is soooo adorable, it makes you wish you had a Jama-P. Also, the addition of the fourth Love Angel is nice, because though she's very stuck-up and doesn't want to work with the others, she's really pretty and an awesome fighter.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed Wedding Peach. Every anime has its filler episodes but even the Wedding Peach fillers are bearable, unlike the Sailor Moon ones. I hated how the main focus of Sailor Moon was the &quot;Villain of the Day&quot; where you never saw a villain's character develop and got these really freaky looking monsters every episode. Wedding Peach tends to do the same but it's not annoying at all. I was really sad when the series ended and disappointed with Wedding Peach DX [DON'T WATCH IT unless you want to see a cute little maho shojo get ecchied up. Plus, it doesn't give you more of the type of stories you're craving for].Overall, I give it a ten. Because it's the best pure maho shojo I've ever seen. Definitely give it a try if you're into maho shojo or just shojo in general. Yes, it sometimes does really remind you of Sailor Moon, but it's worth it and the story is a whole lot better! that Sailor Moon doesn't live up to wedding peach.Story: The story is about Momoko, a girl with a LOT of pink hair that lives with her father.

Yes, it sometimes does really remind you of Sailor Moon, but it's worth it and the story is a whole lot better!"", '""A wedding"". What’s the first thing you think of when you hear these words? Most people would probably say ""it’s the most happiest day for couples, maybe even an exciting new start on life."" Or how about...fighting against the forces of evil in an attempt to save mankind? Enter ""Wedding Peach"", an anime series that takes the fundamental themes of marriage, and uses them to explain a different kind of story.Story: 6/10If you are no stranger to the ""magical girl"" genre, then the start up to ""Wedding Peach"" shouldn’t be anything unfamiliar to you. We start off with a young 15 year old girl named...Momoko, who is chosen to fight the forces of evil between the angel world and the devil world, as one of the Love Angels. She is not alone in this however, as she will be joined by devoted allies, trusted friends, and maybe even some she never thought would help. Wedding Peach has quite a lot going for it with it’s plot (despite the fact that it borrows heavily from Sailor Moon). The main heroines, always seem to be caught up in different situations in their day to day lives, most of which end up getting foiled by the forces of evil. This comes in the form of the devil world possessing human beings, or sending out evil monsters to do their bidding. Now the villains in this story aren’t sent just for the sake of causing havoc, they are looking for something called the ""Saint Something Four"". These four magical marriage items are extremely powerful, and whoever can get their hands on all the pieces will be given great amounts of power. However, they are hidden in different locations throughout the land. So as long as the Love Angels can stop them from obtaining these pieces, the world won’t be taken over. The plot works well enough for a magical girl title, as new information on the overall storyline is revealed at a steady but good pace. Most episodes don’t really lead into the next, unless a key plot point has been reached in the series. And in this, is where I feel Wedding Peach’s greatest weakness in the story lies. Whenever a certain key plot point is reached in the show, it seems to happen more at random than leading into any kind of build up. Without saying any spoilers, I can best describe it as this: picture you’re watching your favorite anime series. After many many episodes of waiting for your favorite hero to obtain something he or she needs, it is finally obtained and celebration follows. But, let’s pretend that instead of obtaining this item by defeating a foe, or doing it in a more stylized way, they instead have the main hero find simply by accident, or just have said item appear out of nowhere. In that mediphore, is the best way I can describe how some of the plots in Wedding Peach come into play. There is little to any build up, or even clues for the viewer, since some seem to happen at random (not all though). Fight scenes usually end up with the girls struggling against a foe, then using the same magic moves each time against an enemy, which can make the fight scenes get repetitive. To Wedding Peach’s credit though, there are good romance elements going on between many of the characters. These can lead into bitter rivalries, heart breaking misunderstandings, and deep romance twists. The Wedding theme doesn\'t play as big a part as some might think, but in fact ""love"" plays more of a role. As the villains can sense what is called ""love waves"" from any human that shows any kind of remote affection. There are episodes that feature couples getting married and what not, but they don\'t happen that often. The storyline takes many curves in it’s plot, and many of them are quite unexpected, and actually do play a big part in the story later on. The ending to this was quite good, as all loose ends are tied. So you don’t have to worry about going through the series only to be dissapointed in the end. Overall, Wedding Peach has it’s ups and downs, and most viewers fill find that their disappointment will walk hand in hand with their enjoyment. Not all episodes are winners, but they defiantly have their good points.As far as possible offensive material goes, Wedding Peach has little to none. Some adult jokes appear every blue moon or so, but rarely ever. All the character relationships are kept clean, and there is no blood in this series. Some of the monsters could scare the little ones, but this anime is nothing past a PG rating.Animation: 8/10Wedding Peach first aired in the mid 90’s, and despite the colors coming off as a bit washed out by today’s standards, the series itself was just beautiful for it’s time. Character animations run smoothly, magical attacks are quite nice to look at, and you overall get a nice array of color schemes in this. Cast members have good distinctions from one another too, and have some pretty good facial expressions. The only thing I didn’t like in the animation, was the actual monster design. They were garbage! The main henchmen that appear through out the series work well enough, but the subordinate monsters just come off as silly, and most times unimaginative. Such examples include a door with a face, and a small clown with a little hat. Most aren\'t even human size. The battle outfits are created with nice colorful detail and flare, but they also have different styles of Wedding Dresses that they wear before hand in order to heal the monsters. Not a whole lot of detail is put into the latter, but they still look nice.Sound: 7/10You get a nice mix of high beat magical girl sounds in this series. The opening and closing themes change twice through both seasons. The first two opening and closing titles really match well with the wedding theme, and you of course get the traditional wedding instrumental played everytime the preview for the next episode starts. Background music isn’t really much in the way of special, but you do get some nice lite hearted tracks throughout. When deciding which version to watch (sub or dub), I would defiantly go with the sub version. They feel more natural and easier to listen to, because the English actors can get on the corny side. Especially when the dub version has some of the cast featured in *shudders* accents!Characters: 8/10This was probably my favorite thing about Wedding Peach. The main cast interact well with one another, and get off some pretty funny lines. Friendship plays key role in this series, and the Love Angels certainly have big hearts in this department. Always willing to help get one another out of a jam. We have Momoko, who typically is a bit on the clumsy side, to Yuri, the well mannered of the bunch. Expect to see quite a bit of romance in this series, most of it starts out as baby crushes between the cast members, but later on in the anime develop into something beautiful. The only negative things are--there weren’t many staple supporting characters, and some of the cast didn’t get enough back story to them. Even still though, they were quite a lovable cast.Overall: 7/10If you are a magical girl fan, then I think Wedding Peach should be given a chance at. Its ups and downs in the storyline might turn off some viewers, which doesn’t make it a series for everyone. But if given the chance, I feel many people will get caught up in it’s character development and romance themes. So while Wedding Peach might not be the big bash of all weddings, it never the less still remains a fun one.

The idea of Angels vs. Devils is really neat, especially consdiering that it made the concept of angels and devils as races as opposed to inherently negative.  My one complaint is that they did not address the idea of an evil angel in this series, but still the plot is great nonetheless.  I also love the romance plot.  Overall, the story was sufficently romantic and funny as well as imaginative.  Story: 10/10I went ahead and gave the art an 8/10 because I\'ve seen more impressive...art in anime, but the way the Angel World and Devil World (particularly the former) were drawn very well, though I wish they done more in the Devil World so we could see more of it.  I loved how the characters were drawn, especially in close up shots.  Also, the transformation sequences were fantastic, but a little too long because there were two sequences for each person.

The first season themse were fitting to the general anime theme.  Music: 10/10The characters in this anime are great.  Although I do have the distinct feeling that Momoko is supposed to mirror the cliche magical girl protagonist (based on other animes I have seen, including Sailor Moon)-Whiny, bad at school, etc.-I feel like she is more than some cheap imitation.  Momoko is funny in her own right because of her temper and because she\'s hyper but accepts her responsibilities as a Love Angel without too much complaint.  Also, Yousuke cracks me up.  Yuri and Hinagiku are funny too.

It gives me hope in real love and I cherish this anime from the bottom of my heart and soul.It\'s a light-hearted funny anime with a fairly simple plot. Every episode is entertaining and can make you laugh unless you\'re a grumpy old man.It really saddens me how some ""anime fans"" here put so much shade on this anime without even watching a couple of episodes. This is an anime from 1995, back then there were no fancy graphics or whatever you seem to hate so much, like ""villain of the day"" theme this anime...has. Why so much hate? Wedding Peach is also made for a younger female audience, hence the love stories etc.I\'m a 19 year old boy and I enjoyed every single moment of Wedding Peach.The plot of the anime is simple but really immersive and each episode makes you want to watch another one, even though there are no major cliffhangers. Looking for bad things in the plot would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. It\'s primarily made for younger audience and there\'s nothing wrong with that.  10/10Intro and outro music are perfect for my taste, they are inspiring and well-written. It gives you the hype for the episode you\'re about to watch :D I listen to intros and outros when I go to college sometimes. 10/10Characters are wonderful, especially protagonist Momoko. Everyone will enjoy her love story, I bet. (I won\'t write any spoilers here)Her two best friends Yuri and Hinagiku are something special, each with her own unique style and personality. They also have their own parts of the story and are VERY important in the overall plot itself. 10/10 Their friendship is amazing and inspirational.Colors in this anime are amazing and vibrant, drawings are near perfect from up-close too.Some moves like their wedding attacks are repetitive but remember this was made in 1995, plus their moves are cool anyway so I could watch them any day every day. :)10/10Interesting fact:The 1st intro is based upon France Gall\'s ""Poupée de cire poupée de son"" song from 1965 which won the Eurovision contest. has.

It does just enough marginally interesting things and dips frequently enough into 'it's so bad it's good' territory (in the English dub, especially) for it to not be a complete waste of time--though it's close.Wedding Peach is essentially Sailor Moon, only wedding themed. Remember the marginally interesting things that I mentioned? This is one of them. It's also pretty dumb and more than a little creepy, but let's roll with it for a little. Basically, the three girls (for starters--one more...is added later) all gain the ability to transform into Love Angels, in order to do battle against the world of the devils, who seek to extinguish love from the human world. To do this, they are given the power to transform into wedding dresses and perform various wedding-based attacks ('Wedding Engagement Gift!' Saint Crystal! Love for You!') until the hapless devil succumbs to their Love Waves, transforms into a 'cute' version of itself, and disappears in a shower of sparkles, thanking the girls for the love they showed it. Yes, this happens every episode. Yes, there's a ridiculous amount of repeated animation. (For the record, I love Revolutionary Girl Utena and can handle my stock footage. Yet even I found the repeated animation and shortcuts in Wedding Peach to be too much to bear a lot of the time.) But, like Sailor Moon, there's something charming about its earnestness, and its ideal audience will probably love it.It does other things worth noting as well: the biggest stand-out to me was how each of the three main female characters (the lead and her two side-kicks) each get a love interest. Typically only the lead does and the side-kicks are just out of luck, so this was nice to see. (Even if one of the girls sort of draws the short straw, so to speak.) Another little twist was how their 'cute' animal side kick actually starts out working for the bad guys, before being persuaded to join the Love Angels. Frankly, I wish he hadn't, because he might just be the most obnoxious anime animal sidekick in anime history, but there you have it. Other than the genuine laughs that the awful English dub and script will inspire, there's not much else that's too positive that I can say about Wedding Peach. Though I sure can say a lot of negative things. Let's run through these negative things briefly.1. Dear god, the filler. There is so much of it. Seriously, at least half, if not more, of this series is downright filler. And I swear that a good fourth of every episode is the characters taking the time to tell us that anyone with half a brain already knows. Couple this pointless exposition with the repeated animation and literally half of every episode is essentially wasted.2. This is an *ugly* anime. The backgrounds are washed out, minimal, and lacking in any interesting detail. The character designs are average at best and terribly ugly at worst. The characters rarely move like real people. The monster designs are impossible to take seriously. There is no hint of mood establishing, directorial flair, or style. It's almost completely artless.3. The soundtrack is even worse. A couple of exceptions aside, it sounds like it was all done by one guy and his cheap synth in about a day or two of recording and writing. It's truly groan worthy.4. The characters, oh man, the characters. Momoko might just be the worst heroine of all time. (Well, other than Tohru from Fruits Basket.) Her 'character arc' is laughable, her voice actress (in both versions) a squealing nightmare, her personality overbearing, and her intellectual capabilities practically non-existent. None of the other heroes fare much better intelligence-wise, but otherwise they're all winners compared to poor Momoko.  I will say that the series handles her required several-episode span of depression better than series like this typically do, though it has the negative side effect of also turning the complete thing into a lifeless drag.5. Speaking of the characters: can we just all agree that this series has the worst, most ineffectual villains ever? And in an unfortunate twist, they only continue to get worse as the series goes along. I mean, I was absolutely thrilled when the first villain finally bit the dust. I was thinking it could only go up from there. By the time the series was drawing to its close I actually *wanted him back.* Everyone that opposes the girls after him is not only even less threatening than he is, but they also manage to continue to grow steadily more and more annoying, culminating in Potamos, who, at least in the English dub, is the single-most grating character I have ever encountered in animation history. Ever. No exceptions. My hate for this character knows no bounds. Every time she showed up on the screen I fantasized about brutally murdering her, and I was sorely disappointed that she actually got a happy ending.So, there you have it. I would recommend that you avoid it, but I suppose if you're purposely looking for an awful blast from the past then this might fit the bill. And looking back on it, I do feel a strange, totally unexplained warmth for some of the characters, which makes me think that maybe the whole thing would have worked better as a slice-of-life than as a Sailor Moon clone. Some of the relationships are 'nice,' and it's hard not to like Yousuke, the closest thing that the series has to a male lead. All that aside though, if you're the sort of person who regularly hosts bad movie nights (or perhaps bad anime series weeks?), then this should be on top of your list of things to check out. is added later) all gain the ability to transform into Love Angels, in order to do battle against the world of the devils, who seek to extinguish love from the human world.

I loved it! Everything was extremely well done it left you filled with love and I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys love!Story 10: The story was amazing. At first I thought that a show souly on the purpose of weddings would be boring. I mean dont get me wrong I love weddings but a 51 episode anime on it seemed a bit far out to me. But then I watched and I realized it was about so much more. The love of friends, family, and the power it has on not only a group of love angels and...some devils but the whole world.Art 9: The art was good but some of the devils were just plain creepy. Like that puppet guy with the weird teeth and eyes, even his face after he is converted by the love angels is scary.Sound 10: The sound was great. The op end themes were great and realy represented the anime well.Character 9: The characters were all pretty good. I liked all the angels even Salvia, but my real problem was with some of the devils. Dont you know realy killed me. When you watch the anime you wont miss her dont worry shes pretty easy to spot and good at irtating people. Takuro was also pretty bad when you first see him too, I mean he gets better when he goes after the other one but before that he just made me wanna drive my fist into the wall.Enjoyment 10: I love this anime. I watched one episode or more every day until it was over. I had a very hard time putting it down and the suspense that some of the episodes brought always had me wanting to watch more of the show.Overall 10: I think everyone young and old should give this delightful anime a shot. some devils but the whole world.Art 9: The art was good but some of the devils were just plain creepy.

The first episodes are probably the worst of the show so if you are willing to bear with it, this is a very rewarding experience. At the start I felt the similarities with Sailor Moon were going to hurt its chances to be an original and concise series.How wrong I was! Sure the first few episodes are very very similar to Sailor Moon but as I saw them through I could see that the plot was going somewhere a little different. Somehow detaching itself from the ""Sailor Moon-ness"". This...is of course to Sailor Moon what Rahxephon is to Evangelion. Like Rahxephon it takes a while to get off the ground but when it does, it even outdoes the source material in certain aspects.The aspects I felt were handled a bit better here were the relationships between the leads. As the cast is considerably smaller than Sailor Moon\'s, a lot more time is spent to develop the characters; and some of them really needed it. The storyline also moves at a much better pace than Sailor Moon with things getting revealed early on still relevant in the end.This is where I will stop with the comparisons to Sailor Moon and will now assess it on its own merits.The animation for the title is quite good for its time. Slow scenes like fast scenes have a nice frame rate. The vibrant colours give it a nice feel and look. The character design is well done for the most part except a few scenes where Momoko and Hinagiku\'s hair just look strange. The repeated transformation/attack footage can get quite tedious but it is worthwhile here as it prevents from repeated footage of other scenes.Some of the backgrounds are very well drawn and suit the scenes perfectly. Most of the action sequences take place in a ""natural"" environment like forests, fields or woods and these are drawn very well. The ""fighter angel"" costumes are really cute but the ""bridal outfits"" are pretty hideous.The sound is an aspect this series just excels in. The two intros and outros are wonderful and are as fun and fluffy as they need to be. The second intro is my favourite of the lot as it is very well crafted Jpop. The background tunes throughout the series are also well done. The music from sad scenes are beautiful and emotive, a bit like the music in Ayashi No Ceres. I really want to get the soundtracks for this but them being out of print does not helpThe voice acting is also very well handled here as a minimum of characters have either annoying voices or performed badly. Overall the seiyuus did a very good job with their characters. Hinagiku is voiced by the same lady who went on to do the voice of Asuka in Evangelion and she is one of the standouts here.The story takes a few episodes to get off the ground but when it does, it really pays dividents. The story is about a war between the Devil World and the Angel World that has somehow moved to the Human World. This being the main story, it is not touched on that much at the start but given a nice chunk near the end to be fully explored.At the start of the series we get the relationship of the three ""Love Angels"", Momoko, Yuri and Hinagiku and their attraction to Yanagiba. Momoko, over time finds herself more and more attracted to a different boy, Yousuke. That particular storyline is very interesting and has a beautiful pace. It also gives the series a real boost as it makes you care a bit more about the characters in general be they directly or indirectly involved in it.Another aspect of the story I really loved was the Wedding theme. It was extremely fruity but they pulled in off with great panache. The revelation of the ""Saint Something Four"" was also quite clever. The only aspect of the story I had trouble with was the lack of one for Scarlet. Although with what is on offer she is a very well-rounded character, a bit more background would not have gone astray.The pace is also a little wrong on some storylines like the Yousuke/Viento one but that does not detract from the series too much.The characters here are probably the series strength. The main cast is given a very good chance to shine throughout and there are thankfully no inconsistencies in their behaviour. Momoko and Yuri are probably the best examples as they grow a lot as Love Angels and as teenage girls. Be it through their friendship or their love lifes.The secondary cast is also great with some ""Devils"" stealing the show on more than one occasion. Potamos is an exquisite antagonist but also the funnest character in the whole show. With her extreme reactions or her use of ""You know?"" at the end of her sentences, how can you not like her, you know? She is not just used for comic purposes either and actually develops as a charcater too which was great to see. Other cast memeber who were interesting and very well portrayed include Takuro, Igneous, Celeste, Sound, Cloud and Thunder.This anime has provided with a lot of fun times. It cheered me up whenever I felt down with the playful silliness of it all, also the great cast was very refreshing as they were universally good. I own the series of this and I can definitely say it was worth every penny. A thinpak collection has been released so you should get that as it has even more value that way.I enjoyed this immensely and I would recommend it to most magical girl viewers, fans of comedy could also give this a try as it is quite comical most of the time. Sailor Moon purists will probably not enjoy it if they keep bringing it back to how it\'s like Sailor Moon.

A lot of school life, first love, hardships, monsters, saving the world - all the normal school stuff, nothing new here. There are a lot of comparisons with Sailor Moon - and yes, it is indeed correct (it uses almost same formula for villains and monsters of the week), Ai Tenshi...resembles Sailor Moon a lot... and as you can guess it didn\'t work good for critical reception of this anime. Coming out in 1995, it were overshadowed by SM and in result not many people know about existence of Ai Tenshi. Me myself only found it while looking at old anime mag scans.BUT! As I may say, Ai Tenshi is not worse than SM. In fact, it has own upsides. Wedding thematic is... well, novelty in mahou shoujo anime. Also, music is fantastic, OP/ED are really melodic and these songs as beautiful as heroines are. And watching this, you can really dive in 90s anime aesthetic. Characters develop strong bonds through story, and sometimes you wonder if they really could beat ""the great big bad"". And I would also like to praise monsters, uhh, I mean, demons designs - there are so many with various powers, appearances and even characters, that I wouldn\'t mind even them being one trick pony.So overall it is good mahou shoujo anime. Would recommend if you like 90s and classic themes like humans vs. monsters, or angels vs. demons in this particular example. And if you are looking for more Sailor Moon like anime - this is a great one to watch! resembles Sailor Moon a lot... and as you can guess it didn\'t work good for critical reception of this anime.

For those who Wedding Peach rings nostalgic for, this sentiment probably hits the mark, including myself. But after re-watching this anime, the rose-colored glasses have unfortunately shattered. Still, its inherent charm still carries on.Story: This anime has a persistent--almost borderline obsessive--fascination with the concept of love, yet its portrayal of love is one-dimensional at best, and stereotypical at worst. Many of the episodic couples have similar themes, with similar dynamics, with similar endings. Some episodes promote outdated premises, which could be uncomfortable for some viewers. There was also an episode that, while not intentional, could have really drawn out...some Madoka Magica vibes if it had been taken to its logical conclusion. Fortunately, Wedding Peach is a purebred, through-and-through supernatural shoujo anime, where there is no such thing as debilitating, permanent hardship and where love always wins.Like Magic Knight Rayearth, one of the female leads unfortunately gets the short end of the stick. In particular, that latter love square (I\'ll call it a square because of the innuendos (whether perceived or canonical)) had so much potential, which was unfortunately wasted. I really can\'t say more without spoiling it, but it does involve one of the later villains in the show. I\'ve seen many shows (including Sailor Moon, Wedding Peach\'s aunt-in-law) showcase various types of loves with various endings, and THAT would have been the time to really delve into it. Wedding Peach\'s insistence on its certain portrayal of love really hindered it.Characters: The three main characters all fill a ""cliche"" (the fourth appearing literally 3/4th into the show), yet have some trait that benefits the story. True, Momoko is a naive, loud-mouthed, childish, hot-headed, sometimes-slower-than-her-peers female lead that makes you either sigh in second-hand embarrassment or irritation, but she\'s THE kindest character in the entire show, including the so-called ""angels"" of love. She has repeatedly given second and third chances to her enemies, earning her several allies and the hearts of her viewers. It\'s occasional, but you\'ll find she\'s worth watching for. Her friends, well...Then there\'s Yousuke. Initially, he\'s presented as a side piece to the guy who should have been the ML, Kazuya Yanagiba, but ends up outshining him over the course of the series. He comes off as a supporting character, but is actually a main character. Which is great, because his character is generally likeable and a bit more complex than the main cast. He initially comes off as brutish, snarky, and insensitive, but is revealed to be so much more through his interactions with Momoko and her friends. He\'s also implied to be more than he appears from relatively early in the series, which encourages the viewer to want to watch it despite the entourage of cardboard foes in each episode.Speaking of foes, most of them felt like a horde of NPCs with a few notable exceptions. In hindsight, Lord Pluie was great foreshadowing for the show, despite his piss-poor performance. His charismatic bravado will either make you love him or not care for him. The other notable villain (besides the great mummy herself) is Igneous, who operated less as a villain and more as a construct and catalyst. Although his job was similar to his predecessors, he took a much more lackadaisical approach and had no problem enjoying himself along the way.  He\'s not entertaining because he\'s a good villain; he\'s entertaining because of his relationship with the other characters.And then there\'s Potamos, the bane of the viewers\' existence.Last Thoughts: Besides its stubborn portrayal of love, Wedding Peach also falls down with its reused footage each and every bloody episode. Worse, skipping 2-3 minutes during the transformation scenes sometimes allows viewers to miss vital parts that progress the overarching story. That said, Wedding Peach has stood the test of time, and while predictable, is still entertaining to watch to some degree. If you have your sanity after lasting 15 episodes, you\'ll probably scrounge up the patience to last the whole 51. some Madoka Magica vibes if it had been taken to its logical conclusion.

Argonavis from BanG Dream!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40677/Argonavis_from_BanG_Dream,"[""I'm someone who is really generous in giving grades to anime that I have watched. For this anime:Story: 9Character: 9Art: 8Enjoyment: 9I love musical-themed anime, so obviously I love this one as well. I love listening to bands plus the songs they used and their vocals, I love them all.I would have rated this 10 if the ending was satisfactory, for me at least. It would have been better if they added few more episodes, like few other anime do, have like a summary or what will happen to them in the future....Other than the ending, I love everything else. Other than the ending, I love everything else."", 'First things first: I really don\'t know anything about bandori. Like, sure, it\'s big music franchise, but apart from that - literally nothing at all. Whatever could be gathered from any other source that exists out there... great, probably. For me though, there\'s only this anime.It\'s unfortunate that if I have to sum it up in one word, that word is ""unfortunate"". I don\'t mind uncommon methods, like the CG we had here for pretty much the whole series: personally I\'m used to it, and indeed considering the genre it just fits. Granted, at times it could have been better, there were moments where it...felt awkward, but overall it was perfectly fine. The designs were also great: settings as well as the characters, and even the smaller details. The music, the songs are obviously great, with the energy and emotions one would expect, given what the franchise is. But great music and easy-on-the-eyes characters can only carry a series so far...And that\'s where the negatives come in. The characters sure look great, but I struggled to discover much (if anything at all) in most of them beyond that. They just feel more like empty husks that have some basic ""programming"" to act out, a generic personality and/or issue or problem to move them forward, but it just doesn\'t feel organic. They aren\'t ""bad"" per se - if anything, they simply lack the complexity to be. I couldn\'t really sense many or strong connections - between them or between myself and any one of them. Sadly, the story is the same: weak, lukewarm, somewhat haphazard, a bit of a hodgepodge that doesn\'t really know which way to go, and eventually doesn\'t really go anywhere. A few huge coincidences change the flow, maybe the direction, but for the most part, that\'s just it: going with the flow. I\'m usually one of those people who are really emotionally affected by the story they watch unfold, who can literally laugh and cry together with the characters and worry themselves to death over them. Here I could barely be bothered enough to care. Songs popping up out of nowhere that we never even hear mentioned being worked on, and that\'s just not the way to make anything believable - yet here it happens more often than not. And while those songs themselves aren\'t bad in any sense of he word, not seeing them being ""born"" makes them, makes the whole ""story"" hard to connect to. Then again, this and the coincidences aren\'t the only two things that can jolt you out of your suspension of disbelief: there are several more cartwheels and backflips in logic that honestly could have been handled better with little (if any) more effort.You might as well go straight for Argonavis\'s or Gyroaxia\'s music on whatever music platform you prefer, that\'s most of the value here. The characters and the story are just too weak to be the source of much enjoyment; and while the visuals aren\'t bad, they aren\'t anything to write home about either. Not a glimpse of fanservice in sight anywhere, so you can\'t even look forward to that. It\'s just unfortunate, because as strong as the music is, this series could have been much better with a little more effort in writing and directing. felt awkward, but overall it was perfectly fine.

However there are some points where I need to focus on.At the beginning, the story focuses on the origin of the main band, which was a good idea indeed, but the way they portrayed it was, in my opinion may I say that I found it a bit rushed? The same goes for when they made the songs, I feel it was more fast that I would like.Another point it's that the way that's was shown the feeling...that the songs generates, well, I comprehend what they tried to show us, but I felt it a bit... Irreal? Though it didn't bother me.The end of it was, uh, I didn't expect that, it got me unprepared, I'm still thinking of it. And before I forget, some navigators said that it's better to think that the episode 12 was the real final, and the 13 was like a bridge for the game.But don't get me wrong, I really really like this anime, love the ost, love the characters, Ren is just, ugh, so cute, I love him so much <3 And don't forget the seiyuus, all of them was just perfect for me, I'm looking at you two precisely, Masahiro and Jin <3And well, if you don't decide on watch this anime or not, i would recommend that give it an opportunity! Maybe it ends being of your like! ^^ that the songs generates, well, I comprehend what they tried to show us, but I felt it a bit... Irreal?

I love idol animes so I tend to compare to my favourites (like Utapri or Starmyu). However I give every anime a fair chance to shine on their own.The characters and environment are obviously done with the 3D model technique, which is a problem with me and many others too. There were some times that were animated ""normally"", which I found a bit weird. I would prefer a bad animation through the normal events and cgi only on stage - not...when they drink coffee and have dialogue. It needs to be used to, since the facial expressions are very stiff and walking is like from a crash doll demonstration. Now that would be pretty much my only critique.If you put the terrible animation aside, I have no complaints on this show whatsoever. The story was really good, the character design (as in their personalities and story lines) was great, the plot twists really hit hard and the music was actually SO GOOD! It was so easy to get involved and live the story through the characters. I found myself suddenly very invested and caring towards the main characters within the first two episodes. And I had my doubts and I really didn\'t like the animation, so that tells something about how well they\'ve done with them and story. Every obstacle made me stressed, every success made me smile (and cry). Every performance gave me chills. Sure there were a lot of clichés, but somehow this was still very different from any idol animes. The obstacles are something a band has to face irl: debuting, writing a song, finding team spirit within the band, finding places to perform... It was very realistic in a way. Kind of reminds me of Idolish7, but Argonavis is not an idol group, but an independent band. Which is great, because no one does the work for them, no label or sponsor. They have to deal with everything themselves.I have to mention the ending though: It was a bit rushed (probably due to the virus) but to me it wasn\'t a disturbance, but a promise of continuance. FOr some it can be annoying, so you\'ve been warned.Like I mentioned before the absolute saviour of this anime is the music. Almost every episode had a new song and it usually connected witht the story. The performances were fire and the cgi really worked well in these scenes. I am so glad that the bands\' songs can be found on Spotify. I have yet to find out who writes the music and how this is produced, because this is not the typical pop they make in musical animes that seiyuus try to struggle through. This was actual music I would want to listen to.So in short: don\'t watch this for the animation, but do it for the characters, story and music. It was one of the best music themed animes I\'ve watched. I highly recommend if you\'re into this genre. Give it a chance even if the cgi-animation hurts your eyes, it is so worth it. when they drink coffee and have dialogue.

But when the anime started airing, and as the story progress to the end of the show, I just stood there watching and say ""Meh, could be better"".Story: 5/10Pacing issue. Soap-opera conflict that shouldn\'t happen because Bushiroad advertise this as more mature bandori (i.e. the conflict is more deep than the girl band). I honestly, didn\'t think so. It\'s just bland and feel too rushed. Probably because this feels more like an advertisement towards the game rather than actual trying to make people feel good about it. Let\'s just pray the game storyline could save this anime...storyline.Art: 7/10After Bandori 2nd season, Bushiroad always use 3D for their anime. And I\'d say, this anime so far have the best graphic among most of the bandori franchise. Character facial expression is also good, very expressive. The background is also drawn beautifully. Guess Bushiroad gave this anime a big budget for its graphic. The only downside is that some of the NPC doesn\'t look \'right\'. But then again, they\'re NPC; not too important.Sound: 7/10Each episode had its own respective song and the song correspond to the events in the anime. So, each story and conflict has its own song as an \'answer\' to their problems. It\'s nice and fun to expect different song every week. Also, I like the feel of the concert in this anime. Feels very real.Character: 6/10Generic anime personality. There\'s some character development, but honestly nothing that significant. The game might make these characters shine more than the anime. I hope.Enjoyment: 6/10Like I\'d said about the story, some pacing issues. It feels too rush and sometimes in a certain scene it feels very boring. Nothing to engage viewer\'s emotions. The music, however save most of my attention span as it\'s fun to hear.Overall: 6/10Just like the other bandori anime, I\'d say the game do the character more justice than anime format. Mainly because of story issues. Would I recommend this anime to people outside of the fanbase? No. With anime format like this (as a promotional material) you need to play the game to understand the whole story and franchise. storyline.Art: 7/10After Bandori 2nd season, Bushiroad always use 3D for their anime.

End me.A two-episode special bundle was released that priors the second season, which turned out to be just sneaked up recap episodes in both freaking damn episodes. Both do nothing but repeat the same...thing that the recap OVA did, I still do not know the purpose behind this.

Yep, that's the nicest way to describe this particular anime. The main Arifureta show was a trainwreck of comedic proportions, so I doubt this two shorts are gonna improve my opinion of the series. Still, I decided to give them a chance.There are gonna be spoilers, but come on, do you really care?StoryThe two episodes are merely recaps of the events from season 1 and the only real change is that Kaori is now part of Hajime's group and we get some insight into her perspective. Overall, the specials don't feature anything new for...the series and only exist to provide fanservice and comedy. (5/10)CharactersKaori is without a doubt the best character in these episodes, mostly because she is the closest thing there's to a normal person in Hajime's group. Of course, that isn't saying much when your companions have weird sexual fantasies and aren't afraid to be outspoken about them. I'm only saying I like Kaori better than the other characters but her connection with Hajime comes off as emotionally genuine, at least compared to Hajime's relationship with the other girls, and the scene that focuses on how Kaori met Hajime was the only time the show took itself semi-seriously. (6/10)ArtThese episodes only exist for the sake of fanservice, so it's only natural that a huge portion of the show's budget goes into the animation. Unfortunately, fanservice alone shouldn't carry an anime and Arifureta's greatest mistake is not understanding that. (7/10)SoundsI did watch the original Arifureta with the English audio, so it was nice listening to the talents of Saori Onishi (Kaori) and Yoko Hikasa (Tio), two of my favorite VAs in the business.

(5/10)CharactersKaori is without a doubt the best character in these episodes, mostly because she is the closest thing there's to a normal person in Hajime's group. Of course, that isn't saying much when your companions have weird sexual fantasies and aren't afraid to be outspoken about them. I'm only saying I like Kaori better than the other characters but her connection with Hajime comes off as emotionally genuine, at least compared to Hajime's relationship with the other girls, and the scene that focuses on how Kaori met Hajime was the only time the show took itself semi-seriously. (6/10)ArtThese episodes only exist for the sake of fanservice, so it's only natural that a huge portion of the show's budget goes into the animation. Unfortunately, fanservice alone shouldn't carry an anime and Arifureta's greatest mistake is not understanding that.

By adding this ordinance, we not only further strength our relationship with the Catians, but also grow closer with our Goddess and Savior, Eris. The new ordinance goes as followed:7) Thou Shalt Include a Strip Game, Amongst Other Games– It appears that everyone knows that one of Earth’s most popular games are 'Strip games'. The members of the Catian mothership played ‘Strip Mahjong’, ‘Strip Poker’, and ‘Strip Rock-Paper-Scissors’. And almost every single member becomes nude once, showing...off their lovely breasts! Now, our ’so-called’ villain is playing chess against Matrey, her personal assist-a-roid. But, what’s this, she is losing and stripping! So, I guess she is playing ‘Strip Chess’. And, now, our Goddess and her friends are playing various games, such as ‘Bullshit!’, ‘Monopoly’, ‘Twister’, and finally, ‘Strip Rock-Paper-Scissors’. Our protagonist, Kio Kakazu, wins by blind luck, literally, and strips everyone naked. Based on our Goddess’ and her friends’ behaviors, it would seem that playing ‘Strip games’ further strengths one’s relationship amongst friends and colleagues. It’s decree that everyone should include one ‘Strip game’, so to further develop one’s bond with another person.By following this new ordinance, we hope that our relationship with Catians continues rises. We further hope that one day, we may obtain a power to grow cat ears and cat tails. And, we hope that our Goddess continues to grace us with her presences.All Hail Our Goddess!All Hail Eris!All Hail Eris! off their lovely breasts!

The story is pretty cool and has so much potential to be a great anime, but it’s just not.

Decent dialogue, gone. Music, poor. Art was always meh.The first episode or two generally showed good effort in telling the story and putting life to the characters, after those episodes though there’s nothing to redeem the bad anime that this...becomes.

The sin of Gluttony leaves Fate in a constant state of hunger, always eating but never satiated. It's not until one night when his hunger takes...over and he eats a man who tries to kill him that he suddenly feels full.  After discovering this pleasure and satisfaction he goes out into the world, eating monsters and the corrupt holy knights who oppress the people, absorbing their powers after every meal. Nevertheless, he must live amongst the populous and alongside his childhood friend, Roxy, ever fearful that his hunger might take over and he’ll eat her.What a cool premise for a story. Shame that I made 70% of it up and it is actually another *sigh* light novel medieval European fantasy anime with a world that operates on RPG video game logic with skills, levels and states none of which matter because the protagonist is always the strongest motherfucker in the room despite always being level 1. Fate may have the skill of Gluttony which leaves him in a state of hunger but he doesn’t satiate it by eating. He just has to kill monsters or the people who bully him. He then takes their states and abilities, some of which are super useful -like telepathy when touching someone- that the show will completely forget about.The cast is just as vapid as the world-building.

The tension of Fate's Gluttony going berserk is there in the first couple of episodes, but if you’re looking for a show where consequences matter this won't be for you.

Simple As.Even though this isn\'t a game changer for all future animes to follow. This is a decent time waster action anime, with a alright story sitting behind it.But this is where the mixed feelings come in. It is a bit disappointing with how much potential this story has, and how little it seems to make use of it.Still doesn\'t make it bad anime outright, it is just disappointing of what it could\'ve been if it was better produced or had a different approach to the pacing of the anime.- Continue on for more reasoning -The...most disappointing part about ""Boushoku no Berserk"" was the execution (I am shortening it to ""Berserk"" from now on), it seemed somewhat lacking with what could\'ve been done with the story. It has an interesting story basis of the ""gluttony skill"" and the kingdoms that are involved, but never takes the full use out of what it can be.""Berserk"" seems to rush everything very quickly, making you not really care for the side characters, since the fast pacing makes their entire characterization glossed over for many characters, examples would be Myne and Eris, they get like 20 minutes to show their whole character throughout these 12 episodes. They are really cardboard cutouts of what they could be. If given an episode that gave them backstories to make you actually care about them, they would probably be really cool and interesting characters.The producers can do it too, since they did an episode meeting Aaron Barbatos, which in the best way I can describe it without spoiling, has had his life destroyed by monsters taking over his home. The show makes this characterization of Aaron done better than Myne and Eris, he is by far a much better character then both of them.It probably is better in the light novel that this is adapted from, since I feel like there probably is lots of details that were cut out with them in the adaptation (I never read it, but it gives off that vibe big time). But it still stands that a character seen for 2 episodes has a better character than the two characters that will be reoccurring.I understand that ""Berserk"" has a 12 episode time constraint, but I am sure they could\'ve found a more early point to stop for the season, done in a way to better show off each character. This could\'ve had a cool arc like ""Spice & Wolf"" where it can be slow growth throughout multiple seasons, or have done something similar to ""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"" where it can have 2 or 3 full arcs throughout a season. Mainly they could\'ve slowed down the pacing a bit, making this a more slow anime, where 1 episode covers 1 week instead of skipping vast amounts of time (possibly months of time adventuring) to get to action. This all makes a lot of wasted potential for a character to have a well constructed ""zero-to-hero"" arc, or producers not doing an amazing job on the adaptation.The main drive with ""Berserk"" really is Fate and Roxy, they both are moderately well constructed characters, albeit they do not get nearly the same amount of characterization after episode 3. They are generic to some degree in a typical sense, but definitely have a good basis to grow character off of. You can at least understand their grievances and beliefs, even if you do not agree with them. You know why Fate likes Roxy and why he has a ""dazzling prince on horseback"" behavior for her.But when all other characters do not live up to their amount of characterization, it drives the story down, because when these are the most grounded characters, and nothing (besides Aaron Barbatos) even lives up to their development, it makes you look at every character more harshly since they get no time for growth and characterization.Animation-wise, it is alright, sometimes this is like a PowerPoint where it pans across the screen, but other times there is really decent weapon-play that really look good, even if it is not insanely complex it really makes the show good to watch. And the character designs are not done poorly, but are very basic and could be improved.Story-wise the show makes the characters are done exactly as the author wants you to feel about them, with the ones that are supposed to be disliked done quite well. The MC is given plot armor, but it isn\'t done to a ridiculous degree, they do not have zero weaknesses, they are not like One Punch Man where they are just a boss all the time. But the ending is kinda poor, and could\'ve been ended at a better time. It is seems to have a rushed story with a weird pacing, but it is good overall.Give it a try at least, because I feel this has the ability to have a good second season that can bring some improvements to make this a better series, examples of this can be ""Clannad"" to ""Clannad After Story"" or ""Tokyo Ghoul"" season 1 to season 2.7/10, This just seems like a messy first season to me, and while a 7/10 might be a bit generous, this show has a weird charm to it that is likable.I hope for a second season that can iron out these issues, because it really has charm and potential.🗿 Thanks for reading 🗿 most disappointing part about ""Boushoku no Berserk"" was the execution (I am shortening it to ""Berserk"" from now on), it seemed somewhat lacking with what could\'ve been done with the story.

A good example of how to subvert the lowest of expectations, and then subvert them further by being even worse. I’ve seen people say the show had potential, ‘’’binge-worthy’’’ even. The only way this slop would be worth bingeing is if you’re an insomniac, because by episode three you’d be fast asleep. Most everything I’m going to say about this snore-fest is simply objective.Outside of the story and world, in short the character designs are either bad or uninspired, the animation is un-exciting, the music is there and voice acting is the normal affair for any slop...anime. All is serviceable at best and dull at worst.Though I haven’t and won’t look at the source material, I despise light-novels. I thoroughly believe that light-novel to anime adaptations are responsible for the degradation of the entire medium in the last decade or more. They have served to dumb down the fantasy genre among other things to where the most basic, un-interesting and lazy garbage storytelling is now accepted as good.Premise -Let's start from the top. The show makes a terrible first impression by using VIDyA’ GAME stats and skills in a fantasy setting, which is wholly unrelated to an actual video game context. This is a common crutch I’ve seen stories use to gloss over the non-existent character progression and growth with artificial stats in their place. When set in the context of a game world, I would take little issue, but this is clearly presented as a ‘living’ fantasy world and not a damn video game.From here on, our MC is Jon Glutzerker, because I can’t remember anything about his name other than that it is very stupid sounding. Jon Glutzerker has no character flaw, weakness or any form of real arc as far as I have seen. His only technical ‘weakness’ is that his skill gives him a perpetual hunger, which cannot be quelled unless he kills monsters or people to absorb their literal souls. Jon Glutzerker’s video game ‘skill’ is first seen as useless, but of course turns out to be able to absorb other people's stats and skills, which allows him to become in-consistently over-powered as the series goes on.Jon Glutzerker starts off working as a Gate Guard for the castle in this unnamed and uninteresting fantasy kingdom. Prior to the story's beginning he is the object of torment for the most comical, unapologetically evil ‘characters’ I’ve seen in a while. Right from the word go, we can tell that there will be absolutely no interesting world-building or original ideas outside of the MC’s main power, or really any form of logic that is applied to this world.This conclusion can be made on this from the first, and most prime example: Our MC is the gate guard for a castle keep, the only one, mind you. The evil ‘Holy Knights’, which are mostly all of them, have him wearing rags as opposed to any kind of soldier attire, on-top of paying him like trash. What would be the in-universe point of having what is essentially a hobo guarding a castle keep, other than because three nit-wits use it as some archaic form of ‘abuse’? With no in-universe uniform and only a shoddy spear to ‘guard’ the gate, there are a dozen reasons this is massively stupid, and security risk would clearly be one of them since nobody likes the comically evil establishment. There’s allegedly a king, but he’s never visually shown so I guess these ‘Holy Knights’ can just do whatever they want, even though all they do is torment and harass the populace.From the first episode alone, you can already tell from basic pattern recognition that this show will have no: Interesting worldbuilding, depth, logical consistencies, character development or anything that makes a real story worth its weight in the time it takes to consume. Of course, who am I to expect the bare-minimum in storytelling from a Light-Novel’s adaptation? Obviously the point is to hardly try, and make slop for all the little piggies to slurp up, and roll around in the mud afterwards. What's worse, is as this mid-drek goes on, no real plot or story takes place despite Jon Glutzerker being a proactive ‘character’. Speaking of which…Characters -As you’d expect, every single character in this generic fantasy hole of a story is either one dimensional or- actually no they’re all just one-dimensional.Some might say a story is only as interesting as its villains. If that's the case, this story triples down on how dull and uninteresting it is as its villains are irredeemably, comically evil, having no motive or incentive to do or say anything, other than because they are evil. The main(?) bad guy has something going on where he is conspiring a plan to become inexplicably immortal. I can think of no incentive or cause for this to be on his bucket list, other than: he is evil, and therefore must seek power without cause. One of the Holy Knights is later shown to literally kidnap children for the explicit purpose of executing them with a bow and arrow; which does nothing but double down on his one and only character-trait - he is evil. If this was a character who presented himself as kind, or had some form of facade to cover what he really does, that would be partially interesting, even engaging. It may even be necessary to convey how evil a ‘character’ truly is if they present themselves as otherwise. But it isn’t necessary, it's just fluff because he already is blatantly evil. This is how children beneath the age of ten interpret and create villains. All of them have no motive for anything they do. No end goal in sight, no character motivation - no character at all other than their life-style as cartoon villains.Love-Interest, as she is only to be called, is the best looking drawing in the entire show. She is also an air-head, who does not openly recognize how everyone in the Holy Knights besides her is evil. From her introduction, she already looks out for Jon Glutzerker, and there is no further relationship development as they are always both overly bashful with one another. This is also one of Jon Glutzerker’s only character traits, to be flustered and bashful whenever the Love-Interest so much as looks at him.Returning to Jon Glutserker, things happen and upon activating his skill for the first time, he goes to find a proper weapon. He conveniently manages to find a sentient sword, which perfectly synergizes with his abilities in a bin full of ‘cheaper swords’ even though it is in pristine condition (visually).I hate this damn sword. It only exists to tip-toe around world-building by narrating exposition whenever it's most convenient. It narrates constantly, to an unwelcome degree, allowing the creators of this show to tell instead of the show, just like alllllll good stories do. In addition, to avoid any form of thought provoking combat, stakes or tension in a fight scene, the sword tells him exactly what to do to win every single time, and has the random ability to transform from some contrived in-universe logic.God forbid we ever have natural sounding dialogue or world-building play out through actual characters and significant events. That would require talent and effort, and this show wasn’t made with either in the budget, besides drawing the Love Interest.This anime does not respect or anticipate viewer intelligence to the point where you would believe this is a kids cartoon. Yet, there is plenty of meaningless and stake-less gore and violence that is so dull it means nothing and bares no intrigue for anyone watching it.The Rest of The Crap -As the story goes on, (unfortunately), an obnoxious flaw in the story is intentionally brought to our primary attention, only to gloss over it every instance after.Glutzerker's sword is sentient, and speaks to our MC telepathically. So of course our MC MUST talk back to it outloud for everyone to hear, which one would expect to make MC look like an idiot or a weirdo. The show acknowledges this, once, and then promptly ignores it for the rest of the story. Any real woman would lose all interest or believe someone to be creepy and weird if they saw them doing this. But of course Love-Interest is an air head and thus she must love our Gary Stu no matter how uninteresting, weird, and obnoxiously bashful he truly is.After slogging through three episodes, I was ready to drop this thing before reading some other reviews. They told a tale of a drastic drop-off in quality from the fourth episode, so me and my fellow Slopaholic carried on in curious interest.The consensus? It was hardly different from the rest of the garbage before-hand. Things happen and people do things, and that's about it.. What really woke us up was the beginning of the fifth episode.This may be construed as a minor spoiler, but honestly this show has no plot or real intrigue that could classify as a spoiler anyways. But, here's your forewarning.First, let's quickly go over the Bad Guy from before, the one who likes shooting children. We’ll call him Blue Hair. Don’t worry, this won't take long.Blue Hair has helped his fellow Holy Knights (Purple Hair Twink and Evil Woman) bully and torment our MC, and he likes killing kids. He is the lackey of Purple Hair, who wants to become immortal, and I think he’s his brother or something.There, done! And really, I made him sound more interesting than he is.After some things happen, (a summary of most episodes), Jon Nutzerker faces down Blue Hair, dawned in his ‘cool’ and ‘badass’ school shooter outfit, and his Tokyo Ghoul mask. Despite at-least partially ‘struggling’ to beat lower-tier monsters previously, Glutzerker obliterates a Holy Knight, whomst are feared across the kingdom for their strength and callousness, near instantly. Big surprise, but it gets better. He transforms his sword into a BFG-9000, established in the episode prior. He uses his BFG to blast Blue Hair into orbit, beating him with no effort, struggle, tension or character developments. After literally falling back to earth, Blue Hair is still inexplicably alive and missing all of his limbs in a bleeding mess. Since Blue Hair is utterly spineless and evil, he spent most of his final moments as a snivelling coward, begging for his life, before the MC then kills him, epicly owning the bully, and fulfilling the power-fantasy to set the groundwork for… nothing of substance afterwards.This ‘character’, like the other bad guys, was objectively evil, and mean to the main character with no other written purpose. Even in utterly deserving to be killed, there's just no substance, no stakes and no point in any victory Jon Glutzerker achieves. This killing is so brutal in concept, but everything that has led us to this moment is just contrived, and it amounts to nothing but senseless violence against a blank canvas, meant to represent the real-life bullies of the viewer or author. Again, no-one in this show has a character beyond one-dimension, and the piss-poor world building leaves you with no sympathy for anything that happens in it. The time wasted on Jon Glutzerker fighting un-inspired generic fantasy monsters while the sword explains everything and anything should have been used to develop the world and characters.When someone says a story isn’t believable, the meaning is that you could not believe or relate to the story taking place even if its fantastical elements were grounded in reality. The primary cause for this is most often that the characters don’t act like REAL PEOPLE. The villains aren’t believable, the Love-Interest isn’t believable, and Jon Glutzerker is definitely not believable as a real character. The people of this entire world aren’t believable, and if the characters aren’t believable the world isn’t either.From this point on, you can imagine anything that gets in MC’s way will only exist to make him look ‘cool’, despite how all the action scenes suffer from dullness, and an absence of psychology.Conclusion/Short-Summary -There's not really anything else worth saying, or thinking about Berserker of Gluttony. From the poster, I expected just the bare minimum. I at-least expected an edgy blood-fest for twelve episodes straight, but what this is is a boring, uninspired, and-then story in a dull and tired fantasy world with no creativity in sight.The final breaking point was when the already string-thin world-building was left hanging by a thread, and then with-out any build-up or pretext we are inexplicably introduced to sci-fi-esque series of buildings, featuring bright lights and industrial pipes. On-top of that, this mediaeval fantasy world had introduced unnamed characters wearing modern lab-coats and using modern lab equipment. I would break down how this utterly destroys the world, creates more questions than will ever be answered and is just genuinely the sloppiest handling of a world I’ve seen, but honestly, I don’t care. This world and story were put together hap-hazardly without even the most basic semblance of structure or care. You would think the target audience would be people who have zero media-literacy, or poor pattern recognition - a story for children. That would explain the tolerance for it, but even children would deserve better than this. Yet still, this show features fluctuating levels of gore despite its lack of substance, a demographic mistake other forms of media would get dragged through the mud for. But it doesn't deserve to be a bloody mess at all, because there is no substance or nuance to any of the violence. It's only a sideshow for Jon Glutzerker to get more skills and become stronger, a means to a boring and predictable end.Despite the show being at face value, not worth a damn - at the time of writing, the mean score for this slop is a resounding seven. Outstanding. Truly, the overall taste in anime has evolved. Backwards.Unless you lose a bet, there is no good reason to watch this anime, as it will provide you with nothing in return. The only worthwhile thought Berserker of Gluttony could ever provoke, is “why does this crap sell?”The answer, is that it's just another money laundering scheme. anime. All is serviceable at best and dull at worst.Though I haven’t and won’t look at the source material, I despise light-novels. I thoroughly believe that light-novel to anime adaptations are responsible for the degradation of the entire medium in the last decade or more. They have served to dumb down the fantasy genre among other things to where the most basic, un-interesting and lazy garbage storytelling is now accepted as good.Premise -Let's start from the top. The show makes a terrible first impression by using VIDyA’ GAME stats and skills in a fantasy setting, which is wholly unrelated to an actual video game context. This is a common crutch I’ve seen stories use to gloss over the non-existent character progression and growth with artificial stats in their place. When set in the context of a game world, I would take little issue, but this is clearly presented as a ‘living’ fantasy world and not a damn video game.From here on, our MC is Jon Glutzerker, because I can’t remember anything about his name other than that it is very stupid sounding. Jon Glutzerker has no character flaw, weakness or any form of real arc as far as I have seen. His only technical ‘weakness’ is that his skill gives him a perpetual hunger, which cannot be quelled unless he kills monsters or people to absorb their literal souls. Jon Glutzerker’s video game ‘skill’ is first seen as useless, but of course turns out to be able to absorb other people's stats and skills, which allows him to become in-consistently over-powered as the series goes on.Jon Glutzerker starts off working as a Gate Guard for the castle in this unnamed and uninteresting fantasy kingdom. Prior to the story's beginning he is the object of torment for the most comical, unapologetically evil ‘characters’ I’ve seen in a while. Right from the word go, we can tell that there will be absolutely no interesting world-building or original ideas outside of the MC’s main power, or really any form of logic that is applied to this world.This conclusion can be made on this from the first, and most prime example: Our MC is the gate guard for a castle keep, the only one, mind you. The evil ‘Holy Knights’, which are mostly all of them, have him wearing rags as opposed to any kind of soldier attire, on-top of paying him like trash. What would be the in-universe point of having what is essentially a hobo guarding a castle keep, other than because three nit-wits use it as some archaic form of ‘abuse’? With no in-universe uniform and only a shoddy spear to ‘guard’ the gate, there are a dozen reasons this is massively stupid, and security risk would clearly be one of them since nobody likes the comically evil establishment. There’s allegedly a king, but he’s never visually shown so I guess these ‘Holy Knights’ can just do whatever they want, even though all they do is torment and harass the populace.From the first episode alone, you can already tell from basic pattern recognition that this show will have no: Interesting worldbuilding, depth, logical consistencies, character development or anything that makes a real story worth its weight in the time it takes to consume. Of course, who am I to expect the bare-minimum in storytelling from a Light-Novel’s adaptation? Obviously the point is to hardly try, and make slop for all the little piggies to slurp up, and roll around in the mud afterwards. What's worse, is as this mid-drek goes on, no real plot or story takes place despite Jon Glutzerker being a proactive ‘character’. Speaking of which…Characters -As you’d expect, every single character in this generic fantasy hole of a story is either one dimensional or- actually no they’re all just one-dimensional.Some might say a story is only as interesting as its villains. If that's the case, this story triples down on how dull and uninteresting it is as its villains are irredeemably, comically evil, having no motive or incentive to do or say anything, other than because they are evil. The main(?) bad guy has something going on where he is conspiring a plan to become inexplicably immortal. I can think of no incentive or cause for this to be on his bucket list, other than: he is evil, and therefore must seek power without cause. One of the Holy Knights is later shown to literally kidnap children for the explicit purpose of executing them with a bow and arrow; which does nothing but double down on his one and only character-trait - he is evil. If this was a character who presented himself as kind, or had some form of facade to cover what he really does, that would be partially interesting, even engaging. It may even be necessary to convey how evil a ‘character’ truly is if they present themselves as otherwise. But it isn’t necessary, it's just fluff because he already is blatantly evil. This is how children beneath the age of ten interpret and create villains. All of them have no motive for anything they do. No end goal in sight, no character motivation - no character at all other than their life-style as cartoon villains.Love-Interest, as she is only to be called, is the best looking drawing in the entire show. She is also an air-head, who does not openly recognize how everyone in the Holy Knights besides her is evil. From her introduction, she already looks out for Jon Glutzerker, and there is no further relationship development as they are always both overly bashful with one another. This is also one of Jon Glutzerker’s only character traits, to be flustered and bashful whenever the Love-Interest so much as looks at him.Returning to Jon Glutserker, things happen and upon activating his skill for the first time, he goes to find a proper weapon. He conveniently manages to find a sentient sword, which perfectly synergizes with his abilities in a bin full of ‘cheaper swords’ even though it is in pristine condition (visually).I hate this damn sword. It only exists to tip-toe around world-building by narrating exposition whenever it's most convenient. It narrates constantly, to an unwelcome degree, allowing the creators of this show to tell instead of the show, just like alllllll good stories do. In addition, to avoid any form of thought provoking combat, stakes or tension in a fight scene, the sword tells him exactly what to do to win every single time, and has the random ability to transform from some contrived in-universe logic.God forbid we ever have natural sounding dialogue or world-building play out through actual characters and significant events.

His rapid growth, absorbing skills from vanquished foes, echoes the series' pace, albeit predictably.Notably, the weapon, Greed, adds a twist with its capacity to drain stats for augmented strength, and its unexpected ability to converse.Despite these elements,...the anime falls short in delivering excitement, with battles that hover around average and character development that lacks depth. The promise of a potential continuation looms, but the overall impression feels akin to an 'isekai' one might casually peruse out of sheer boredom.It's a series best approached with tempered expectations, offering a passable watch for those seeking casual entertainment without delving too deeply into intricate storytelling or robust character arcs. the anime falls short in delivering excitement, with battles that hover around average and character development that lacks depth.

In simple terms, generic≠bad. Berserk of Gluttony has a lot of the usual fantasy tropes that we see in modern light novels and anime, but those tropes exist for a reason. Because they’re entertaining and when done right, make for a great viewing experience. For me, that’s how I felt about...this show. Yea, there’s the rags to riches MC underdog story that we’re used to, the shitty nobles who make life for everyone around them miserable, the dark plot going on behind the scenes, etc. But, it just works well enough for me here. There’s enough of an interesting dynamic between the MC and his weapon, as well as the main female lead and the MC, that makes things pleasant.What specifically interests me so much in this world is the relationship between weapon and user. In a similar vein as tenken from last year, Fay has a unique bond with his sword wherein by exchanging his stats/levels, he’s able to upgrade his weapon and unlock new forms for it. The sword is able to communicate with Fay and they have a really fun dynamic with a ton of banter. Additionally, as a result of using the sword, Fay becomes “hungry” for souls and has to constantly replenish it. It makes for a unique set up since he has to go out and kill people periodically or risk being consumed by his own skill.Over time, we see that the skill also affects Fay’s personality. Making him more irritable, forceful, direct etc. I really enjoyed seeing him go from a broke homeless loser for lack of a better phrase, to someone with a purpose and the means to protect himself.Now, like most fantasy LN adaptations, you can definitely tell quite a lot was cut from this. I mean at several points in the story we legitimately skip what seem to be logical next scenes. Particularly between episodes 10 and 11 where the opening of the episode makes you go “wtf did I miss?”. I also have concerns about potential power creep issues which we began to saw towards the end of this show. Fay gets some power ups seemingly out of nowhere that kind of broke my immersion because they don’t seem to be consistent with the pace we’d established. I’ve heard this is an issue in the LN too, so that might just be a critique of the overall writing.Cast isn’t too big in this one, but the characters that we do have are all pretty great to me. As I touched on before I’m a big fan of Roxy and Fay’s relationship. To me it feels like what people think Kirito and Asuna’s relationship is. Not to mention the similar designs. Roxy doesn’t feel like a pretty girl who just needs saving either, she’s actually a bad ass character in her own right who stands up for her sense of justice. Unlike many anime, I can actually understand why Fay falls for her. She isn’t just gorgeous, but actually gives him ideals to strive towards and inspires him to be a better person, which was cool to see. If you don’t like cookie cutter fantasy romance stories, I think you’ll enjoy this one.Now, power creep and cuts aside, my biggest critique of the series is the production. The animation is pretty bad in here which is a shame. I think if it had better animation, several fight scenes would’ve been downright epic. Instead, they ended up looking like PowerPoint presentations. Episode 11 has a really cool scene which is arguably the highlight of the story so far, and they did deliver on that one. So maybe they were saving time and staff for the most important stuff? Regardless, it’s noticeable.All that aside, I still really liked this show. I’m a sucker for edgy dark fantasy stories and berserk of gluttony is definitely one of the most true to form dark fantasy stories out there. It’s not overwhelmingly edgy though. It’s a genuinely interesting world with some cool concepts and mechanics. I’m very much looking forward to reading it, I’ll miss it.Berserk of Gluttony gets 8, out of 10 this show.

In a similar vein as tenken from last year, Fay has a unique bond with his sword wherein by exchanging his stats/levels, he’s able to upgrade his weapon and unlock new forms for it. The sword is able to communicate with Fay and they have a really fun dynamic with a ton of banter. Additionally, as a result of using the sword, Fay becomes “hungry” for souls and has to constantly replenish it. It makes for a unique set up since he has to go out and kill people periodically or risk being consumed by his own skill.Over time, we see that the skill also affects Fay’s personality. Making him more irritable, forceful, direct etc. I really enjoyed seeing him go from a broke homeless loser for lack of a better phrase, to someone with a purpose and the means to protect himself.Now, like most fantasy LN adaptations, you can definitely tell quite a lot was cut from this. I mean at several points in the story we legitimately skip what seem to be logical next scenes. Particularly between episodes 10 and 11 where the opening of the episode makes you go “wtf did I miss?”. I also have concerns about potential power creep issues which we began to saw towards the end of this show. Fay gets some power ups seemingly out of nowhere that kind of broke my immersion because they don’t seem to be consistent with the pace we’d established. I’ve heard this is an issue in the LN too, so that might just be a critique of the overall writing.Cast isn’t too big in this one, but the characters that we do have are all pretty great to me. As I touched on before I’m a big fan of Roxy and Fay’s relationship. To me it feels like what people think Kirito and Asuna’s relationship is. Not to mention the similar designs. Roxy doesn’t feel like a pretty girl who just needs saving either, she’s actually a bad ass character in her own right who stands up for her sense of justice. Unlike many anime, I can actually understand why Fay falls for her. She isn’t just gorgeous, but actually gives him ideals to strive towards and inspires him to be a better person, which was cool to see. If you don’t like cookie cutter fantasy romance stories, I think you’ll enjoy this one.Now, power creep and cuts aside, my biggest critique of the series is the production. The animation is pretty bad in here which is a shame. I think if it had better animation, several fight scenes would’ve been downright epic. Instead, they ended up looking like PowerPoint presentations. Episode 11 has a really cool scene which is arguably the highlight of the story so far, and they did deliver on that one. So maybe they were saving time and staff for the most important stuff? Regardless, it’s noticeable.All that aside, I still really liked this show. I’m a sucker for edgy dark fantasy stories and berserk of gluttony is definitely one of the most true to form dark fantasy stories out there. It’s not overwhelmingly edgy though. It’s a genuinely interesting world with some cool concepts and mechanics. I’m very much looking forward to reading it, I’ll miss it.Berserk of Gluttony gets 8, out of 10', 'Butchered. Violated. Soiled. Rarely do these words come to mind when I think about an anime adaptation, but this time is different.Before getting into the actual review I would like to say, if you are interested in the story, read the light novels. If you\'re reading this after watching for some reason, the novels are just better and may improve your opinion about the story. If you somehow enjoyed what you watched, definitely read the light novels!Berserk of Gluttony was never going to be anime of the year, I knew that and my expectations weren\'t very high going in, but holy shit this...was worse than I could have imagined. I enjoyed the light novels quite a bit, and to see the story I had come to like be spit on, shredded, burned, then shaped into the most generic two-dimensional square I\'ve ever seen was quite painful. I\'m certain this is an exceedingly common opinion for light novel readers when anything they like gets animated, but hear me out.Story - My biggest complaint. It was so rushed, and so much was changed. Some scenes were way shorter than they needed to be, and many things were sped through. I get it, there\'s a lot of content in each novel, and adapting three of them in one season is naturally difficult, but why in God\'s name was so much changed?! I can totally see leaving small things out, that\'s fine, but straight up changing said small things AND LEAVING THEM IN is unacceptable. The small things are part of what makes each character themselves, and by changing many small bits of the story, each character is both less whole and less who the author wrote them to be, and the story overall is worse for it.***SMALL SPOILER FOR EPISODE 3 AND LIGHT NOVEL 1***I will give an example of something that was changed that ultimately hurt multiple characters AND changes their dynamics with other characters. Roxy\'s inspection was, in the novel, meant to show Roxy\'s dedication to the common people of Seifort and let her and Fate grow a little closer, as well as revealing small parts about their characters. This was not the case in the anime.First, it was rushed through. Half of this event was supposed to involve the lost boy you see being accosted by the Vlericks (WHO WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP AT ALL BY THE WAY) but most of that was skipped.Second, the involvement of the Vlericks in this part is problematic. They do not consider Fate someone of note at this point in the story, just another plebian they happened to employ and abuse, but their encounter with him in this part sets them up as if they know him almost intimately. When I read the first part of the first novel, I questioned if they even knew his name, which makes sense given that they are important holy knights and he\'s just some guy.Third, changing the reason Roxy went out in the first place. The original reason she went out was to try and understand the common people, as well as taking a little break from her newfound responsibilities as head of her house. She supposedly does this with some regularity, which shows how much she cares about the commoners. Changing her reason for going out to ""investigating the wandering monster"" eliminates this AND involves her in an event she\'s not supposed to be involved in.Fourth, the scene in the bar was originally charming and almost completely unrelated to the ""wandering monster"" and much more about Fate and Roxy\'s relationship and their casual interaction with the bartender, as well as Roxy getting more information about commoners. In the anime, it\'s an incredibly generic scene that I have seen as many times as I have strands of hair.Fifth, Greed is not supposed to be present in this event! I love Greed, he\'s one of my favorite characters, but his involvement in this part makes zero sense due to how rushed Fate was in accompanying Roxy (he had no time to go inside and get Greed before leaving + bringing Greed on a pleasant afternoon in town with Roxy makes no sense) and his presence removes some intimacy between Roxy and Fate, as they are supposed to be alone.Sixth, the gemstone salesman part. For some reason they changed them to be a man (which I don\'t understand considering he\'s supposed to be a woman but whatever) and they made the rock/gemstone lottery an actual thing instead of something impromptu and nice that the saleswoman did for Fate because he didn\'t have time to grab all his money before going out, so he only had a handful of copper. Here, Fate was supposed to choose a rock before thinking to use inspect, then the saleswoman asking if he was sure, which he isn\'t (which shows a bit of indecisiveness), then thinking of using inspect himself (not Greed\'s suggestion), then using it and finding out he chose well (which shows his luck). Roxy is then supposed to crush the rock with her bare hands which surprises the saleswoman (which shows a tendency toward not thinking when she\'s excited and happy, since she\'s supposed to be incognito at that time). This is a cute event that was trashed in the anime and personally I find that unforgivable.Keep in mind, this is just ONE event that is ruined in the anime. These small changes add up and, due to how generic the replacements are, they generify the whole story.***END SPOILER***Some of the changes are not so small. Entire events are skipped in some cases. Many things stop making sense as the reasons characters do certain things are changed. The WHOLE TONE of certain arcs are altered. I find this inexcusable, as it tarnishes everything that made the story good in the first place.Characters - \'Generic\' summarizes my complaints here fairly well, though I wish it didn\'t. 2D, flat, and mostly uninteresting, the characters in the anime adaptation fall far short of their novel counterparts, which is upsetting.Animation - Before watching this dumpster fire I didn\'t know what to expect from A.C.G.T. since I had never watched anything they worked on. Now I wish I had, if for no other reason than to set my expectations even lower. To be clear, it isn\'t the worst animation I have ever seen, but it\'s not great, especially in action scenes. Fight scenes were very jumpy and, to me, disorganized. Some parts almost felt like they began drawing a bigger picture but gave up halfway through and just zoomed in on what they had done already. This may be more of a complaint toward direction than anything else though.Music - Generic. Almost feels like something you might have heard 10-15 years ago.Voice Acting - I thought the VA choices were pretty good, and it turns out that was the only good part about this anime. Unfortunately, good performances by VAs cannot save an adaptation with so many issues.Overall, disappointing in nearly every regard. I have no idea what the higher ups were thinking when they destroyed Berserk of Gluttony\'s story. It feels as if they had no respect for the author or their work. More than anything though, I\'m sad, sad that most viewers\' only experience with this story will be a bad one purely because those in charge feel it\'s necessary to change everything that\'s already good, only to make it worse. I\'ll be honest, Berserk of Gluttony was never a masterpiece, even as a novel, but it was a hell of a lot better than what we got with this anime adaptation. was worse than I could have imagined.

However, there are some things that I dislike about this show. The setting is great, with the whole ""Stat System"" stuff since I do like isekai/fantasy anime and manga that have it. I just think that Fate as a character is kind of unlikeable. Funny to say that I like Greed(his sword) more as a character since the banter and chats he has with Fate are what kept me going for the story. Coming back to Fate, the person who wrote this story really could\'ve done better with him. Fate just feels too edgy and that doesn\'t seem...to keep me involved with him as a character. I usually dislike characters like that, but there are times where it works. Still, I liked Roxy and her benevolent attitude. She\'s definitely what people call ""Waifu material"". The combat scenes for this show were good. It\'s no Jujutsu Kaisen or Demon Slayer but it isn\'t too bad. If you\'re looking for a decent action fantasy anime, this isn\'t too bad of a watch. I only wish it was more to my taste but it might be for others. to keep me involved with him as a character. I usually dislike characters like that, but there are times where it works.

Overall the story is pretty okay, even good I would say, it is not too complexe but it is no way near to nonsense. However when you watch the anime episode after episode it just feels like progressing through the plot/everything is just for the plot, ""every idea we have has to help progressing the plot or it gets thrown out and wont make it into the show"". Animation and style are good and the animation...even pops off sometimes but rarely, special effects are really well made. The style they gave to the mc fits really well to everything. Character development exists, but it feels very clumsy like ""we need this specific development for the plot so lets get this done now"". The other characters are fine, nothing special, except his love Roxy. She only has the character traits ""very friendly, loves mc, wants to help the people"" and thats about it. So all in all the story is pretty good and the special effects aswell, I personally like the mc and I continue watching because I want to see how the plot will go on. even pops off sometimes but rarely, special effects are really well made.

Starting from the basic premise, in this plot people are born with magical abilities, but as already explained above the main character was not born with any type of power, for this reason he is mistreated and despised by the imperial knights (those whose main function is to protect the population from any threat, however many of them use their position to intimidate anyone who opposes the abuse of power practiced by the corrupt part of the imperial knights.Another relevant factor is the issue of the Seven Deadly Sins, which is a type of force considered cursed and feared by citizens, as the misuse of the capabilities of tools imbued with evil power has the possibility of affecting the world, due to its power in large scale and the harm that plague holders live with.What was the reason for this explanation based on explaining everything about the Seven Deadly Sins? The reason is quite simple, the protagonist who has always been disrespected and humiliated for not having any characteristic worthy of recognition gains favor with the sword of Gluttony, one of the seven deadly sins.Unveiling his vast power, Fate seeks revenge against those who oppressed him and confronted him with the indiscriminate use of violence, but he also seeks to provide security for Roxy and other individuals for whom he has a certain sympathy and affection.Analyzing the anime, I realize that the protagonist, despite being strong, does not present noble and equitable causes, continuing to be generic, both in appearance and in his empty and innocent ideals, I say this, for the simple fact that he only keeps searching From fighting evil to protecting Roxy and the people he cares about, he forgets all other factors, he simply doesn't care about bigger problems in the world to be solved, like Vlericks' abuse of power.In terms of fights, the program does not have a high level of consistency in fluidity, movement and choreography and dissipation of powers in most of the screen, however it is not an aberration either, as the A.C.G.T. studio. maintained the tendency to invest more in the fights that are truly essential to the plot.The design of the large mass of characters is very generic and without a distinguishing feature or striking point that differentiates it from so many other animes full of clichés (a clear generic design is that of the protagonist.)In development, it failed to show the relevance of Eris and Myne, given the little screen time given to them during boushoku, however Roxy becomes more mature, even if only minimally to protect the powerless protagonist in terms of responsibility and commitment. with his attitudes of using Gluttony irresponsibly until he is on the verge of death, Fate goes against the grain, as he does not have a heroic or glorification-worthy cause to achieve his ambitions.The opening and closing music, as well as the sounds in battle and the environment are normal, nothing exceptional or mediocre, it is simply acceptable and tolerable, as it does not compromise your experience when watching the show in any way.My enjoyment of this anime was average, with a score of around 5.In conclusion, boushoku no berserk is an anime with defects, imperfections, flaws and deficient in telling the story, especially that of Eris and Myne, the fights are nothing spectacular, but this animation also has its merits in building an interesting world, bringing to light a simple but understandable power system, develop reasonable fights, which may not seem like much, however other animes stand out negatively due to the constancy of the animation this season, unlike this one and their main success was certainly creating a heroine as interesting and protective as to Roxy, that is, by balance of measurements it is a work that divides opinions, with strong positive and negative points, so in my view this work has good and bad factors mixed together, leaving me with a mixed view of this program\u200b the information unfolds, the viewer concludes that Fate did not hold any power relevant to society, and is therefore just an ordinary citizen without great achievements.To better explain the context, it is extremely important to know how this world works.

But one day Fate finds a sword named Greed that helps awaken his Gluttony ability, which makes him more powerful the more he kills, However, if he doesn't fulfill his duties and fails to kill anything, than he will go berserk and something bad would happen ig (I don't...know, he never actually went berserk)This show is like an amalgamation of a bunch of others shows.

It's like they're taking the piss at everyone who's tired of these power fantasy shows, Which I honestly respect.Berserk Of Gluttony is one of the shows that also feels like a drag to get through the longer you watch it, it was fun for the first few episodes, but then it gets kind of boring.

Basically, everything about this show is pretty generic and even feels AI generated at times.All in all, I myself had a decent time watching this show, sure the interactions were boring, however when they actually get into fight scenes it starts to get fun again. The art is pretty good, but the animation itself is meh. I recommend this to people who enjoy trashy power fantasies, but not so much to people who like the more mainstream, serious shows."", ""It's a normal fantasy story about an overpowered character, if you just want a good fun brainless time go for it.BUT, the last few seconds of episode 11 (pls watch everything cause it won't have nearly the same impact if you don't) were really well made. No ridiculously fancy animation (which I do like too, don't get me wrong), no bombastic sound effects or soundtrack, just honest-to-goodness good direction with just on point facial expressions and good solid work from the voice actors. Am I recommending you to watch the whole thing because of 15 seconds or so? Welp, guess I am. "", ""Good anime based on a great manga. Quite fast-paced unlike its manga counterpart. But still looks and feels great.The animation quality is normal maybe above normal considering the anime doesn't use CGI. At least I had not seen any.Fights are quite interestingly animated, and everything looks like the manga counterpart. The adaptation is fabulously made.The only negative I can say is its fast-paced nature. Everything is too compacted. It could easily have been anime with 20 episodes.Even tho this anime is quite entertaining and I think everyone who watches the first episode will get easily hooked.

I'm not saying they are all ground breaking, just that you should definitely consider watching those first.  I have not listed anime such as Mushoku Tensei, Eminence in the Shadow etc. because if you are even considering watching Boushoku no Berserk you must have seen the best and most popular shows of this formula.If you have seen everything out there and need to kill an afternoon Boushoku no Berserk is watchable unlike other similar shows out there. as a SwordBlack SummonerTrapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for MobsThe World's Finest Assassin Gets ReincarnatedSeirei GensoukiI'm a spider so what?The Reincarnation of the Strongest Exorcist in Another WorldAll of the above listed anime have a similar formula and are superior in every way due to their execution, world building and character development.

I watched this because I was curious whether it could be saved. It could not.This anime is probably called Berserk of Gluttony because it drives anyone that watches it insane.

One character turned up, fought the MC, lost and died all within about 20 mins of content.The characters are the worst part of this story, by far.- The MC is a classic Japanese doormat MC who will arbitrarily take revenge on one person and yet, a different person who has treated him just as badly will be helped at no cost. Here's an example: he was kicked out of his village as his father died and he, as a child, was not useful. He was stoned, bullied by the other children, verbally and physically abused and then exiled. His father likely died due to being used by the other villagers as a shield against monsters. Fast forward to present: one of the kids that threw stones at him and bullied him out of the village comes begging for help, he is rejected by an unrelated warrior who doesn't even have a grudge against him. Instead of also saying no as any sane person would to a person who essentially is the source of their childhood trauma, he accepts the guys request. Upon arrival he is once again verbally abused by the village chief and villagers alike, instead of getting understandable annoyed and leaving he allows the abuse to continue. Then, when monsters attack the village he puts his life on the line to defend the very same villagers who kicked him out into the wilderness to starve, showing them that no matter how badly they treat someone, they'll always be able to drag them back and use them again when convenient. This is just one of many incidents like this - give me a break and grow a backbone. It's to the extent where you begin to wonder if he actually enjoys the abuse.- The main heroine is a hypocrite. She is presented as a jesus-like figure, the only good one among a scum-ridden holy knight order. She is the only thing keeping the knight order in control in the city the story starts in. Without her the knights, who are 1 dimensional and cartoonishly evil, kidnap children to torture them for their pleasure. This all seems fairly good until she decides that she would rather volunteer to go fight monsters on the front lines, thus dooming the citizens of the town completely. That is her hometown by the way, but who cares about them they're not in her immediate vicinity so they might as well sod off. Oh and punishing the evil holy knights from her position of authority? Impossible. She'd much rather give them a stern talking to and tell them to never do it again - truly a fitting punishment for the grievous bodily harm of a helpless citizen... Surely they won't just continue to do it when she's not there or not looking, that would truly be impossible... dumb.- Next comes the wrath girl, who has so little personality I can't even remember her name. She should be renamed to the sin of being a burden. She joins the MC and leaves him some kobolds to fight, essentially pushing the task on him. She frames this as a favour and in return, forces him to confront one of the strongest beings on the planet for her convenience. Not only this but she eats all his food, breaks the travelling cart over minor unintentional verbal slights, charges her companions obscene prices for even the most basic of tasks to help out and unironically uses the MC as furniture. Obviously the MC being a doormat completely goes along with this and even his minor pranks that he returns as payback for her unreasonable acts of eating all the food and falling asleep while MC works are returned disproportionately.

Watch Redo of Healer instead. pointless when Greed is just a transformation from victory and the lore behind the deadly skills is ignored.  The worst part is the end because nothing is presented that even suggests it could end any other way. Watch Redo of Healer instead."", ""To understand my thoughts on this series, you need to understand my thoughts on the past few seasons of anime and how much of a disappointment much of it has been in general,Anime that lost their direction, or anime that tried to stand out by either putting a new twist on things but but just ended up being boring, or looked to be edgy, and forgot that they also had to be engaging.Not to mention the amount of anime that have stumbled and lack consistency, that have left me feeling unsatisfied or unfulfilled.To use food analogies, it's like being served the salad as a...main dishNow I won't deny that we've had some really good steak getting served up, but not often enoughBerserk of Glutton is not a steak, but it is a burger, and that is all it needs to beIt doesn't try to do anything different, to do anything new, it doesn't seek to deviate from the recipe and deviate from the path of a good burger, instead all the tropes, all the ingredients are there in the right quantities, after all there is a reason these tropes are so common and overused, its because they work, and in the hands of a competent cook, they taste good.It is seasoned / paced well, and the end result is a tasty / fun burger that will satisfy your stomach until you get to yet another bad anime.What? Is that not enough of a review? You want more? Such gluttony.On the surface the story is very cookie cutterOP MC starts out as Weak MC with apparently a weak skill that turns out to be an OP skill, which he doesn't know until it triggers and we know how the rest of this trope plays outHe finds a sword that is ignored in the bargain bin, that is pretty much perfectly suited for someone who has a talent like his, and it also talks, think Familiar of Zero and Reincarnated as a Sword.He is mistreated by obvious bad / evil guys, but is protected by female hero who he admires, who they plot to send to her death, and he then vows to protect.It is when we get to the character Myne that things get more interesting and we also get a hint of a wider storyWhich brings us to charactersI'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but the majority of the characters at the start of the series are pretty much two dimensional. The only exception are Roxy and Fate themselves.It's only when we leave the capital that we see a shift in thisI would say Set is the first character to be given this treatment, even though we do briefly encounter Myne before himBut Set is the first person who is given a proper character, he has to deal with his past while trying to protect his future. The fact that he has such a minor role in the series, and yet is able to stand out far more than some of the others tells you the significance of good character writing.Aaron is another character that is given heavy focus along the way and is well written.Myne we don't get to know much about as a lot about her is kept a mystery, but we do get to know her personality, and certain things about her are slowly revealed as she starts to trust and like Fate moreThe only reason I'm not going into more detail here is I don't wish to get into spoilersIn all honesty, I can see people giving up on this after the first few episodes as it doesn't do enough to set itself apart, it walks those same tropes far to closely at the beginning and it's only when he leaves the capitol and heads for Galia that we actually get some development going and the burger starts to come together.It's enjoyable, and sometimes, that is enough main dishNow I won't deny that we've had some really good steak getting served up, but not often enoughBerserk of Glutton is not a steak, but it is a burger, and that is all it needs to beIt doesn't try to do anything different, to do anything new, it doesn't seek to deviate from the recipe and deviate from the path of a good burger, instead all the tropes, all the ingredients are there in the right quantities, after all there is a reason these tropes are so common and overused, its because they work, and in the hands of a competent cook, they taste good.It is seasoned / paced well, and the end result is a tasty / fun burger that will satisfy your stomach until you get to yet another bad anime.What?

Any hope it might've had was wasted tho.I suspect the writing was done by a middle-schooler.

However, there were instances where the narrative abruptly shifted to a point in the story without offering an explanation of how the main character arrived there. Despite this, I would wholeheartedly recommend the anime due to its exceptional world-building and a compelling storyline, in my opinion. It proved to be an easy watch, and I developed a deep fondness for the characters. While certain moments felt a bit lackluster, primarily due to the main character not always making the smartest decisions, there were still numerous enjoyable aspects to the series. Overall, I consider it a...commendable show. The art style seamlessly complemented the story, and the narrative itself was notably unique.

Nice work!Recommended!', 'Berserk of Gluttony — this ain\'t your usual late Kentaro Miura\'s Berserk levels of violence and gore. It\'s just another one of those LN titles that just screams generic edgelord levels of ""zero to hero"" predictable redemption arcs for the oppressed.Written by novelist Ichika Isshiki, Boushoku no Berserk a.k.a Berserk of Gluttony is yet another dark fantasy Syosetu-turned-LN series that you\'ve most likely caught by perchance of something interesting, but what it (and now the anime adaptation) amounts to is basically a revenge story in the sea of yet another similar one this season (see Hametsu no Oukoku a.k.a The Kingdoms of Ruin) that likes...to take the idea of revenge and glorify it for the weak MC who has yet to reach their redemption arc to save those that brought him to where they are now.In this fantasy world, people are born with skills that will prove their worth to the people around them. But for one MC by the name of Fate Graphite, his skill is rather useless: Gluttony, one of the Seven Deadly Sins skills. Working as a poor gatekeeper for the rather malicious Vlerick family of holy knights of children Hado, Memil, and Rafale, Fate always finds himself starving for no reason at all, always being bullied by the children with no end of salvation in sight. Fortunately, Fate\'s one glimmer of hope is with another holy knight: Roxy Hart, who is benevolently kind to him, and he would do anything to make sure that he would work under her and reap her kindness in return in the hope that he could protect her one day. Soon, Fate wants to make a name for himself and purchases a rusty black sword for almost literally nothing, only to learn that the sword he got was the living magic sword Greed, teaching Fate that his Gluttony skill is a forbidden one that defies Divine Law since it can absorb other skills and must be kept a tight-lipped secret.I don\'t know about you, but Fate Graphite as a character, I get that he has the ""zero to hero"" MC tropey treatment that is the usual typical cliché, but the way that the author pits his character to be, it just feels uncooked at best. Maybe that\'s the stereotypical thing of pacing that affects the anime, but even the manga adaptation of the LN is rather similar as well, so in the context of the anime, it chocks up to just being that Fate is a good-nurtured individual who wants to correct the perverse of justice (just like in Tate no Yuusha a.k.a Shield Hero) and fight for what\'s right. It\'s clear that we\'ll need to see more of Fate\'s development rather than being just a typical powerless-to-powerful MC who has a dream to protect Roxy and the people he cares about in return, other than meeting others with their Seven Deadly Sins skills and figuring out what their intentions are as well. Speaking of Roxy, she\'s like an angel to Fate: the Holy Knight, adored by the people for her kindness, is a victim of her nurtured personality, thus looking like they had crushes on each other. For now, Fate\'s self-absorbed responsibility to protect her is the sole reason why he still stands tall and righteous. Everybody else, forget it, as the world itself is smudged in fearmongering and terror of people abusing their power, just like the Vlericks.Even the production values don\'t give much hope that this\'ll preserve for the ages, coming from a studio whose track record is all the wonkier with a rather disappointing (but expected) return. Directed by Tetsuya Yanagisawa, who\'s responsible for High School DxD and Orient, A.C.G.T. may not be the studio that comes to mind these days, but still, they have to rely on shows like this to keep the 3rd-rate studio\'s business running, even if it means that the show will not look as good from a production standpoint. The anime just felt mostly mediocre on its animation, though it\'s better than some studio having to push an obscene 3 shows this season (I\'m looking at you, Project No. 9) and isn\'t as bad as you think it is.Needless to say, the OST is not that memorable either, though for up-and-coming Seiyuu group EverdreaM, while Spring\'s Rokudou no Onna-tachi OP song is just not for me, both OP and ED songs here are a much better effort, and I\'ve come to like them both over time, especially the latter.But in an overall sense, Boushoku no Berserk is just not the show that I can recommend if you\'re expecting something unique to come out of the dark fantasy genre that most LN authors have stuck to the same old bread-and-butter trick for years now, with nothing new to offer. You simply watch this show for its own ""unique"" entertainment, which is rather methodical yet underwhelming and slow.Just pass on; there\'re other shows that do the dark fantasy genre better justice. to take the idea of revenge and glorify it for the weak MC who has yet to reach their redemption arc to save those that brought him to where they are now.In this fantasy world, people are born with skills that will prove their worth to the people around them.

Aho Girl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34881/Aho_Girl,"['*No Spoiler Concise Review*TL;DR: An idiot girl getting into endless shenanigans that keeps viewers just laughing till their precious buttocks fall off.[Story: 4/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 9/10]What is Aho Girl? What isn\'t Aho girl? Should I even watch this anime? If you think this anime looks stupid and the premise you\'ve read on MAL sounds dumb then you are even more of an ""Aho"" than the main girl is in this anime. Seriously, Aho Girl (Idiot Girl) is your classic boke and tsukkomi style comedy with plenty of slapstick. If you just want to turn off your brain and laugh...your ass off, this is definitely that show. I have never seen so much savagery in anime. The brutality is absolutely barbaric. It\'s just gag after gag after gag. One of the best 15 minute ab workout ever. Your sides will hate you but they will thank you.This is your classic yin-yang sort of anime where the characters and the story directly compliments each other. One can\'t live without the other. Though there are numerous characters introduced as the anime goes on, the main characters are, Yoshiko, a masochist idiot beyond all belief, and her childhood crush A-Kun, a genius sadist beyond all belief. Every time Yoshiko\'s idiosyncrasies rises to a peak, A-Kun brutally punches it down to normalize the situation. It is this exchange of quit pro quo that makes this anime so hilarious.  Even though viewers might feel bad for Yoshiko because of all the sufferings she endures due to her stupidity. However, she\'s literally the anthropomorphized genderbent version of Patrick Star. Not to mention she deserves every bit of it.Each episode consists of few short gags. Even though you know it will feature some sort of idiotic stunt from the MC, needless to say, each gag remains fresh despite reusing running joke here and there. As the show goes on, we are introduced to various side characters ranging from Yandere Killer Mom to Tsundere Lewd President to Kuudere Dumb Sister to Overtly Charismatic Doge. At first they appear smart however as the show goes everyone but A-kun slowly becomes an idiot. There\'s a popular fan theory from avid manga readers that it\'s all A-Kun\'s fault. He sucks the intelligence out of everyone around him. He has like a 20 foot radius that sucks away at least 50 points of intelligence from everyone who enters. True or False, well that\'s for you to decide.Anyways, the art & animation in this anime is pretty good. The studio did great justice to this anime despite it being an anime short. It\'s beautifully hand drawn and all the characters somehow stand out from one another. Not just the character design, the seiyuus in this anime heightened the enjoyment factor even more. Specifically the seiyuu of Yoshiko. She did a fantastic job. The OP and ED songs are funny and compliments the comedy style of this anime. The background score didn\'t stand out much but that can be overlooked.Overall, if you are looking for a short anime with endless comedy gags with no clear story or plot but just laughter, then this anime is for you. It\'s slightly lewd, slightly dramatic but over the top comedy. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how great your abs look from all that laughter.Btw, did you know that ""Baka"" and ""Aho"" are synonyms. People who live in the eastern half of central Japan (Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba) generally use Aho whilst rarely using Baka when serious. This is reversed in the western half of Japan, (Osaka, Kyoto,) resulting in some minor arguments between Tomins (Capital Citizens) and Osakans.P.S. Thank you for reading.

I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!', 'Hidden beneath the antics, the one-liners, and the pop culture references, Aho Girl’s goal is obvious even to the untrained eye; it desires your attention. “Look at me! Look at me!” Aho Girl screams, waving its arms and jumping about in a frenzied, excessive, and desperate manner. In doing so, this show has managed to not only work but endear itself to the audience as well. Quite a few seasonal viewers have been smitten over this show and, at first glance, it’s easy to see why. Aho Girl is energetic. It’s straightforward. And it’s occasionally charming. However, Aho Girl is also painful to watch.First and...foremost, this show is simply not funny. For Aho Girl, which largely subdues its aesthetics in an effort to emphasize its writing, this is a severely damaging flaw. Aho Girl fancies itself an extravagant comic extraordinaire yet it never fully ventures into the absurd; it’s as if Aho Girl is frightened of abandoning its slice-of-life roots and as a result is rather hesitant of displaying signs of vivaciousness. The instances where its comic genius sparks to life are memorable in their own right (the homage to the Power Rangers, in particular) but they are few and far between. It hardly helps that Aho Girl, like most mediocre comedies, is obsessed with explaining the jokes to you; with every act of mischief, there’s not only a character (read: the “self-insert”) elaborating on the details of said act but there are also occasional cues from Aho Girl itself that tell you how the act was intended to be funny. As this show can attest to, even comedies can be guilty of infodumping.From the first episode, Aho Girl is engaged in a war against common sense. This is a show that prides itself in its intentional stupidity; for Aho Girl, lapses in judgment and instances of in-the-moment logic are par for the course. A carefree attitude and general acts of silliness are a major source of this show’s appeal. That said, Aho Girl underwhelms when it attempts a serious approach; it’s as if the show doesn’t understand its audience. Most viewers appreciate Aho Girl because of its slapstick humor, because of the amusing eyecatches, because of its short runtime and, yes, because of the fanservice. I doubt that these viewers picked up Aho Girl for the half-baked, insipid, and monotonous moments of insight that ultimately result in little but wasted time. These moments of insight are not only executed poorly but their suitability is subpar; Aho Girl tends to observe the most trivial matters, like a low score on a quiz, and overexert itself when it should be focusing on the more important problems, like the abusive relationship at the center of it all.Every problem that arises from Aho Girl stems from the disastrous dynamic between its protagonists; it’s the repugnant elephant in the room that Aho Girl’s fanbase has condoned, glossed over, neglected, and outright ignored at times. The cast members are defined by a single trait but no cast member has as damaging a trait as Akuru Akutsu (the “self-insert”) and Yoshiko Hanabatake (the show’s poster girl). Yoshiko’s defining trait is idiocy while Akuru’s is anger; while Yoshiko compensates for her lack of intellect with a can-do attitude, Akuru offers little outside of his constant rage. There have been plenty of characters similar to Akuru, like Last Exile’s Alex Row, that have provided substance, versatility and growth to their cast beyond their brooding tendencies and hair-trigger temper. Akuru, however, is feeble in comparison; he makes little effort to express himself beyond screaming matches and physical abuse. When he encounters a problem, Akuru explodes. When his friend attempt helping him, Akuru becomes spiteful; he insults, he torments, he belittles, he punches, he kicks, and he hurls expletives at his friends simply because he perceives them as annoying. Sure, Akuru apologizes once in a while but he never bothers to change. Honestly, why should he? The other cast members, specifically Yoshiko, and Aho Girl itself by proxy have long since accepted this as rational behavior. That the show has treated Akuru’s abusive tendencies as a gimmick, that the show’s fanbase has little reaction to it, is sickening to me.There is a place in this world for Aho Girl, where it can exist without scrutiny of any sort. Aho Girl has established itself and thrived in GIFs, in Vines, in reaction videos, in memes and in the Weird Side of YouTube. It is there that Aho Girl’s positive traits can flourish. However, under any sort of analysis, Aho Girl not only leaves you unsatisfied but more than a little repulsed as well. This show, allergic to depth and disgusted by morality, is at best mildly amusing and at worst one of the biggest disgraces of a thoroughly mediocre season. Aho Girl makes a spectacle of itself -  presenting faux-meaningful observations; idolizing its vapid female lead; overindulging in panty shots; deploying one tired, overused cliché after another (the sister complex, among others); and fishing for attention - while accomplishing absolutely nothing in the end. While its peers in the comedy genre have pushed boundaries, expanded horizons, enlightened its fans, and revolutionized the medium, Aho Girl has contributed little beyond munching on bananas. foremost, this show is simply not funny. For Aho Girl, which largely subdues its aesthetics in an effort to emphasize its writing, this is a severely damaging flaw. Aho Girl fancies itself an extravagant comic extraordinaire yet it never fully ventures into the absurd; it’s as if Aho Girl is frightened of abandoning its slice-of-life roots and as a result is rather hesitant of displaying signs of vivaciousness. The instances where its comic genius sparks to life are memorable in their own right (the homage to the Power Rangers, in particular) but they are few and far between. It hardly helps that Aho Girl, like most mediocre comedies, is obsessed with explaining the jokes to you; with every act of mischief, there’s not only a character (read: the “self-insert”) elaborating on the details of said act but there are also occasional cues from Aho Girl itself that tell you how the act was intended to be funny. As this show can attest to, even comedies can be guilty of infodumping.From the first episode, Aho Girl is engaged in a war against common sense. This is a show that prides itself in its intentional stupidity; for Aho Girl, lapses in judgment and instances of in-the-moment logic are par for the course. A carefree attitude and general acts of silliness are a major source of this show’s appeal. That said, Aho Girl underwhelms when it attempts a serious approach; it’s as if the show doesn’t understand its audience. Most viewers appreciate Aho Girl because of its slapstick humor, because of the amusing eyecatches, because of its short runtime and, yes, because of the fanservice. I doubt that these viewers picked up Aho Girl for the half-baked, insipid, and monotonous moments of insight that ultimately result in little but wasted time. These moments of insight are not only executed poorly but their suitability is subpar; Aho Girl tends to observe the most trivial matters, like a low score on a quiz, and overexert itself when it should be focusing on the more important problems, like the abusive relationship at the center of it all.Every problem that arises from Aho Girl stems from the disastrous dynamic between its protagonists; it’s the repugnant elephant in the room that Aho Girl’s fanbase has condoned, glossed over, neglected, and outright ignored at times. The cast members are defined by a single trait but no cast member has as damaging a trait as Akuru Akutsu (the “self-insert”) and Yoshiko Hanabatake (the show’s poster girl). Yoshiko’s defining trait is idiocy while Akuru’s is anger; while Yoshiko compensates for her lack of intellect with a can-do attitude, Akuru offers little outside of his constant rage. There have been plenty of characters similar to Akuru, like Last Exile’s Alex Row, that have provided substance, versatility and growth to their cast beyond their brooding tendencies and hair-trigger temper. Akuru, however, is feeble in comparison; he makes little effort to express himself beyond screaming matches and physical abuse. When he encounters a problem, Akuru explodes. When his friend attempt helping him, Akuru becomes spiteful; he insults, he torments, he belittles, he punches, he kicks, and he hurls expletives at his friends simply because he perceives them as annoying. Sure, Akuru apologizes once in a while but he never bothers to change. Honestly, why should he? The other cast members, specifically Yoshiko, and Aho Girl itself by proxy have long since accepted this as rational behavior. That the show has treated Akuru’s abusive tendencies as a gimmick, that the show’s fanbase has little reaction to it, is sickening to me.There is a place in this world for Aho Girl, where it can exist without scrutiny of any sort. Aho Girl has established itself and thrived in GIFs, in Vines, in reaction videos, in memes and in the Weird Side of YouTube. It is there that Aho Girl’s positive traits can flourish. However, under any sort of analysis, Aho Girl not only leaves you unsatisfied but more than a little repulsed as well. This show, allergic to depth and disgusted by morality, is at best mildly amusing and at worst one of the biggest disgraces of a thoroughly mediocre season. Aho Girl makes a spectacle of itself -  presenting faux-meaningful observations; idolizing its vapid female lead; overindulging in panty shots; deploying one tired, overused cliché after another (the sister complex, among others); and fishing for attention - while accomplishing absolutely nothing in the end.

Summer 2017 animes are ending already and it was quite a hustle... From the isekai genre shows like ''In Another World With My Smartphone'' that so many hates about,,the A-1 pictures version of the Fate series, the gambling-crazy anime Kakegurui, the action packed 2nd season of Boku No Hero Academia, to the romantic anime Koi To Uso, we all have been blessed with so many good shows though there is something missing.. An anime that is mainly focused on humor, laughter or should I say.. The legendary ''Comedy'' genre. There comes the hidden wonder ''Aho Girl''. It looks like an anime version of...''Minions'' but focused mostly on the daily high school life of our beloved banana-loving girl Hanabatake Yoshiko and her childhood love but a brutal wrestler who can supplex her everyday because of her stupidity, Akutsu Akuru or simply, A-kun.Story: 7/10On my opinion, I prefer stories that goes with the intro, rising, climax, falling then resolution. Thats whats lacking Aho Girl.. Though this anime gives us ''part'' where it has almost all the elements of a perfect plot, though I said ''Almost''. Not everytime. The comedic side though is very superior on this anime which balance the enjoyment of the audience.Art: 9/10The art of this anime... The characters sketches are easily aliked to any other animes out there but the action-packed art scenes/effects and the mouth along with the eyes of the characters makes it unique and entertaining. Comedic + Good Art = Worth it.Sound: 9/10Hey hey.. They said the opening of the anime is not that good. I'm like ''Am I the only one who loves it?''. Along with the humor side of the opening, its music is preferable to the anime itself to be honest. Then comes the little background music when the shows rolls on stating that this anime will be a high school/laughable anime...Character: 9/10This anime shows us that even characters that are hard to read like A-kun can be an element to a joke or humor and they did it perfectly along with other characters. All of the characters have their roles on the line from Main to Supporting, which supports the show even more on its genre.Enjoyment: 9/109/10 is already pretty high for me. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment. A 12-minute anime like Aho Girl, for me, its like already 24 minutes (but I'm begging for more Lmao).Overall: 9/10If theres 9.5/10 I could really give this anime that rating. Enjoyable, funny, great art, excellent characters, wrestling supplexes, everything here is almost perfect and I love this show very much.

Review!12 episodes, each is around 12 minutes. Each episode is split into 3 or 4 smaller parts.Now, Aho Girl doesn\'t have any story, it contains random unrelated stories which are funny with different characters from the cast.It was pretty funny at the beginning, and I even wanted full 24 minutes episodes, but..... Somewhere in the middle I felt like I\'m already done with Aho Girl. It became a lot less funny, and many of the jokes repeated themselves.At one point new characters were introduced, and which felt to me too much. I liked the original cast and now that half of...the scenes are focused on Yoshiko and other random characters.The concept of Aho Girl is simple- Yoshiko, the main character, is stupid (Well, ""Aho"") and does nothing but play around. She doesnt study and doesnt even care about it. She thinks everybody loves her and basically... she acts like a 4 years old girl.And yea it was funny at first, but then again, it just becomes repetitive.If I were to take all the stories together and give them a score, 5/10 would fit.Art-7/10 as nothing too special, but it wasn\'t unappealing.Sound 3/10. Nothing worth remembering, neither the OP or the OST (if there even was one)Character- 7/10Now, I\'ve already described Yoshiko, but all the characters repeat the same pattern. While they are pretty funny in the beginning (because you have yet to see they follow the same pattern over and over again).You already know the pattern from episode one (or the first episode every character is introduced).I\'ll confess, because there aren\'t any character complexity  nor development, nor story, I can\'t really say much about this anime. You can try it, as it was funny at the beginning, but... Don\'t hope too much.Enjoyment+Overall: 7/10.

I wonder if the author respects women or not.The story, a stupid girl Yoshiko with a brain of the size of a monkey that has some attention disorder illness. She takes stupid decisions all the time and tries to capture the ""love"" and interest of Akutsu. Also, she likes bananas, so the author refers to her as a monkey.  She has been near Akutsu since their youth, but this guy incomprehensibly hates her. Honestly, ¿isn\'t that fun?  We will...laugh in some scenes, I can\'t deny that some of them are funny but others no. Is like seeing a mentally ill person doing any stupid thing and someone will punch that person, and we end laughing for that actions.It isn\'t funny seeing a guy beating a woman all the time, he hits Yoshiko, insults her, minimizes her and even compares her to a piece of filth. And that doesn\'t end there he does similar actions to her mom, Yoshie that is desperate to give her daughter to the first person that appears nearby, in this case, Akutsu. It isn\'t funny seeing a progression like this. It will be funnier if Akutsu tries helping the poor soul of Yoshiko by all means in a similar case as with his sister and ends failing.About the characters, what can I say? It is a monkey as described in the show (Yoshiko) vs. and orangutan (that arrogant guy one). The other characters are forced, like Yoshiko\'s friends and appear in a very useless way. To add some competition for her, the author just added another female from her school that falls in love for Akutsu.Update recent episodes:  In the last episodes, I noticed that if you remove Akutsu from the story, the show will go from bad to abysmal. The story failed entirely in being a balanced and real comedy. The show can\'t make people laugh without the abusive orangutan around.The voice over, ¿what happened Aoi? You are better than this. Honestly, she isn\'t the voice for Yoshiko. The character needs to yell too much, and she ends doing a pinch that gets annoying because she uses a high pinch and can\'t maintain it regularly so ends pushing harder and the tone isn\'t balanced.About the art, it is normal. We aren\'t seeing any master piece here, but your eyes aren\'t going to suffer from it either.  The songs are good. The OP has a good rhythm. The sound, in general, is acceptable.Finally, I am sure that a lot of persons will love this kind of shows and I can\'t argue with them. I am neutral and will end watching it because I am hoping that Akutsu will change his actions or that Yoshiko could hit this orangutan. laugh in some scenes, I can\'t deny that some of them are funny but others no.

I started the anime out reluctant to do it as I felt it was going to be stupid and mediocre but I sure was wrong.Story: 6/10The story is nothing special. The story follows Yoshiko, a girl extremely stupid you'll feel stupid yourself just watching her, and her every day life with her childhood friend, A-kun. She is always doing something stupid and he is always trying to stop...her. She also adds suffering to the life of the rest of her friends.Art: 6/10The art is normal for an anime like it. I can see them making the most out of their budget, though.Sound: 7/10The opening theme is somewhat catchy. There isn't much to say about the sound considering most of the background music is like something you'd find in Youtube video about comedy.Character: 6/10All characters are cliched in their personality but they are extreme in it. Yoshiko is a free-spirited, stupid girl but taking it to the extreme. A-kun is the aggressive character that's forced to put up with the stupidity of Yoshiko but he is missing a machine gun.Enjoyment: 10/10I haven't laughed as hard since Konosuba. This anime is pretty hilarious and would just make you laugh pretty much the whole time. As always, comedy as subjective so what I might be laughing at, another person might find unfunny. It's all a matter of preferences and personality.Overall:Aho Girl isn't some kind of perfect anime that has great narrative, interesting story, deep characters, breathtaking art, or best soundtrack in history but it is something you watch when you're free an wanna have a good laugh. I'd recommend it to any comedy fans and just casuals that wanna try something funny. It should NOT be taken seriously or you might not enjoy it at all.

Yoshiko, the titular girl of the show, loves bananas, she loves Akutsu, and she loves playing around. She is also absolutely imbecilic, managing to consistently get 0's on every test in school. Yet she has a certain charm to her, and a devious insight into the behaviour of those around her, that sometimes make you wonder whether she's really stupid or just sees the world very differently from everyone else.Akutsu on the other hand is a thoroughly disagreeable fellow, he's very smart and has a punch that can knock out anyone. Most of the...time he's punching Yoshiko (in a gender equality kind of way which would make Kazuma of Konosuba proud).  The setup for many of the early jokes in the series relies on this dichotomy between Yoshiko and Akutsu. Yet the series quickly moves on to bigger and greater things. It parodies shounens, racing anime (the sequence which parodies Initial D is absolutely spot on), and most other genres under the sun. Even if you haven't seen the shows which it parodies, your enjoyment of it is hardly going to suffer. Aho Girl doesn't hold its punches, and toys around with all kinds of situational comedy, parody in general, as well as more down to earth humor about the human condition.This is a show that loves poking fun at others, but does so with a conscious nod to the genres it parodies. Not unlike One-Punch Man, the love toward the genres it makes fun of is ever-present. More than anything, the very short format of the series (12 minute episodes as compared to the 25 minute episodes of normal shows) makes for an absolute blast when watching Aho Girl. Any given episode usually has 2-4 stories in it, meaning even if one segment might not be in your taste, you're sure to get something wildly different within minutes.More than anything, Aho Girl is FUN. The jokes are often on point, the shenanigans of Yoshiko, the depraved nature of Fuuki Inchou, the long-suffering nature of Akutsu, the sweet nature of Sayaka who inexplicably agrees to most of the shenanigans, and the constant failures of Ruri, Akutsu's Aho sister, all plays into the manic nature of Aho Girl. This is a comedy show that's perfect to watch while eating, on the subway, or when you're bored. It is probably the most unexpectedly good show of the season it was released in and an absolute blast to watch.The lack of any cohesive narrative and some segments less interesting nature notches the show down a bit, but I would gladly recommend this show to anyone looking for a laugh.Aho Girl gets a well deserved 8/10 time he's punching Yoshiko (in a gender equality kind of way which would make Kazuma of Konosuba proud).

But BOY was I surprised.Aho Girl is probably the only anime I\'ve seen of it\'s kind, where the girl gets beat up by the support character instead of a dude.Not just lightly bonked like in a cute way either, she gets FUCKING SUPLEX SLAMMED INTO THE FLOOR.Aho Girl represents the standard for physical comedy in anime for me. It\'s very easy to pick a male comedic relief character and have the straightman girl bash him up for...no reason to garner cheap laughs. The way this anime differentiates itself, is by making it so that almost every smacking she receives is justified and appropriate.One of the things that stood out to me was the character design. Yoshiko, or the Aho Girl\'s design is made in such a way that it\'s quite difficult to look at her sexually or treat her as this innocent fragile flower that most female characters in anime are usually treated like.Not only does it make it easy to swallow the fact that she gets absolutely shitmixed by Akuru almost daily,this also makes it easier to see her as this absolute idiot that somehow transcends her medium and annoys the viewer as well, which is amazingly remarkable.The VA for Aho Girl, Aoi Yuuki did an AMAZING job in giving her a voice that\'s just the right amount of annoying to get the point across, while still keeping it bearable to watch. Her voice, while being annoying, is very suited to Yoshiko\'s personality, which makes it easier to digest her stupidity.Unfortunately, because of the near perfect character of Aho Girl, all other characters, with the exception of Akuru, were not explored enough. This is especially true in the case of Sayaka, who got so little screentime, that Yoshiko\'s dog was more prominent in the anime than her. While it doesn\'t really affect the anime as much, that was just my personal wish.The intro gag is pretty funny, not gonna lie. It makes it worth it to stick around to see it on every episode. It\'s little things like that that elevate this anime to such an enjoyable experience overall.Since this is a gag anime, things like story and character development are barely needed. This anime definitely doesn\'t have any of them, but it does the one thing a gag anime is supposed to do VERY well.That is, this anime is FUCKING HILARIOUS. Not only because of Aho Girl\'s antics, but the supporting cast is also very funny in their own right. Somehow, everytime Aho Girl get smacked into orbit, it makes me burst into laughter. It took me a while to get used to it.Other than physical comedy, the thought process jokes and other jokes landed very well for me. Every episode managed to get me, despite the fact that I could feel my brain slowly being rubbed smooth.Overall, this anime is regarded pretty well by the community, and it\'s easy to see why. This anime knows exactly what it wants to be, which is a gag anime that\'s actually funny. It absolutely nails it.I definitely recommend this anime. Sure, your brain might feel numb after watching it, but it\'s definitely worth it. no reason to garner cheap laughs.

Her voice, while being annoying, is very suited to Yoshiko\'s personality, which makes it easier to digest her stupidity.Unfortunately, because of the near perfect character of Aho Girl, all other characters, with the exception of Akuru, were not explored enough. This is especially true in the case of Sayaka, who got so little screentime, that Yoshiko\'s dog was more prominent in the anime than her. While it doesn\'t really affect the anime as much, that was just my personal wish.The intro gag is pretty funny, not gonna lie. It makes it worth it to stick around to see it on every episode. It\'s little things like that that elevate this anime to such an enjoyable experience overall.Since this is a gag anime, things like story and character development are barely needed. This anime definitely doesn\'t have any of them, but it does the one thing a gag anime is supposed to do VERY well.That is, this anime is FUCKING HILARIOUS. Not only because of Aho Girl\'s antics, but the supporting cast is also very funny in their own right. Somehow, everytime Aho Girl get smacked into orbit, it makes me burst into laughter. It took me a while to get used to it.Other than physical comedy, the thought process jokes and other jokes landed very well for me. Every episode managed to get me, despite the fact that I could feel my brain slowly being rubbed smooth.Overall, this anime is regarded pretty well by the community, and it\'s easy to see why. This anime knows exactly what it wants to be, which is a gag anime that\'s actually funny. It absolutely nails it.I definitely recommend this anime. Sure, your brain might feel numb after watching it, but it\'s definitely worth it.', ""A Cast with a simple airheaded whiny control freak who's very obsessed with bananasand a loner caretaker childhood friend having a bad luck every dayThe possible relationship between the two are straight up Tsukkomi Boke routine, Mostly the teasing really reminds me Kashima and Hori from the way he treated very skeptically neither how possible dumb she can be.Detailed show with the same art as Mangaka-san to assistant-san, the gag can be specify less humor and sitcom from the most set of shows out there.First 5 minutes of scenario can simplify cracked you up very badly or if isn't really your cup of tea...then at least you're quite satisfied from how it ends. then at least you're quite satisfied from how it ends."", 'Many shows have adapted the funny and the idiotic main character,if written well can be really funny but that’s not the case with Aho girl .At first glance it seems like an average ok show but when you start to look at it fully it’s very mediocre .

despite the logical fallacy, there\'re always gonna be a couple...less than stellar members of the bunch.Story: With a title that literally translates to \'Idiot Girl\', Aho Girl follows the comedic school romp of an idiotic girl named Yoshiko and her childhood \'friend\' Akuru filled with fast comedic misunderstandings, leaps in logic, and some vaguely illegal things, ultimately creating a show that when you put it into perspective...makes absolutely no sense.In...a word, Aho Girl is pure nonsense.\xa0 Based on a 4-koma manga of the same name, the entire runtime of Aho Girl spans roughly six full length episodes (or twelve, twelve minute long episodes) purely about pure insanity about a high school girl with a head so empty you\'ll wonder how she ever got to high school, and if she even has a functioning brain stem.The show primarily uses a double act style of comedy, where someone (usually Yoshiko) begins a chain of misunderstandings and high energy moments only to be counteracted by the few members of the cast who act as the straight man for a resolution to the whole thing and bring the energy back down to earth after it\'s spiraled out of control to astronomical proportions.\xa0 You\'d think the show would be tiring after using this routine in basically every scene, but each episode manages to bring out different situations with different members of the side cast to really create a...unique viewing experience.I think the best part about Aho Girl is the fact that the jokes don\'t overstay their welcome.\xa0 We get the setup, the buildup, a little more buildup, the payoff, end.\xa0 It\'s quick, it\'s snappy, and it makes just enough impact for the viewer to know what\'s going on and potentially want to continue watching just to see what kind of shit

welcome+/- Comedy is subjectiveCharacters: Hanabatake Yoshiko, the Aho Girl herself, is no doubt the show\'s biggest selling point as not only is she the titular character, but her character is so devoid of intelligent or rational thoughts that it\'s a wonder how a character like this hasn\'t really been advertised like her.\xa0 A simple creature with an extreme fondness for bananas, Yoshiko spends the entire series dragging in practically every member of the cast into her brainless schemes, usually dramatizing everything up to the payoff for the sake of comedy.\xa0 As expected her

even half of a working brain.Then there\'s Aktsu Akuru, the show\'s primary straight man and childhood friend to Yoshiko.\xa0 As a man who primarily focuses his time on studying, Akuru is a character who is completely out of fucks to give, easily giving into his temperament when it comes to what Yoshiko does in order to try and involve him with things.\xa0 So I guess he\'s kinda stupid for falling for that so many times...\xa0 Which actually brings up a very good point.While the show does follow the style of a double act, everyone in this show has a few screws loose, and the straight men as a

Spoilers ahead!)The banana is sometimes considered one of nature’s most amazing creations.Commonly produced. Comes in bunches. Easy to hold. Sweet taste. Biodegradable packaging. Penchant for comedy. Not since the apple has there been such a fruit, such a food that has given humans so much with so little.While people love bananas, nobody loves them as much as Yoshiko of Aho Girl. And, while she may have less brains than one of these yellow-wrapped fruits, she upstages their comedic value with her own brazen stupidity.STORYAt roughly thirteen minutes per episode, Aho Girl has only so much time...to get its audience laughing. The show knows this dilemma, and so it delivers unto them a near constant stream of comedy that does not stop for nearly its entire run.Much of this comedy revolves around Yoshiko, the titular character of this project and quite possibly the dumbest person to ever exist. Ever. That’s not a slight against her. Everyone in the show agrees with this statement, and Yoshiko herself couldn’t care less what others think about her let alone what they do for and around her.Which leads directly into what Aho Girl showcases.It loves its loudness. Yoshiko and the others did not learn about the concept of inside voices, so their exchanges quite quickly devolve into shouting matches. Admittedly, some people may be put off by the obnoxious yelling throughout the season, especially from the banana-pining girl who elevates her voice when even remotely excited. But such high energy supercharges the mundane events depicted, giving them a comedic push down the right path.Slapstick never goes away. Yoshiko’s vacant noggin equates to weakened pain receptors, so she often succumbs to many a bruising and a beating both of her own accord and at the hands of Akutsu. Of course, everyone involved punches, kicks, and tackles without remorse. From the three gyaru girls simultaneously punching the lovable idiot to Yoshie duking it out with Iinchou, the physical comedy complements the loudness with ease.The idiocy does not falter. The events seem normal at first, but Yoshiko’s arrival, words, or mere existence twist the dial of intelligence down to zero. She plays hide-and-seek for days on end. Akutsu and Dog bond over a particular movie scene. Yoshie must confirm Sayaka’s purity while revealing too much information about her own person. In other words, the show is stupid not in a negative sense but in a purposefully ridiculous one, further improving the overall hilarity.Aho Girl also makes small decisions here and there that help guide the show along. Its scenes split up into distinct parts with a small amount of crossover and callbacks to make the stream of comedy that much more digestible. Moreover, the show also varies up its content as much as it can, like when Yoshiko disguises as the male Yoshio to cheer up their teacher or that time where the group go on summer vacation filled with a couple of ecchi escapades.To be fair, nothing within the anime is exactly novel. But that doesn’t stop its loudness, its slapstick, and its idiocy from giving this comedy anime its clout.ART & ANIMATIONAho Girl continues its strong execution with an appreciable set of visuals.For instance, due to the time constraint, the show makes use of its opening track’s frames to deliver even more comedy. They almost always change the setup: Iinchou looking longingly at Akutsu, Sayaka acting as an angel in a play, a flurry of Yoshiko faces that fill the entire screen. Small stuff really, but these constant changes give the audience something to look forward to at the start of every episode rather than the same tired montage.Otherwise, the anime includes elements that continue down its comedic path. Lots of speed lines accentuate the characters’ yelling and crazy actions. Missing pupils give them their “dead” looks after a kerfuffle of any kind. A cheerful banana censors out any particularly ecchi displays. And the various imaginative sequences, like a giant Banana Froppeccino Deluxe floating in the sky, a flurry of hearts as Yoshiko jumps in for a kiss, or a manga-like style as she races a motorbike rider while riding Dog herself, change up the often-lacking background artistry.The actual animation in general remains involved throughout the season, too, lending further credit to its strong execution. This direction is thanks mostly to the constant brawls, reactions, and situations the group normally find themselves in and make for each other.Unfortunately, Aho Girl does not perform as well when it comes to the designs of its characters. While the cast members often just wear their unassuming garb for school, their somewhat same-face looks – especially when yelling all big mouthed and wide eyed – reduce variety in their potential depictions the most. It also does not help that their colors and looks in general do not go for anything too striking.Even so, those fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and noticeable movements keep the anime going strong despite the designs not quite stacking up.CHARACTERSAs purely a comedy anime, the characters of Aho Girl focus first and foremost on, well, comedy. They toss aside complexity and say to themselves, “Let’s get the audience smiling with our strangeness.”Many of those smiles come from Yoshiko herself. It cannot be overstated how dumb she is. She has next to zero attention span, has little care for consequences, and has no desire to do anything except what she deems as in-the-moment fun.Thus, she does not pick up on even the most normal of societal cues, leading to her raucous behavior no matter where she is or what she is doing. It may mean running all the way to a farmer’s farm X kilometers away just to tell him that she likes his produce, or it could be the case that she pukes from eating one banana too many after declaring that she cannot eat another. Either way, Yoshiko refuses to follow the norm, and, for this reason, she improves the comedy present without fail.When she isn’t playing dolls a little too realistically with the local kids at the park, she often spouts backwards logic that somehow, someway makes sense in her signature lunacy. Most importantly, Yoshiko desensitizes the audience to and accentuates the strange traits of the other cast members. Akutsu’s standoffish personality. Iinchou’s stalking tendencies. Yoshie’s psychotic mindset (like mother, like daughter). If nothing else, Dog is literally smarter than her, giving his scenes an actual basis besides just being more aware than usual as a pet animal.In turn, Yoshiko’s relationships create even more comedic opportunities. Ruri is sadly an idiot like Yoshiko on certain levels, so Yoshiko tries to bond with her fellow moron whenever she can. Ryuuichi looks up to her as his boss, going from a delinquent to a dude who just wants to hang out with some friends. And Sayaka, the most regular person of the whole group, offsets Yoshiko’s overbearing asides, but even she breaks down on occasion around her friend, the contrast inviting another round of funnies.Yes, the characters are simple. But that fits Aho Girl perfectly. And, at the end of the day, they follow through on what they had in mind. Which means that it’s tough to ask for much more out of them.MUSIC & SOUNDThe anime packs in as much fun into its audio design as it can.For starters, Aho Girl wouldn’t be Aho Girl without its, well, “aho” girl. To this end, Aoi Yuuki as Yoshiko deserves a ton of props for her lead role as the twin-tailed weirdo. If she isn’t passed out on the floor after taking a punch to the face, she’s yelling as much as possible, creating an annoying yet hilarious voice for the star that doesn’t let up for the show’s whole (and short) run.Tomokazu Sugita as Akutsu also dishes out hilarity with his scathing hatred for his less-than-ideal neighbor, but the opening track “Zenryoku☆Summer!” brings even more smiles into this sound space. During its one-minute timeframe, it goes all over the place while still following a clear path. Quick lyrical deliveries, differing vocal tones, bongos, the distinct noise of a metal bat hitting a baseball. Combined with the occasional chimes and goofier background sound-effects, the OP forms as a silly, catchy tune that sets the comedic tone for the series without any effort.The remainder of the music, however, doesn’t reach those same hits-a-funny-bone heights. The ending track “Odore! Kyu-kyoku Tetsugaku” is pretty much an afterthought, playing underneath the outro scenes of Aho Girl as a mediocre poppy song. And the original soundtrack – even with its different meandering, guitar, and classical pieces – doesn’t exactly push forward with a ton of intrigue. It at least doesn’t take anything away from the show, though.So, with hilarious VA performances and a just-as-funny OP to back them up, the music and sound for Aho Girl partly accomplishes arguably its most important goal: bringing a sizeable chunk of fun.ENJOYMENTIt’s been a while since I laughed so consistently while watching one specific anime.In fact, I burst out laughing so much so that it would be unfair of me to list any scenes since they all got me smiling or chuckling. Of course, as a show defined by how funny its characters manage to be, they were the cornerstone to my laughter.Thinking back on the show, I liked all of them. Yoshiko somehow one-upping herself in stupidity constantly. Her mom Yoshie doing everything in her power to only allow Akutsu to hook up with her daughter to secure her future retirement. Dog being a good puppy. Akutsu’s little sister Ruri cutely struggling with life. Iinchou’s flashbacks and flashforwards. Sayaka crying as she barely keeps up with their collective antics. Their teacher Atsuko in the classic Christmas Cake role. The gyaru girls introducing a new angle. Ryuuichi just trying to be buddies with Akutsu. Sure, some are better than others, but they each still got me to laugh a lot all the same.Overall, I found that the anime was the right length for its content. It had some “romance” too which, while leading nowhere tangible, got a thumbs-up from me. And it also hardly ever strayed away from its comedy roots, remaining straightforward and sure of itself. Truth be told, this anime isn’t exactly clever let alone unique – but I wouldn’t want it to be any other way.Aho Girl no doubt embraces the first half of its title. It’s short. It’s quick. It’s funny. A three-way combo that ensures an entertaining time. While not the banana of this medium, it peels ahead regardless.SUMMARYStory: Good, loudness, slapstick, and of course idiocy keep the laughs of this multipart comedy streaming without ever showing any signs of stoppingArt & Animation: Good, fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and nice actual animation give the visuals strength even if the character designs do notCharacters: Good, Yoshiko is an unintentionally funny girl thanks to her “aho” nature, highlighting the strangeness of the other cast members and holding distinct relationships with all of themMusic & Sound: Fine, boisterous VA performances and a silly-sounding OP rise above a mediocre ED and a passable OSTEnjoyment: Great, have not laughed so much and so consistently in a long whileFinal Score: 7/10 to get its audience laughing.

To this end, Aoi Yuuki as Yoshiko deserves a ton of props for her lead role as the twin-tailed weirdo. If she isn’t passed out on the floor after taking a punch to the face, she’s yelling as much as possible, creating an annoying yet hilarious voice for the star that doesn’t let up for the show’s whole (and short) run.Tomokazu Sugita as Akutsu also dishes out hilarity with his scathing hatred for his less-than-ideal neighbor, but the opening track “Zenryoku☆Summer!” brings even more smiles into this sound space. During its one-minute timeframe, it goes all over the place while still following a clear path. Quick lyrical deliveries, differing vocal tones, bongos, the distinct noise of a metal bat hitting a baseball. Combined with the occasional chimes and goofier background sound-effects, the OP forms as a silly, catchy tune that sets the comedic tone for the series without any effort.The remainder of the music, however, doesn’t reach those same hits-a-funny-bone heights. The ending track “Odore! Kyu-kyoku Tetsugaku” is pretty much an afterthought, playing underneath the outro scenes of Aho Girl as a mediocre poppy song. And the original soundtrack – even with its different meandering, guitar, and classical pieces – doesn’t exactly push forward with a ton of intrigue. It at least doesn’t take anything away from the show, though.So, with hilarious VA performances and a just-as-funny OP to back them up, the music and sound for Aho Girl partly accomplishes arguably its most important goal: bringing a sizeable chunk of fun.ENJOYMENTIt’s been a while since I laughed so consistently while watching one specific anime.In fact, I burst out laughing so much so that it would be unfair of me to list any scenes since they all got me smiling or chuckling. Of course, as a show defined by how funny its characters manage to be, they were the cornerstone to my laughter.Thinking back on the show, I liked all of them. Yoshiko somehow one-upping herself in stupidity constantly. Her mom Yoshie doing everything in her power to only allow Akutsu to hook up with her daughter to secure her future retirement. Dog being a good puppy. Akutsu’s little sister Ruri cutely struggling with life. Iinchou’s flashbacks and flashforwards. Sayaka crying as she barely keeps up with their collective antics. Their teacher Atsuko in the classic Christmas Cake role. The gyaru girls introducing a new angle. Ryuuichi just trying to be buddies with Akutsu. Sure, some are better than others, but they each still got me to laugh a lot all the same.Overall, I found that the anime was the right length for its content. It had some “romance” too which, while leading nowhere tangible, got a thumbs-up from me. And it also hardly ever strayed away from its comedy roots, remaining straightforward and sure of itself. Truth be told, this anime isn’t exactly clever let alone unique – but I wouldn’t want it to be any other way.Aho Girl no doubt embraces the first half of its title. It’s short. It’s quick. It’s funny. A three-way combo that ensures an entertaining time. While not the banana of this medium, it peels ahead regardless.SUMMARYStory: Good, loudness, slapstick, and of course idiocy keep the laughs of this multipart comedy streaming without ever showing any signs of stoppingArt & Animation: Good, fun OP frames, extra comedic elements, and nice actual animation give the visuals strength even if the character designs do notCharacters: Good, Yoshiko is an unintentionally funny girl thanks to her “aho” nature, highlighting the strangeness of the other cast members and holding distinct relationships with all of themMusic & Sound: Fine, boisterous VA performances and a silly-sounding OP rise above a mediocre ED and a passable OSTEnjoyment: Great, have not laughed so much and so consistently in a long whileFinal Score: 7/10', ""Warning possible SpoilersI decided to begin my summer anime crusade on something that I thought wasn't going to be that good, but surprisingly enough for an anime that is only 12 minutes per episode was actually entertaining.Story (6/10)The story is about Yoshiko Hanabatake a girl so stupid she gets zero's on every test and has a fascination with Banana's, the only person who can keep her stupidity in check is her friend Akuru Akutsu.Now the story is the weakest aspect of the show mainly because there isn't really a story at all though considering it was developed from a 4-Koma Manga it's going to be...difficult to make a full show from this and because of this there isn't really an end goal for the show instead it mainly has Yoshiko getting either herself, Akuru or even her friends into stupid or bad situations and everyone suffers for it in the end although it is very funny how they get into these messes.The final episode is what you think either as the final episode decides to be an origin story of how Yoshiko and Akuru met which was actually pretty good, but other than that there isn't much to say about the story hence why the score isn't that high.Characters (8/10)Now the characters were definitely a ball of fun especially Yoshiko who out of all the characters surprised me the most.Yoshiko is the female MC and is probably the most stupid character I have ever encountered, but much like Kintarou from Golden Boy this is a good stupid which is a stupid that will make you feel weird, but you will be laughing at the same time although it did surprise me how Yoshiko was very smart in one aspect and that was the art of love because somehow she made a teacher feel better about herself which is probably the only good thing she did in the show which also reminds that she is surprisingly contagious like her methods may be stupid, but they make people happy and overtime she actually starts making more and more friends from her actions which either felt like dumb luck or everyone is stupid too.Akuru the male MC is a rare site for me which is the male Tsundere and boy does he take the Tsundere troupe seriously yet you understand the suffering he has gone through with his relationship with Yoshiko since he has to deal with her stupidity 24/7  and this guy feels no remorse for her as he is happy to whack her in the face whenever she steps out of line, but he isn't always an angry looking guy because whenever he interacts with his sister or with Dog (yes that's the name of the dog) he actually seems like a kind guy yet somehow since his sister is suffering from whatever Yoshiko is he always ends up hurting her feelings.Sayaka is Yoshiko's best friend and is pretty much the most normal character of the show since she is the cute and innocent type however that doesn't stop her from blowing a gasket whenever Yoshiko or any of the other characters go a little too far like when Yoshiko and Iinchou snuck into Akuru's room.Iinchou is another female character who is the Disciplinary Committee President so she hates the stuff Yoshiko does, but she ends up having a crush on Akuru when he helps her out during one of Yoshiko's moments however her view of love is of the stalker type though not to the point of being a Yandere and whenever she tries to get close to him he just sees her moves as weird which always put's her down.Art (7/10)Now the artstyle wasn't amazing it felt very samey compared to other anime's that I have seen or just not impressive, but for some reason the fact that Yoshiko always had this ridiculous smile on her face reminded me of the smile Saitama would make in OPM in fact everyone's facial expressions were actually really funny which is pretty much the reason why the art gets a 7.Sound (8/10)I know this is going to sound stupid, but that intro was actually very catchy because at first it seemed weird or stupid however the more I listened to it the more enjoyable it got which actually surprised me because the intro's from the spring period were actually very lackluster apart from a few and it's funny how the first intro I watch of the summer period is actually alright and I also liked how the intro had something different going on in the background.Extras:The comedy is the icing on the cake for this show because despite how stupid it was the comedy felt fresh in some way even when they were using cliched looking moments or scenes they didn't feel like rehashes of stuff we've seen countless times in other anime's so I applaud this short series for managing to make something funny feel fresh for once.The romance part of the show is probably the most confusing one because you don't really know who to support because Yoshiko is stupid as hell, Akuru is a very violent and short-tempered person and Iinchou is a stalker leaving Sayaka as the only character who seems appealing yet she never gets any action which is funny yet sad at the same time so yeah a show like this having Romance just didn't feel right although it is strange how Yoshiko is actually a master at knowing the feeling of love.Enjoyment (8/10)Overall despite the length of the show it was a surprisingly entertaining show and a pretty good start to the summer 2017 anime's so if anyone's looking for something short that can give you a good laugh then try this one. difficult to make a full

Robert A. HeinleinTake that quote, put it in anime form, and crank the ""stupidity"" up to 100. Then multiply that with the most fun you\'ve had in a long time. That\'s how Aho-Girl was created (literally, the title is exactly what it is).Many have written this anime off because of the countless number of memes and clips you\'ve seen of it on the internet make it seem like a joke. None of them have given it a fair chance. They don\'t know what they\'re missing out on.Story: 7Once upon a time,...humanity was cursed by the gods and suffered a terrible fate. That fate was Hanabatake Yoshiko. She and her intricate tactics to overthrow humanity were bound to reign down on the mere mortals below in due time. Thus, it was up to Akutsu Akuru, humanity\'s knight in shining armor, to put a stop to this.You see, that was the dramatic version. In reality, this show is simply about a girl\'s stupidity and what kind of situations it puts herself and others in. While there is no overarching plot of speak of (except one man\'s struggle to stop her terror), each episode contains a few small, generally self-contained stories, that provide a stage for all the wacky antics we see our characters get themselves into.Art: 8At first glance, the artwork and animation are quite basic. However, as the series progresses and the situations become more wild, the art becomes more distinct and expressive. If a character is mad, they look furious. If a character is shocked, they look distraught. The animation conveys every action and emotion with such fluidity and precision.In addition, there a few segments where the animators either change the style of the show completely, or change the kind of animation itself. At one point, a segment turns into a manga-like high-speed chase scene on a highway. Another time, it transforms into a shounen-like battle scene. In general, you\'re always in for a treat, even if there are a few noticeable mistakes and mishaps sprinkled throughout.Also, the opening for every episode changes. For a show that you\'d think would have a low-budget, this is quite unique and deserves praise.Sound: 8Every time music plays, it fits the scene it accompanies well. In addition, the opening and ending themes are nice to listen. As for the opening in particular, it displays the show\'s playful and upbeat nature perfectly.Character: 8I\'ll go ahead and say this now, there is very minimal character development to be found. Yet, the show dances around this roadblock with grace. Each character has great chemistry with every other character they interact with. The characters are what sold this anime to me. Every funny moment is because of the characters. While the characters could technically be defined as one-note, each individual personality is so strong that you won\'t care in the end.Enjoyment: 10I\'d be lying if this wasn\'t one of the funniest anime I\'ve seen. The anime is bold in nature and constantly strives to defy one\'s expectations of what comes next. Every trope that it could possibly be subjected to, is turned on it\'s head. Every episode was like a roller coaster, except the ride only ever went down when it was finished.Overall: 8This anime is not meant to be judged critically. By those standards, the show is quite poor. However, if you are willing to turn off your brain for 12 minutes at a time, you will love this anime for what it is.

No.Does it create a lasting imprint on its audience, or contain any theme that teaches something of value? Also no. There's no real story to speak of, the music is decent but nowhere near amazing, and the characters fall into various general tropes that you've probably seen a thousand times.All of this, yet I think this anime deserves an 8? Yup.Aho Girl is the very definition of lowbrow humour; the greasy potato wedges, the barbecue pulled pork of anime. There is nothing refined present, but it throws...countless gags toward you that are so absurd, idiotic, and unrealistic that you can't help but laugh at the intrusive slapstick it provides. This makes it a forgettable yet oddly entertaining comedy in its own right.If irrational slapstick humour that edges upon being barbaric is your type of thing, grab a bit of your favourite comfort food before you dive in; you're bound to have a comically good time. countless gags toward you that are so absurd, idiotic, and unrealistic that you can't help but laugh at the intrusive slapstick it provides.

Stay away from this."", ""Just a reminder that i had no intentions in watching Aho girl in the first place as just reading the title alone already made me thinks that its one of those shows that are not worth my time at all. The reason i made a decision to watch it is because a friend of mine always telling me to give it a try because apparently  its one of the funniest commedy anime to date. Well guess what? i was absolutely disappointed from the begining until the end and right now im going to write a review according to what i think about Aho Girl...aka Stupid GirlStorywhat story? since this is a comedy anime there is no story at all. if i actually want to give a brief explanation on what you are going to expect, its about an absurd and remarkably stupid girl (hence the title of the show) named Yoshiko who has an IQ less than the emoji movie's rotten tomatoes ratings that apparently suffers mental disorders. The reason why i mentioned this is because she is really that stupid always makes dumb decisions which could left the viewers disgusted. the entire show revolves around her insane daily lives with her friends who also had absurd personalities which i will cover later in the characters section. and thats about it. each episode is relatively short which lasts for about 10 minutes in total and is divided into specific sketch sections and they are all the same.ArtThere is nothing much to be said here since the artstyle is just plain to look at. i do kinda like the character's designs though especially the girls. They looked really great most of the times. Overall, its your standard animated artstyle that you had already seen several times in dozens of anime.SoundIm going to start with the openings and endings. As for the former, well you could say that its the only good thing from the show. I do appreciate the animators who creating a distinctive version for each of the episodes meaning that the sequence animations of the OP will change from 1 episode to the next but the song still remains the same. The ending song on the other hand  basicially just merges with the ending sequences in every episode. Voice acting is pretty standard for the most part.CharacterThis is like one of a few comedy anime that i found the characters loathful and had no substance at all. Especially the queen of idiots, Yoshiko aka the monkey who cant think wisely than a 6 year old child because basically she is a teenager with mind of a child heck even some children are far more intelligent than her. She is the childhood friend of Akutsu ( A-kun for short) also one of the main character who dont have any friends because the grim expression that he always potray which makes others to stay away from him and seemed to keeps continuing abusing yoshiko whenever she did something idiotic. Now many people would think that its unjustified for him to always hit her whenever he can but if you think about it,no matter what you say to her, it will always comes out from her ears so hitting her might be the only way to shut her up. HOWEVER, he does not need to act rude to his other friends for no reason especially Sumino, the only normal person out of the cast. While she is a kind girl and always wanted to sort problems out i found her quite unnecessary to the show as everything that she did always ended up with a failure. The other side characters are just there without contributing anything to the show at all. The only characters that i like are A- kun's little sister and the dog.EnjoymentI do admit that i chuckled a bit in the first early episodes but thats about it. There is almost nothing in this show that is universally funny. when i said universal im talking about slapstick comedy which majority of the people will find it hilarious but the usage of it in this show is absolutely very low effort to the point it becomes irritating and extremely repetitive. Yeah we get it that the monkey likes to eat bananas. yeah we get it that the monkey loves to show her panties to A-kun like heck.OverallSo far this is by far one of the worse comedy anime ive ever watched and that is saying something as i found the anime Cells at Work even funnier than this unpolished turd.

I'll rate it a 5/10"", 'This is one of the only anime I\'ve written a review about that had a dumb story and an annoying main character that I rated 10/10. Needless to say, it\'s funny as hell.The story for Aho Girl is... well pretty much nothing. It\'s just a slice of life about an ""aho girl"". There is a narrative, sort of, but it\'s more of a way of organizing the madness that ensues in the 12 minute episodes.The art is amazing. It provides hilarious visual comedy and mocks/parodies other anime, especially JoJo. Not to mention, on the accidental and rare occurrence of me seeing part of the intro,...I actually had a good time. The intros are funny too!The ""aho girl"" is annoying. This is to be expected though, so I don\'t think it\'s all bad.I like the characters. They\'re all well thought out. The hyperbolic, explosive behaviors of the main duo work wondrously together. The side characters are funny too. The \'booby president\' becomes a good source of comedy while best-girl Sayaka is the most sane person in the entire series. She\'s also soft spoken, so believe me, she doesn\'t do much to stop the main duo.I had a great time watching this anime. Unlike some other comedy anime, this one knows its place. Something as wacky as this is SUPPOSED to be shorter than 24 minutes. If you drag an anime like this on for the length of a plot-driven anime, it will quickly become as boring as a box of flaccid dicks.Episodes 10 and 12 are really great watches even if you don\'t plan to tune in to the rest of the series.10/10 I actually had a good time.

It does not have anything special : there is no such thing as a story, the art and sound are okay. Characters, while not very surprising nor interesting, work pretty well with each other. And that's all.However you just keep laughing. The fun of Aho Girl is looking at a bunch of idiots actually being punished for their stupidity, but never understanding that they are stupid.If you like a bit of sadistic, dark or perverted humor, you've got something you'll enjoy. "", 'This anime is what i expected from the title.This mf mc pulls out so many combos on the girls that it is hilarious. He is like trying every move he saw in the UFC. He is absolute giga chad. No doubt about it. The girl is basically stupid af which is kinda nice tbh. Sayaka best girl, I would like to sniff her thighs so much. This is absolutely must watch if you wanna spend your free time laughing from ear to ear, believe, have you ever seen A GIGA CHAD WHO TRIES TO SUFFOCATE THE MOTHER OF A MAIN GIRL OF THE SHOW IN...THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET?

Cu'z it did deliver the laughs, not bad for an anime that only runs half the time of that of regular anime, let's git er don as Larry the Cable Guy would say:Story, Poor 3.Ok, so it was funny, it was entertaining, when we see Yoshiko Hanabatake, get punched, kicked, lambasted and all kinds of violence against women that one can imagine by her childhood sweetheart , Akun, frankly the concept is a feminist's worse nightmare and when they watched this, there is no doubt...that they would be coming to Japan , to hunt down this original creator, Hiroyuki to give him the same kind of violence that women experiences on a daily basis and I kinda agree, since it was kinda shallow to use it as it's shallow plot and quite frankly, them feminist would kinda brand the creator as a chauvinist, since the main character, Yoshiko was presented as a lowly animal who has all kinds of appalling traits, where it's ok for her take all the abuse that she get's form Akin and the worse part was, she likes it. Not a very good thing for an anime/manga to rely on.Art, Poor 3.Ok, so the school uniform for girls is hot, there is the quintessential Zettai Ryoki on Sayaka Sumino, panty hose on Fuki Incho and her boobs, there is the bikini fanservice, where Yoshiko wore it good, but WTF, why is the shinpantsu only limited to Yoshiko  and no shinpantsu on Sayaka, Fuuka Incho and those 3 gayru bitches, also those 3 gayru bitches don't look like a bunch of gyarus, in fact why the fuck were they even call that when they don't dress the part? Main reason for the score.Sound, Poor 3.Ok so the seiyus who did Yosiko and Sayaka's voice were ok, but it kinda makes them sound like a retard, also the seiyu's who did Akun's voice sounded too manly, Fuuka on the other hand was just too mature , however seiyu Hikasa Yoko's voiced did played well for being Yoshiko's mom, since she does have that mature voice.Character, Very Good 8.Ok so Yoshiko often get's the full blunt of Akun's ire, but ya know what, she maybe a victim of his violence, but the again she can make him cry uncle if she wants to, that's is if she wants to, since she just too stupid to even realized it and just too manly in love that she just become's sooo masochistic, but ya know you gotta hand it to her, what she lack s in the IQ department, she makes it up with guts, high tolerance for pain, unwavering confidence, spunk, thinking way tooo ridiculous outside of the box, and being friendly even thought she gets a lotta flak from those 3 gyaru bitches. Akun or Akutsu Akuru, is every feminist's nightmare, he is a typical guy who is presented as an achiever but an epitome of a spouse abuser, however he just wanna be left alone, since we did see on the last episode that he never actually likes her and prefer to be a herbivore, which is a ridicules  Jap term for a guy who prefers to be single for life, but much to his chargin , Yosihiko basically is giving him a life outside of the monotony that he prefers, too bad as the quintessential oblivious guy she doesn't realize that. as for Sayaka Sumino, too bad she has to be this wife material for Akun who probably will never happen, cu'z Akun is just too serious about being an achiever and there is Yoshiko's mom who is around to keep anybody else from being Akun's wife. Also, about the stalker girl Fuuka Iincho, it was kinda funny that she has to deal with Yoshiko's mom, but that as good as her role gets.Enjoyment, Good 7.Well, it is what the title said it would be, it was  funny to say the laest, especially when Yoshiko was able to get around certain thing were she can make anybody (except for Akun) turn tables on them, so....Overall, Good 7.It's all GOOD!!!!!!

I know that\'s the whole point, but that\'s not to say stupidity can\'t be enjoyable or funny. It can be, but there\'s a fine line between dumb fun and just plain dumb. Aho Girl is definitely the latter. This anime is the sitcom of comedy anime. I almost feel like there should be a laugh track played after everytime Yoshiko gets punched, flashes her panties, wants a banana, etc. The comedy in this show is really obsessed with telling the audience ""this is the funny part, laugh please.""Even the ""level-headed"" character (Akutsu) is pretty stupid/annoying in his own right....Somehow I feel like he\'s more retarded than the main girl. He really doesn\'t offer much besides beating the ever living shit out of Yoshiko and then apologizing occasionally so we can pretend that there\'s actually some progression. This anime is pretty unfunny and mind numbing. You\'ll probably enjoy it if you\'re into minion-tier slap stick humor and need more seasonal anime crammed down your throat but this isn\'t for me.

For me, it\'s everything I could ever want in a comedy that\'s only 10 minutes per episode, it reminds me of a trashier Konosuba in that regard, but for others...it\'s cheap and attention seeking.Which is completely fine, it\'s comedy, no two people are going to laugh at the same exact joke or situation.This is probably the greatest example in recent memory of a ""If the shoe fits..."" kind of show, where if you watch the first episode and think it\'s funny, the rest is going to be funny as well, and the same is true of the reverse. it\'s cheap and attention seeking.Which is completely fine, it\'s comedy, no two people are going to laugh at the same exact joke or situation.This is probably the greatest example in recent memory of a ""If the shoe fits..."" kind of show, where if you watch the first episode and think it\'s funny, the rest is going to be funny as well, and the same is true of the reverse.', ""I wish Aho Girl had more and longer episodes.

I pity poor A-kun for everything that came across his life because of that stupid girl, but she's so funny I can't be mad at her!There is a genuine, silly and spontaneous humor, and it's worth watching more than one time!Highly recommended by me, while having watched...300 anime, most of which are comedy.Enjoy fellow otakus! 300 anime, most of which are comedy.Enjoy fellow otakus!"", 'Aho Girl: short review.Positives:Had funny moments - Some scenes did make me laugh, but humour is a subjective thing.Short episodes - about 10 mins excluding opening, so makes it easier to watch or to fit into people\'s busy lives if they want to watch the show. Or to make your MAL bigger without as much commitment as a normal show, if you are one of those people.Makes some good gifs - You can basically watch all the best parts of the show in different gifs that you\'ll see around the internet, if you don\'t have time to watch the show....NegativesMain female character (Yoshiko) - Can be overly annoying instead of funny, and the anime will be based a lot around her so if you can\'t handle her, its best to stop as you\'ll only see her more.No story - You don\'t always get a lot of story with comedy animes but with Aho Girl there really is no story apart from Yoshiko does something stupid and here\'s the outcome of that.Not positive or negative:Other characters - Other characters are easier to handle than Yoshiko and not as annoying, but also won\'t be as memorable as her.Art style - A subjective thing but to me there is nothing wrong/outdated with. Probably a style that most people will be just fine with.Opening song - A silly song, but not one that is so bad that you\'ll have to skip it everytime.Overall Score: Proceed with Caution.Aho Girl isn\'t an anime I can just say ""I can recommend it"" or ""I can\'t recommend it"". Some people will just hate Yoshiko and that will be the end of the series for them. My advice will be give the first episode a shot and if you think that you can\'t handle Yoshiko for all 12 episodes, then drop the show and move on. Personally, there is a lot of ""just okay"" things about the show. That are just fine and that is enough for this particular show. I don\'t think this is a comedy show that would make it into a top 10 funniest or best comedy anime list for most people. There are other shows that are not just comedy based that do comedy better in my opinion. But for what its worth, I found the show to be fine and that was enough for me. NegativesMain female character (Yoshiko) - Can be overly annoying instead of funny, and the anime will be based a lot around her so if you can\'t handle her, its best to stop as you\'ll only see her more.No story - You don\'t always get a lot of story with comedy animes but with Aho Girl there really is no story apart from Yoshiko does something stupid and here\'s the outcome of that.Not positive or negative:Other characters - Other characters are easier to handle than Yoshiko and not as annoying, but also won\'t be as memorable as her.Art style - A subjective thing but to me there is nothing wrong/outdated with. Probably a style that most people will be just fine with.Opening song - A silly song, but not one that is so bad that you\'ll have to skip it everytime.Overall Score: Proceed with Caution.Aho Girl isn\'t an anime I can just say ""I can recommend it"" or ""I can\'t recommend it"". Some people will just hate Yoshiko and that will be the end of the series for them. My advice will be give the first episode a shot and if you think that you can\'t handle Yoshiko for all 12 episodes, then drop the show and move on. Personally, there is a lot of ""just okay"" things about the show. That are just fine and that is enough for this particular show.

Yoshiko is a genuine self-proclaimed idiot with a ridiculous sense of pride and confidence. The other MC, Akuru, is her childhood ""friend"", and plays quite the perfect fold to her. We are shortly introduced to a few more high-school aged characters, Yoshiko\'s mom and Akuru\'s little sister, and even though all of their personalities and chemistries mix and match perfectly to...create interesting comedic angles and combinatios, the most important character dynamic is between Yoshiko and Akuru.Akuru has had to suffer from Yoshiko\'s idiocy, invasion of privacy and sexual harassment from a very young age, which has turned him into a cold and cynical person with a short temper. Yoshiko on the other hand hasn\'t matured at all, but her sincere enthusiasm makes her very good at manipulating the people around her. Many jokes start with Yoshiko planting her idiotic plans and ideas into other people\'s heads, people following through with Yoshiko\'s ideas, and having Akuru (or one of the few other sane characters) put a stop to all the idiocy.The rest of the cast is also perfect, with a somewhat even split between absurd caricature-like characters and their more sane counterparts. Akuru\'s little sister is a perfectly absurd character. Despite putting a lot of effort into her studies, and obviously having a good home environment, she is as bad at studies as Yoshiko, despite acting a like a straight character. Her contempt for idiocy makes her despise Yoshiko, but her self-loathing makes her hate her brother as well. The ""Boob President"" is another hilarious example, but I wouldn\'t want to explain all the jokes to you.In general this series\' style of comedy is best described as absurdist. Each episode is full of explosive humour and equally explosive visuals. All of the running jokes evolve perfectly and feel fresh throughout the entire season. Despite the show\'s short running time, it introduces quite a large cast of equally funny characters, and they are always put into new and interesting situations. create interesting comedic angles and combinatios, the most important character dynamic is between Yoshiko and Akuru.Akuru has had to suffer from Yoshiko\'s idiocy, invasion of privacy and sexual harassment from a very young age, which has turned him into a cold and cynical person with a short temper.

I can\'t really put it into words, but I have to since I decided to make a review of it. I will have to do my best to describe characters without spoiling too much, but as soon as certain characters are introduced, you\'re already pretty familiar with them, so there\'s not much to spoil for an anime like this.Aho-Girl is one of the most peculiar anime I have seen in a while. It follows the blatantly bizarre adventures of Yoshiko as she attempts to make the life of her childhood friend, Akutsu, a living hell. And it seems...to take a liking to latching onto common mental illnesses or idiosyncrasies that are found in certain humans; of which, Yoshiko exploits quite frequently, often inadvertently, as she often does so well she\'s expressing her curiosities on certain matters.Yoshiko has one friend at school, Sayaka, who seems to have a strange attachment to Yoshiko where she will tolerate everything she puts her through just to see if it makes her a better person, despite how much it bemoans her. And she is willing to even shatter the mentality of the few sane people in the anime, such as Akutsu, whom she was willing to call a sadistic and rude person for not going on a trip with her to the beach, being completely oblivious to the hell Yoshiko puts him through everyday. I am uncertain how her character complements the anime, but as I go on, it\'s hard to really grasp how they use character archetypes at all.The last significant character in the anime who regularly appears in Yoshiko\'s group is Fuuki, whose obsession with Akutsu results in her completely losing her common sense and doing absurd things on the whim of Yoshiko. She is very visibly tsundere, but is also mildly insane. At one instance, Sayaka had an intervention with her and nearly shattered her mentality by telling her that everything she was doing to Akutsu was wrong. She then said ""just kidding"" and immediately reverted Fuuki back to her ludicrous nature.Besides those three girls, other characters are often swept up into the mix and their mental problems, too, are often obvious and out in the open. It\'s really an anime where, as you continue watching, you go ""who will Yoshiko mess up next"" and the result is almost always the same. She meets someone, they come off as a pretty normal person and Yoshiko, through the sheer willpower of her curiosity, manages to break them. Even her own mother has some messed up things about her, though you would expect that due to the nature of Yoshiko herself.And even poor Akutsu is not alone. Probably the most sane out of the entire cast, his problem is that he became a sadist thanks to Yoshiko not enduring any of his punishments and him believing there\'s genuinely no hope for her. His is the only one you can\'t really get mad at since he was driven to it out of the overbearing nature of Yoshiko taking advantage of his generally weak physique and literally abducting him to go play. And at one point, even physically raping him by making out with him for a quarter of a minute, well they were both still children. The worst part is that, even after stressing his body to its absolute limits to get stronger than her, he wound up getting sick and was unable to achieve his goal until he got much older, where the mental wounds had already begun to lie dormant.I still am unsure if I can even recommend this anime to anyone, but one thing is for sure, you should avoid recommending it to anyone who is still new to anime or else they may or may not be ruined by Aho-Girl since it could either make someone fall in love with the stuff or hate it. Truly, even after writing all of this, I am at a loss of words and can not properly describe what the anime\'s goal is. It\'s just Yoshiko having fun and messing people up. But, I can\'t deny you will laugh a ton well watching it. to take a liking to latching onto common mental illnesses or idiosyncrasies that are found in certain humans; of which, Yoshiko exploits quite frequently, often inadvertently, as she often does so well she\'s expressing her curiosities on certain matters.Yoshiko has one friend at school, Sayaka, who seems to have a strange attachment to Yoshiko where she will tolerate everything she puts her through just to see if it makes her a better person, despite how much it bemoans her.

But, I can\'t deny you will laugh a ton well watching it.', 'Comedy comes in many forms, from witty satire to slapstick, sitcom and more.  Some of these subgenres produce shows which you can enjoy proudly or openly without fear of judgement. Aho Girl is not one of those shows. In fact, it might be the dumbest and most immature anime I’ve seen since Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-Chan, which is saying a lot. That probably sounds like a bad thing, but I found this show hilarious.As the title suggests, the show is about a girl, Yoshiko, who’s somewhat of a moron, frequently scoring 0s on tests and being pretty much incapable of functioning like a normal human...being. But what what she lacks in conventional intelligence, she more than makes up for with her boundless energy and enthusiasm and her absurd, yet often profound reasoning that frequently criticises and questions the nature of accepted social norms, albeit completely unintentionally on her part.  This is a girl who I might describe as being a cross between Mako Mankanshoku and Karl Pilkington, and the chaos she creates is a thing of beauty to behold.The ‘other’ main character is Akutsu, the unwitting and unfortunate object of Yoshiko’s affection, who is otherwise an intelligent, if socially inept high school student. If you’ve ever seen The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, you’ll be familiar with the dynamic between him and Yoshiko, as it’s in many ways similar to Kyon and Haruhi, and it’s a formula that I feel works very well.  There’s also a fair number of supporting characters whose interactions with Yoshiko and Akutsu fuel some of the funnier gags throughout the show.Being an adaptation of a 4-koma manga, Aho Girl is very much a gag comedy, featuring a sequence of shorter sketches over the course of each 12-minute episode with only minimal continuity between them. Some of these sketches have their own, unique style independent from the rest of the show, particularly when parodying another show, something Aho Girl does a number of times to great effect.Whether or not you enjoy Aho Girl likely depends on whether you like absurd, over-the-top slapstick humour. As a fan of that, I think this is great.  If I had any criticisms, it’d be that while many of the gags are hilarious, some of them got a bit repetitive or weren’t that great to begin with, but overall I’d say this is very much worth the watch. being.

Aho Girl is a show that embraces stupidity while also encouraging its viewers to indulge in a nutritious snack. While it's not a masterpiece, its comedy is pretty well done and it has a fairly solid cast of characters. Each episode only runs 12 minutes, which is a plus if you're low on free time.Firstly, let's talk about Yoshiko. Our lovable protagonist is a teenage girl with an IQ about half her age. Or does she? Most likely. In spite of this she's more dynamic than her gag of having a...head running on empty (anime review!) While I'm dissuaded from mentioning spoilers on here, I will say that there are several segments in the second half of the series where Yoshiko shows off her witty side. The fact that she possesses such moments makes the show more engaging for me. Still I wouldn't really describe her or any of the other characters as deep, but they perform their respective roles well.Next up we have Akuru Akutsu, better known as A-kun. I have mixed feelings towards this character. Being the straight man in this comedy, he's a good foil to Yoshiko's wild and thoughtless behavior. Although later episodes shed light on his hostile behavior towards Yoshiko, I find it rather off-putting. This is an issue I have with many anime, especially when it's played for comedic purposes. I have little interest in seeing a character getting punched or kicked multiple times in an episode simply for having a goofy attitude. That's not to say there aren't times when I can understand A-kun's pent up frustration. I quite like Yoshiko, but she definitely lacks boundaries. Still A-kun is overly stiff and has weak emotional intelligence.The other characters are alright albeit less memorable for me. A-kun's sister also shows a nice contrast with Yoshiko. Though she has similarities with our Aho protagonist, I like the her more serious, perhaps more mature outlook on life. Sayaka, who appears to be a fan favorite is probably the only character in the show with whom I'd feel comfortable going to have dinner. She's level headed and maintains decorum most of the characters lack. And to round out this not so subtle harem around A-kun is Iinchou, the class rep. Honestly I don't have much to say about her. She's okay.The remaining characters (that matter) are Yoshiko's mother, a delinquent named Ryuuichi, and a large white dog. Yoshiko's mom is something of a gold-digging psycho. Ryuuichi has a sweet side, which is nice, but he lacked screen-time. If I had to pick an overall favorite character it would probably be Dog. Yes, that's the name of the big white dog (it was named by Yoshiko, go figure). Despite being an animal, Dog is shown to be a kind, brave, and thoughtful individual.The opening song has a fitting goofiness to it, which I found enjoyable. The animation quality is fairly standard for the current year. Characters are well differentiated but likability is hit and miss. The jokes are mostly good, although the violence, especially early on is a bit needless, but still somewhat better handled than your usual punch a character at the drop of a hat behavior so common in comedy based anime.Aho girl is a good show. It's dumb, but not sloppy. If you're looking for some laughs maybe this will hit the spot? So grab a banana and settle in for the evening. Just don't put off studying for any upcoming multiple choice tests, unless you're competing with Yoshiko in the aho world cup........ are you still reading this? Why? Look! A flying banana! head running on empty (anime review!)

Akuru is the male lead of the anime and he is a friend to Yoshiko but he does end up hitting her and stuff because of her stupidity he is a pretty much a study person at heart so doesn't have that or any friends expect for her otherwise hes a pretty nice character. Fuuki is a supporting character and is part of a committee of the school she also falls in love with Akuru to the point of stalking him and such shes a pretty nice character though. Sayaka is another supporting character and she is a pretty nice and pretty shy (in my eyes) character nothing really else to say about her. Ruri is another supporting character and is the sister to Akuru she is also a complete idiot when it comes to testes and stuff but at least studies and stuff unlike Yoshiko otherwise she is a pretty nice and good character.Enjoyment: Things that i liked: this anime was freaking funny as hell like just beyond funny also the fact the characters are all really good as well here. Things that i didn't like: honestly nothing one thing maybe for people is that Akuru does tend to beat up Yoshiko (who is a girl) but honestly that's meant more for comedy than anything else.Overall: im giving this a 9 for sure the comedy in this is freaking funny as hell and the characters really complete that as well also that the art is really well done as well but man the comedy in this is a freaking gold id easily recommend this anime for sure. that's for that otherwise the characters sounded really good here.Characters: Yoshiko is the female lead of the anime a complete and total idiot also she has love for bananas and also Akuru otherwise she was a freaking funny character loved her in this anime.

And I like it (in some way), but, if take this serious, it\'s absurd.You can judge yourself: the plot is almost missing, all situations are cliche, characters are flat and show no progress at all, lame animation and sound. No pros at all (this is not true), but still I am glad that I watch it.Because you can have fun, all the situations in which our heroes take part are absurd, our heroes are absurd (nothing new for anime) and ... and something else is absurd too.

Yoshiko is the main engine of the show, but there is also a perverted head of the school board, a really nice girl (only one normal) and a set of other plain but fun-delivering characters.Anime consists of short episodes with even shorter skits.

Peace out !"", ""This is a comedy anime that focuses on a guy who has to constantly deal with the stupid shenanigans of his friend, a stupid girl who loves bananas. The thing that stands out about this is that instead of the guy being hit, it's actually the male MC hitting the girl. That does seem wrong when you hear it the first time around, but it's actually pretty funny once you get to watch it.To begin, there's not much of a story. It goes along the lines of the main heroine doing something stupid that makes male MC hit her because he's annoyed. There's different situations...like when she acts childish, gropes someones big breasts, says something stupid, but they all lead to the same outcome. A big punch to the face.If you like that kind of stuff then this is for you. There's also gags and jokes involving the other characters and that's equally funny.As for the characters themselves, they're all likable in a way. You can pity Akutsu kun (male MC) for having to deal with a stupid girl every day, laugh at what the banana loving girl does (heroine), it doesn't matter. There's always that one trait you'll like about the character.The art and sound on the other hand, are plain and simple. The OP seems like it's trying hard to be funny, and the art is kind of meh when compared to other anime this season.That being said, you should watch this anime if you just want to relax and have a good time. I mean, the episodes are only 12 minutes long, so it doesn't really leave a dent in your spare time. Just be aware that the comedy does get repetitive, at least for me, but I think that's just my own bias because I read some of the comments and people said they enjoyed it.In conclusion, if you like ridiculous comedy, guys hitting girls for once (not as bad as it sounds), and an overall decent time, then Aho Girl will definitely satisfy you. like when she acts childish, gropes someones big breasts, says something stupid, but they all lead to the same outcome.

The titular character, ""idiot girl"" named Yoshiko, is often more annoying than funny and her writing only at rare occasions reaches the witty and surprising qualities I would expect from a series in this formula. However, the more action focuses on the supporting cast and the protagonist Akkun, the more compelling it becomes. After five episodes, I have to admit that I had some decent laughs and even enjoyed re-watching earlier episodes while knowing a bit...more context to the story and roles certain characters would take on later.Some reviews here points to Akkuns ""violence"" against Yoshiko (and rarely other women) and interprets the show as misogynist - I think it\'s an obvious misreading, as all those scenes are in the formula of slapstick comedy and shouldn\'t be taken literally. There\'s also a bit of sexual humour, with Yoshiko trying to ""seduce"" Akkun in various, absurd ways, but I find it all less questionable than typical fanservice in many comedy anime titles (and here it\'s always part of the gag rather than actual fanservice). Parts of the humour might be off-putting to some, but I think it would be unfair to reject the whole series based on those fragments and I personally didn\'t mind them, outside of the somewhat-gross last episode.In general, I was very much sceptical about this series when I first encountered it, but I think that later in the season it really starts working well as a quick, absurd comedy it\'s ought to be. It\'s not for everyone and I was still sometimes disappointed by the quality of the writing, but it was also able to positively surprise me with some more creative gags. It might not be a must-watch, but still worth giving it a try, at least to find whether its kind of over-the-top absurdity appeals to you. more context to the story and roles certain characters would take on later.Some reviews here points to Akkuns ""violence"" against Yoshiko (and rarely other women) and interprets the show as misogynist - I think it\'s an obvious misreading, as all those scenes are in the formula of slapstick comedy and shouldn\'t be taken literally.

That scenario is what our protagonist of Aho Girl has seemingly found himself in, where in a world of screwballs he is forever cursed to serve as the lone source of sanity.While most people tend to focus on Yoshiko, the titular Aho Girl who is stuck on an idiotic neverending quest to...consume all bananas, I was instead mostly fascinated by the show’s other protagonist, Akuru whose neverending quest is to make sure Yoshiko doesn’t consume his banana. Because in this show’s world of idiots, perverts, and mature perverts he is forced to serve as the sole straight man to the insanity around him. Time and time again we see him pushed to his limits and weirdly out of the cast he was the sole reason that I stuck around and finished this admittedly irritating series.At its core, Aho Girl is a rapid-fire sketch comedy anime that quickly bounces from setup to setup trying its best to cram as many jokes and references into its 12-minute episode structure. With only 12-minutes the creators of Aho Girl decided to focus on the jokes and elected to leave out excessive aspects like character development, world-building, relationships, and frankly any semblance of an actual plot. However, despite lacking any actual plot besides Yoshiko being dumb and wanting bananas, often at the expense of the serious and grounded Akurur, Aho Girl actually kept my attention, especially during the first few episodes.At the start of the series, the setups and gags just focused on the dynamic between Yoshiko and Akuru, and while Yoshiko is undeniably annoying it always felt weirdly compelling to see time and time again Akuru having to endure and eventually give in to his own rage. With further episodes adding to Akuru’s misery as more and more side characters began to inhabit the show with each one posing some weird trait or obsession to clash with his serious demeanor and further provide horrifying evidence that Yoshiko isn’t the annoying outlier of his world, but rather he is the sane outlier of a world of aggravating madness.

No matter where he goes this world is Akuru’s own personal hell and if find it oddly amusing to watch his comedic suffering.Unfortunately, while that concept certainly grabbed my attention and kept me laughing for the first few episodes the show eventually reached a point where the series’ premise and humor started to lose me. Instead of branching out and experimenting with its gags and setups Aho Girl quickly began to recycle its own material falling into a series of extremely formulaic gags, made even worse by the series' gradual refocusing from Akuru’s suffering to the daily life of Yoshiko, which I didn’t find nearly as interesting.Aho Girl is definitely worth a view, especially if you’re like me and were looking for a comedic itch to briefly fill the hole of Gintama.

Motivations are slowly provided to make sure that its maniacs and basket cases feel much more believable than plenty of story-focus anime.Enjoyment: 8The writing, direction, and timing of each sketch are quite good, and most of the gags are endearing. It is almost a master of joke length that a stand-up comedian would use, with the ability to use much more visuals to sell the details. It is, however, very vulnerable to saturation, and watching only 1-2 episodes at a time is strongly recommended to prevent viewer burnout.Its central problem is that it requires at least a young adult\'s patience, but a juvenile sense of humor, along with a tolerance for panty shots, but also readiness for none of its echi to be at all attractive.If have managed to be eager for a show with all 4 of those things, this show will be a solid 10 for you. Its problem is that anyone without those incredibly specific preferences will enjoy the show a lot less, and that it thus has nothing to offer most viewers.Sound: 7The sound design does a good job of supporting the jokes, and doesn\'t pretend it is good to punctuate a punchline with a sound. Unfortunately, the sound track never breaks away to carry a segment.

This show is just so stupid that it\'s funny in a good way. I have to admit that the ""Aho girl"" Yoshiko becomes a bit annoying after a while but it doesn\'t really bother me because every other characters besides her is just perfect.The 3 characters that are the main focus of this show is the Aho girl, Yoshiko who\'s...just a straight up idiot, know nothing of anything in life except for love of bananas and romance, she has a bit of common sense when it comes to that actually. 2nd is Akutsu who has known Yoshiko since they were small and is violent with Yoshiko like a tsundere and there\'s Yoshiko\'s friend Sumino who is pretty much the only characters in this show who is a normal girl with common sense.What makes this show so fun to watch for me is the interactions the main characters has with every side characters that shows up from time to time. For example*SPOILER*Akutsu\'s little sister who is also an idiot but she at least tries to get smarter unlike Yoshiko but Akutsu doesn\'t care if her little sister is an idiot cause he will still love her and therefore doesn\'t help her even though he\'s smart and there\'s also a girl who\'s the president of the disciplinary commitee who has a crush on Akutsu but doesn\'t know how to deal with her love for him so she ends up stalking him like all the time, she\'s probably my fav character for how her character is xD*END of spoilers*I\'d definitely say you should give it a try if you like comedies that\'s 99% jokes and 1% drama. just a straight up idiot, know nothing of anything in life except for love of bananas and romance, she has a bit of common sense when it comes to that actually. 2nd is Akutsu who has known Yoshiko since they were small and is violent with Yoshiko like a tsundere and there\'s Yoshiko\'s friend Sumino who is pretty much the only characters in this show who is a normal girl with common sense.What makes this show so fun to watch for me is the interactions the main characters has with every side characters that shows up from time to time.

I rated it a 5 because its just an average show.There isn't meant to be some life lesson or a theme to this show, it is a comedy after all. However the lowbrow humour never made me burst out loud. I smirked and grinned but for a comedy there are certainly better anime with similar comedic style that made me laugh out loud.Everything in this anime is average, the soundtrack was forgettable and the art was generic. The VA however suited the characters.The characters themselves had...that one-dimensional personality with only one trait, that most comedies have.

With not the best story, but still very enjoyable. One of the things I enjoyed the most though was the fact that the creators still put in a little romance along with the comedy. I am usually someone who...watches a lot of Romance anime. But I also don't mind Rom-Coms either. With this one there was more comedy for sure, which I found very enjoyable.Sorry if this is a little short. I watched this anime a good bit ago.

The problem is not the presentation, writing, or performance.  These are all top-notch, or at least as good as we can expect for this kind of show.  No, the problem lies with the thematic choice.Aho Girl is a harem comedy, with an unwilling protagonist being pursued by a bunch of thirsty Ｔ Ｈ Ｏ Ｔ Ｓ.  Yoshiko-chan (the titular ""dumb girl"") is a worthless moron who pursues A-kun in an outlandish and overt way to get him to...marry her so she doesn\'t have to worry about her own survival.  Fuuki-chan is the head of the school morality patrol, and ""fell in love"" with A-kun for no apparent reason and now wants to sleep with A-kun because she thinks he\'s hot.  Yoshie-san is the MILF mother of Yoshiko-chan who is desperate to get her daughter and A-kun hitched so she can ""retire"".  Sayaka-chan is the ""good girl"" who barely has a personality or any motivations worth discussing.  Together, they and some other minor characters harass A-kun day after day for their own benefits.Now, there isn\'t anything inherently flawed with this premise.  It actually sounds kind of fresh at first glace.  However, the issue comes in when you realize that comedies of this type rely heavily on the cute and endearing personalities of the girls to deliver the comedy.  Common gags in harem comedies include: accidental falling on boobs, accidental panty flashing, spying in the bath, etc, etc.  However, in this anime, the girls are outright Ｔ Ｈ Ｏ Ｔ Ｓ, and are so incredibly forward with our protagonist that it is not only not cute, but annoying.  And that\'s the end result:  You end up just identifying with A-kun and thinking how incredibly annoying these girls are.  Not cute.  Not funny.  Just annoying.  Sure, there are some well-written gags, which are funny in isolation.  But for the most part, you just end up waiting for A-kun to punch Yoshiko-chan for the 100th time to shut her the f*** up.TL;DR: Good writing, presentation, and performances.  Flawed harem comedy due mostly to the unlikableness of the girls.

It doesn\'t try to be anything, and yet encompasses many things which we find enjoyable from other shows.The story revolves around Yoshiko who is the stupid girl. She is an idiot without equal. Her childhood friend and neighbor Akuru is an intelligent guy without any friends. Together they live their lives with Yoshiko doing stupid things and Akuru trying to reign her in.The art was pretty good and the soundtrack was catchy.The characters are pretty fun. As mentioned above Yoshiko is the idiot....Akuru is the straight man. Sayaka is the other ""primary"" character, and her role is the innocent girl who bridges the gap between all the characters. The other characters are fun, like the Yoshiko\'s mother who tries to keep other girls away from Akuru. Or the discipline committee president who is turns into a stalker. However they most of the show is Yoshiko and Akuru.Overall I enjoyed this anime a lot. I think it knew what show it was and knew what it could do. The characters all intermingle really well, Yoshiko is  a caustic character and without the other characters to cut in it might have become tedious to watch. The 11 minutes also allowed for enough of the show to progress without feeling overwhelming. The comedy also has different angles. It isn\'t like other shows with a caustic character where its a one trick pony. Yes the theme is around a stupid girl doing stupid things but you see if from several viewpoints. It\'s not a gem, it\'s not a classic, it\'s a fun break.TLDR: If you like stupid humor this is pretty good. Its a short too, only 11 minutes an episode. Give it a try.*I wasn\'t going to review it as its a short and obviously a comedy show, but a review twists things into issues that are not really issues. If your not interested me breaking down some things then you should stop here.*First of all not everyone will like the show, its completely a comedy show revolving around stupidity. Not once does it try to be serious or thought provoking. It has the typical joker and straight man setup. The show almost feels like a spoof, but its not. It walks the line between really well. For example there are a lot of panty shots in this show. However its not fan service. I mean someone somewhere might have gotten into it, but I don\'t think its meant to be that. At the start of the show Akuru says something to the degree of ""who would be attracted to you"" and its true, Yoshiko is not a sexual character. They do have sexualized characters in Yoshie and Iinchou but neither have more than eluded to sexual themes.The relationship between our straight man and joker is abusive in the most obvious sense. Yoshiko does stupid thing and gets punched. However this is pretty typical. The three stooges, Laurel and Hardy, and the Groucho brothers are all famous for physical humor. That\'s to name a few, there are many many more examples. In this anime the worst that happens is a punch to the face and a shot with her on the floor with the white eyes. Anime does stuff like this all the time to literally add a punch line to the comedy. I\'m not exactly sure why this is so terrible we need to clam up and act like what we are watching is something terrible that needs to be censored. A good equivalent to their relationship is the pairing of Sousuke and Kaname from Full Metal Panic.Now some more character specific things. Akuru is not a self insert character. In fact he is almost the equivalent of a side character. He studies, and is smart. He has other personality points but none of them make you want to be in his shoes. On the other hand he has enough personality that he isn\'t just an empty vessel. He is what Yoshiko has made of him. He explodes because who wouldn\'t. The nicest guy on earth would not be able to deal with what Yoshiko puts him through. Why should he change? The other character cliche\'s are again a homage of sorts. Why reinvent the wheel when the show doesn\'t try to be anything other than a stupid comedy? Akuru doesn\'t have a sister complex. Loving your family member is different than wanting to screw them.Again the show has its flaws but don\'t pass up a show you might like because someone wants to make mountains out of mole hills. It\'s easy to be taken in by well written reviews. However try and experience things for yourself. Akuru is the straight man.

But boy, I was enjoying every minute of it. I laughed and face palmed myself multiple times until the very end. It was that stupid. I feel sorry for the other characters especially A-kun for enduring all those years as Yoshiko’s childhood friend. R.I.P. A-kun’s childhood.It was nice to watch this kind of shows from time to time. A show that doesn’t make you think, but only makes you laugh because of the absurdity of some scenes. Even if the anime was only 12 minutes long, the effect of the stupid comedy brought...by the series was tremendous. Even now, remembering some scenes from the series still gives me a chuckle. I’m definitely satisfied with this series, from how it started up to how it ended. It definitely brightened my summer anime watching.That is all. by the series was tremendous.

It definitely brightened my summer anime watching.That is all.', ""This is one of those anime that you watch solely for the LOLs. You expect to laugh and Aho girl definitely delivers. The purpose of these characters is made for your chuckling pleasure. Living up to its title, here is a psychologist's point of view on the comedic anime.※ Strength ※- Funny. Whether or not, Aho girl definitely has funny elements attached to it. Because the purpose of the girl MC is to make the viewer laugh. We laugh at her ridiculousness and stupidity. We laugh at her incapability to understand. If you want a good laugh, you are in for a treat.- Violence. This...is a double-edged sword and it definitely worked out for me. I found it hilarious to see characters getting beaten up overdramatically as of course, it's ultimate purpose is to deliver the comedic effect and exaggerate it to the point of impossibility.- Intriguing. The plot storyline and events keep Aho girl spicy as we are repeatedly exposed to the same amount of setting. It's not just the same thing happen over and over again. But the same thing happening in different ways in different settings.※ Weakness ※- Lack of development. One of the biggest downfall about this anime is the lack of progression. Whether it may be character or the story plot itself, one can assume from each episode to remain overall similar in the big picture. This anime had the potential to deliver some quality character development by bringing extra characters in and making it more vivid and complex but it apparently miss that chance.- Illogical. Sometimes I wonder the validity of the realism in this anime. I see various tiny but noticeable attempts in some seriousness but then it was slowly canceled out by illogical and inconsistent actions and behaviors.Was this a fun anime? Seems like it.How did I like it? Definitely gave me a good LOLing.Rewatch? Probably not.Aho Girl had ultimately served its purpose: to make the audience laugh but if I were to rewatch again, would it give the same similar initial feeling I had when I first watched it? It was definitely a ride worth experiencing but ultimately, it's nothing more than a comedy anime that is forgettable like all the others. Perhaps years later, I'll give it another try. But for now, thanks for the good times, Miss Aho Girl! is a double-edged sword and it definitely worked out for me.

It won't take...you long.Watch it for dog. you long.Watch it for dog."", 'Oh man, where do I begin with this review because honestly, I do not know. Aho girl is something. Like I watched it because I was just curious about it. I mean an anime where the girl is stupid like EXTREMELY stupid and a childhood friend who has to deal with her. Sounds interesting at least. You can picture some crazy antics happening.I would have to say that this anime is mediocre at best. It is a comedy anime but the comedy it exhibits, are like one-liners and mainly has to do with something about love or sex. Or heck its both at...the same time. I guess it is okay to use those things a couple of times but to me, after a while, it got kind of old and cringey. I don\'t remember if I actually laughed a lot while watching this anime (mainly because I had to put off finishing this anime for a while because I was busy with school. Like I started during the summer but didn\'t actually finish it until December.)STORYWell, the whole premise of the story is that it is about a girl who is a complete and utter idiot and her childhood friend that has to deal with her. They are in high school and they meet other people and all that.So because of a premise like that, you would imagine that there would be some weird antics that they get into. Well the antics they get into are in fact weird but they surpass weird. Like for me, it got cringey. Again tying with the fact that they used one-liners and jokes about sex and love. Another thing is that the anime relies a lot on intense movements (I guess that is how I can describe it) And at times it can be in your face. I don\'t know how to really describe it.That is all I got to say. The story is meh. I mean every episode is divided into four parts and each part is dedicated to a different type of story so yeah...CHARACTERSOh boy... Okay, I would have to say, the characters that I liked were Akuru (the childhood friend), Ruri (Akutsu\'s little sister), Sayaka (their classmate) and Dog. My ultimate favorite being Dog. Everyone else I thought was okay or I just didn\'t like them as much.The main character Yoshiko, I will say right now, I did not like her that much. I mean okay she is a complete idiot (I mean the title is called Aho girl so yeah...). Actually, she surpasses the level of complete idiot. She makes complete idiots look smarter. Like she is so stupid, I am so surprised at how she is able to live for so long. Like how in the world did you get into high school??Like I know she is supposed to be the gag character. The character that makes the jokes. She is designed to be the stupid character so that she can administer the jokes. But the things that she says and does, at first are like completely outrageous (well they are always outrageous) but it just gets to the point where I am cringing. I am just cringing at everything that she does.I will give it to her that at some points that she makes a point. Like about how there is a limit to how pure a person can be in a relationship. I would have to admit she had a point. At some point, you have to do things like hold hands and kiss. Those ""unpure"" things. But other than that... honestly, I don\'t know.And can I just say, am I the only one that feels very bad for Akuru? I mean he had to deal with Yoshiko\'s shizz for the longest time. I just felt bad for him to be honest. And I liked it whenever he punched or hurt Yoshiko. Because honestly if I had to deal with someone like that, I would probably do what he did. Like seriously.ARTArt was okay. Nothing really special to be honest. Character designs were generic in my opinion. Nothing really stood out from the characters visually.SOUNDNothing really special about it. The score was eh. It was okay. Not bad but not that great either.ENJOYMENTDid I enjoy this anime? At some parts I did but others not really. Majority of the time I was either cringing, or I was just like meh. Just meh.That is basically how I can describe my enjoyment. Meh. This anime was meh. To be honest, I was like pushing through to finish the last few episodes. And now I can say I have watched Aho girl. the same time. I guess it is okay to use those things a couple of times but to me, after a while, it got kind of old and cringey.

The episodes are cut to half-length from a normal anime which suits really well. This way they don't have to overextend the episodes making them really boring.

Each episode is split into several, disconnected episodes with simple plots to drive the humour. The story is mediocre at best and characters are archetypes to a fault.Ultimately, the portrayal of genders is one of my main gripes. The main character, the only male in more than four or five ""mini episodes"", is seen as rational, intelligent, cold, and uncaring of anything that isn\'t academics. Almost every female (with one notable exception) in this show comes across as incredibly stupid, boy crazy, or manipulative. I can\'t help hating...the show a bit for that. Additionally, the main girl\'s voice will probably grate on your ears within an episode or two.With all of that said, I couldn\'t refrain from smiling through the episodes.

I\'ll get right into the review.Story: I don\'t really know what you\'d expect from this kind of show when it comes to story, seeing how it\'s Nichijou-esque. However, this show did have somewhat of a story for some of the episodes, which did surprise me. This ""story"" showed up by influencing the characters and their actions, instead of doing what most animes like this would have done (which is to ""reset"" to a certain point in time to make...different stories). Overall, story was a nice little addition to the anime, but not really developed as the anime\'s genre didn\'t allow it to be too developed.Art: At first glance, art in this anime seems to be generic, without anything extremely eye-catching. Well, it\'s like this until you get to when A-kun punching Yoshiko. When that happens, everything changes as if it\'s an intense fight. It\'s a nice part of the anime especially when you see those scenes.Sound: I just want to say that I think sound was the 2nd best part of this anime, other than character. The voice acting was on point, and A-kun being voiced by the man who did Gintoki was one of the best choices ever. Yoshiko was also done well, getting the smug and idiotic parts of her brought out really well. I especially like the episode where Yoshiko went out to beat up all the dudes from (wait for it) Dick High School. She changed from idiot to edgy in less than a millisecond.Character: So, character. Being a 12 episode anime with episodes half the length of a normal one, I found the characters to have much more depth to them than I would have initially thought. Yoshiko not only is an idiot who likes bananas, but her backstory reveals that she has infinite energy, will fight you if you talk trash about bananas, and is hard to persuade when it comes to doing a task (which is usually playing games). A-kun also shows that he basically was just a weaker and shorter version of himself in the past, since his need to study has never changed. But the best part of the anime was when the Morality President went from someone who was respectable to a stalking closet pervert. Other honorable mentions is Sayaka, who can get drunk off of fumes.Enjoyment: This anime was extremely enjoyable, full of references (but not as much as Nyaruko), and scenes that make absolutely no sense. It felt like a mix between Gintama and a regular school anime. This is seen in episode 9, during the part when Yoshiko explains that women want to remember a kiss, and men want to remember a fondle. But, once you watch episode 10 and 11, you see how much the anime is inspired by other ones. Episode 10 makes fun of racing anime, using Yoshiko and the dog, and episode 11 uses a fight scene full of banana filled revenge in order to make fun of animes with intense fight scenes like JoJo and One Punch Man.Well, overall, this anime was a nice break from the animes that I\'ve been watching right now. It had scenes that were self-aware at times, and had characters that all fit a cliche. In the end, all the categories combine into one really strange, but entertaining anime. different stories).

Yes, I'm talking about Aho Girl, an anime that takes the phrase 'dumb blonde' to a whole new level.The premise of Aho Girl is fairly simple. Our protagonist, Yoshiko, is a high school student who's so ridiculously stupid that she's a danger to herself and those around her. Along the way, she meets a cast of characters who are equally bizarre, including her long-suffering friend Akuru and the delinquent Ryuichi.The humor in Aho Girl is certainly not for everyone, relying heavily on slapstick and physical...comedy. But while there are certainly some funny moments, the repetitive nature of the gags can become tiresome after a while. The characters, too, lack any real depth or development, making it difficult to care about their antics.Well, isn't this just an anime that's about as subtle as a freight train? It's almost enough to make me want to switch over to watching old mangaksa san to assitant san.Overall, I'd give Aho Girl a score of 6.727272/10. While it might appeal to fans of over-the-top comedy, it's unlikely to win over anyone looking for a more nuanced and sophisticated anime.--------------------------------------Halo, dan selamat datang di sebuah anime yang sehalus palu besar. Ya, saya sedang membicarakan tentang Aho Girl, sebuah anime yang membawa frasa 'blonde bodoh' ke level yang lebih tinggi.Premis dari Aho Girl cukup sederhana. Protagonis kita, Yoshiko, adalah seorang siswa SMA yang sangat bodoh sehingga dia menjadi bahaya bagi dirinya sendiri dan orang-orang di sekitarnya. Di sepanjang jalan, dia bertemu dengan sekelompok karakter yang sama-sama aneh, termasuk teman penderitaan Akuru dan Ryuichi si preman.Humor dalam Aho Girl tentunya tidak untuk semua orang, sangat bergantung pada slapstick dan komedi fisik. Tetapi meskipun ada beberapa momen lucu, repetitifnya gurauan bisa menjadi menjemukan setelah beberapa saat. Karakter-karakternya pun kurang memiliki kedalaman atau perkembangan, sehingga sulit untuk merasa peduli pada tingkah laku mereka.Baiklah, apakah ini bukanlah sebuah anime yang sehalus kereta barang? Hampir saja membuat saya ingin beralih menonton Mangaka-san to Assistant-san yang lebih lawas.Secara keseluruhan, saya akan memberikan skor 6,727272/10 untuk Aho Girl. Meskipun mungkin menarik bagi penggemar komedi yang berlebihan, tetapi anime ini tidak akan menarik bagi orang yang mencari anime yang lebih nuansa dan canggih comedy.

Fortunately for Aho Girl, it's not one of those. Aho Girl takes the absurdity of many of the situations and cranks it all the way to one hundred. The result is a very entertaining and hilarious comedy that is able to take advantage of the fact that it's only twelve minutes long.The story revolves around Yoshiko Hanabatake and it is her idiocy that sets the standard for the dumb fun that the show contains. The isn't any centralizing plot but instead the anime focuses it's efforts completely on skit humor and relies...on the interactions between the amazing cast of characters to carry the show. I don't think there was a single character in the anime I didn't end up liking. The art and animation aren't anything special but gets the job done. One drawback I can come up with is that even with the short duration of the anime, some of the jokes may outlive it's welcome if it's not the type of comedy that you enjoy to watch.Even then, Aho Girl is probably going to be one of the first shows that will pop into my mind if I had to recommend a short form show to someone. It's also one of the better comedies I have watched in recent memory. on the interactions between the amazing cast of characters to carry the show.

It's also one of the better comedies I have watched in recent memory."", ""So far I have watched 7 episodes of Aho-Girl that are currently available to us the viewers. In this brief review, i shall share my thoughts on this anime with whomever is interested in watching this anime.First i'd like to address the genre's of the anime and if i see them as appropriate for the shows description. The genres listed in the bio for the anime are;  Comedy, Romance, School, Shounen.Comedy~ I feel like this genre is very fitting for this anime since it is mainly about a girl who is very stupid therefore the 'aho' in the title of the anime which is...another word for idiot/dumbass. Each episode is filled with jokes towards Yoshiko's intelligence (or lack there of) or good old sexual harrassment from Yoshiko and Iinchou towards Akuru who seems to be sick to the bone of them both. The shows comedy also comes to light when Akuru is around Yoshiko because more often than not she tries to flash him her 'pantsu' or annoys him with continus flirting and breaking into his home. This show is filled with silly humor and light hearted plot. This genre fits the anime very well.Romance~ Well so far in the anime there hasn't been any romance between two people but there has been- what seems to be- a one sided love from Yoshiko to Akuru and with Iinchou towards Akuru. If anything i feel like this anime could-in some manner- fit with an ecchi genre since there is quite a bit of fan service in a humor sort of fashion. But all in all, perhaps by the end of the anime it will be more evident who Akuru choses are his partner so i guess this genre suits well.School~ This genre is suited since most of the other characters apart from Yoshiko and Akuru have become friends inside the school and many of the events happen at the school, such as Yoshiko failing her exams and their teacher feeling lonely and hopeless due to never finding love and not being able to help Yoshiko understand her lessons. This genre is suited.Shounen~ is a genre aimed at a young male audience, anywhere from the ages 8-19. Personally i don't see how this genre applies... Although it is clear that the anime is about a stupid girl and the guy she is in love with, it still seems odd to add this genre to the mix. I admit the fanservice is mainly- if not primerly- directed towards the male population it still raises the question as to why this genre is included? Akuru isn't the main character in every episode while Yoshiko is the main character and usually if there is an issue that is in the anime it is mainly revolved around her. But then again that might be my nitpicking tendency.All in all the genre's are pretty accurate to its anime and serve it justice. Every episode is around 12 minutes long which are split into mini episodes.Next i'd like to comment and give my opinion on Story, Art, Sound,Characters, Enjoyment and Overall.Story~ 6/10. The story is about a stupid girl Yoshiko in love with her childhood friend Akuru who happens to be really smart but hot headed. The story is a bit unclear as to where everything is going but i think that by the time the series ends Yoshiko and Akuru will end up together. So far the story is easy enough to follow and is touching in some parts and quite funny in others. The story isn't the best but it isn't the worse. I wouldn't say i love it or that i am overly enthusiastic  about the show, but it is a good way to just sit back and enjoy a silly series without a hardcore plot.Art~ 5/10. The artwork is nothing spectacular and in my opinion it's pretty bland and unimpressive. It's not the worse artwork i've ever seen but its by far not the best. At the very best it's better than boku no Pico.Sound~ 5/10. The opening is pretty catchy and upbeat and throughout the anime the background music is pleasant. The voice acting can be pretty annoying with some characters voices being way too high pitched for my liking, but other than that the sound was enjoyable enough.Characters~ 6/10. The characters are pretty cliche in the parts that the main male character has a little sister which he adores. There is a cute shy girl, Sayaka which has become the norm for every anime to include. The mother is quite the interesting character and Yoshiko is pretty original with her love for bananas. Most charaters are pretty likable but i can't help but notice that many are cliched.Enjoyment~ 7/10. The anime itself is enjoyable to watch since it isn't too long and doesn't require much thought since everything is pretty obvious and with no hidden meaning. It is an anime you should watch after having your brians fucked by an anime that was either, too confusing or too annoying. I enjoy the silly humor and even the fan service in some points. Some characters are refreshing and interesting to watch.Overall~ 6/10. The anime- as i've said before- is pretty ejoyable, lighhearted, entertaining and funny. It by far isn't a masterpiece but it isnt the worste thing to be served to us the hopeless Otaku's who just want to be on top of seasonal anime. I would recommend this anime if you want something short and sweet just as an extra 'watched' on your list.That concludes my review and i hope i didn't bore any of you out of your minds. another word for idiot/dumbass.

The other voice actresses do a great job of matching the energy level too, creating a high pace fiesta of idiocy, excitement, and mental breakdowns.What's even more surprising is that the art stays at a consistent quality throughout, and there's some scenes where...they really pull out the stops to ramp up the absurdity, very similar to Nichijou. Without stellar animation, slapstick comedy like this really falls apart.So considering my personal enjoyment of this show sits at a 9, the only point I dock from Aho Girl is that objectively, it might be too stupid for some people. But this is right up the alley of someone (me) who still laughs at toilet humor. they really pull out the stops to ramp up the absurdity, very similar to Nichijou.

The show is a comedy all the way through and accomplishes it in, quite honestly, a stereotypical way but done right.Story: 6There really isn\'t much story to be had. It\'s a random act comedy that follows the daily shenanigans of our idiot MC. You get glimpses of flashbacks and memories but even those are often just comedic in nature as well.Art: 6The art is...solid and consistent. You can tell that they are actually very aware of the budget they have but do quite well with it.Sound: 6The ED is forgettable to me but the OP is actually fairly catchy. The VA is solid, a little over the top at times but I feel that\'s what they aimed for. I can\'t recall any background music but the occasional sound effects for the actions of characters is also spot on.Character: 7Albeit being stereotypical the characters are almost so far down the line that they actually become likable again. The idiot, free spirit MC, her smart, stoic childhood friend, the all around slightly above average friend, the pervert morals committee member, etc...They have all the typical roles filled but, as I said, they take that extra leap further and actually make them funny and enjoyable.Enjoyment: 9I finished the first episode and had one of those ""Ahh...Wtf did I just watch?"" moments. However it was not in the bad range of those emotions at all. I knew that I had found a nice little treat because I had laughed the entire way through and it had ended before I realized it. Having shortened episodes is a bummer but it suits the series very well. I\'m happy the comedy has continued episode to episode as well. A very nice show to pass the time.Overall: 8For what it is, Aho Girl is great. The type of comedy that actually makes you laugh loudly in your room at 3 A.M without feeling any sense of guilt for those around you. The comedy itself is great but you can never ascertain as to whether that is from them trying too hard or just saying eff it and not trying at all.

The idea of watching yet another slice-of-life anime surrounding an idiotic female character, (and one with only a 7.1 score) would\'ve been something I would\'ve passed on.Fortunately, I had never seen or heard of Aho Girl before, and only ended up watching it because I randomly clicked on it, after running out of Ace of Diamond episodes to watch during my workout. I\'m so glad I did. There are moments in this...anime that were so funny, I will probably remember them for years to come. Some moments had me in literal tears.The story itself is wildly simplistic. Yoshiko is an idiot. Yoshiko loves Bananas. Yoshiko loves Akkun. That\'s it. But, the jokes, man the jokes are just absolutely ridiculous. It\'s interesting that Akkun is voiced by the same voice actor as Gintoki, because the level of hilarity in the gags are Gintama-esque. Now, that\'s not to say Aho Girl is as excellent as Gintama, it\'s just that the level of some of the jokes are so high, that they\'ll have you laughing as hard as Gintama\'s best gags do.This is an anime all about setting up those funny moments. There\'s nothing else it really cares about. There\'s no drama, there\'s no real plot, there\'s nothing but one gag after another. (Probably why this anime is only a 7.1) But, when you gamble it all on the jokes like this, people are either going to love it or hate it. And clearly, for some it works and for others it doesn\'t. For me? This worked like crazy. I laughed almost the whole way through.I will say, however, that I\'m glad this anime was only 12 minutes an episode. Because this anime relied on two comedic themes: ""Perverted jokes"" and ""Slapstick"". And those two kinds of jokes can rarely carry an anime for 12 episodes at 24 minutes for a pure gag anime. Aho Girl was the perfect length. Any longer and the jokes would\'ve probably gotten stale, especially since they just come one after the other with no plot or story building in between.The last thing I will mention, is that of all of the idiots I\'ve seen in anime, Yoshiko has got to be one of my favorites. The way they used her idiocy was fantastic. At times, she wasn\'t really even an idiot, she was an idiot savant. And her totally oblivious nature when it came to dealing with other people\'s love lives, man, that made for some classic moments. Especially behind the school. I will not forget that. I will never forget that confession scene. Or, when Akkun spits. Or, ""That\'s the sluttiest thing I\'ve ever heard."".

Honestly, I\'m not sure what the fuck I just watched.The story revolves around Yoshino, a dumb girl, and her childhood friend Akun. While Akun is a major part, moreso, Yoshino actually seems to be the central character for the show....I wasn\'t expecting each episode to be so short, but with the simplicity of the show and it\'s continuous gags it actually works in the show\'s favor.In the spirit of such a short show, I will also keep a short review and actually go by the categories for once:Story: Virtually nonexistent, but that\'s not to it\'s detriment. There\'s no real ""progress"" in the show other than better understanding Akun and Yoshino\'s relationship, and the introduction to new characters. This feels more like an introduction to the manga, although now that all the set piecing is done, I\'d heartily welcome a season 2.Art: I actually have a friend who refuses to watch this due to the the animations seeming ""uncanny,"" however I never felt this. Actually, I think some animation are overdone for how simple of an anime it is.Sound: The music, while simple, was actually done pretty well to set the mood. Some ""battle scenes"" seemed ripped straight from shounen, while the idle background songs sounded like they were out of Persona 5 occasionally.Character: Pretty stereotypical. There\'s a nice girl, a pervert girl, a dumb girl, a dumb guy, and then the Akun whose a prick. Actually, the children characters that Yoshino interacts with and the dog are actually more developed than you\'d expect them to be.Enjoyment: I really liked this anime, but I can completely tell it\'s because it ""hit the spot"" for what I was looking for. It\'s nothing special, but it really was a fun and lighthearted show when I was looking for just that.Overall: You\'re not getting the Shakespeare of anime here, but it\'s a lighthearted comedy, with some good situational comedy that comes off higher than a regular sitcom, but not quite the same as a quirky dramedy.

All to the dismay and misfortune of Akuru (A-kun), who will throughout the series get annoyed with her...to the point of physically striking her. This doesn\'t phase her as she will continue to harass him. Along the way she manages to bring her mother to tears, dead set on making A-kun marry Yoshiko so that she can retire in peace, drags unexpected students, teachers, and children into the messes she creates, and eats bananas because we needed something to further symbolize that Yoshiko is a rabid animal that needs to be locked in a cage because society has failed her.Art 5/10:The art is decent. Characters are drawn pretty well and each time A-kun strikes Yoshiko it\'s a cathartic experience. The backgrounds serve their purpose and character designs are uninspired but serviceable.Sound 5/10:OP is pretty annoying, but expected coming from an inherently annoying series.

There are a few bits of piano in certain scenes that\'s actually pretty nice.Character 3/10:This is where Aho Girl hits rock bottom.Yoshiko is the most annoying, dumb character played up for laughs I\'ve seen yet, and while her presence is needed to keep the show moving forward, I detested every minute this protagonist was on screen.Akuru plays the only straight man in the series as he\'s constantly harassed by Yoshiko and her harem of equally inept supporting characters. He has two emotions, annoyed and furious.Sayaka is the zero presence side character in which the audience will base their perception of ""normal"" in this universe off of, she serves as that and not much else.Iinchou is an upstanding student turned dere as she attempts to win A-kun\'s heart only to be thwarted by Yoshiko and her mother repeatedly.Each subsequent character follows a similar singular gimmick that drives their role and interactions with the main two protagonists.Enjoyment 4/10:Overall 2/10:I knew that Aho Girl wasn\'t going to be a masterpiece.I was aware that the idiocy beyond words character existed and was hoping that the comedy and supporting cast would be enough to warrant some entertainment out of this series, but this wasn\'t the case.I have shit taste, but Aho Girl goes far beyond that. to the point of physically striking her.

From the comedy style, to the voice acting, to the wacky situations and outside references, it is trying its hardest to make you laugh from start to finish. Beginning with the story, it's a simple and highly episodic setup about a dense, fun-loving fool and her best friend, a short-tempered and studious guy who takes everything as serious as a car crash. Through their misadventures, often instigated by her immediate desire to play or eat bananas, they gather a small cast of supporting oddballs, like the disciplinary committee president, and a directionless hoodlum who dedicates his life to these...two friends. There's very little in terms of story here, which makes total sense, and things are largely taken on an episode-by-episode basis where some crazy new thing happens. It's often very funny, but after a while some of the gags get kind of old, which is really saying something as each episode is only 12 minutes. The art is pretty good, but nothing groundbreaking. I enjoyed the stylistic changes to match whatever they're referencing in the moment, but beyond that the character designs are clean and pleasing to the eye, ensuring that everybody is distinct and has their own visual style in this fast-paced anime. The sound is surprisingly good, with an unusually high-quality OST and impassioned voice acting, which caught me off-guard. The characters are this show's strongest point, being distilled into specific yet original archetypes that somehow succeed in feeling interesting and at least a little believable. My favorite characters are Fuki Iincho the disciplinary committee president, and Inu, Yoshiko's huge dog that she rides everywhere. They just felt the most consistently funny and brought the most to the show as complicating elements to the insane plots of Yoshiko and the overbearing discipline of Akuru. Overall, Aho-Girl is a quick, funny watch that doesn't really break any new ground. Be aware that there are some moments where the jokes don't really land, but that's not really too much of a price to pay for something that is otherwise perfectly fine.

Aho Girl is neither bad or amazing, just somewhere in between. For me, Aho Girl is like one of those animes you watch if you want a quick laugh or some sense of gender equality. Let\'s try to keep this review short in terms of ratings.The story for Aho Girl is pretty simple. As...the title implies, we have an ""aho"" or stupid girl that goes by the name of Yoshiko who does stupid things while the homeboy Akutsu contemplates his connections with her, usually expressing his emotions in the most perfect way. The basis of the story is fine with me, but it didn\'t really seem unique or interesting, especially in future episodes.The art for Aho Girl is fair, nothing too special and nothing to simplistic.Sound is sound, what do I even need to explain here. (btw the opening is pretty good ngl)The characters in Aho Girl seem pretty simple and normal, like any fine anime there is. From a stupid cheerful girl to a normal blonde sane girl to a disciplinary president with some melons, I don\'t see how this can be that unique.In some parts of Aho Girl, I might of had a small laugh here and there, with the occasional burst, but all in all, it was just me looking at a girl doing stupid things like any normal stupid person would do. I didn\'t enjoy it that much but I liked it.In conclusion, Aho Girl is fine in my book.

There\'s no denying that this anime would benefit if it would lose some of its perverseness, and yet its perversion is part of what makes the comedy work. It details the ""love"" story between Yoshiko Hanabatake (the eponymous ""Aho Girl"") and her ""lover""/""best friend"" Akuru Akutsu (who clearly wants nothing to do with her). The sheer simplicity behind Yoshiko\'s idiocy is matched only by her obsession towards bananas, the only topic perhaps where she seems to devote her entire intelligence towards, while somehow she demonstrates an attraction to her childhood friend Akuru despite having no real indication towards a reason....Indeed, even Akuru admits it is strange how the two of them constantly end up together, and perhaps this match not made in heaven is perfect due to the sheer unlikeliness of their personalities paired with the utter, blantant idiocy that Yoshiko fills her life with. And this doesn\'t begin to include straight-man Sayaka Sumino and stoic Fuki Iincho (who, despite seemingly appearing to be Akuru\'s female clone in personality, has her own comedic niche), and the riotous ever-changing anime intros (which, for a reviewer who tends to dislike and skip anime intros, is a pleasant surprise). If there is anything that could possibly accentuate this anime further, is to give Yoshiko more character development and growth besides just being a ""common idiot"", as her lack of progress can be frustrating for a reviewer who desires more plot to his stories. 9/10 Indeed, even Akuru admits it is strange how the two of them constantly end up together, and perhaps this match not made in heaven is perfect due to the sheer unlikeliness of their personalities paired with the utter, blantant idiocy that Yoshiko fills her life with.

Great character and even...better innuendos. Ima go eat a banana. better innuendos. Ima go eat a banana.', ""I watched Aho Girl. Here are my thoughts:The episodes for this are under 13 minutes long, so I'll try to be brief. This is basically a silly comedy show that is mostly episodic. In a nutshell, the comedy itself is objectively terrible but the delivery is good.Most of the comedy in this is either slapstick or sexual, neither of which I'm fond of. Much of the humour in this is just utterly generic school-anime comedy that any anime viewer has definitely seen before. However, the delivery was good enough to keep me watching.The VAs constantly yell and the dialogue is pretty fast-paced. Yoshiko (the main...retard girl with the orange twintails) really carries the entire show – her VA does a fantastic job of enthusiastically yelling all her lines into the mic. This show would literally be unwatchable without her voicework; I'm not exaggerating, this VA carries the entire show, and redeems its bad attributes enough to make it tolerable. None of the other voice actors shine nearly as much as her. Everyone else in the cast is both unfunny and unlikeable as well. However, the male lead, although irritating and shameless self-insert bait, acts as a good foil for Yoshiko, and they play off each other well.Visuals and OST were both adequate but unremarkable.My overall rating: 5/10The fact that this anime is completely retarded is both its worst and best quality. It really is stupid as hell. However, sometimes it is just dumb enough to be funny and entertaining. I also think the execution of this show is good, and this compensates a lot for how mediocre the humour itself is written. The high-energy script delivery and fast pace combined with short episodes are really what make it watchable. Yoshiko's VA in particular basically carries the entire show with how well she manages to deliver such a low-quality script.I have no idea how the manga for this managed to be successful, because the writing of the show is totally mediocre and recycles a lot of typical anime humour cliches. Maybe the way the manga panels are setup enhances the humour.I found this show optimal to watch when I had a bad day or I was angry about something because it would reliably lighten me up just by being really silly. retard girl with the orange twintails) really carries the entire show – her VA does a fantastic job of enthusiastically yelling all her lines into the mic.

Akuru Akutsu voiced by Tomokazu Sugita is Yoshiko\'s minder and a studious character and will physically attack Yoshiko whenever she starts pissing him off and to be honest...LA doesn\'t blame him. However where it crosses the line for him for LA was when he ""accidentally"" tried to attack his little sister Ruri voiced by Sayaka Senbongi. Fuuki Iinchou voiced by Sumire Uesaka, the student morals president was LA\'s favourite character...at the time, however she became OBSESSED with Akuru to the point of a stalker yandere and she crossed the line under the temptation and  stupidity of Yoshiko pushing her to her limits made LA look elsewhere for a favourite character. If you thought LA would choose Sayaka Sumino voiced by Sayaka Harada, then no but close, as she is the most normal character in this series in an anime filled with crazy, stupid and violent characters but she became plain at best and a target for small breast jokes (in comparison to Fuuki\'s big breast groping by Yoshiko). If you think Yoshiko is a worse character in this anime short, then look no further than Yoshiko\'s mother Yoshie voiced by Yoko Hikasa who REALLY crosses the line in this anime as she tries anything to get Yoshiko off her back by forcing marriage on Akuru in any way possible and becomes a rival to Fuuki just for this reasoning. SO LA\'s favourite characters...well those go to the characters who appear later in the anime short, the gyaru girls Akane Eimura voiced by M.A.O, Kii Hiiragi voiced by Rena Maeda and Tadashi voiced by Yuka Iguchi, as their reactions to the situation Yoshiko gets them through were well timed and had great chemistry with Yoshiko, plus as much as they are gyaru girls, they are mostly innocent and moe at times and best of all, they\'re situations are tamer in comparison to to how Yoshiko gets the main cast into.The comedy in this anime is also varied like it\'s divisive characters, it\'s one part crude humor to groanworthy panty shots fanservice, one part quick witted lines and finally one part stupidity and this combination as much as LA HATED this anime short early on, Aho-Girl definitely got better over time.The animation done by diomedea is consistent for the most part and the character designs are typical of them, but the animation is probably the least interesting part of the anime.The voice acting however...from Yoko Hikasa, Aoi Yuuki, Sumire Uesaka and Tomokazu Sugita hamming it up was GLORIOUS, especially from Aoi Yuuki pretty much shouting all her lines out in the crazy comedic accent she has...it\'s pretty much if Hibiki Tachibana was in a comedy hey it went full circle!, anyways...Aoi Yuuki essentially SAVED this anime short for LA, just how bombastically stupid her vocals were as Yoshiko kept LA from watching more and got Aho-Girl out of the ""so bad it\'s bad"" territory.

But the more I invest my time with the series, it gets overall boring. I have no predicament against the protagonist as it portrays of how the title of the anime should be ""Aho means: Stupid"".

If you\'re not sure what I mean by that, 4-koma manga are manga that are formatted to deliver quick punch lines in a 4 panel spread, which makes any anime adapted from them into simplistic, slapstick/gag anime. However, while that might sound like an insulting description, this can make for a decent comedy series, especially if you\'re looking for something to watch with a night of drinking.Story: 7, As I\'ve previously explained, this is a 4-koma adaptation, so there\'s really not any story. The plot is basically just a bunch of random...events about an incredibly stupid girl being incredibly stupid, and usually getting beaten up by her childhood ""friend"". So if the story basically non-existent, then why did I give it a 7? Simply put, this isn\'t an anime you watch for story; you watch for comedy. Aho Girl is pretty good at delivering its humor, and in a review for an anime that is purely comedy driven, which doesn\'t require a plot to function, I typically will sub Story out of Comedy, and that\'s why I gave it a 7. I found this show to be decently funny, it\'s not going to win any awards, but it certainly has decent comedy.Art: 7, The art is alright, nothing special, but it does manage to stay consistent with the quality of the art for the entirety of the series. Fortunately this isn\'t a genre overly dependent on the quality of its artwork, but I will say there are a few pretty nicely drawn scenes of the childhood ""friend"" uppercutting the idiot girl (sorry, I genuinely don\'t remember their names).Sound: 6, I skipped the OP every time, I don\'t really remember any of the other songs; they didn\'t stick out to me. I don\'t think idiot girl\'s VA did a bad job portraying her character, but she was annoying to listen to. The sound quality was fine, but I think some of the VAs could\'ve done a bit better with their roles.Character: 6, Hate to bring this up again, but as expected of a 4-koma adaptation, there is little-to-no character development. Any character development that tends to happen occurs in the scene the character is introduced in, and the rest of the time they remain flat characters, each having different jokes that reflect toward their character trait or two they might have. The characters might be very flat, but they are still decently enjoyable from a comedy stand point.Enjoyment: 8, I enjoyed this because it was exactly what I was in the mood for. If I had been in the mood for something that was even slightly serious or had an ounce of plot, I would not have enjoyed this even a fraction of the amount that I did. That might sound like a weird thing to say, but the point is, unless a ""turn your brain off and laugh"" show is what you\'re looking, you\'re probably not going to enjoy this.Overall: 7, Aho Girl is good at what it does and nothing else. Just like the idiotic girl Aho Girl is about, this show is also only good at being dumb, and that\'s it. While that might sound like an insult, Aho Girl is very good at being dumb, to the point that it\'s genuinely entertaining to watch.

I'm hoping there's more dumb funny hahaa anime like aho girl. joy emote clap "", ""This is the most energic anime I've watched so far !Yoshiko is really spontaneous, and even if she's stupid, she also have some good reflexions which is interresting.I feel a little pain for the seiyu because they shout a lot.It's really enjoyable, and character are attaching, even if it's mainly in a comedic show.One of the most funny scene for me was the one in Akuru's room at night, with Sakaya saving all situations....I've also really liked Fuuki, who bring a little fan-service character but also some funny scenes.The angry Yoshiko at episode 11 was great in animation and in rupture with how she is most of time of the anime.A great anime if you want to watch something funny and to give you energy for the day !

One of the funniest shows someone can find on anime. There are 12 episodes with 12 minutes each. There's not a linear plot, just random storylines mixed together.The Aho-Girl is Yoshiko who's obsessed with bananas and always try to find a way to have fun instead of study. She's stupid academically and frustrating to be around her with her constant energy to play, but she excells in pretty much any other way and she's just too hilarious to handle.The only negative is the male character named A-kun who's always a downer and everytime Yoshiko try to interact with him in...her own way, he just beats her out of his way. That part wasn't funny. They could have find a different way for him to deal with her than punch her all the time.Overall, if you want to relax and have some good laughs, watch it! The whole season is about 2 hours long so you finish it very easily. her own way, he just beats her out of his way. That part wasn't funny.

I guess i could see why some people might enjoy this show for the comedy. but to me it was just basic ""anime"" comedy. I just didnt really find her banana loving self funny in anyway.She as a character just really pissed me off. The mother of her was pathetic, she was depending on A-kun to carry her daughter in life.

The distillation of all things funny and nothing else. This show must have taken inspiration from Dumb and Dummer.  Yoshiko is a genius crafted character, as cute as they get but with an IQ of a banana. For that matter, I question the IQ of all the girls in this show. While most anime uses ecchi to target sex-starved, hormonal overloaded teens, Aho Girl uses it for comedic effect. Some of the fight scenes would give many shonen a run for their money. This show pays homage to a few anime classics, in the funniest way possible.All that...it asks, is that you switch off your brain. This is not thinking man's show.Can't wait for season 2!

Its crazy and stupid the entire time, and I loved it all. The art sytle is very clean and fun to watch with lots of references to other animes and culture such as JOJO. The characters are fairly simple with not a lot of depth but their interactions are funny and they do get somewhat of a backstory. The entire series is simply a chaotic journey that leaves you smiling the whole time. I reccommend this anime as a filler show, something to watch after the post anime show depression. Its an easy story with lots of fun...and laughs. Dont expect anything deep, just enjoy the wild ride. and laughs. Dont expect anything deep, just enjoy the wild ride.', ""There were a lot of funny moments from all these episodes. I just really wish that Yoshiko would fix her idiocy by herself. Even for someone her age it really is concerning. But that's what makes Yoshiko a character with a lot of energy and brings the comedy for every episode that I've watched.There are also some other characters that somehow manages to catch Yoshiko's delusions and have idiotic moments of their own. But honestly, I don't think I'd change it (ok maybe a little bit). But without these people, I don't think the show would have been as comedic as it was supposed to...be. be."", ""Aho-Girl, is, in short, extremely silly. From the comedy style, to the voice acting, to the wacky situations and outside references, it is trying its hardest to make you laugh from start to finish. Beginning with the story, it's a simple and highly episodic setup about a dense, fun-loving fool and her best friend, a short-tempered and studious guy who takes everything as serious as a car crash. Through their misadventures, often instigated by her immediate desire to play or eat bananas, they gather a small cast of supporting oddballs, like the disciplinary committee president, and a directionless hoodlum who dedicates his life to these...two friends. There's very little in terms of story here, which makes total sense, and things are largely taken on an episode-by-episode basis where some crazy new thing happens. It's often very funny, but after a while some of the gags get kind of old, which is really saying something as each episode is only 12 minutes. The art is pretty good, but nothing groundbreaking. I enjoyed the stylistic changes to match whatever they're referencing in the moment, but beyond that the character designs are clean and pleasing to the eye, ensuring that everybody is distinct and has their own visual style in this fast-paced anime. The sound is surprisingly good, with an unusually high-quality OST and impassioned voice acting, which caught me off-guard. The characters are this show's strongest point, being distilled into specific yet original archetypes that somehow succeed in feeling interesting and at least a little believable. My favorite characters are Fuki Iincho the disciplinary committee president, and Inu, Yoshiko's huge dog that she rides everywhere. They just felt the most consistently funny and brought the most to the show as complicating elements to the insane plots of Yoshiko and the overbearing discipline of Akuru. Overall, Aho-Girl is a quick, funny watch that doesn't really break any new ground. Be aware that there are some moments where the jokes don't really land, but that's not really too much of a price to pay for something that is otherwise perfectly fine. Give it a watch, especially if you enjoy kinetic, fast-paced comedy. two friends.

I\'m going through my entire watchlist and watching as much as I canTo start off , don\'t get this show twisted it isn\'t a romantic comedy , its a comedy with romance sprinkled in there. Overall its charm is what makes it a little above average for me. The absurd situations that are no where plausible are entertaining enough to get me hooked. The episodes don\'t run as long as other , being cut in half to 12 minutes an episode which...I think is long enough with each bit being around 3 minutes.Animation: 8/10Its not any mappa type of animation but theirs sprinkled in high budget battles scenes between some characters for bits and their pretty impressive for a comedy , kind of giving nichijou in the sense , its not anything mind blowing but its nice to watchMusic: 6/10the op is so catchy but their really isn\'t any music in this series which is fine cause it doesn\'t need it to be funny , but if the tack for the show is a deal breaker for you , then maybe not this onePlot 7/10having an interesting plot is good when it comes to humor cause it sets up most of the jokes and its done quite well in this. The whole punchline is the main character being unbelievably stupid to the point other characters become just as stupid and its nice to see a guy bating a girl (forgive me) instead of the regular tsundere beating her crush upDesign 6/10regular colors are used quite a lot instead of the usual bright ""oh there\'s the mc"" and to be frank honest they could\'ve made it more like Saiki K in the designs but thats just personal. Overall the designs aren\'t by any means bad their just a little lack lusterAll in all its a decent show to watch when your bored or just wanna put something on while eating. Its humor is its strong point though at some points kinda weird (personally , episode 3 was a little much to be a \'joke?\') but its a decent show that ill finish just like an average soup7/10 soup !

All but one episode features skit after skit where the ""joke"" is slut-shaming, victim-blaming, and assault. There was a single moment where I thought that the characters were finally going to be forced to address the crimes being committed,...but the ""punchline"" for that bit ended up being a ""just kidding~"" and it felt like a backhanded acknowledgment more than anything else.Due to this, the majority of the characters are difficult to like or find amusing. Sayaka is the most sane character in the main cast and Ryuuichi is the true queer cryptid of this hell pit, but there is so much mess to slog through to get to the decent moments. The biggest disappointment here is just how much potential there is for this comedy sketch setup to work really well with better content. Instead, it reaches for the lowest hanging fruit and hits it on the head repeatedly.After watching episode 2, I became convinced that this series is propaganda to get kids to study hard in school. The underlying message that, if you don\'t study well in school and get straight 100\'s on all of your exams, you\'re worthless and will never be able to succeed in society is pervasive throughout. It holds Yoshiko up in front of the audience as an example of how society will view them so that, even when Akuru\'s mom tries for half a second to tell him that it\'s healthier to go outside and play sometimes, the bit pushes back because the only alternative to studying is being like Yoshiko. This is made extremely clear in how Akuru\'s younger sister is treated as she struggles to study like the brother she constantly looks to for help.If there are any good reasons to watch this show, it\'s probably the voice acting and the rare funny bits scattered throughout.
